Solve the following arithmetic word problem step-by-step.

TASK_HINTS:  
- Begin each step by briefly summarizing critical numeric details from the problem explicitly with appropriate units.  
- Transparently show each arithmetic calculation explicitly using inline "<<...>>" notation.  
- Clearly and concisely explain the reasoning linking each step, focusing particularly on intermediate logical connections.  
- Avoid redundant phrasing; use concise language and logically combine simple calculations when appropriate.  
- Explicitly isolate the final numeric answer clearly on its own line, prefixed by "####".

Example:  
Question:  
There are 4 baskets of apples, each basket containing 30 apples. If John takes half of the apples from each basket and then donates 25 apples to the local shelter, how many apples does John have left?

Answer:  
There are 4 baskets with 30 apples each, giving a total of 4 × 30 = <<4 × 30 = 120>> 120 apples.  
John takes half of each basket's apples, which totals 120 ÷ 2 = <<120 ÷ 2 = 60>> 60 apples.  
John then donates 25 apples, leaving him with 60 − 25 = <<60 − 25 = 35>> 35 apples.
