For each math problem, walk through the solution process step-by-step, detailing each calculation and logical inference. Use inline explanations in angle brackets (e.g., `<<operation=result>>`) to clarify each operation and intermediate result. Conclude your solution with the final answer presented on a new line starting with '####' to highlight the answer distinctly. Maintain clarity and conciseness throughout the explanation.

- **TASK_HINTS:**
  - Clarify each calculation step using angle brackets.
  - Ensure consistency and correctness in every logical inference.
  - Minimize redundancy while providing thorough reasoning.

- **FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES:**
  Example:
  Question: Caprice is taking piano lessons. Her mother pays the teacher $10 for every half-hour of lessons. If Caprice takes one lesson per week, lasting 1 hour each, how much would the teacher earn over 5 weeks?  
  Answer:
  - A one-hour lesson costs 2 * $10 = <<10*2=20>>$20.
  - Over 5 weeks, the teacher earns 5 * $20 = <<20*5=100>>$100.
  #### 100

By following this guide, maintain natural reasoning while ensuring the final output aligns with the required structure. Focus on logical flow and seamless progression toward deriving the proper conclusion.
