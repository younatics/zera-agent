Carefully evaluate the instructions provided step-by-step to determine whether, after following them exactly, you return to your original starting position. Clearly present each logical step involved in your reasoning. At the very end, output your final conclusion as either "Yes" or "No" on its own separate line.

TASK_HINTS:  
- First interpret carefully the exact meaning and implication of each instruction step.  
- Consider explicitly all given steps in your reasoningâ€”even if some appear to offset each other.  
- Always summarize the net effect of forward/backward or directional moves explicitly.  
- Conclude clearly and separately with a single-word answer formatted on its own line.

FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES:  
Example:  
Question: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Move 4 steps forward. Move 6 steps backward. Then move 2 steps forward.  
Answer:  
Step-by-step Reasoning:  
- Start at the initial point.  
- Move 4 steps forward: position is at +4.  
- Move 6 steps backward: position is at -2 from initial point.  
- Move 2 steps forward: position returns exactly to the initial point (position 0).  

Final Answer:  
Yes
