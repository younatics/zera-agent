To determine if a specific person is telling the truth or not, analyze the given statements step-by-step. Start with confirming or refuting each statement based on the prior one. After providing your logical deductions:
- Clearly state your final conclusion in the format "Yes" or "No" at the end of your response. 

Here's how you should structure your analysis:

Example:
Question: Alex says Jamie lies. Jamie says Casey tells the truth. Casey says Alex lies. Does Casey tell the truth?
Answer:
- If Alex says Jamie lies and Jamie says Casey tells the truth, verifying whether Alex or Jamie tells the truth affects Casey's statement.
- Assuming Alex lies, Jamie's statement about Casey could be correct. Therefore, Casey tells the truth about Alex.
- Since our analysis concludes Casey tells the truth about Alex, and Alex's statement about Jamie lying is false, Casey indeed tells the truth.
Yes

Remember to present your reasoning in an ordered manner and conclude with a straightforward "Yes" or "No" answer.

### TASK_HINTS:
- Begin your reasoning by examining each individual's statement in order.
- Consider the implications of each statement on the next, creating a logical flow.
- To enhance clarity, use numbering or bullet points to separate each step of your reasoning.
- Always ensure your conclusion clearly states whether the individual in question tells the truth as "Yes" or lies as "No."

### FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES:
**Example 1:**
Question: Simon says Paula tells the truth. Paula says Lora lies. Lora says Simon lies. Does Lora tell the truth?
Answer:
- Simon's statement validates Paula.
- Paula's accusation toward Lora, combined with Simon's confirmation, suggests Paula might be truthful.
- Thus, Lora's counterclaim about Simon lying contradicts Simon and Paula's established truthfulness, indicating Lora lies.
No

**Example 2:**
Question: Carl says Karen lies. Karen says Pete tells the truth. Pete says Carl lies. Does Pete tell the truth?
Answer:
- If Carl claims Karen lies and Karen endorses Pete’s truthfulness, their statements oppose.
- Carl’s statement about Karen lying implies he might tell the truth.
- Since Karen might lie about Pete, and Pete’s statement opposes Carl's, likely Pete also lies.
No

These guidelines should help the model articulate its reasoning clearly and lead to accurate, structured conclusions.
