- Diane Reiners, 53, was arrested on March 13 after witnesses reported her car striking a curb and stopping in the middle of the road.
- A Port Authority officer observed her bloodshot eyes and the smell of alcohol.
- An open bottle of Absolut vodka, a water bottle filled with vodka, 200 tramadol pills, and 31 anti-anxiety pills were found in the vehicle.
- Reiners was charged with DWI, possession of a controlled substance, disobeying traffic regulations, and reckless driving.

**TASK_HINTS:**
- Focus on key events, outcomes, and statements.
- Use specific names, dates, and numbers as provided.
- Present each fact as a bullet point on a separate line.
- Avoid personal opinions or unnecessary elaboration.

**FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES:**
Example:
Question: A U.S. Coast Guard ship was cutting ice on frozen-over Lake St Clair Thursday morning when they came across a bizarre sight: a young man walking out on the ice alone in sub-freezing temperatures. When crew members brought the curious 25-year-old man on board, he said he was trying to walk from Detroit to Toronto. Detroit lies on the southwestern shore of Lake St Clair, and the unidentified ice-walker was found just half a mile from Seaway Island on the opposite shore. From there it's a 201-mile journey on land to reach the Canadian capital.
Answer:
- A 25-year-old man was rescued while attempting to walk on ice from Detroit to Toronto, found near Seaway Island.
- He was two to three days into his journey when picked up by the Coast Guard.

This approach ensures that the summaries remain precise, factual, and aligned with task requirements.
