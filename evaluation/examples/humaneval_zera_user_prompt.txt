Below is a Python function signature with its explicit task description provided in the docstring:

```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    '''
    Create a function that returns a tuple (a, b), where 'a' is
    the largest of negative integers, and 'b' is the smallest
    of positive integers in a list.
    If there are no negative or positive integers, return them as None.

    Explicit Examples:
    >>> largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7])
    (None, 1)
    >>> largest_smallest_integers([])
    (None, None)
    >>> largest_smallest_integers([0])
    (None, None)
    >>> largest_smallest_integers([-4, -2, -9, 0, 3, 7])
    (-2, 3)
    '''
```

Explicit Comparative Reasoning:

Two viable implementation strategies are:

1. **Iterative Approach (single traversal)**:
- Iterate through the list, tracking two variables: one for the largest negative integer (initialized to negative infinity) and one for the smallest positive integer (initialized to positive infinity). Update them whenever a better candidate is found.
- Readability: Excellent; logic is explicit and straightforward.
- Conciseness: Slightly verbose due to explicit value updates, but clear.
- Efficiency: Optimal time complexity of O(n), traverses the list exactly once.
- Pythonic Best Practices: Explicit, direct approach common in Python for clarity and readability.

Example snippet:
```python
max_neg = float('-inf')
min_pos = float('inf')
for num in lst:
    if num < 0 and num > max_neg:
        max_neg = num
    elif num > 0 and num < min_pos:
        min_pos = num
```

2. **Functional Approach (filter with built-ins)**:
- Use Python's built-in `filter()` function twice separately to obtain negatives and positives. Then apply `max()` and `min()` built-ins.
- Readability: Good, but slightly less intuitive due to split logic.
- Conciseness: Potentially more concise with fewer explicit steps.
- Efficiency: Traverses the list effectively twice (filtering negatives and then positives), slightly less efficient but remains O(n).
- Pythonic Best Practices: Demonstrates Python's built-in functions, which is idiomatic but marginally less intuitive here due to two-step filtering.

Example snippet:
```python
negatives = list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, lst))
positives = list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, lst))
max_neg = max(negatives) if negatives else None
min_pos = min(positives) if positives else None
```

Selected Optimal Implementation:

The iterative approach provides clearer readability, explicitly unified logic, optimal efficiency through single traversal, and more straightforward handling of edge cases (empty lists, no negatives/positives). Thus, it is the preferred solution here.

Final Implementation:
```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    max_neg = float('-inf')
    min_pos = float('inf')

    for num in lst:
        if num < 0 and num > max_neg:
            max_neg = num
        elif num > 0 and num < min_pos:
            min_pos = num

    return (max_neg if max_neg != float('-inf') else None,
            min_pos if min_pos != float('inf') else None)
```

TASK_HINTS:  
- Explicitly reason step-by-step through at least two valid implementation strategies and compare them systematically.
- Clearly separate comparative reasoning analysis explicitly from the structured, final Python implementation.
- Prioritize readability and Pythonic style unless explicit trade-offs justify otherwise.
- Ensure rigorous compliance with all explicitly stated edge cases and constraints (empty lists, absence of positive/negative integers).

FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES:  
Example:

Function and explicit constraint:
```python
def squared_numbers(n: int) -> list:
    '''
    Return a list containing squares of numbers from 0 up to n inclusive.
    >>> squared_numbers(3)
    [0, 1, 4, 9]
    >>> squared_numbers(0)
    [0]
    '''
```

Explicit Comparative Reasoning:

Two approaches exist explicitly:

- **List comprehension**:
```python
return [x ** 2 for x in range(n + 1)]
```
(Readability: Explicit, highly intuitive; Conciseness: Compact; Efficiency: Optimal single-pass O(n); Pythonic: Strongly emphasized idiom.)

- **Map plus lambda function**:
```python
return list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, range(n + 1)))
```
(Readability: Concise, but slightly less immediately intuitive; Conciseness: Equally concise; Efficiency: Still O(n), small overhead; Pythonic: Slightly less common because of readability considerations.)

Choosing the list comprehension method due to superior readability, intuitive clarity, and Pythonic emphasis:

Final Implementation:
```python
def squared_numbers(n: int) -> list:
    return [x ** 2 for x in range(n + 1)]
```
