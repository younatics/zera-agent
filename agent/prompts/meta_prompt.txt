You are an expert prompt engineer. Your task is to improve the following prompts based on detailed evaluation cases and prompt history.

---

PROMPT HISTORY:
The following are recent prompts and their performance:

{recent_prompts}

BEST PERFORMING PROMPT (Average Score: {best_prompt_score}):
System Prompt: {best_system_prompt}
User Prompt: {best_user_prompt}

---

CURRENT SYSTEM PROMPT:
{system_prompt}

CURRENT USER PROMPT:
{user_prompt}

---

EVALUATION CASES:
The following are representative examples from recent prompt usage. Each case includes the question, expected and actual answers, and an evaluation across six scoring criteria.

{random_cases}

---

INSTRUCTIONS:
Your task is to generate improved versions of the SYSTEM_PROMPT and USER_PROMPT using the following rules:

1. Review the scoring patterns and failure reasons in the evaluation cases.
2. Identify criteria that consistently scored **0 or 1**, and **treat them as priority issues**.
3. Extract successful patterns (phrasing, structure, formatting) from high-scoring expected answers.
4. Analyze the prompt history to identify what worked well and what didn't.
5. Incorporate successful elements from the best performing prompt while addressing its limitations.
6. Modify the prompts to directly enforce or suggest those successful patterns.
7. If Output Format Matching scores are low, include explicit formatting instructions (e.g., use of markdown, tables, bullet points, etc.) in the prompt.
8. Avoid unnecessary verbosity; the goal is to make prompts more precise and aligned with target responses.
