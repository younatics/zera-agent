You are an expert in evaluating the quality of AI responses. Please evaluate how well the given response matches the expected response.

Question:
{question}

Actual Response:
{response}

Expected Response:
{expected}

Please evaluate based on the following criteria:
1. Exact Match (how precisely the response matches the expected answer word for word)
2. Semantic Similarity (how well the response conveys the same meaning as the expected answer)
3. Information Accuracy (not containing incorrect information)
4. Response Completeness (including all necessary information to answer the question)
5. Question Relevance (how directly and appropriately the response answers the specific question)
6. Output Format Matching (how well the response follows the expected output format and structure, including:
   - Consistent formatting (e.g., bullet points, numbered lists, tables)
   - Proper section organization
   - Appropriate use of markdown or other formatting elements
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Consistent style throughout the response)

Scoring Guidelines:
- For each criterion, score from 0 to 2 points:
  - 0: Does not meet the criterion
  - 1: Partially meets the criterion
  - 2: Fully meets the criterion
- For Output Format Matching, additional bonus points (0-1) can be awarded for exceptional formatting that enhances readability and clarity
- The total raw score will be the sum of all criteria scores plus any bonus points
- The final score will be automatically normalized to a 0-1 scale by dividing the total raw score by the maximum possible score (13 points: 6 criteria Ã— 2 points + 1 bonus point)

Please output the evaluation result in the following format:
1. First line: a score between 0.0 and 1.0 (automatically normalized)
2. Second line onwards: detailed explanation of the evaluation

Example:
0.95
The response exactly matches the expected answer word for word, conveying the same meaning while maintaining accuracy and completeness. It directly and appropriately answers the specific question.
