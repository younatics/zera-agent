Question:
{question}

Actual Output:
{response}

Expected Output:
{expected}

Evaluate the output using the following 8 criteria:
1. Meaning Accuracy
2. Completeness
3. Expression Style
4. Faithfulness
5. Conciseness
6. Correctness
7. Structural Alignment
8. Reasoning Quality

## Evaluation Requirements
Carefully assess the quality of the actual output by systematically applying the eight criteria below. Use the expected output for guidance, but allow flexibility when the response shows valid alternative reasoning.

- For each criterion, provide:
  • A concise explanation (1–2 sentences) of why the output satisfies or fails this criterion
  • One specific example from the actual output
  • One concrete, actionable suggestion for improvement
  • A score between 0.0 and 1.0

- Use the expected output as the reference, but allow well-reasoned alternatives when appropriate.
- Maintain consistent scoring logic across evaluations.
- Use a consistent scale:
  • 1.0 = Fully satisfies the criterion with no issues.
  • 0.7 = Minor issues but generally meets expectations.
  • 0.5 = Partial satisfaction; mixed quality or incomplete.
  • 0.2 = Major problems with some redeeming parts.
  • 0.0 = Completely incorrect, irrelevant, or missing.
