Question:

Actual Output:
{response}

Expected Output:
{expected}

## Evaluation Requirements
Carefully assess the quality of the actual output using the eight criteria below. Use the expected output as a reference, but allow flexibility for well-reasoned alternatives that still fulfill the task requirements.

For each criterion, provide:
- A concise explanation (1â€“2 sentences) of how the output satisfies or falls short of the criterion
- One specific example from the actual output
- One concrete, actionable suggestion for improvement
- A score between 0.0 and 1.0
- A dynamic weight between 0.0 and 1.0 based on the importance of the criterion for the TASK_TYPE

Weighting Guidelines (based on TASK_TYPE):
- Classification: prioritize Correctness, Reasoning Quality
- Summarization: prioritize Faithfulness, Conciseness
- Code Generation: prioritize Correctness, Structural Alignment
- Math/Logic: prioritize Reasoning Quality, Correctness

Scoring Scale:
- 1.0 = Fully satisfies the criterion with no issues
- 0.7 = Minor issues but generally meets expectations
- 0.5 = Mixed quality or partially complete
- 0.2 = Major issues with some redeeming parts
- 0.0 = Completely incorrect, irrelevant, or missing

Maintain consistent logic and calibration across all evaluations.
