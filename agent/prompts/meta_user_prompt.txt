# PROMPT OPTIMIZATION TASK

## 1. TASK CONTEXT
Task Type: 
{task_type}

Task Description:
{task_description}

## 2. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
Review these cases carefully:
{random_cases}

- Check whether the prompts allow free-form reasoning without early formatting constraints.
- Check if formatting is enforced only at the final answer presentation.
- Identify if the prompts are unnecessarily verbose or over-constrained.
- Study the Expected Output cases to infer the necessary structural patterns.
- Extract generalizable rules for brevity, clarity, and minimal instruction sets.

## 3. PROMPT REVIEW
Recent Prompt History:
{recent_prompts}

Best Performing Prompt:
{formatted_best_prompt}

Current System Prompt:
{system_prompt}

Current User Prompt:
{user_prompt}

## 4. IMPROVEMENT TASK
- Your goal is to generate a new system prompt and user prompt that:
    - Encourage free, logical reasoning during the main solution phase
    - Consider and apply the required output structure only at the final improvement
    - Keep the prompt short, clear, and non-burdensome
    - Based on the task type and recent performance, determine whether the USER_PROMPT should emphasize free-form reasoning, output formatting, or a balance of both. If examples can help clarify output structure or improve model performance, insert them directly into the USER_PROMPT—not in the instructions. Let the model decide how many examples are appropriate based on the task characteristics and observed performance patterns. Avoid imposing rigid heuristics—adapt dynamically to the context.

- If evaluation scores stagnate, prioritize simplifying prompts and reinforcing the separation between reasoning and formatting.
- Instead of mimicking the expected output, extract its intent by applying our core evaluation criteria and use these insights to guide prompt improvement.

## 5. OUTPUT FORMAT
TASK_TYPE:
[Main task type] ([Sub-task type])

TASK_DESCRIPTION:
[Enhanced task description with clear output requirements]

SYSTEM_PROMPT:
[Optimized system prompt]

USER_PROMPT:
[Optimized user prompt that clearly guides the model’s behavior, with examples or format cues if appropriate. Style and structure should reflect the task’s reasoning depth, format sensitivity, and output clarity needs.]
