# TASK
Based on the information below, generate an improved SYSTEM_PROMPT and USER_PROMPT.

First, infer the type of task and the characteristics of effective responses.  
Then, use what you've learned to create new prompts that are aligned with the task and optimized for quality.

Your goal is not to copy the best prompt,  
but to learn what made it effective and generalize those strategies into a more robust and adaptable version.

# 1. BEST PROMPT
Score: {best_prompt_score}  
System: {best_system_prompt}  
User: {best_user_prompt}

# 2. CURRENT PROMPT (to improve)
System: {system_prompt}  
User: {user_prompt}

# 3. PROMPT HISTORY (recent attempts)
{recent_prompts}

# 4. EVALUATION SNAPSHOTS (sampled)
{random_cases}

# OUTPUT FORMAT
SYSTEM_PROMPT:
[your improved system prompt here]

USER_PROMPT:
[your improved user prompt here]
