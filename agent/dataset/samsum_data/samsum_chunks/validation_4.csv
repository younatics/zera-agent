Kyle: Do they pay him? :P
Roseanne: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way?
Megan: Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me.
Roseanne: The famous chocolate cookies?
Megan: Why not? I'm feeling generous today :D
