"Fran: so how's the new affair going?;)
Sally: hmm
Fran: what happened?
Sally: I'm not sure. I mean everything is fine but there's no chemistry. Maybe there's something wrong with me
Fran: There's nothing wrong with you. Don't let yourself think that. Maybe you just need more time
Sally: It's not like I wanna give up but sometimes I wonder if I should be forcing myself
Fran: Definitely not. But maybe try not to put so much pressure on it
Sally: I just don't understand it. And myself
Fran: You don't have to understand anything :)
Sally: I mean there was definitely a spark at the beginning and now I really don't know what happened and how to get it back
Fran: You probably started thinking too much ;)
Sally: Hahah probably. My head is my worst enemy
Fran: You just met, don't force it. Why would you want chemistry that just dies out after 3 months? Maybe deep down you're looking for something more serious or stable and that's why you actually don't wanna rush it? And you're older now. It's more difficult to fall madly in love when you are not so easily fooled anymore ;)
Sally: I get it. It's not even about falling in love. I just don't get what happened. I mean I can't be in a relationship with absolutely no chemistry at all
Fran: Well it went away so maybe it will come back :D You can't overthink those things. They don't like it ;)
Sally: I probably am overthinking. We had a heart to heart and I feel much better after the talk
Fran: You want soulmates, intellectual connection, and chemistry - that's some high expectations for a new relation. Not everything at once
Sally: Yeah I would but I know I can't have it all
Fran: Of course you can. But some things work better overtime. On the other hand, do NOT force yourself into anything. 
Sally: I'm not going to. I guess I've been lucky I found someone who is understanding and wants to discuss things
Fran: Exactly. And once you feel safer, chemistry might come back, because you won't be analyzing and thinking and worrying and pressuring yourself ;)
Sally: You're probably right.",Sally doesn't feel the chemistry in her new relationship anymore. Fran suggests that Sally is overthinking the situation and that Sally should give the relationship some time.,13730602
