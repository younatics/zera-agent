"Oliver: I think I should stop reading the rules after we already played a game
Oliver: found two things we were doing wrong today
Chris: maybe it shows that you should keep reading them
Chris: so what we were doing wrong?
Oliver: first the basic follow-up only gives you temp influence and not the permanent one (so my whole strategy for the day was basically based on a wrong rule :P)
Oliver: and second, you only get the income for the resources you own (tokens on top) and not for everything you have access to
Chris: the map had full symbol drawn for the action so I also thought it was permanent influence
Chris: had no idea about the second one
Emily: the second rule means money would be much more sparse
Oliver: well yes but it gives you a reason to build an already existing building again
Oliver: with the rules we played with there was no sense in doing that
Emily: true
Emily: yet another game we need to play again with the right rules ;)
Oliver: additionally during the vote phase, if there is a draw the first decision is taken by the player with the least amount of points and not the closest to the player initiating the vote
Chris: makes sense
Chris: but I'm not sure about the income phase, it's written that you get income for import
Olivier: well yes but technically the import action is building your own buildings
Oliver: so no matter how you look at it with import you'll always be on top with your token and get the income
Chris: right
Chris: well just like Emily said we need to play this again
Emily: we can always do it during the next meeting
Oliver: as usual I'm up for anything
Oliver: but if we'll play a new game, let me read the rules first :P",Oliver found out that they misunderstood the rules of the game. Emily and Chris think they should play the game again. ,13819864

"Amanda: oh no, my phone charger has stopped working

Amanda: dunno, it just won't charge
Keith: can't you ask your sister to lend you hers?
Amanda: but I have an iphone and she has a samsung
Keith: hmm, yeah, but the charger itself should be the same. so if you use your cable with her charger, you could see if it works?
Keith: then at least you'll know which part needs replacing
Amanda: oh, I could do that, yeah
Amanda: should I get the spare part from apple or...?
Keith: idk, I've never had an iphone. I hear not all cables are compatible for some reason but imo you should be able to find a cheaper replacement that should work... their prices are too high

Keith: I've found some shop that sells replacement cables
Keith: <file_other>
Keith: I'd try this one first, see if the phone detects the cable at all
Keith: cuz if it does, then problem solved, if it doesn't... then it might be the port

Amanda: thanks, I'll do that... I hope it'll work, not sure if I can afford a repair :/","Amanda's iPhone is no longer charging. She tried with her sister's charger, but it didn't help. It might be the cable or the charging port. She'll get a cheap replacement cable to check it.",13829160
