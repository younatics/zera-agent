"Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?
Turtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured.","['(L • H) ≡ I', '(L • H) ∨ I', 'L • (H ∨ I)', 'L • (H ⊃ R).', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'N/A']","A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let “L” denote “living long”, H “being happy”, and “I” “being injured”. Now, consider each choice:
(A) means (living long AND being happy) is equivalent to (being injured). 
(B) means (living long AND being happy) OR (being injured). 
(C) means (living long) AND (being happy OR being injured). 
(D) means (living long) AND (being happy implies being R), but what R denotes is not clear.
Obviously, (B) is the best symbolization of the original sentence. The answer is (B)."
"Select the best translation into predicate logic.George borrows Hector's lawnmower. (g: George; h: Hector; l: Hector's lawnmower; Bxyx: x borrows y from z).","['Bhgh', 'Bggh', 'Bhlh', 'Bghl', 'Bhlg', 'Blhg', 'Bllg', 'Blgh', 'Bhhg', 'Bglh']","A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. We are told that “Bxyx” means “x borrows y from z”. We can rewrite “George borrows Hector's lawnmower” as “George borrows a lawnmower from Hector”, which can then be translated into predicate logic as “Bglh”. The answer “Bglh” appears in (J); therefore, (J) must be the correct answer. The answer is (J)."
