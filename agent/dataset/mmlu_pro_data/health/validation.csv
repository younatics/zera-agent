"What is the embryological origin of the hyoid bone?","['The third and fourth pharyngeal arches', 'The fourth pharyngeal arch', 'The third pharyngeal arch', 'The second pharyngeal arch', 'The second, third and fourth pharyngeal arches', 'The first pharyngeal arch', 'The second and third pharyngeal arches', 'The first and third pharyngeal arches', 'The first, second and third pharyngeal arches', 'The first and second pharyngeal arches']","A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. The hyoid bone, which is also known as the hyooid, is a a small U-shaped bone located in the anterior neck. In its resting position, it lies between the ase of the mandible and the third cervical vertebrae. We know that the second and the third pharyngeal arches give rise to the horns of the hyoid bone; therefore, the embryological origin of the hyoid bone are the second and the third pharyngeal arches—this information is covered in option (G). Therefore, we conclude that (G) must be the correct answer. The answer is (G)."
