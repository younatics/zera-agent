"The symmetric group $S_n$ has $
\factorial{n}$ elements, hence it is not true that $S_{10}$ has 10 elements.
Find the characteristic of the ring 2Z.","['0', '30', '3', '10', '12', '50', '2', '100', '20', '5']","A: Let's think step by step. A characteristic of a ring is R is $n$ if the statement $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ implies that $k$ is a multiple of $n$. Assume that $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ for some $k$. In particular $2k = 0$. Hence $k=0$ and $n=0$. The answer is (A)."
"Let V be the set of all real polynomials p(x). Let transformations T, S be defined on V by T:p(x) -> xp(x) and S:p(x) -> p'(x) = d/dx p(x), and interpret (ST)(p(x)) as S(T(p(x))). Which of the following is true?","['ST + TS is the identity map of V onto itself.', 'TS = 0', 'ST = 1', 'ST - TS = 0', 'ST = T', 'ST = 0', 'ST = TS', 'ST - TS is the identity map of V onto itself.', 'TS = T', 'ST = S']","A: Let's think step by step. For a given polynomial $p$ we have
\[ST(p) = (xp(x))’ = p(x) + xp’(x)\]
and
\[TS(p) = xp’(x).\]
Hence \[ST(p) - TS(p) = p(x) + xp’(x) - xp’(x).\] The answer is (H)."
"Let A be the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \in A}?","['-5', '0', '-3', '-7', '-4', '-6', '-1', '-2', '-9', 'N/A']","A: Let's think step by step. We have 12n = 22 - 7m and one of the solutions is $m = -2$, $n = 3$. Then $m + n = 1$, hence we need to look for smaller $m$ in order to make $m + n$ negative. The next solution is $m = -14$ and $n = 10$. For smaller $m$ we have $m + n$ smaller than $-4$. The answer is (E)."
"A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?","['3 + e^-2', '2 - e^-4', '2 - e^-2', '3 + e^-4', '2 + e^-3', '2 - e^-3', '3 - e^-2', '2 + e^-2', '2 + e^-4', '2']","A: Let's think step by step. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, let $s(t)$ denote the number grams of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 3$.
We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution sprayed into the tank adds $(0.02) 4=2 / 25$ grams of salt per minute. There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $4(s / 100)=s / 25$ grams of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(2 / 25)-(s / 25)=(2-s) / 25$, and so $[s(t)=2] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,
$$
\frac{d}{d t}[\ln (s-2)]=\frac{s^{\prime}}{s-2}=\frac{-1}{25}=\frac{d}{d t}\left[-\frac{t}{25}ight] .
$$
Choose $C \in \mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}, \ln ((s(t)-2))=-[t / 25]+C$. Let $K:=e^{C}$. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $(s(t))-2=K e^{-t / 25}$, and so $s(t)=2+K e^{-t / 25}$. Then $3=s(0)=2+K e^{0}=2+K$, so $K=1$. Then $s(100)=2+K e^{-100 / 25}=2+1 \cdot e^{-4}=2+e^{-4}$. The answer is (I)."
"A total of 30 players will play basketball at a park. There will be exactly 5 players on each team. Which statement correctly explains how to find the number of teams needed?","['Multiply 5 by 5 to find 25 teams.', 'Divide 30 by 5 to find 6 teams.', 'Add 5 to 30 to find 35 teams.', 'Subtract 30 from 5 to find -25 teams.', 'Divide 5 by 30 to find 0.1667 teams.', 'Add 5 to 30 then divide by 2 to find 17.5 teams.', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'N/A']","A: Let's think step by step. We want to find the number of teams. We know that there are 5 players/team, and 30 players. Thus to get the number of teams we divide players by players/team, so 30 players / 5 players/team = 6 teams. The answer is (B)."
