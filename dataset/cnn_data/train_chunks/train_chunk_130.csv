"(CNN) -- Coca-Cola could be coming to Myanmar soon. The world's largest beverage company has announced plans to return to the country for the first time in 60 years. Coke has applied for a general license to begin conducting business there, the company stated in a press release. Myanmar, the once reclusive nation, is one of three countries in the world where Coca-Cola does not do business, according to the company. It does not have a presence in Cuba and North Korea. Myanmar's government is opening up to international investors as it undergoes a series of reforms. The United States, the European Union and others are easing sanctions, allowing their citizens and businesses to directly invest in Myanmar after the ruling junta returned to civilian rule and allowed free elections. A recent oil and gas conference was held in the city of Yangon to attract potential investors from around the world. Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy advocate who had been under house arrest for nearly two decades, recently won a seat in the country's legislature. This week, she traveled to Europe for the first time since her detainment to accept the Nobel Peace Prize she was awarded in 1991. Still, challenges lie ahead for Myanmar. The country's western state has been rocked recently by ethnic violence that prompted a state of emergency. Coca-Cola, which sells sodas, bottled water, sports drinks as well as juices, described its investments in Myanmar as ""significant"" over the next three to five years. Initially, the products would be shipped into neighboring countries while local business ties are established. The company's international strategy is to operate as a local business in every market, with selling, distributing and manufacturing taking place locally, Coca-Cola stated in a release. The company's charity arm also pledged a $3 million grant for women's economic programs in the country.","Coca-Cola announced plans to do business in Myanmar .

"(CNN) -- In a speech to a wounded nation, presidential hopeful Mitt Romney returned to his roots of faith in the face of a national tragedy. It was a rare public expression of faith for the candidate who has kept much of his faith private. Romney, who was the head of a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints congregation in Boston, quoted heavily from the Bible and the Book of Mormon as he stood before a small crowd in New Hampshire. Romney calls for unity following Colorado shooting . ""We can offer comfort to someone near us who is suffering or heavy laden,"" he said, a reference to the Gospel of Matthew where Jesus tells a crowd, ""Come to me all ye who are heavy laden and I will give you rest, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."" Romney continued, ""And we can mourn with those who mourn in Colorado."" That phrase ""mourn with those who mourn"" is found in the New Testament and is also found in the Book of Mormon. ""Our prayer is that the comforter might bring the peace to their souls that surpasses understanding,"" he said, evoking the Apostle Paul in his letter to the Philippians. Romney also left no doubt about his source material in his next line when he said, ""The Apostle Paul explained - ""Blessed be God who comforteth us in all our tribulations, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble."" He was quoting from 2 Corinthians 1:4 using the King James Version of the text, a translation favored by Mormons. Romney also said grieving families could know they were being lifted in prayer by ""people in every part of our great nation."" In Aurora, the agonized seek answers through faith . The Bible-laden references in Romney's speech also signal to evangelicals who worry about his Mormon faith that he is drawing from a familiar text. ""I think he's growing more comfortable and today's speech is further evidence of that, talking about his faith in the public arena,"" said Tony Perkins, the head of the Family Research Council. Perkins said that on Monday he had a wide-ranging face-to-face meeting with Romney in Baton Rogue. He said he told the candidate to be more open about his faith and the shared values he has with evangelical voters. ""I encouraged him to do it a little more,"" Perkins said. For Perkins, Romney was able to strike the right balance in his speech. ""I think it was more a reflection of who Mitt Romney is, rather than who he has been,"" Perkins said. There are still undoubtedly theological tensions between Mormons and evangelicals that won't be resolved in the presidential campaign. ""Most of the evangelicals think Mormons are going to hell and they aren't Christians,"" said Clyde Wilcox, a political science professor at Georgetown University who co-wrote ""Onward Christian Soldiers?: The Religious Right in American Politics."" ""What he's saying is there is a commonality of faith and shared values."" According to a Gallup Poll in June, bias against a Mormon presidential candidate hasn't budged in 45 years, with 18% of Americans saying they would not vote for a well-qualified candidate who was Mormon. Some evangelical students balked when Romney was chosen to give a commencement speech at Liberty University in Virginia in May. The school was founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell. CNN's Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the big stories . In response, Romney gave an address in which he addressed his faith head on. ""...People of different faiths, like yours and mine, sometimes wonder where we can meet in common purpose, when there are so many differences in creed and theology,"" Romney told those gathered for the commencement. ""Surely the answer is that we can meet in service, in shared moral convictions about our nation stemming from a common worldview,"" he continued. ""The best case for this is always the example of Christian men and women working and witnessing to carry God's love into every life."" Since then, Romney has kept a low profile in matters of faith. Earlier this month, Romney, dressed in a suit jacket despite the sunny morning warmth, clasped hands with his wife, Ann, as they entered the Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints with their two sons and grandchildren. In an impromptu moment after his remarks on Friday, Romney stood just outside the seating area for his event, shaking hands and sharing hugs with nearly all the supporters who stood in line to meet him. ""Moments like these call for our commander in chief to act as a theologian in chief, and Romney did that today,"" said Stephen Prothero, a religion professor at Boston University and the author of the American Bible. ""He offered a theology of comfort, compassionate conservatism if you will, consistent both with the biblical witness and with the needs of the country on tragic days like today,"" Prothero said. Prothero said both Romney's speech and Obama's speech struck him in the same line of civil religion speeches as Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address or Ronald Reagan's speech after the Challenger shuttle exploded. To Prothero, Obama's speech sounded more pastoral and Romney sounded more presidential. He said Romney was trying to ""bind the nation together"" and the Romney speech was more ""self evidently a theological speech."" ""The speech would be completely at home in a Mormon meeting and yet was carefully ecumenical,"" added Kristine Haglund, the editor of Dialogue, a quarterly journal on Mormon thought that is independent of the church. Haglund noted that ""mourn for those who mourn,"" which is found in the Book of Mormon in Mosiah 18:9, ""is in the top 10 passages for Mormons."" The speech also struck Haglund as more optimistic than President Obama's speech. ""Mormons are pretty relentlessly cheerful. [Romney] doesn't mention any Mormon ideas of the afterlife, but certainly those ideas make such optimism possible in the face of such tragedy."" ""The communities of family we build here are created in similar fashion in heaven. It's not unusual for Mormons to seem especially optimistic in the face of death or certain of the life to come. The views of afterlife are quite defined,"" she said. ""Mormons really do expect families and communities to continue in heaven."" Haglund also said she heard an olive branch to evangelicals in the phrase, ""lifting up in prayer."" ""That's very evangelical language that Mormons don't say. That was striking.""","Mitt Romney makes several references to the Bible and Book of Mormon .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's President Mohamed Morsi is looking at ways to return lawmakers to office after parliament was dissolved, his spokesman said Monday, putting the new leader on a likely collision course with the country's powerful military only days after he was sworn in. Morsi took office on Saturday as Egypt's first democratically elected president, taking the helm of a deeply divided nation that is economically strapped and lacks a working government. The Muslim Brotherhood-backed leader has ordered his office to look into legal options for bringing parliament back, his acting spokesman Yasser Ali said. He also ordered the creation of a committee to arrange for the release of political detainees who have no criminal convictions, the Brotherhood said on its website on Sunday. Restoring parliament would take power away from the country's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which ran the county for more than 16 months until Morsi was sworn in, and currently claims legislative authority. The nation's top court ruled in June that the laws governing parliamentary elections were invalid, and the following day, SCAF announced it was dissolving parliament. The legislature was dominated by Islamists, with Muslim Brotherhood-backed candidates having the single largest bloc of seats. Morsi's historic swearing-in took place amid tight security before the Supreme Constitutional Court and was overseen by the military rulers who have been in control of the country since a popular revolution ousted President Hosni Mubarak last year. ""Today, the Egyptian people established a new life for complete freedom, for a true democracy,"" Morsi said after taking the oath. Shortly after the swearing-in, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he gave his first speech as president. He praised the country's military, but indicated that their control of Egypt's legislative powers would return to civilian hands. ""The (Supreme Council of the Armed Forces) adhered to its pledge to not go beyond of the will of the people. And the elected institutions will come back to take their role, and the great Egyptian army will to go their job to protect the boundaries and security of the country,"" he said, delineating the army's role. SCAF has said it will retain lawmaking powers until a new parliament is sworn in near the end of the year. ""We have fulfilled our obligations and the pledge that we took before God and the people. We now have a president who was elected in free elections. Egypt is witnessing a new democratic process,"" the head of the SCAF, Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, said at a military ceremony for Morsi Saturday. Egyptians, all Arabs, and the world were witnessing ""how authority is transferred from the armed forces to the will of the people to the elected civilian authority,"" Morsi said. Morsi's theme in his recent appearances has been one of respect for democracy and the people. ""Today we start a new chapter in the history of Egypt. We turn an old page of an ugly era,"" he said. He added, """"I will not betray my country. With the will of God I will fulfill your ambitions."" Morsi became president by defeating Ahmed Shafik, a former air force general who served as Mubarak's last prime minister. Morsi was the candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, but he resigned from the party shortly after he was elected president.","Mohamed Morsi is looking at ways to restore parliament, his spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Basketball commentator and former hoops star Charles Barkley was arrested Wednesday in Scottsdale, Arizona, on suspicion of drunken driving, a police spokesman said. Charles Barkley was driving an Infiniti SUV through a trendy area of Scottsdale on Wednesday, police say. Barkley issued a brief statement, saying, ""I am disappointed that I put myself in that situation. The Scottsdale police were fantastic. I will not comment any further as it is a legal matter."" Lt. Eric Shuhandler of the Gilbert Police Department said an officer pulled Barkley over after he ran a stop sign in Scottsdale's Old Town area, a trendy spot known for its nightclubs and bars. Gilbert and Scottsdale are in the Phoenix metro area. ""The officer identified the driver of the 2005 Infiniti as Charles Barkley,"" according to a written statement from police. ""Mr. Barkley was administered the standard field sobriety tests after the odor of intoxicating liquor was detected.""  Watch: Barkley 'disappointed' by arrest » . At a news conference later in the day, Shuhandler said Barkley's ""performance on the field sobriety test revealed there was probable cause to make an arrest."" Barkley declined to take a breath test to measure his blood-alcohol level, Shuhandler said earlier. ""When he arrived at the station, police administered a blood test, which is customary of our police department to do,"" he said, adding that Barkley consented to the blood test. It will take ""a few days"" for the crime lab to test the blood sample and determine Barkley's blood-alcohol level, Shuhandler said. The former NBA power forward was cited for driving while impaired and released. ""It was a pretty routine arrest,"" Shuhandler said. Barkley's sport-utility vehicle was impounded under mandatory vehicle impound laws, police said. Shuhandler said Barkley behaved professionally during the booking and was ""very respectful and cordial with our officers.""  Watch Shuhandler describe the arrest » . Barkley, 45, is a commentator for TNT's coverage of the NBA. In October, he told CNN's Campbell Brown that he plans to run for governor of his home state of Alabama in 2014, saying, ""I can't screw up Alabama. We are number 48 in everything and Arkansas and Mississippi aren't going anywhere."" Although he is well known for entertaining comments and a cocky attitude, he also compiled an impressive résumé as a professional basketball player. A Hall of Famer and 11-time All-Star, Barkley is one of four players in history to rack up more than 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists in a career. He also earned the NBA's most valuable player designation in 1993 and brought home gold medals with the U.S. Olympic basketball team in 1992 and 1996. His commanding performance on the court earned him the nicknames ""Sir Charles"" and the ""Round Mound of Rebound."" Barkley was drafted out of Auburn University in 1984 by the Philadelphia 76ers and played 16 seasons with the Sixers, Phoenix Suns and Houston Rockets before he was permanently sidelined in 1999 with a ruptured tendon in his left knee. TNT is owned by Turner Broadcasting Corp., also the parent company of CNN. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","NEW: Barkley says he's disappointed in himself, police were ""fantastic""

"(CNN) -- A German court Wednesday reactivated a request to extradite controversial conservationist and ""Whale Wars"" star Paul Watson to Costa Rica after Watson's lawyer told the court he had skipped bail. German authorities detained Watson at Frankfurt airport on May 13 on an international arrest warrant issued by Costa Rica, which accuses him of endangering a fishing vessel off the coast of Guatemala in 2002. Watson's attempts to disrupt Japanese whalers at sea gained him fame through Animal Planet's ""Whale Wars"" TV show. Video: South Korea back on the whaling hunt? The Higher Regional Court in Frankfurt ordered him detained but freed him on a bail of 250,000 euros (about $302,000), according to a court news release, but required him to report regularly to authorities. He stopped doing so Sunday, the court said. Watson has ""shown by fleeing that the trust placed in him was not justified,"" the court said, explaining why the extradition orders were reinstated. The Frankfurt court had originally given Costa Rica 90 days to make its case before deciding whether to extradite him. Video: Debate over killer whales in captivity . Watson, leader of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, has defended his actions against the Costa Rican vessel, saying ""I had to take action with my crew a decade ago to protect hundreds of sharks, and of course, those shark poachers have very powerful allies in government and other places."" The U.S.-based Sea Shepherd has denied wrongdoing in the Costa Rica case and urged supporters through its website and social media to write to German officials, arguing that the charges have less to do with law than with Watson's anti-conservationist enemies and that it doubts he would get a fair trial. Opinion: Even after attacks, sharks should be protected . In the 2002 incident, Sea Shepherd ship operations officer Peter Hammarstedt said, the Ocean Warrior found the Costa Rican crew killing sharks for their fins in Guatemalan waters. It initially had permission from Guatemalan authorities to stop it and tow the vessel into port, he said. The Ocean Warrior used water cannons on the fishing vessel, but ""there were no injuries and no physical damage to any ship,"" Hammarstedt said. The Ocean Warrior did stop the ship, but Guatemalan authorities eventually asked Watson to release it, Hammarstedt said. The confrontation is detailed in part of a 2007 documentary, ""Sharkwater,"" Hammarstedt said. Shark finning is the practice of cutting the fins off sharks and throwing the sharks back into the sea, where they die. The fins are used for expensive soup, mostly in China.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps has acknowledged he engaged in ""regrettable"" behavior and ""demonstrated bad judgment,"" after a British newspaper published a photograph of the swimmer smoking from a bong. Sports attorney Ryan Smith thinks Michael Phelps should speak to public about his opposition to drug use. Ryan Smith, a sports attorney and BET talk show host, on Monday spoke to John Roberts on CNN's ""American Morning"" about how the incident could affect Phelps' career. John Roberts: What was your reaction to news of this picture of Michael Phelps surfacing? Ryan Smith: The thing with Michael Phelps is, he's not only been an outspoken athlete against drugs so he's done a lot of testing, he's been supportive of WADA, which is the World Anti-Doping Agency. But he's really a guy of high character. So you look at this, and my first thought was, ""What about his endorsement deals? What's going to happen in those?"" A lot of endorsement deals have clauses that say that you can't do bad actions like this, not only crimes, but just things that you do bad in public could result in the termination of your contract. So he could lose a lot of money on this. Roberts: Now he never really admitted to smoking marijuana. ... The United States Olympic Committee isn't going to sanction him, it looks like, but did call his actions disappointing. But to the greater issue that you were talking about, in terms of his endorsement deals, do you think anybody is going to say, well, this is the straw that broke the camel's back with this guy? He had one incident back in 2004. But are you going to dump Michael Phelps because of this picture? Smith: It could happen, and the reason why is because a lot of these companies that are sponsoring him really are focused on kids and how actions of their athletes affect children. So that can be a big problem. The other thing is, unlike an athlete that plays sports every year in the public spotlight, the Olympics for swimmers comes only every four years. So he doesn't have that chance to rehabilitate his image immediately like a lot of other athletes, a basketball player or a football player would. So companies might say, you know what, let's not work with Michael Phelps right now, because he doesn't really have a chance to redeem himself. A picture says a thousand words, and how can he fight that? Roberts: How could you turn this around? If you were his attorney, if you were advising him what would you do? Smith: The first thing I would suggest is a drug test. And I know that that's not required. And I also know that he's not really going to have a problem with swimming in 2012. But I would just show that hey, I'm clean, I'm doing great. The next thing I would do is go out there in the public and talk about the troubles with working with drugs and really show the public that you are not about drug use, you are not about doing bad things in public. You are only about supporting the rules of WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, and supporting their drug testing program. So you can show that, hey, this is a minor incident, not a big deal. And really what it's all about is remaining clean. Roberts: If you were to lay a bet, would you say anybody drops him? Smith: I would say he'll have some problems. I don't know if I would say that a big sponsor would drop him, but I would say that a more wholesome-oriented sponsor might.","Michael Phelps could lose a lot of sponsor money, attorney says .

"Washington (CNN) -- An Electoral College tie. It's the white whale of American elections: elusive, mythical and never realized.But could it finally happen this year? The likelihood that President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will each net 269 electoral votes in November, instead of the 270 needed to win, is actually not so farfetched -- and for close observers of the Electoral College system, a tie would set off a wave of constitutional and political mayhem that would make the 2000 Florida recount seem like a tidy affair. Check out the CNN electoral map and calculator . Election results in key states would immediately be subject to legal challenges. Electors, normally an anonymous batch of party insiders elected to ratify each state's winner with their electoral votes, would be lobbied to change their votes by friends, neighbors and political leaders. Ultimately, the House of Representatives could elect the next president, even if that candidate lost the popular vote. ""What it would reveal is that we have, in some sense, a profoundly undemocratic mechanism for dealing with a tie,"" said Alex Keyssar, a professor of history and social policy at Harvard University, and a critic of the Electoral College. ""I think there would be an enormous outcry over that."" A quick reading of the electoral map shows that the prospect is startlingly real. This year's list of battleground states is now familiar to anyone following the race. The campaigns and their allies are spending money in states where the polls are tight: Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Nevada, Colorado, New Hampshire and Iowa. By the numbers: Why Ohio matters . Democrats say North Carolina is in the mix. Republicans insist the same is true for Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, where Romney has family roots. Strategists inside both campaigns agree, for now, that the 2008 battlegrounds of Missouri and Indiana are all but certain to go red, while New Mexico is likely to stay blue. So using those parameters, here's one plausible scenario in which no candidate wins an Electoral College majority in November: . Romney tears up Obama's 2008 map and wins New Hampshire, Iowa, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Nevada. Obama, meanwhile, keeps Colorado, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the Democratic column. That combination of states adds up to 269 votes for each candidate -- and that's just one of several realistic scenarios yielding the same outcome. A handful of paths involve Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, two blue-leaning states that Democrats insist are off the table for Republicans (even though the Obama campaign has spent heavily in Pennsylvania on television ads attacking Romney). Also in the mix is Nebraska. The state awards its five electoral votes by congressional district, and the Omaha-anchored 2nd District sent a single vote to Obama in 2008. The Obama campaign has been organizing in the Omaha metro area for months, and the Republican National Committee is opening a field office there in the coming weeks. Both campaigns know that just a single electoral vote could play a decisive role in what's expected to be a historically close race, and that makes what happens in the event of an Electoral College tie all the more intriguing. Both political parties begin coordinated ad efforts with the campaigns . The rules governing the process -- outlined 208 years ago in the 12th Amendment -- seem straightforward. The House tallies up the electoral votes in a special session of the next Congress in January, and if no candidate reaches a majority, then each state's delegation in the House casts a vote for president. The last time a ""contigent election,"" as it's known, occurred was 1824. After the unresolved presidential election of 1824, when none of the four candidates achieved an Electoral College majority, the House met the following January to decide the outcome. After a good bit of politicking from all the candidates, the House awarded the presidency to John Quincy Adams, even though Andrew Jackson had won the most electoral votes. This is the model that will be used if Obama and Romney find their fates in the hands of Congress in January. According to a report on contingent elections by the Congressional Research Service, the procedures undertaken for that 1825 vote -- the House met in closed session without reporters, for instance, and voted anonymously by paper ballot -- would be ""precedential, but not binding"" for similar elections in the future. But a modern-day version of that pageant play is guaranteed to be messier and far more dramatic, election scholars say. If Romney and Obama both finish on November 6 with 269 electoral votes apiece, the true results will not be known until December 17. That's when the electors -- Democratic and Republican loyalists nominated by state party officials and placed on the ballot alongside the presidential candidates -- meet in their respective state capitals and the District of Columbia to formally cast their electoral votes. That has become a mostly irrelevant exercise in recent presidential elections. But in the event of a razor-thin finish, or a 269-vote tie, every elector will suddenly wield great power. A handful of states have ""faithless elector"" laws on the books designed to punish electors who switch their votes, and some two dozen states require electors to pledge to vote for the state's winner. ""If there appears to be a tie, then faithless electors become a big problem, and we could have a real mess on our hands,"" said Robert W. Bennett, a constitutional law professor at Northwestern University who has written extensively about the Electoral College. Many recent electors have mulled switching their votes and little can be done to stop them, said Robert Alexander, an Electoral College expert at Ohio Northern University. What are the most important issues to you? In the course of writing a book on presidential electors, Alexander interviewed more than half of the electors who participated in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 elections. Of the 2004 group, 10% said they considered voting for someone other than to whom they were pledged. In 2008, 11% said the same. Many told Alexander they were lobbied or pressured by someone to change their allegiance -- sometimes in person, sometimes by anonymous e-mails and phone calls -- in the period between Election Day and mid-December, when the Electoral College votes. ""If it's really close, you would expect to see massive lobbying campaigns,"" Alexander said. ""Most do follow the herd, but not all, and that becomes the question in a close election. What happens at the margins?"" Despite being party loyalists, he said, electors are regular people with their own biases and political inclinations. In rare cases, they make them known. In 2000, Washington D.C. elector Barbara Lett-Simmons abstained from casting her electoral vote as a protest against the District's lack of voting representation in Congress. In 2004, an anonymous Minnesota elector voted for John Edwards instead of John Kerry. Throughout this past spring and summer, Ron Paul's devoted supporters worked furiously to elect their own as electors at state party conventions. ""They are trying to be the revolution to the Electoral College,"" Alexander said. If the electors behave in December and affirm an Election Night split decision, the action would move on to the House of Representatives. A joint session of the newly elected Congress would be convened to open and count electoral votes. A House leadership aide told CNN this would happen on Monday, January 7. If no candidate reaches a majority of 270 votes, a contingent election immediately ensues. In the House, each state's delegation casts a single vote for president. This scenario all but guarantees a victory for Romney. Republicans hold a majority in 33 state delegations to 16 delegations for the Democrats. Barring a miraculous Democratic wave up and down the ballot this November, the axis of power is unlikely to shift enough to hand Obama's party control of a majority of state delegations. And there's another hiccup: The vice president is elected separately by the U.S. Senate, which may still be controlled by Democrats next year. Each senator has a single vote, and the next vice president would be chosen by a simple majority vote. A Romney-Biden administration? No one's betting on it. But it could happen. If you're voting this election season, we want to hear why. Share your thoughts on the presidential race.","The likelihood that Obama and Romney each net 269 electoral votes is not so far-fetched .

"(CNN) -- On the day that LeBron James announced that he would accept an employment offer from the Miami Heat, I had a conversation with a person you would not automatically associate with basketball expertise. But it wasn't basketball I wanted to ask him about. It was the fleeting nature of celebrity -- even of the most incandescent celebrity. James is enjoying that kind of fame right now. It seems that you can't walk down a city street without hearing someone mention his name. But a person's moment in the sun comes and goes. The passions, both good and bad, that a star inspires can cool off in a relatively short span. Which is an instructive thing to keep in mind at times like these. The person with whom I spoke was Steve Auerbach, co-owner of the famous Stage Deli on Seventh Avenue in New York. For generations, the Stage has been a part of New York City life. The triple-decker sandwiches at the Stage have traditionally been named for famous men and women. The idea is to appeal to customers whose eyes will be drawn to an item on the menu because of the celebrity associated with it. So I asked Auerbach about the No. 8 -- the sandwich called the Katie Couric. It features turkey, ham and swiss cheese. It wasn't always known as the Katie Couric, Auerbach said. Its name was changed in recent years from what it was formerly called. Diners, it seemed, were no longer quite as attracted to the old name of the No. 8: . The Marilyn Monroe. Same with the No. 18 (turkey, chopped liver, lettuce, tomato, onion). It's a hit, in large part because of the bigger-than-life New York figure for whom it is named: Alex Rodriguez. The A-Rod sandwich appeals to a new generation of customers who might not feel as strong a connection with what the same triple-decker was called until not so long ago: . The Joe DiMaggio. ""The clientele changes,"" Auerbach told me. ""It happens. Younger customers come along who might not be as familiar with the old famous names."" Milton Berle, 60 years ago, was as famous as a person could be in the United States. He was the first major television star -- magazines and newspapers referred to him as Mr. Television. His Tuesday evening broadcasts were so popular that in some cities, restaurants and movie theaters closed their doors on that night because they couldn't compete with him. The world and all of its rewards were his, and so was the No. 12 at the Stage Deli: roast beef, chopped liver, onion. No one's eyes could scan the big menu without stopping at the Milton Berle. But that was long ago. The No. 12 has a different name now, one with more cachet: . The James Gandolfini. ""The Sopranos"" took care of that. ""The celebrity thing is hard to keep up with,"" Auerbach said. ""It used to be that fame lasted for 30 or 40 years. Now, it seems to pop up and then it's gone. Someone like Britney Spears comes along, and everyone is talking about her, and next thing you know you don't hear her name and everyone's talking about someone else."" For all the hyperbolic verbiage during that LeBron James television special (""You're now looking live at the king""), for all the incomprehensible financial figures being thrown around about other NBA players who recently have agreed to terms (one, it was said, signed a six-year deal for $123 million, another signed a four-year deal for $80 million), perhaps a small dose of perspective is needed. The sports analysts often ask if events like the frantic courtship of James are a distraction for the various teams involved. But of course, that's what professional sports are: a distraction. That's what the public is buying: a few hours of distraction from the matters in this world that are genuinely troubling, the ones that can't always be solved with certainty when the final buzzer sounds. The welcome distraction that all of this provides is at the core of its inherent value. Is it any wonder that the players in the middle of it sometimes can become a little disoriented? During the Chicago Blackhawks' recent National Hockey League playoff run to the Stanley Cup, many fans in the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, wore the replica jersey of the team's captain, Jonathan Toews, who turned 22 years old this spring. One of the people in the arena wearing a Toews jersey was a 47-year-old fan: Michael Jordan. What must it be like for Toews, knowing that Jordan is not only watching him play, but also wearing his jersey? It all moves along so quickly; on the day in 1988 that Toews was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the papers carried stories saying that Jordan had scored 50 points in a playoff victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on this same stretch of West Madison Street where he now sat cheering for Toews. No one could be more famous than LeBron James, this week. Even the president of the United States was talking about him. At the Stage Deli in Manhattan, Auerbach had a decision to make. ""People want to see recognizable names,"" he said. ""Names that are popular."" For years, the No. 24 (twin rolls of pastrami and corned beef) was known as the Raquel Welch. Then, as the sands of renown shifted, it was changed to the Dolly Parton. Auerbach believes that it's time for the No. 24 to evolve again. He is considering various candidates. No offense to Dolly. ""Nothing lasts forever,"" he said. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","LeBron James is an incandescent celebrity, with tens of millions paying attention .

"London (CNN) -- Hundreds of millions around the world have been dazzled by the sights and sounds of director Danny Boyle's opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympic Games. The four-hour, Â£27 million ($42.4 million) spectacle contained references to such globally-recognized British icons such as James Bond, David Bowie and Harry Potter's Lord Voldemort. But with the production tossing out historical and cultural references at a rapid rate, even the most ardent Anglophiles in the audience may have felt some allusions whiz over their head like an airborne nanny. The Oscar-winning director of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" says the ceremony, titled ""Isles of Wonder,"" was inspired by a passage in Shakespeare's The Tempest, believed to have been written in 1610 and set on a remote, magical island. Although that phrase itself appears nowhere in the play, the character Caliban refers to his home as an isle ""full of noises, sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not."" The line encapsulates the vision fellow film director Stephen Daldry, the ceremony's creative director, says the production sought to represent, in capturing ""the rich heritage, diversity, energy, inventiveness, wit and creativity that truly defines the British Isles."" The ceremony opened with a scene inspired by the work of another English literary genius, the Romantic visionary poet and painter William Blake: Specifically, the preface to his epic ""Milton a Poem"" -- ""And did those feet in ancient time,"" better known as ""Jerusalem."" Written in 1804, the poem was set to music in 1916 by Sir Hubert Parry, and sung to bolster flagging spirits during the war years. With its lyric describing the establishment of a new Jerusalem in England, it has become England's most recognized patriotic song, sung as a religious hymn and a de facto national anthem at many sporting events. No less than three phrases from its 16 lines -- ""green & pleasant land,"" ""dark satanic mills"" and a ""chariot of fire"" -- have entered the national lexicon, and were referenced within the ceremony. The first provided the theme for the opening scene, which presented a vision of England as a pre-industrial rural idyll -- the type of bucolic setting in which J. R. R. Tolkien's Hobbits made their home. Animals gambolled, workers tended the fields while a game of cricket took place on a village green, complete with a maypole -- a traditional focal point for community celebrations in British village life. In one area of the stadium was a mound resembling Glastonbury Tor, an historically significant hill in Somerset identified with King Arthur. The hill carries a link to the Jerusalem theme, as Blake's poem is inspired by the ""Glastonbury Legend"" -- an apocryphal story that one of Jesus' relatives, Joseph of Arimathea, had visited Glastonbury and taken Jesus there as a boy. Glastonbury also has a more contemporary significance as the home of the UK's most famous music festival. Enter the ""dark satanic mills"" of the industrial revolution, which began in the UK in the middle of the 18th century and swept throughout the rest of the world, transforming society and laying the foundations of the modern world in its wake. Featured in the ceremony were representations of looms for manufacturing textiles and iron-making processes which played a key role in the revolution. The next, dreamlike sequence celebrated one of Britain's most beloved institutions, the National Health Service, while playing on its link to another celebrated icon. Founded in 1948, the NHS provides free healthcare, and has become the fifth largest employer in the world, with 1.7 million staff. Many Britons are fiercely proud of the service and have fought to defend it from successive waves of reforms. The NHS was represented here by several wards' worth of nurses pushing hospital beds, which were used as trampolines by children before being arranged to spell out the word: ""Gosh."" Coming in close proximity to a recitation from J.M. Barrie's children's classic Peter Pan -- ""When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real"" -- this was a clear reference to Great Ormond Street Hospital, a London children's hospital closely associated with that book. In 1929, Barrie gifted all the rights from the work to the hospital, claiming that Peter Pan himself had been a patient there, and that ""it was he who put me up to the little thing I did for the hospital."" Peter Pan was not the only children's literary character to feature in the segment, as a shower of Mary Poppinses -- the magical English nanny who was the heroine of P. L. Travers' book series -- blew in from above, to do battle with a towering character who resembled Lord Voldemort, the main villain of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter books (Rowling herself also appeared in the ceremony). The heroes didn't all hail from the world of books. At one point a Mini appeared -- the classic two-door economy car first manufactured by the British Motor Corporation in 1959. The next narrative segment was more modern and raucous, featuring a house party crashed by a horde of social networking teens. The attention also shifted to Britain's rich lineage of musical stars: Queen, David Bowie, the Sex Pistols, New Order and the Eurythmics, among many others. The ceremony also made great play of the two great, inescapable constants of British life -- the weather, and the dry national humor. At one point in the proceedings, as a ""storm cloud"" broke and threatened to jeopardize the celebrations on stage, an audio clip familiar to many Britons was played. It contained the immortal words of veteran television weatherman Michael Fish, best remembered for allegedly saying, hours before a killer 1987 storm: ""Apparently a lady rang the BBC and said she heard that there was a hurricane on the way. Well, don't worry, if you're watching, there isn't."" In recent years, Fish has been at pains to point out that the British public has misremembered his role in the affair, saying he wasn't working that day and that his infamous quote was actually made in relation to another storm. On any other day, he might resent the matter being revisited. But tonight he will surely manage a laugh at the unlikely way the bane of his career has placed him at center stage, in celebrated company, at Britain's biggest party.","Danny Boyle's Olympic opening teemed with historic, literary and pop culture references .

"(CNN) -- North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Un married 23-year-old Ri Sol Ju in 2009, according to a South Korean lawmaker on Thursday. The curiosity over Kim's wife started several weeks ago when North Korean state television and news agencies showed video footages and pictures of an unidentified woman attending official events by Kim's side. The name of the mystery woman was only announced Wednesday as Ri Sol Ju by North Korean state television. Details about her remained unknown until Jung Chung-Rai, a South Korean lawmaker from Democratic United Party, attended a closed-door intelligence session by National Intelligence Service (NIS), which is equivalent to the CIA in the U.S. ""Ri attended Geumsung's Second Middle School before going to China to study singing,"" Jung said. ""She previously visited South Korea as a member of North Korea's cheering squad for Asian Athletics Championships in 2005,"" he said. North Korea's cult of personality surrounds Kim . Whether the couple has a three-year-old child as some Korean media reported earlier has not been confirmed by the intelligence service, Jung added. There had been two prevailing theories circulating about the woman, who made her first appearance accompanying Kim Jong Un in his father's funeral in 2011. Some identified her as Hyon Song-wol, a popular singer who is a member in a musical group that sang ""horse-like lady"". South Korean media previously speculated that Hyon previously dated Kim and eventually married a military officer. It was rumored that Kim later forced the couple to split in order to restart his relationship with Hyon, and they now have a three-year-old son together. Others identified the woman as Ri So Ju, a singer in the Unhasu Orchestra, a group said to be favored by Kim Jong Un, and has made several overseas performances. It was speculated that Ri hails from an elite family, with her father working as a professor and her mother as an obstetrician. Nevertheless, not much is known about Kim's wife, in the reclusive country known for its impenetrability from the outside world. What Kim's 'mystery woman' says about North Korea . The announcement is part of a trend of greater openness under the recent leadership of Kim, according to Choi Jong Kun, associate professor at Yonsei University in South Korea. Kim became the third generation of his family to head North Korea, following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in December. He is the youngest son of Kim Jong Il and thought to be in his late twenties. His father had ruled North Korea for 17 years after inheriting power from the country's founding father, Kim Il Sung. The wives and mistresses of the leaders were often shrouded in mystery. ""Since he got his power, this guy has been pretty different than his father in terms of handling the media,"" said Choi. ""To me, revealing his wife's identity is no surprise,"" he added, given the country's recent track record of making information available about major state events. Choi cited North Korea's reporting of its rocket launch failure in April as an example. The term ""failure"" was used in the official press release, which Choi said was the first time North Korea admitted failure. He added that the announcement came four hours after the launch attempt, which Choi considered ""real-time"" for North Korea. Choi also pointed out the military reshuffling earlier this month was reported overnight. Not only does this demonstrate greater openness, but also that Kim has a ""strong power base"" and does not need to bury such news, he said. He attributed the more open approach to Kim's education in Switzerland. ""I expect that next week Kim will announce a son,"" Choi joked.

"(CNN)  -- Opposition candidate John Evans Atta Mills has narrowly won Ghana's presidential election, the Ghana Electoral Commission said on its Web site. John Atta Mills, left, of the opposition NDC has defeated Nana Akufo-Addo, right, of the ruling NPP in the runoff. The chairman of the Ghana Electoral Commission, Kwadwo Afari-Gyan, said Mills had garnered about 4,521,032 votes, or about 50.2 percent of the total votes cast. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, of the incumbent New Patriotic Party, won about 49.77 percent of the total valid votes cast, Afari-Gyan said, according to the commission's Web site. The two men led a field of eight candidates in the December 7 general election, but neither secured a majority of the votes. Akufo-Addo had held a slight lead in that vote. The runoff election was so close that it could not be decided until the last of the 230 constituencies, the Tain constituency, voted on Friday. ""On the basis of the official results given, the results of the run-off election in the Tain constituency in the Brong Ahafo Region, which was held on the 2nd January 2009, it is my duty to declare Professor John Evans Atta Mills the President-elect of Ghana,"" Afari-Gyan said, according to the government's Web site. Both parties had alleged irregularities in voting in the Ashanti region and Volta regions, but Afari-Gyan said the commission did not find evidence in ""purely electoral matters"" that invalidated the results. Mills, 64, will replace John Agyekum Kufuor as Ghana's president on January 7. Kufuor is stepping down after serving two four-year terms, the maximum allowed. Mills is a law professor who served as vice president from 1997 to 2000 under Jerry Rawlings. He lost to Kufuor in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. Ghana, a country about the size of England, is the world's second-biggest cocoa and gold producer. In 2007, leaders announced the discovery of oil off its shore. The world recession, however, has hindered growth. Ghana has seen a decline in its exports and will not tap into its oil resources until 2010. Part of a former British colony, Ghana was among the first African countries to gain independence in 1957. It endured a series of coups before military dictator Rawlings took power in 1981. A decade later, Rawlings led the country through the transition to a stable democracy with multi-party elections.","NEW: Opposition candidate John Evans Atta Mills wins presidential election .

"(CNN) -- Maria de Villota's family have expressed their thanks for the public support they have received after the Marussia driver lost her right eye following a Formula One crash. The Spaniard, one of only two female drivers contracted to an F1 team, sustained serious head and face injuries when her car collided with a stationary truck during a test event on Tuesday. De Villota underwent surgery at a British hospital following the incident, but it was too late to save the 32-year-old's eye. ""Last dinosaur"" or F1's brainiest man? ""We, the family, are supporting each other here at Maria's side and we take great comfort from the remarkable medical care she has been receiving,"" her sister Isabel said in a statement released by the Russian-owned team. ""We remain positive and this is due, in no small part, to the overwhelming expression of love and support for Maria from every corner of the world. ""We would also wish to thank everyone at the Marussia F1 Team for all the care and attention they have shown us over the past few days."" Tuesday was the first time De Villota had been behind the wheel of Marussia's MR01 car, although she did conduct a test for the Renault team last year. ""Maria remains in a critical but stable condition,"" added De Villota's sister. ""While there is no further news than that at present, we have at least been able to take encouragement from the fact that Maria has remained stable throughout since the accident, particularly during the first night following such a lengthy surgical procedure as she experienced."" The De Villota family has a rich motorsport heritage. Maria's father Emilio was a Formula One driver between 1976 and 1982. The only other female driver currently involved in the elite division of motorsport is Susie Wolff, who is a development driver with Williams.","Maria de Villota remains in a critical but stable condition in a British hospital .

"(CNN) -- Motorsport's governing body has ended uncertainty over the Bahrain Grand Prix by issuing a statement confirming that the Formula One race will go ahead next weekend. The Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) on Friday acted to end weeks of speculation amid continuing protests and civil unrest in the Gulf kingdom. ""Based on the current information the FIA has at this stage, it is satisfied that all the proper security measures are in place for the running of a Formula One World Championship event in Bahrain,"" the FIA said following a meeting between F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone and the 12 competing teams in Shanghai. ""Away from the public eye, the FIA has received regular security briefings from the most senior diplomatic officials based in the Kingdom as well as from other independent experts,"" the statement continued. F1 chief Ecclestone: Sport and politics should not mix . ""The FIA must make rational decisions based on the information provided to us by the Bahraini authorities and by the Commercial Rights Holder. In addition we have endeavored to assess the ongoing situation in Bahrain."" Ecclestone said he welcomed the statement after all the recent speculation. ""I understand that the problems in Bahrain are nothing to do with Formula One. Quite the opposite, we have a lot of support,"" the 81-year-old told CNN. ""There are other issues, I believe, in Bahrain, but nothing to do with us. We don't go into the country and interfere with the politics of the country anywhere, wherever we go."" Schumacher - Bahrain is safe . FIA president Jean Todt visited the island on a ""fact-finding mission"" last November, the statement says, consulting ""a large number of decision-makers and opinion formers"" including the Crown Prince, King Hamad bin Issa al-Khalifa and ambassadors of European Union countries. ""All expressed their wish for the grand prix to go ahead in 2012, and since then, the FIA has kept in close touch with all these stakeholders,"" the FIA said. The race, which was canceled twice last year because of concerns about safety, is due to run on April 22. The owner of the host track, Bahrain International Circuit, said that the race should be trouble-free. ""The BIC has been clear throughout recent weeks and months that the security situation in Bahrain is suitable for the staging of a major sporting event,"" it said in a statement. Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner said he respected the FIA's decision. ""The confusing thing has been the uncertainty. So I think for everybody here in the paddock now it's clear that there will be a race in Bahrain next week,"" Horner told reporters in China ahead of the third race of the 2012 F1 season on Sunday. ""The FIA have obviously done their research and come out with a clear statement that as a team entered into the championship we respect."" Red Bull driver Mark Webber, who publicly opposed last year's race in Bahrain said Thursday that he wanted to race, but it was a difficult decision. ""I have tried to watch the news to get the most balanced view that I can possibly get without getting too corrupted by false information,"" Webber told reporters. ""It has been a little quieter, but this is Mark Webber sitting here -- I have as much information as anyone else. ""If we had a choice would we go? I want to race. That is what I would like to go there and do. ""But saying that you cannot ignore the fact that all of us, in the backs of our minds, want it to go down smoothly and don't want it to be involved in the unrest."" But seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, now in his second season at the Mercedes GP team, said he would feel safe racing in Bahrain and trusted the FIA's decision-making. Former world champion Damon Hill, who had previously expressed concerns about the staging of the race this year, says he was ""100% behind"" the FIA's decision. ""All the arguments have been made for and against. Human rights organizations have had their cases heard. No one is under any illusions about the situation. But the less vocal majority of Bahrainis also have a right to get on with their lives and we also have a responsibility to our F1 fans in the region,"" Hill, the 1996 champion, said in a statement. ""I hope that F1 can be seen as a symbol of all that is possible if we can work together peacefully,"" Hill added.","World motorsport's governing body say Bahrain Grand Prix will go ahead on April 22 .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov -- the owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team and one of the world's richest men -- said Monday that he will run for president of Russia next year. Calling his decision to run for president ""probably the most important decision of my life,"" he acknowledged the risks of challenging Russia's rulers. ""There is saying in Russia: Never say never, anyone can end up behind bars. But I am not afraid,"" he said in a press conference in Moscow. Prokhorov, 45, is worth $18 billion, Forbes estimated in March, making him Russia's third richest man. Profile: Who is Mikhail Prokhorov? His announcement set off a frenzy of speculation about whether he was running with the Kremlin's tacit backing, to give the impression there was a genuine contest for president, or whether he really seeks to defeat Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who also says he will run. He told reporters he had not discussed his decision with Putin or President Dmitry Medvedev, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. Prokhorov, who has dabbled in opposition politics before, wrote just last week that Putin was the only person who could run the country. ""You may like it or not but Putin is the only person who can somehow manage this ineffective state machine,"" he wrote on his LiveJournal blog. A Prokhorov representative declined a CNN interview request on the businessman's behalf, saying Monday he wanted to focus on communicating with Russians via Russian media. Prokhorov's Onexim Group has interests in metal, financial services, media, real estate, utilities and high-tech businesses, according to the Nets. He weathered the 2008 global financial meltdown particularly well, and told CNN the following year it was partly due to luck. But, he also said, ""I like business. It's my profession. I spend, like, 15 hours a day in the office. It's the great joy in my life. And I never think about money."" He laughed when CNN's Matthew Chance asked him what he thought of his reputation as a playboy. ""I don't care. I try to act natural,"" he said, adding he had ""no time"" to think about having a family. Forbes magazine described him as a ""six-foot-eight bachelor and martial arts buff"" in March, when it listed him as the 32nd richest man in the world. Separately, Putin backers demonstrated in support of his government Monday, after enormous crowds protested against the government over the weekend. Tens of thousands turned out Saturday to protest against election results that returned Putin's United Russia party to power. Police estimated crowds in Moscow at 25,000, while organizers said it would be 40,000, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. Either figure would make the protests the largest in the Russian capital for decades. Claiming the results of parliamentary elections were rigged, protesters chanted ""Putin out,"" according to RIA Novosti. Protesters also braved freezing temperatures in other Russian cities to demonstrate against what they said was vote fraud. A day after the protests, Medvedev called for a probe into the allegations. ""I agree neither with the slogans nor the statements voiced at the protests,"" the statement on Medvedev's Facebook page said. ""Nevertheless, I have ordered checks into all the reports from polling stations, regarding the compliance with the election laws."" Critics piled ridicule on the Facebook post. ""It's awful,"" Elena Panina wrote. ""Really. He was drunk when he wrote that or he didn't read what he wrote. ... What slogans does our president disagree with? 'We are for fair elections?'"" Vladimir Kaganovich said the statement showed Medvedev is in the wrong job. ""The president of the country isn't an individual person and doesn't have a right to show his disagreement with dozens of thousands of citizens,"" Kaganovich wrote. And he asked what it meant to launch a probe with no investigators and no time limit on the investigation. ""Please forgive me but it I wouldn't trust you even to manage a group in my department,"" Kaganovich wrote. And, addressing the president in the formal Russian manner, Sergey Pavlyuchenko simply wrote: ""Dear Dmitry Anatolievich! Are you ever ashamed?"" Putin's United Russia party suffered big losses in the election but retained its parliamentary majority, according to official results. The protesters demanded an annulment of the December 4 election and a new vote. Around 7,000 people rallied in St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, RIA Novosti said, citing police. Hundreds of protesters were arrested during demonstrations last week. Police said they cracked down on those demonstrations because the turnouts were not legal and the protesters were being disorderly. Election officials on Friday released the official election results: 238 seats for United Russia; 92 seats for the Communists; 64 seats for Fair Russia; and 56 seats for the Liberal Democrats. Putin has announced plans to run for president -- the office he used to hold -- when Medvedev's term expires early next year. CNN's Arkady Irshenko and Phil Black contributed to this report from Moscow. CNN's Richard Allen Greene reported from London.","Mikhail Prokhorov concedes he runs the risk of ending up in prison .

"(CNN) -- Veronica Lon Pantaleon Mendoza said it was her son's pleas that finally led her to quit work. The 37-year-old from San Juan City in the Philippines went back to work three months after her son, now 14, was born and worked as a marketing executive for more than five years. ""My office was in another city,"" she writes on iReport. ""I'd need to beat the traffic; leave home very early while my son was still sleeping; travel home during rush hour and arrive home late at night when he (was still asleep)."" ""A nanny took care of him. We had a maid. I would describe myself then as more of a career woman than a mom.""

Mendoza is one of many who responded with their own experiences to the news that new Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is expecting a baby in October. In a Fortune article announcing the news Tuesday, the 37-year-old said: ""My maternity leave will be a few weeks long and I'll work throughout it."" Mayer's comments have re-ignited the perennial debate around how working mothers can balance motherhood with their careers -- can women really have it all? A CNN story published Wednesday, asked just that question: ""If Marissa Mayer can 'have it all,' can you?"" It prompted comments showing a variety of standpoints on the subject. As the piece mentions, Mayer is not your typical working mother and some of you echoed that, saying that because of her success, Mayer isn't a useful role model for the average person. See also: Want more female execs? Sort out the household chores . ""Using Marissa Mayer is not a good comparison to regular working moms,"" wrote Hamsamich.

But many of you chimed in, saying that no matter what a woman's wealth or success ""having it all"" is a myth. ""It is impossible to have it all,"" writes James330i. ""The ideal parent is at home watching the baby grow up. The ideal CEO spends the majority of time watching the company grow. ""To have it all would mean finding a job requiring 4hrs a day of work and the rest being a parent."" Rmercat agrees: ""You cannot be something for everyone, and be there all the time. Something at some point will have to give. ""This isn't necessarily a bad thing -- but people need to stop fooling themselves when they believe you can be in a board meeting and at the preschool play at the same time."" Pghgirl thinks that high-achieving women put pressure on others: ""(It's) a shame that women and men who want to stay home with their children have to feel pressured by society to be superwoman like this chick."" Spoddney thinks that the solution to the issue lies in legislation: ""When will the U.S. get with the program (I'm Professor of Medicine in Australia but worked ... in Boston for 3 years) ... Australia is much more working mum friendly and flexible than the U.S."" On Twitter, a debate sprang up on Twitter around the hashtag #havingitall.

What is this controversy all about? Romney contends that he ceased actively managing Bain in February 1999 when he joined the Olympics organization. As a candidate for president, he filed a Public Financial Disclosure Report with the federal Government Ethics Office stating that ""Mr. Romney retired from Bain Capital on February 11, 1999, to head the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. Since February 11, 1999, Mr. Romney has not had any active role with any Bain Capital entity and has not been involved in the operations of any Bain Capital entity in any way."" As we learned last week, documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission contradict this statement. Some of these documents were Schedule 13D reports, required to be filed pursuant to the Williams Act whenever any person or group acquires 5% or more of the stock of any public company. The purpose of such reports is to notify the securities markets of a possible change in control of a public company. For example, a Schedule 13D for Odwalla Inc., filed May 2, 2000, covers the acquisition of 32.7% of the shares of Odwalla by Bain Capital Partners VI and related entities. Bain Capital Partners VI (BCI VI) was one of many investment vehicles managed by Bain Capital Inc. (BCI). The Odwalla 13D Schedule represents that W. Mitt Romney is chief executive officer, president and managing director of BCI VI and his principal occupation is ""Managing Director of Bain Capital, Inc."" Similarly, a Schedule 13D for Stericycle Inc., filed November 22, 1999, by various Bain Capital entities and Romney as an individual states that Romney is ""the sole shareholder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of BCI, BCI VI Inc., Brookside and Sankaty, Ltd."" Elsewhere in this document, Romney is described as ""sole stockholder, sole director, Chief Executive Officer, Managing Director, Chairman and President of BCI."" A proxy statement for 2000 filed by Stericycle several months later indicates that the Bain entities, together with Romney, owned more than 11% of the shares of Stericycle and that Romney had the power to vote and dispose of these shares. At the next annual meeting, a Bain representative was nominated to the Stericycle board. The contradictory representations in the Government Ethics Office and SEC filings are at best evasive and at worst a violation of federal law. A federal statute -- 18 U.S.C. ยง 1001 -- provides that anyone who ""in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully -- (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation"" shall be fined or imprisoned. Violations of federal securities laws, including the making of false statements in a 13D filing, are independently punishable under the securities laws. Although prosecutions for false statements in 13D filings are not common, Michael Milken, the junk bond king, was prosecuted by Rudy Giuliani, and went to jail for aiding and abetting a false Schedule 13D filing by Ivan Boesky. (This was a plea bargain in a complex and controversial case, involving charges of numerous securities law violations.) Romney is not now claiming his 13D filings were inaccurate or false, but he is claiming that although he was chief executive officer, managing director, chairman and president of Bain Capital, he was not really there, but in Utah managing the Winter Olympics. Nevertheless, he was earning more than $100,000 in salary from Bain. Since he will not release his income tax returns for 1999-2002, we have no idea how high this salary really was. If Romney was not ""involved"" in the operations of Bain Capital, why was he being paid? As sole shareholder, why did he keep himself on as CEO? Also, at least with respect to the Stericycle deal, he invested as an individual along with the Bain entities. Why is Romney's story about his relationship to Bain and its investment activities at odds with the documents his firm filed? Bain Capital is a private equity firm. It acts principally by forming investment partnerships such as Bain Capital Partners VI to buy and sell operating companies. When Bain was headed by Romney, it invested in numerous distressed companies and attempted to turn them around and then sell them at a profit. These deals were financed by highly leveraged junk bonds. Excessive leverage by investment banks and others led to the 2008 financial meltdown from which we have yet to recover, but many investors reaped large profits from these leveraged deals. Also, partners in private equity companies such as Bain were taxed at advantageous rates called ""carried interest."" We do not know how much money Romney made on Bain deals because he will not make full disclosure of his finances. Some portfolio companies were resold by Bain entities at a substantial profit; others failed. That is the nature of private equity investment. Some of these companies were engaged in businesses or business practices that Romney now finds politically inconvenient, so he is attempting to absolve himself of responsibility for these deals. But the CEO, sole director and sole shareholder of an entity is legally responsible, and should be held accountable, for any wrongdoing or questionable activities of the company he heads. If Romney wants the American public to judge him by his business successes, we also need to judge him by his business failures and see the entire record of his financial dealings. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roberta Karmel.","Mitt Romney says he ceased managing Bain Capital when he took over Olympics in 1999 .

"(CNN) -- The cell-phone video shows a scene straight out of hell: a darkness lit only by billowing smoke, tinted orange and red from nearby flames, as a vehicle hurtles toward safety. ""Daddy?"" says a small, tearful voice, tinged with panic. ""We're going to make it,"" Doug Gulick tells his child. ""We're going to be fine."" ""Where's Mom?"" the child says, then, urgently, ""Why is she stopping?"" Kaleb Gulick, 13, shot the video in the car with his father as his family, in two cars, fled a deadly Colorado wildfire that crept too close to their home earlier this week. Firefighters were hoping to make more progress Thursday on containing the fire, which has burned more than 4,000 acres in a mountainous area near Denver. With improving conditions, some evacuated residents were allowed to return to their homes Thursday morning, the Jefferson County sheriff's office said. The Colorado Forest Service apologized for the wildfire after it was revealed that it was caused by a ""controlled"" burn that got out of control, killing at least two people. ""This is heartbreaking and we're sorry,"" State Forester Joe Duda told reporters Wednesday about the Lower North Fork Fire, which has scorched 4,140 acres in Jefferson County, destroying or damaging 27 houses and leaving a woman missing in addition to the two fatalities. The revelation pushed Gov. John Hickenlooper to suspend such burns. A team is being formed to investigate how last Thursday's controlled burn re-erupted on Monday as a wildfire. ""The loss of life and property this week is devastating and this fire is far from being contained,"" he said in a news release. ""That's why our top priority remains working to control the blaze,"" Hickenlooper said. He suspended the use of prescribed burns by state agencies on state lands -- including state parks, refuges, State Land Board lands and any agency that manages lands -- or under contract on nonstate lands, such as by the Colorado State Forest Service. The suspension will be effective until the review of protocols and procedures of prescribed burning is complete. Doug Gulick told CNN on Thursday as the family loaded the cars, ""the last thing I saw was this large flame shot up, and we realized we had to go right then."" ""We turned that corner and went from daylight into pure darkness,"" he said. Gulick's wife, Kim Olson, was in the vehicle in front of her husband. She explained Thursday she put the brakes on -- prompting her child's panic -- because she was fumbling for the headlights in the darkness, and because she hesitated, wondering if the family was going to make it out or whether she and Gulick should turn around. But then, she said, their neighbor went ""flying"" past them, and she decided to keep going. ""There it is, right there,"" Doug Gulick tells the children on the video as they pass flames. ""Oh, my gosh!"" a child exclaims, and Gulick soothes them as the sky brightens, ""We're out. We're out."" Kaleb Gulick said his father handed him the phone and ""I just did my best to capture the whole experience."" Olson said their home was still standing as of Tuesday, when they saw an aerial shot of its roof line and that of their neighbor. She said she has received word that firefighters are camping out on her driveway and her neighbor's, putting out spot fires. Their home is not out of danger yet, she said, but the family is ""still hoping for the best."" And as firefighters work to extinguish the blaze, the search continues for a woman missing since the fast-moving wildfire swept through her home. A search and rescue team of 32 people and six dogs searched 60 acres Wednesday around her house and found no sign of the woman, said Jacki Kelley, a public information officer with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. Firefighters have dropped 4,100 gallons of fire retardant on the blaze, which was fueled by high winds and dry conditions, officials said. Jefferson County Coroner John Graham identified the two victims as a married couple, Samuel Lucas, 77, and Linda Lucas, 76. ""They were found very close together,"" Kelley said. ""One was found outside; one was found inside."" Officials were trying to determine why the couple did not leave the fire zone by Monday night. CNN's Michael Martinez, Tina Burnside, Phil Gast, Darrell Calhoun, Josh Levs, Shawn Nottingham, Dave Hennen, and Sarah Dillingham contributed to this report.","NEW: Some residents are being allowed to return to their homes .

"London (CNN) -- The arrival of Prince William on a British military mission to the Falkland Islands puts him at the center of a diplomatic storm with Argentina about who owns the archipelago the two nations went to war over in 1982. William's six-week posting with an air force search and rescue crew has further inflamed anger in Argentina, where hostility towards Britain over the territory it calls Islas Malvinas is already intense. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and British Prime Minister David Cameron have both been drawn into a bitter war of words in recent weeks, reviving memories of conflict. Meanwhile Argentina has recruited regional allies such as Brazil to back its claim to the islands. Why are the Falklands in demand? Located in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 480 kilometers east of the tip of South America, the windswept Falklands have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources. Their remoteness, however, exposed them to neglect and complex wrangling over ownership among British, French, Spanish and Argentine interests. Argentina's forerunners formally declared possession in 1820, prompting Britain to reclaim a sovereignty it originally declared In 1765. Falklands conflict in photos: High-res gallery . Despite regular challenges, notably in 1982, British control has endured and the Falklands' current 2,500 inhabitants look to London to safeguard oil, fishing, farming and tourism incomes. What happened in 1982? The Falklands became a battleground as Britain and Argentina sent warships, submarines, aircraft and troops to the islands. Diplomatic hostilities initially broke out over Argentinian activities on South Georgia -- an even remoter British territory in the South Atlantic. Naval forces were dispatched by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as Argentine President Leopoldo Galtieri's military dictatorship launched a Falklands invasion on April 2. Troops fought on the islands, aircraft were shot down and ships were attacked with significant losses of life -- most notably the Argentian General Belgrano and Britain's HMS Sheffield, HMS Antelope and RFA Sir Galahad. Britain declared an end to fighting after 74 days following the surrender of Argentinian troops. Argentina put its death toll at 645. Britain's civil and military losses amounted to 255. How did the United States and other world powers react? President Ronald Reagan's administration nailed its colors firmly to the British mast, declaring economic sanctions against Argentina. It also gave its Cold War ally a strategic edge by supplying potent Sidewinder missiles to counter Argentina's Exocets. At the height of the conflict, a meeting in Versailles, France of the world's biggest economies -- including the UK, U.S., Germany, Italy, France, Japan and Canada -- backed Britain's position. Why won't the UK give up the islands like it did Hong Kong? Britain acknowledges its claim to the Falklands is disputed, but has no intention of discussing the sovereignty issue, according to Professor Clive Schofield, an expert in maritime territorial disputes at Australia's University of Wollongong. He says that there is no comparison to Hong Kong, which Britain returned to Chinese control after expiry of a set lease in 1997. ""The UK position on the Falklands is that they are under British sovereignty -- they are not leased from anyone."" What has happened to the islands since the end of the war in 1982? Spurred by the conflict and stung by accusations of neglect, Britain began taking renewed economic interest in the Falklands. It protected fishing rights and asserted control over oil exploration licences. It also stepped up its military interests, building a new airfield and bolstering naval, army and air force presences. See high-res images of life in the Falklands . Cooperation between Britain and Argentina -- by now an established democracy whose militarist past has left current leaders distrustful of its armed forces -- has improved, but Buenos Aires continued to reject any territorial claim to Las Malvinas other than its own. So why is the language between London and Buenos Aires more tense now? Pure politics say analysts. The deployment of Britain's Prince William has added to the theater, as have claims and counter-claims of colonialism -- and Britain's decision this week to send its newest destroyer HMS Dauntless. But, they say, the real source is Argentinian politicians seeking to divert voters from the pain caused by inflation and reduced subsidies on oil, gas and electricity. ""The government is being squeezed from lots of different areas, so one way to distract from the economic problems facing the country is to raise the Malvinas issue,"" said Professor Mark Jones, an expert in Latin American politics at Rice University in Texas. ""It's one of the few issues outside football that you can get universal consensus on."" In the UK, Cameron -- an heir to Thatcher's Conservative party legacy -- must be seen to defend the principles his predecessor mobilized the troops for. ""It's not about asserting a claim, it's about allowing people of the Falklands to have the right to self-determination,"" said Simon Weston, a British Falklands conflict veteran. What has Argentina done to bolster its claims? Regional allies have been recruited to the cause, with members of the South American Mercosur trading bloc uniting to ban Falklands-flagged vessels from their ports. This is largely ""diplomatic dressing"" that will do little to isolate the islands, says Professor Roett Riordan, who heads the Latin American program at John Hopkins University in Washington D.C. Jones adds that more effective pressure could be applied if Argentina's Fernandez persuades Chilean President Sebastian Pinera to cancel a vital air link between the islands and Santiago. Is this now all about oil? Partly. There is Argentinian resentment of a British oil exploration project launched off the Falklands in 2010. This has been worsened by Argentina's recent relegation from exporter to net importer of hydrocarbons. Analysts, however, insist this remains a sideshow to the political traction offered by the Malvinas dispute. How much oil is there? Press reports say up to 8.3 billion barrels of undersea oil reserves could lie in the Falklands economic zone -- a radius of 320-kilometers around the islands, but despite successful drilling finds in recent months, this quantity is still speculative. The figures are backed by claims from small oil ventures, including Rockhopper and Borders & Southern Petroleum, which are hoping to raise capital for further exploration in fields licensed by the islands' British-backed government. Attempts to attract investment in the projects has been hampered by the Anglo-Argentinian dispute. Many major oil firms have interests in Argentina and are wary of upsetting Buenos Aires by involving themselves in the Falklands. Also a problem is the considerable cost of extracting deep water reserves from the remote South Atlantic -- although this becomes less of an issue as oil prices continue to climb. Professor Alex Kemp, a petroleum economics expert at the University of Aberdeen, described the Falklands oil reserve estimates as ""optimistic,"" adding that even if they are proven, the cost of exploiting them could still be prohibitive. ""It's one thing doing exploration, but when you come to development, we're talking about bigger volumes of materials and to get that there is expensive because at the moment there's nothing there -- just sheep farmers,"" he said. ""It will take a few 100 million barrels to make it worth it, and there's a number of ifs and buts before we get there."" Is conflict likely again? No, say analysts. While there are parallels with the 1980s -- politicians using Anglo-Argentinian tensions to court votes and divert from economic woes at home -- there is little appetite for conflict on either side. Any action is likely to remain in the diplomatic sphere. A former senior British military officer last month said UK cutbacks had left the Britain unprepared for another Falklands conflict. Argentina is apparently in a similar state, with a heavily depleted military that experts say would be no match even for Britain's depleted force. ""Even if Argentina wanted to go to war, they have no military capacity,"" says Jones. He said Fernandez's own antipathy towards the military -- a legacy of her political opposition to Argentina's former dictatorship -- meant she would be unlikely to support even a maritime blockade of British vessels.","Several countries have disputed ownership of Falklands since the first recorded landfall in the 17th century .

"Washington (CNN) -- A controversial program by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that tried to track illegal weapons sales shows the need for tougher gun laws, according to a report issued Thursday by a House Democrat. Entitled ""Outgunned,"" the report released by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, quoted law enforcement officers on how lax or nonexistent laws and regulations on so-called ""straw"" purchases of illegal weapons, firearms trafficking and monitoring of the sales of assault rifles and other long guns contributed to the thriving trafficking of illegal weapons to Mexico. The report is an attempt by Cummings and other Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to raise the issue of gun control in the investigation of ""Operation Fast and Furious,"" the ATF program that focused on following people who legally bought weapons that were then transferred to criminals and destined for Mexico. Instead of intercepting the weapons when they switched hands, Operation Fast and Furious called for ATF agents to let the guns ""walk"" and wait for them to surface in Mexico, according to the House committee. The idea was that once the weapons in Mexico were traced back to the straw purchasers, the entire arms smuggling network could be brought down. Instead, the committee argued, letting the weapons slip into the wrong hands was a deadly miscalculation that resulted in preventable deaths, including that of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. The Democratic report issued Thursday said committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa of California prevented questions about the need for stronger gun control laws at a June 15 hearing on the ATF operation. ""Despite the chairman's efforts to wall off any discussion of the nation's gun laws, the record compiled during the committee's investigation documents clearly that these same law enforcement agents believe that their efforts to combat international drug cartels would be enhanced significantly with common-sense improvements in several key areas,"" the report said. It called for increased criminal penalties for illegal straw purchases, enactment by Congress of a ""dedicated firearms trafficking statute,"" and for ATF to get reports from gun dealers on purchases of multiple long guns ""that are now the weapons of choice for Mexican drug cartels."" Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, told a forum on illegal firearms trafficking he organized Thursday that he knew the recommendations of the new report ""will face stiff resistance in Congress and beyond."" ""Before today's forum even began, it was criticized as a conspiracy to confiscate the firearms of law-abiding citizens, which is ridiculous,"" he said. Cummings also said he and Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, would introduce legislation on the reforms called for in the report. In the report, federal agents called existing laws against straw purchasers insufficient and said the country needed a specific statute against weapons trafficking. ""Prosecutors and law enforcement agents should not have to bend over backwards to imprison those who provide military-grade weapons to murderers,"" Cummings said. The ATF operation has been criticized by President Barack Obama, who promised ""appropriate action"" once a Justice Department investigation is complete. Federal law enforcement sources say Kenneth Melson, acting director of ATF, is expected to be forced out as a result. Terry was killed last year north of the Mexican border in Arizona after confronting bandits believed to be preying on illegal immigrants. Two weapons found near the scene of the killing were traced to Fast and Furious. Issa has called the operation ""felony stupid."" As many as 2,000 semiautomatic rifles reached the hands of cartels as a result, and Issa said the top two ATF officials were briefed on the program regularly. In Mexico, the case has drawn nationwide attention and sharp criticism from top officials, who have long stressed that U.S. weapons are fueling the country's drug war. CNN's Terry Frieden and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","A Democratic report says illegal weapons reach Mexico too easily .

"London (CNN) -- It's not just the athletes going for gold in the 2012 London Olympics -- it appears that some of the torch bearers may be trying to cash in on the role of carrying the flame. In the few days since the Olympic flame arrived in Britain several adverts for what are claimed to be genuine Olympic torches have appeared on the online auction site eBay, some with eye-watering price tags. Six torches have sold for more than £100,000 ($158,000) on eBay, although it's not known whether money actually changed hands at the end of the auction. One bidder asks if a torch is authentic, and the seller, who lives in Burnham-on-Sea, England, responds: ""Running at 1638 on Monday. It will be dispatched within my handling time. Absolutely authentic, I wouldn't risk my eBay rating on selling a fake."" After a frenzy of up to 163 bids, the ""soot-marked torch"" sold for £153,000 ($241,000). London Olympics organizers say they cannot be used again as the burner system is disabled after each runner finishes a section. Some sellers say they will donate a percentage of the sale price to charity, with one offering to give 10% to Save the Children. Each of the torches used in the 70-day relay up to the opening ceremony on 27 July has been offered in advance to the runner at a discounted price of just under £199 ($314)... or £215 ($339) if they bought it on the day. Organizers say the money helps to cover the production costs of £594 ($937) for each of the perforated, aluminum alloy torches. A spokeswoman for the 2012 games said: ""The torches are the torch bearers' to do what they want with them -- we hope they find a good home."" London Olympic Games organizers are not responsible for the distinctive torches once the runners take ownership, but the spokeswoman urged potential online bidders to be cautious. She advised anyone considering making a bid to check the seller's identity and then visit the official London 2012 Olympics website which carries a full list of torch bearers. Large crowds have been turning out each day to watch the procession of the Olympic flame through the UK and some have gained a glimpse of a celebrity -- English soccer star and Los Angeles Galaxy player, David Beckham, lit the first torch on its arrival in the UK. And American rapper and Black Eyed Peas star Will.i.am took a turn carrying the flame on Monday. Organizers say there will be a series of high-profile bearers throughout the relay but are staying tight-lipped about exactly who they are. Apart from celebrities and athletes, most of the runners were chosen in recognition for a contribution to their community or personal achievement and followed a nomination process. The journey began when the flame was lit from the sun's rays at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The flame will feature at the opening ceremony when the final torch bearer lights the cauldron inside London's Olympic Stadium. In the interim, it will be carried 8,000 miles across the UK by 8,000 runners and using a route that organizers say will be within 10 miles of 95% of the population. Five days into the relay, crowds are still turning out in force across the south west of England. ""I think it's fantastic there's been so much enthusiasm running through each community,"" said the London Olympics spokeswoman. ""I think it's a very British thing to do -- to get behind something in your community.""","Adverts for what are claimed to be genuine Olympic torches have appeared on eBay .

"Savannah, Georgia (CNN) -- This old Southern city is still waking up when the first members drift into the church basement. They turn on the lights, pull metal chairs across the wooden floor and settle in with paper cups of coffee and the weight of the week. There's work or not enough work. Diabetes. Tonight's dinner and tomorrow's, too. Parents in prison, neighbors just getting out. Kids who want some faraway, high-cost college and kids who don't want to get out of bed on Sundays. Then there's money -- always, forever money -- to think about. They've heard weekly sermons about how to plan, overcome and grow, but the lessons really start to apply in Bible study, like today, when they'll pore over a line and relate it back to the messy, wonderful business of living. Worry is nothing new for the congregation at First African Baptist Church, which is well into its third century and one of the oldest black congregations in the United States. But this is a loving congregation, they say, and always the type to take action when times are hard. Of course they will feed the hungry, clothe the naked and teach the young, but they also want to preserve their space. Members say it was the first brick structure in Georgia that was built, used and owned by black people, that it's their own living history of slavery, civil rights and freedom. It's just so much. ""This is not new for us,"" says Gladys Cohen, a lifetime member and 7 a.m. Bible study regular. ""There's just more needs."" So, with darkness pouring in the windows and a long day still ahead, the Rev. Thurmond N. Tillman sits in his folding chair and reminds his followers of the Bible passage he repeats most, from the book of Matthew: ""But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you."" As they all know, it has worked for this congregation before. Faith first, then freedom . More than 150 years ago, slaves built this church by fire and moonlight. They raised the walls with clay and sand blocks known as Savannah Gray Brick, and a white ceiling patterned after a nine-patch quilt, a symbol of safety from slavery. After the first Bible study of the day, Johnny McDonald explains this to a small tour group seated in the church's curved oak pews. He was baptized in First African's chilly pool at age 7 and began giving tours as a teen. He's 22 now, one semester shy of graduation from Savannah State University. He learned the church's history through a thousand sermons and older members' memories. Several times a week, he leads tours of each level, and shares everything he knows. He talks about the earliest church leaders, who were whipped and harassed by white residents who balked at the idea of a black preacher. He tells of schisms that divided the flourishing black congregation. He explains that in the 1830s, a white congregation planned to move to a new location, and offered its land and an aging wooden building to First African Baptist Church. The price was $1,500. Most of the church members were slaves, whose labor fueled Savannah's agriculture and shipping economy. But many could earn money of their own by working after-hours or taking odd jobs. Some could save enough to buy freedom for themselves and their families. So, they faced a choice, McDonald says: Use money saved to free themselves, or pool their funds to purchase a church for all. He imagines that they read the line from Matthew, about seeking God's kingdom first; he knows that within a few months, they came up with the money, and the church was theirs. But the building was already deteriorating when First African moved in. By the 1850s, Savannah was a growing city of 14,000 free residents and 7,000 slaves. The pastor championed a new structure, one made of brick, one made to last. This very building, McDonald says. He points out the handiwork of members who toiled through the night from 1855 to 1859. They designed a tall sanctuary, balcony seating and pews with ancient African languages carved into the sides. Perhaps their best plan was mostly out of view, McDonald explains as he leads visitors down stairs and into the basement. Beneath the wooden floor, builders left a space four feet tall, large enough to hide hundreds of slaves following the Savannah River to freedom. They punctured holes in the floor in the cross-and-diamond shape of an African prayer symbol, the Kongo Cosmogram, and publicly worshipped its ancient meaning. Quietly, underneath, runaways worshipped the light and air the symbols allowed. ""You're talking about working 12 to 16 hours, then turning around to come build a church at nighttime and going back to work on fields after that,"" he tells the tour group. ""If I can say so, that's a lot of hard work, and a lot of dedication to the task at hand."" Most of the builders were still enslaved after the church doors opened, but freedom came to them a few years later, anyway, through the Emancipation Proclamation. McDonald repeats the passage from Matthew again, ""All things shall be added."" ""That was no coincidence,"" he tells the crowd. The pastor interrupts the tour to invite the guests to stay. There's another Bible study at noon, and everyone is welcome here. Rebuilding the church . ""Do we see ourselves as programmers, or do we see ourselves as builders?"" the pastor asks. It's time for the evening Bible study, and the crowd has outgrown the basement. They're sitting in pews in business suits and blue jeans; Tillman is in the same suit he started the day in 12 hours before. They murmur the question, wondering what trick he has thrown at them. He asks again: Programmers, doing service as a thoughtless habit? Or builders, serving to edify their church and its mission in the community? Since Tillman took over in 1982, he has simplified how people worship. He encouraged members to decentralize ministries and take the lessons from church into their everyday lives. He wants them to consider the community's needs and use their talents to serve the church, whether they're passing out water at football games, teaching a seminar about financial planning or leading a church tour. This will never be a church that has to look far for service projects, Tillman says. He needs only look at their building. It needs a kitchen; the old one was removed to make wheelchair-accessible bathrooms. They want to replace the steeple with a 100-foot replica of the original, which was knocked down by a hurricane about a century ago. They want to rip the stucco off the exterior and preserve those old gray bricks, then build a museum out back to teach thousands of visitors who take their tour every year. It will cost millions, and nobody wants to spend a dime till they can do it without debt. In Savannah, a city where history now drives much of the economy, they're likely to get community support. Still, African-American spaces have long fallen behind others. Where there are well-preserved plantation mansions, slave quarters are often long gone.

"(CNN) -- Few Americans think twice about whether their medicine bottle really contains what it says on the label. But that sense of security was shaken last month, when the Food and Drug Administration announced that a counterfeit version of Avastin, an expensive and commonly used cancer drug, had been purchased by 19 hospitals and medical centers. FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg spoke to CNN about medical counterfeits, as well as another crucial problem -- the ongoing shortage of many lifesaving cancer drugs. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: Where does the investigation stand? Hamburg: It's an ongoing investigation, but we're working hard, and from what we can tell, patients have not been harmed from this. But it's a wake-up call that we need to be working with the patient community and law enforcement to make sure our drug supply stays as safe as possible. CNN: Did any patients actually receive the medication, or was it caught before that? Hamburg: We were able to get an early warning from colleagues in other countries that had noted the problem with substandard Avastin, and to move quickly to identify distributors in this country that had purchased and were using this counterfeit product. And our sense is that patients were not harmed. CNN: The hospitals and providers -- do you think they should have noticed this problem sooner? Hamburg: It's very hard for a health care provider to know when a drug is faked. And believe me, some of the fakes are very, very good. CNN: Has this case helped to put more attention on the problem? Hamburg: It's focused new attention and concern on counterfeit drugs. We feel at the FDA that we're doing a very good job working with companies, with law enforcement and the health care community, but there's more that still needs to be done. I'm very eager to work with Congress. They're considering some legislation that would give the FDA stronger authority and stiffen the rules around counterfeit drugs, and make it easier for us to really track drugs in the system, and enable us to quickly pull inadequate drugs. CNN: Right now, if you find a package of counterfeits, you sometimes have to send it back to the counterfeiter. Hamburg: At the present time, the FDA actually doesn't have the authority when we find counterfeit drugs coming into the country, to just seize and destroy them. We can go to the courts, we can get an order and then take action, but that takes time. We need new authority. We also need stronger systems in place, to work with other countries and the international community to trace drugs as they move through the system. CNN: How would tracking work? Hamburg: It's important to recognize that drugs taken in this country come from sites all over the world. Right now 40% of finished drugs Americans take come from other countries, and 80% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients taken here come from other countries. We are responsible for overseeing drugs in 300,000 facilities around the world, coming in from 150 or so different countries. So it's a huge task. CNN: Do we know how widespread counterfeits might be in the U.S? Hamburg: We are constantly vigilant, and we do see on a regular basis isolated problems with counterfeit and substandard drugs. What we're concerned about is putting in place systems to prevent greater and more widespread problems in the future. Also, penalties for counterfeiting drugs need to be stiffened. Right now, in terms of criminal activity, the penalties are less than if you counterfeit a Gucci purse. I think we can do better. CNN: There has been an ongoing shortage of cancer drugs. Does that create a greater incentive to counterfeit? Hamburg: Right now, the problems are separate and discreet, but we need to recognize that there's a huge potential for overlap. As drugs are in shortage, it creates the possibility of new gray markets or illegal markets to fill in those gaps. We need to make sure that does not happen. CNN: Do you think the problem of shortages will get better or worse? Hamburg: It's a serious problem and it's going to be a continuous problem. It arises from an array of different factors. Some economic factors, incentives and reimbursement issues, and some that have to do with manufacturing issues and quality concerns. I think we are really deepening our understanding of how problems arise, and we've strengthened the network of reporting so we're getting early indications of when shortages may occur. CNN: What's an example of that? Hamburg: It's very striking. After the president made an announcement about the importance of drug shortages, and issued an executive order basically asking FDA to call on companies to voluntarily expand their reporting when they think they might have a shortage or a disruption in the drug supply, we've seen an increase of about six times as many reports. In that time frame -- November, to here we are in the middle of March -- we've been able to prevent about 115 drug shortages.","Right now 40% of finished drugs Americans take come from other countries .

"London (CNN) -- Six months to the day before Opening Ceremonies, builders have handed the Olympic Village over to the London 2012 organizers. The first of 16,000 beds have been delivered as organizers start to fit out the rooms. ""We are starting the huge process to install essential facilities and services ready to welcome competitors from around the world in six months' time,"" Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London 2012 Organizing Committee said in a press release issued early Friday. The beds will soon be joined by 11,000 sofas and even 5,000 toilet brushes, say organizers. The Summer Games run from July 27 through August 12. Olympic Village, a huge housing complex of some 2,800 apartments within walking distance of the stadium in East London, has already been sold as part of the post-games legacy plans. Nearly 1,400 of the apartments were sold in 2009 for $400 million and will be rented by local governments for subsidized housing. The remainder was sold to a consortium, including the Qatari government, as part of a $800 million deal to own and manage the entire village. Local campaigners have pushed for more of the apartments to be social housing as part of the organizer's pledge to regenerate the area post-games. The original plan was for the developer Lend Lease to raise the funding privately to build the village, but the work started in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. The government decided instead to the foot the reported $1.6 billion bill and is unlikely to recoup the entire cost of the housing. The complex will be known as East Village once it is turned over to renters and homeowners.","Olympic Village in London ready for next phase .

"(CNN) -- Slovakian sensation Peter Sagan made it a hat-trick of stage wins on his debut in the Tour de France as he sprinted to victory in Metz Friday. The 22-year-old Sagan has extended his lead in the battle for the green points jersey after denying German Andre Greipel his third straight stage win. But the 210-km sixth stage from Eperney was marred by a mass pile-up 26km from the finish which claimed a number of contenders for overall honors. Race leader Fabian Cancellara, favorite Bradley Wiggins and defending champion Cadel Evans avoided the crash. But Giro d'Italia winner Ryder Hesjedal (Garmin-Sharp-Barracuda) and RadioShack star Frank Schleck all but saw their hopes ended along with French favorite Thomas Voeckler and Dutchman Robert Gesink. The globalization of the Tour de France . Britain's Mark Cavendish (Team Sky) was also held up to leave Sagan to battle it out with a reluctant Greipel, who had gone down twice in earlier incidents to leave his confidence shaken. Australia's Matt Goss (Orica-GreenEdge) finished third. The decisive crash came as the peloton chased a four-man breakaway on a straight but tight section of road. Several riders were injured and behind it was chaos, with many competitors held up and looking for new bikes and wheels. Hesjedal's teammate, David Millar of Britain, summed it up on his Twitter blog: . ""Oh sweet jesus that was scary. Approx 70km/h pile up, like a tidal wave of debris smashing towards us, could do nothing but brake and pray."" A whittled down peloton of eventually caught the frontrunners of David Zabriskie (Garmin), Davide Malacarne (Europcar), Karsten Kroon (Saxo Bank) and Romain Zingle (Cofidis), with Sagan going on to show his undoubted class at the finish.","Peter Sagan wins third stage on his debut in the Tour de France .

"Northern Syria (CNN) -- Syrian troops at a besieged military base just north of Aleppo fired out in three directions on Sunday in the face of a rebel onslaught, part of a high-stakes battle for a city where a top regional leader claimed war crimes are being committed. For days, anti-government forces have been trying to take over the northern Syrian city, where many residents appear to support their cause, only to be answered by fierce fighting by the Syrian military. The fight for the military base is one of many hotspots of violence raging around Aleppo, which is the commercial and cultural center of the Middle Eastern nation and its largest city. CNN's Ivan Watson inside Syria . Yet it is indicative, in many ways, of what's going on, with the rebels attacking from seemingly many different directions and scores of troops inside firing back furiously with machine guns -- oftentimes straight into neighboring villages. Rockets and shells routinely land in residential communities, many of which are largely deserted as civilians flee the area. On Sunday, families continued to use motorcycles, cars and whatever other means to escape the city. They are among the roughly 200,000 people in Aleppo and surrounding areas to flee shelling and heavy weapon fire over the past two days, according to Valerie Amos, the U.N.'s under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs. Nabil Elaraby, the head of the Arab League, said Sunday in a statement that his group supports calls from the Syrian opposition for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting to address the situation in Aleppo. Elaraby added that the group believes war crimes are being committed in the city. Officials from the Arab League are planning visits to Russia and China hoping to persuade the superpowers, which have vetoed several resolutions over Syria, to change their stance, he said. The regional group's statement came hours after Syria's top diplomat delivered ominous words about the battle for Aleppo, vowing that rebel troops would not gain control of the city. ""Since last week, (opposition fighters) planned for whatever they called the 'great Damascus battle,' but they have failed after one week,"" Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said during a trip to Iran, one of his nation's few remaining allies, in referring to a rebel offensive beaten back earlier this month. ""That's why they moved to Aleppo, and I can assure you that they will fail."" But U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, speaking aboard a military aircraft Sunday traveling to North Africa and eventually the Middle East, predicted that government forces' violent crackdown in Aleppo will prove ""a nail in Assad's coffin"" by turning even more people against President Bashar al-Assad and his government. U.S. increasing contacts with Syrian rebels . Aleppo was just one area hit by violence on Sunday. The city saw 11 deaths out of 114 nationwide, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. At least 41 people were killed in Damascus and its suburbs, a figure that includes 18 unidentified bodies found charred on farms in Moadamiyeh, where a total of 36 people were reported dead. Another 33 died in the province of Daraa, and nine apiece were slain in the provinces of Homs and Deir Ezzor, the group said. State media and activists reported violence elsewhere as well, including clashes in suburbs near the southwestern city of Daraa and the northwestern city of Idlib. That said, Aleppo has gotten much of the attention in part because controlling it is considered key for the embattled regime and the anti-government fighters. Regime forces are preventing fuel and food from entering Aleppo neighborhoods controlled by rebel fighters, opposition activists said. Rebels have had to set up medical clinics in homes. ""The situation in the city of Aleppo is very critical and quite serious,"" said activist Abo Hamdi from the neighborhood of Salahuddin, adding the ""Free Syrian Army is preparing for a fierce battle."" Aleppo: Great world city in grip of war . Syrian TV reported that ""terrorists"" suffered heavy losses after clashes in three neighborhoods. With relentless attacks rocking Aleppo, the head of a prominent Syrian opposition group pleaded for world allies to help arm rebels. ""Our friends and allies will bear responsibility for the terrifying massacres that will happen in Aleppo if they don't move soon. This regime is planning for a big massacre in Aleppo,"" Abdulbaset Sieda, head of the Syrian National Council, told reporters in Abu Dhabi. He urged allies to act outside of the U.N. Security Council, as resolutions there can be vetoed. ""The rebels now are fighting with primitive types of weapons against the killing machine. We need weapons that will allow us to stop tanks and planes,"" Sieda said. Libyan rebels move onto Syrian battlefield . Meanwhile, Syria's foreign minister decried what he called a ""vicious"" international plot against the Syrian regime. ""I can tell you that we are facing a global war against Syria, and as a proud Syrian I can tell you that it is a great honor to be part of a great country that is facing a ferocious attack by certain countries,"" he told reporters in Tehran after a meeting with his Iranian counterpart. Moallem also described a ""media campaign"" by the United States and others about chemical weapons in Syria. Iran's foreign minister accused Israel of being behind ""a conspiracy against Syria."" ""It is completely ridiculous and delusive to believe that there is a possibility of creating a vacuum in the leadership in Syria,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said. ""We call upon the people of the region to be fully aware and not to move in the wrong direction, because there will be severe consequences that will go beyond the borders of the region to the outside world."" The Syrian crisis started in March 2011, after al-Assad's regime cracked down on peaceful protests. More than 20,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the conflict, the LCC said. Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said almost 17,000 people have died. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Saad Abedine and Mohammed Jamjoom and journalists Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Shiyar Sayed Mohamed contributed to this report.","NEW: 114 die in Syria, including 41 around Damascus, an opposition group says .

"(CNN) -- Coloradans continued to put their lives back together Thursday after last week's deadly shooting rampage at a crowded movie theater -- some mourning, others returning to homes from which they had been barred for days. More of the scores wounded in last Friday morning's shooting left hospitals in and around metropolitan Denver, though 12 remained. The last two patients of six that were at Children's Hospital Colorado were released on Thursday, according to the hospital. The final person being treated at Denver Health Hospital also went home Thursday, said spokesman Tony Encinias. One patient was discharged Thursday from the University of Colorado Hospital; four of the five who remain there are in critical condition, officials said. Five more shooting victims are being cared for at Aurora Medical Center, and two are in fair condition at Swedish Medical Center in Denver, the hospital said. For others, Thursday was time to mourn. That included scores who packed New Hope Baptist Church in Denver to remember Micayla Medek, a 23-year-old woman who had been working toward her college degree. Speakers at the service reflected on Medek's love of the color pink and Hello Kitty, her vibrant and positive spirit, and her belief that life and people, in fact, are a ""little weird."" ""I will push myself forward, and I will carry her with me every step of the way,"" said Thomas Luong, her roommate and friend since high school. Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan told Medek's parents, brother and sister that they had the support of thousands, if not millions. He said he had gotten messages from people on all seven continents, expressing their sympathy and solidarity. ""The world knows. The world will remember,"" said Hogan. ""We are all part of your family today. We will stay part of your family."" Aurora heroes: Three who gave their lives . The man who authorities say opened fire in the theater during the midnight premiere of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" killing Medek and 11 others, is in custody after being ordered held without bond. James Holmes, who identified himself to police as ""the Joker,"" made his first court appearance on Monday and will be formally charged July 30. Two court orders, signed by Arapahoe County District Judge William Sylvester, were posted on a court website Thursday noting restrictions on information the University of Colorado could release about Holmes. The 24-year-old had recently dropped out of a Ph.D program in neuroscience out of the school's campus in Aurora. Prosecutor in shootings has courted controversy . The orders, in addition to a previous one issued Wednesday aimed at ""limiting pre-trial publicity"" at the defendant's request, endeavor to restrict the amount of publicly available information in order to assure ""the fairness of a trial."" Meanwhile, Holmes' former neighbors are being allowed back home for the first time since the shooting, Sgt. Cassidee Carlson of the Aurora Police Department said Wednesday evening. The tenants of the apartment building where Holmes had lived were rousted out of their apartments by police in the early hours of Friday shortly after the shooting. Warning signs of violence: What to do . Holmes had booby-trapped his sparsely furnished third-floor, one-bedroom unit apartment with more than 30 homemade grenades and 10 gallons of gasoline, a law enforcement official who viewed video showing the apartment's interior has told CNN. The sophisticated setup was meant to harm, or possibly kill, anyone who entered -- and tested the skills of bomb squad members charged with clearing it, the official said. Stories of survival: Newborn a 'silver lining' Authorities on Monday also discovered a package in a mailroom at the University of Colorado -- Anschutz Medical Campus apparently sent by Holmes, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said Wednesday. CBS News reported that the package was addressed to a psychologist at the university, which Holmes had attended. ""Sources say the letter was from a pent-up Holmes to one of his professors,"" the news organization reported. ""In it, he talked about shooting people and even included crude drawings of a gunman and his victims."" Some of his victims, both in and out of hospitals, faced a difficult recovery process and the prospect of daunting medical bills. How to help victims . They include Caleb Medley, who lost an eye and suffered brain damage. His wife gave birth to their son Hugo Jackson Medley on Tuesday morning, and the University of Colorado Hospital said both baby and mother are doing well. Medley, who had been doing standup comedy routines in Denver and was working full-time at Target, had no health insurance, his brother Seth said. ""The surgeon came and talked to us and said he'd be in ICU at least a week,"" said Medley's friend, Michael West, who set up a website to help take care of medical bills and the needs of Medley's family. By Thursday evening, it had raised more than $313,000. Chloe Anderson has set up a similar fund for her sister, Petra Anderson, an aspiring musician who was also shot in the head. In a video posted Sunday asking for funds, Chloe Anderson notes that her mother was preparing to undergo cancer treatment later this month when Friday's shooting occurred. ""My sister's hospital bills on top of that are making the financial reality look pretty daunting,"" she says. ""So that's why we are reaching out to you -- the people who have already asked us what they can do to help."" By Wednesday evening, that fund had received more than $184,000 with a goal of $250,000. Money is also streaming in to GivingFirst.org, which is accepting donations for the shooting victims and their relatives. By Tuesday, the amount had reached almost $2 million, Gov. John Hickenlooper said. Victims remembered through poignant stories . ""The needs will be great and we look forward to seeing the fund grow exponentially,"" he said. ""This money will help those impacted by this tragedy begin to recover and rebuild their lives."" Hickenlooper said donors include Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures, co-producers of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Sources at Warner Bros. studios told CNN the company made a ""substantial"" donation. Warner Bros., a subsidiary of CNN's parent company Time Warner, would not divulge how much money it was giving out of respect for the victims, the sources said. Dispatch: We need rescue in theater 9 . Several hospitals were also making efforts to minimize the financial burden. Children's Hospital Colorado said in a statement it will use its charity program and donations to cover medical expenses for victims who don't have insurance, as well as waive co-pays and deductible-related expenses for those with insurance. HealthOne, the health care system that includes the Medical Center of Aurora and Swedish Medical Center, pledged to ""eliminate personal financial responsibility for hospital charges as appropriate."" And Denver Health said it will evaluate each patient ""on a case-by-case basis"" and discount bills by 70% for those unable to pay. Focusing on the victims, not the shooter .

"London (CNN) -- Seven promising young British athletes lit the Olympic cauldron early Saturday, capping the Games' festive opening ceremony in east London. The torch, which arrived on a boat driven by football star David Beckham down the River Thames, had been carried into the stadium by five-time Olympic gold medalist Steve Redgrave. The retired rower then passed it to the young athletes, who lit part of the outer rim of the torch, setting off a domino effect as fire spread to 205 small metal ""petals,"" symbolizing the nations taking part. The small petals eventually rose on long stems and converged to become a cauldron pointing up to the sky above the stadium. A short time earlier, Queen Elizabeth II formally pronounced the Olympics open for business, saying, ""I declare open the Games of London, celebrating the 30th Olympiad of the modern era."" Organizers had said they expected a billion people worldwide to watch the opening ceremony -- which was created by Danny Boyle, best known for directing the Oscar-winning film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" -- on television. Explaining the ceremony: From Shakespeare to the Sex Pistols . Tens of thousands more congregated in ""fan zones"" around the British capital to watch the festivities on big screens, their enthusiasm hardly diminished by overcast sky and sporadic showers. The event opened with a scene dubbed ""Green and Pleasant,"" after a line from poet William Blake. It featured an idyllic view of a British countryside. Rolling hills, fields and rivers -- complete with picnicking families, sports being played on a village green and farmyard animals -- made up the elaborate set. Hundreds of volunteers dressed in period costumes walked, danced and otherwise performed as music played. The set soon transformed into one recalling the noisy, grimy transformation of the Industrial Revolution, including large smokestacks emerging from below. After a short film featuring Daniel Craig, the latest actor to play cinematic British spy James Bond, and none other than Queen Elizabeth II herself, the next performance paid tribute to Britain's National Health Service and children's literature. J.K. Rowling, author of the best-selling Harry Potter books, kicked off the scene -- which featured, among others, the evil Voldemort from her series and magical nanny Mary Poppins. Next came a performance of the iconic song from ""Chariots of Fire,"" a tale about two British Olympians from 1924 that was lightened up by slapstick comedian Mr. Bean, played by Rowan Atkinson. Then came a showcase for pop songs from the Beatles to the Rolling Stones to Frankie Goes to Hollywood to David Bowie, which was followed by a short live performance by rapper Dizzee Rascal. There was also a special shout-out to Tim Berners-Lee, a London native who is credited with inventing the World Wide Web. His words, ""This is for everyone"" at one point lit up a part of the stands for all to see. Just over one hour in, the Olympic athletes finally made their way into the stadium led, per tradition, by the Greek delegation. The mastermind behind the opening ceremony . That was followed by another performance featuring bicyclists with glowing butterfly wings going around the stadium, one of whom soared into the air. Several dignitaries escorted the Olympic flag as it entered the stadium, among them U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and legendary American boxer Muhammad Ali. Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London Games organizing committee and a four-time Olympic medalist, then promised, ""London 2012 will inspire a generation."" ""In the next two weeks, we will show all that has made London one of the greatest cities in the world,"" Coe said. ""Let us determine, all of us, all over the world, that London 2012 will see the very best of us."" International Olympic Committee chief Jacques Rogge noted the history being made with these Games -- the first competition in which every delegation had female athletes and the first time any city has hosted the Olympics three times. ""In a sense, the Olympic Games are coming home tonight,"" he said. Excitement has been brewing in and around London for years, and it's been especially palpable in recent days. Katie Lawrence, a resident of the U.S. state of Georgia who holds dual U.S.-British citizenship, told CNN that she was hugely excited to be in London to watch the sporting extravaganza. ""I love the Olympic Games, I always have, always will. I'm always torn as to which team to root for, but I have no shame in rooting for both USA and GB,"" said Lawrence, who saw some of the 1996 Games in Atlanta as a child. ""I cannot wait to be immersed in all of the excitement and bustle that the Games bring."" CNN iReporter Kevin Dunscombe said he was ""very proud"" of London as the host city. ""I really felt the buzz of the Olympics when I walked through Trafalgar Square on my way home last night,"" he said Friday. ""The atmosphere was really electric and this is before the Games have actually begun!"" Are you there? Send us your images and videos of the Olympics . British newspaper headlines heralded Friday as the start of something truly special. ""Get the party started,"" read the Telegraph, while the Times of London hailed ""The world in one city."" The Guardian struck a more reflective note as London prepared to host the Games, saying, ""Time to find out who we are."" Records already broken and ticket-holders warned . Some 10,500 athletes are set to take part in the Games, the British government said. Some of them competed in advance of Friday night's formal kickoff, including members of multiple men's and women's football squads. All 128 competing archers also took part in a preliminary round at Lord's Cricket Ground in London to determine seedings for team and individual competitions. Three South Korean archers took the top three seeds in the men's individual round, with the winner, Im Dong-hyun -- who is legally classified as blind -- setting a world record in the process, according to the official website for the Games. Hundreds of people hoping to attend that event, however, were turned away after apparently being sold fake tickets and because of confusion about whether the event was open to the public, UK media reported. Read more on the gritty East End -- the London area hosting the Olympics . The London organizing committee said tickets had been neither advertised nor sold. ""We think we have made it very clear that this is not a free event, like the road races or marathon, which have been advertised as free events,"" the committee said in a statement. ""This is a ranking round and there is no spectator access at all. We are dealing with this at the venue, along with some people who have turned up with fake tickets purchased from a fraudulent website."" People are urged to ""be extremely cautious and vigilant when attempting to buy tickets and only purchase from an official source,"" the statement says. Video: British etiquette for London Games . U.S. politics becomes part of the story in London . Dozens of dignitaries from around the world attended Friday night's opening ceremony. They included U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, who met with members of Team USA at a breakfast Friday morning at the U.S. Olympic training facility. But it was her husband's presidential challenger this fall, Mitt Romney, who was making headlines. Read more: London prepares for an Olympics to remember . News reports picked up on the verbal to-and-fro between British Prime Minister David Cameron and the Republican U.S. presidential candidate, who appeared to question London's readiness while on a trip to England and then appeared to backtrack. ""You know it's hard to know just how well it will turn out,"" Romney said in an interview with NBC News on Wednesday evening. ""There are a few things that were disconcerting. The stories about the private security firm not having enough people, the supposed strike of the immigration and customs officials -- that obviously is not something which is encouraging."" A day later, in what sounded like a jab at Romney's own stewardship of the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City, Cameron appeared to draw a contrast between staging the Games in London versus Utah.

"(CNN) -- ""Try to imagine the situation,"" says Dezso Gyarmati, captain of Hungary's 1956 Olympic water polo team. ""A superpower destroys your country with weapons and tanks -- a country that has never asked for that power to be there. And after that revolution is crushed you have to face the representatives of that superpower."" The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 became the backdrop to one of the most famous contests in Olympic history, where blood spilled in the sporting arena came to symbolize the bloody struggle of a nation against a brutal oppressor, the former Soviet Union. The events at the Melbourne Games in December that year became known as the ""Blood in the Water"" match, but when Hungary's water polo team set off for Australia in early November, the possibility of freedom still hung over the streets of Budapest. Mass protests and fighting which erupted on October 23 had died down after a ceasefire was ordered, and Soviet armed forces were beginning their withdrawal. Gyarmati had taken part in the initial rally, leaving the team's training camp in the hills above Budapest to join protestors on the streets. But by the time they set foot on Australian soil, Gyarmati and his teammates were informed of a brutal turn of events as Soviet forces ruthlessly reasserted their grip on the Hungarian capital. More than 2,000 protesters were killed in the fighting, hundreds more were injured and many thousands were forced to flee the country. It proved to be a bloody prelude to a bruising semifinal showdown with the Soviet water polo team. Gyarmati recalls a tough, but generally disciplined match which turned sour in the closing moments when Soviet player Valentin Prokopov elbowed Hungary's star Ervin Zador in the face, cutting him below the eye. ""I told (Zador) to get out of the pool,"" Gyarmati recalled, ""but not where he was, but to swim across the pool to the grandstand with 8,000 people. ""By the time he'd swum over, the blood had trickled down onto his chest. He looked like he (had come out) from the butcher. The audience exploded."" The headline ""Cold War violence erupts at Melbourne Olympics"" ran the following day in the Sydney Morning Herald, which reported that many spectators left their seats in the stands, shouting abuse and spitting at the Russians. The image of Zador standing poolside, blood streaming down his torso, quickly gained a wider audience. It seized the imagination of a world shocked by the crushing of the Magyar uprising, while offering some crumbs of comfort to a traumatized nation as the Hungarians triumphed 4-0. The team went on to win in the final, beating Yugoslavia 2-1 to claim the nation's fourth Olympic gold in the competition. Zador, who didn't play in the final, never returned to Hungary, instead choosing to settle in the U.S. and become a swimming coach in California. The victory over the Soviets inspired the making of a documentary ""Freedom's Fury"" and a feature film ""Szabadsag, szerelem"" (""Children of Glory"") both released to mark the 50th anniversary in 2006. The documentary, co-produced by Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino, was narrated by seven-time Olympic champion Mark Spitz, who was coached by Zador as a youngster during the 1960s. The dramatic events in Melbourne form the centerpiece of a rich and proud heritage in the sport which has seen the Hungarians rack up nine Olympic golds, more than twice as many as any other nation. The ""Blood in the Water"" story continues to inspire and motivate Hungary's modern water polo heroes including Gergely Kiss, who grew up in dying years of communist rule. ""Beating the beast, the big enemy was such a great feeling for every Hungarian. It helped so much for the revolution,"" Kiss said. The 34-year-old was part of the Hungarian team which beat Russian opposition in the final at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, ending a 24-year gold medal drought. Further success followed at Athens in 2004 and in Beijing four years later. Kiss will be aiming for a record fourth straight gold at this year's London Olympics.","Hungary's water polo match with Soviet Union played against backdrop of revolution .

"(CNN) -- London 2012 Olympic organizers said Wednesday they oversold thousands of tickets for the synchronized swimming events at this summer's Games. The committee said it discovered the error while comparing final seating configurations at Olympic and Paralympic venues against the millions of ticket orders placed. They found that four synchronized swimming sessions were oversold. Organizers last month contacted around 3,000 customers who had applied for tickets to the four sessions and told them of the error. ""We are exchanging their synchronized swimming tickets for tickets in other sports that they originally applied for,"" a London 2012 spokesman said in a statement. It was not immediately clear whether the committee discovered oversold tickets in other events. The newly-built Aquatics Center, with its giant wave-like roof, is located at the Olympic Park and will play host to synchronized swimming and other water sports, including swimming and diving. The majority of spectators for those events will be seated in two temporary wings that will be taken down after the Games, the committee said. The London Olympics are scheduled to take place July 27 through August 12. The Paralympics go from August 29 to September 9.","The error affects four synchronized swimming events .

"(CNN) -- A police officer arrested Friday in Will County, Illinois, has been charged with one count of first-degree murder in connection with a two-state rural shooting rampage that left one man dead, authorities said. Brian E. Dorian, 37, an officer with the Lynwood Police Department, will probably face other charges, said Will County State's Attorney James W. Glasgow. In addition to the fatality, three people were wounded in the spree, which occurred south of Chicago. At a news conference Friday, authorities declined to provide a possible motive for the shootings, which occurred Tuesday. Dorian's first court hearing is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. He is being held on a probable cause warrant, and bail was set at $2.5 million, said Charles Pelkie, a spokesman for the Will County state's attorney's office. ""It's always law enforcement's worst nightmare when someone in the law enforcement community chooses to break the law,"" Glasgow said. ""It's critical that we act no differently in investigating a policeman than we would any lay person. No professional courtesies. No special treatment."" Dorian's father adamantly denied his son was involved. ""My son would never do that. They don't have the shooter. The shooter is still out there,"" John Dorian told CNN affiliate WLS in Chicago. Dorian, who WLS said has been on medical leave for an injured shoulder the past year, was taken into custody at his residence, said authorities, who added that evidence is being analyzed. A woman left the residence before the arrest. Dorian had four pit bulls with him when he was arrested, said Will County Sheriff Paul Kaupas. The shootings began about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday at a construction site near Beecher, Illinois. The gunman killed one worker at the site and wounded two others, police have said. An hour later and about 10 miles away in Lowell, Indiana, authorities believe the same gunman opened fire again -- this time on a local farmer. Keith Dahl was shot in the left shoulder, arm and elbow, and then was robbed. Dahl told Lake County (Indiana) Sheriff's Detective Robert Martinez that the gunman approached him on his farm and started a conversation about bees before beginning to shoot. The gunman was believed to be using a revolver -- possibly a Colt .38 caliber or .357 Magnum -- because no shell casings were found at either scene, Lake County Sheriff Rogelio ""Roy"" Dominguez said earlier. CNN's Kara Devlin contributed to this report.","Officer is charged with first-degree murder .

"London (CNN) -- The bill for staging the 2012 London Olympics and Paralympics is set to rise by nearly 20% to £11 billion ($17.2 billion) a UK government committee has warned. The £9.3 billion ($14.5 billion) of public money set aside for funding the Games is ""close to being used up"" according to a report published Friday by the British Parliament's public accounts committee. ""We are concerned about whether the running of the Games will be held within budget. Taking into account costs outside the package, the full cost to the public of the Games and legacy projects is already heading for around £11 billion,"" said Margaret Hodge MP, chair of the committee. Hodge said that the committee were ""particularly concerned"" with the rise in cost of security for the Games which has doubled from the 2010 estimate of £282 million ($442 million) to over £550 million ($862 million) by December 2011. The London Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) early estimate of a need for 10,000 security guards has now jumped to 23,700. ""It is staggering that the original estimates were so wrong,"" Hodge said. The committee also raised concerns about the Olympic stadium becoming ""a white elephant."" As yet, no takers have been found for the 80,000-capacity venue which is estimated to have cost nearly £500 million ($785 million) to build. A deal which would have seen West Ham Football Club move into the stadium after the Games collapsed in October 2011. A new tender process opened in December last year with interested parties required to submit full bids by March 23 2012. The committee also expressed concerns about the UK Government's legacy commitment. ""We were promised a strong Olympic legacy but the Government has chosen not to adopt the target of one million more people participating in sport by 2013,"" Hodge said. But Hugh Robertson, the government's minister for sport, rejected the committee's findings. ""What (the committee) has not done is made any allowance for the amount of money that comes back to the public purse once the land on the park has been sold,"" Robertson told the BBC. Should the committee's estimates be borne out, the projected cost of staging the Games will have almost trebled from an initial bid estimate of £4 billion ($6.3 billion). That figure was revised up to £9.3 billion in 2007. The Olympics and Paralympic Games get underway on July 27 and August 29 respectively.","London Olympics bill set to rise from £9.3 billion to around £11 billion according to new report .

"London (CNN) -- It's hard to imagine the president of the International Olympic Committee on the ""naughty step,"" forced to stay there until he had repented for his behavior. But that's more or less what has happened. Jacques Rogge had to ""clarify"" (in other words, backtrack on) his newsworthy comment that there was a ""question mark"" over the suitability of McDonald's and Coca-Cola as Olympic sponsors. Apparently he had actually first flagged his concerns four years ago, but the lure of sponsors' cash far outweighed any considerations about growing obesity levels ... and apparently still does. However, now Rogge is far from alone in questioning high-calorie, high-sugar fast food brands sponsoring the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Academy of Royal Medical Colleges made a high-profile intervention in April, specifically singling out sponsorship of the Games by junk food and fizzy drink firms as sending out the wrong health message. The London Assembly has also recently passed a motion calling for a ban on the sponsorship of the Games (and other sporting events) by such companies. Even the Financial Times, though not sharing that policy prescription, agrees Big Macs are not necessarily compatible with Olympic values and in an editorial backs changes to the way sponsors are selected and expected to behave. The media has, until now, been slow to pick up what health campaigners have understood for some time: there is public unease at some of the world's biggest junk food manufacturers using the Olympics to heavily promote their unhealthy products at every opportunity, and especially to children. In fact, one might expect sentiment against the company to fall further, now the torch relay -- with its super-sized Coca-Cola trucks and brightly dressed assistants handing out free Coke samples and merchandise to children and their parents -- has passed through Britain's streets. Parents' worries about advertising and sponsorship undermining their efforts to encourage their children to eat healthily are supported by academic research. A systematic review commissioned by the Food Standards Agency and more recent studies have concluded that junk food promotions to children influences their food preferences, purchasing behavior and consumption, increasing their risk of serious illness in childhood and later life. The situation is made worse by the nature of the Olympic sponsorship deals, which dictate the Games' experience for children far beyond the Olympic Park. The exclusive rights that McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Cadbury's have for branded food and soft drink products at the Games blocks brands and manufacturers which might offer healthier alternatives. Meanwhile, licensing agreements restrict the promotional use of the Olympic mascots Wenlock and Mandeville -- and thus access to their five-15-year-old target audience -- to these same official sponsors. Hence all the food tie-ins with the Olympic mascots are for chocolate and sweets. The sponsors try to sugar-coat their Olympic involvement with ever-grander sports and exercise schemes that they claim will make children more active. However, there is little evidence that these short-term pushes will have a lasting effect in increasing children's physical activity levels. Moreover, the companies cannot disguise one salient fact: no amount of free equipment and sporting initiatives will make unhealthy diets any less unhealthy. This is what makes McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Cadbury's such unsuitable Olympic sponsors. The Games are hugely valuable to the sponsors, which is why the merest sniff of unease from the IOC president is likely to provoke a fierce response, as they seek to protect their privileged position. The relationship should not be so imbalanced -- given that the IOC derives four times as much income from broadcasting rights as it does from sponsorship deals, it remains curiously reluctant to demand more from its global sponsors. Now is the time for the IOC to re-evaluate its policies and its highly-prized sponsorship deals. We must ensure that continued pressure from civil society will be felt by Jacques Rogge and his colleagues and give them the courage to make it happen. Four years' time may be too late -- not only for the waistlines and health of citizens in 2014 and 2016 Olympic hosts Russia and Brazil, but also those in the emerging markets of Africa and Asia where Coca-Cola and McDonald's are already ruthlessly exploiting opportunities to promote their products. CNN invited the sponsors named to respond to Malcolm Clark's argument: . Coca-Cola: ""As one of the longest, continuous sponsors of the Olympic Movement, we are proud that we are able to use our sponsorship to enable millions of people to experience the Games and believe we have a valid role to play. As well as sharing expertise, without the support of sponsors such as Coca-Cola, many National Olympic Committees would be unable to send athletes to compete. ""People consume many different foods and beverages, so no one single food or beverage alone is responsible for people being overweight or obese. We believe all of our drinks can be enjoyed as part of an active, healthy lifestyle that includes a sensible, balanced diet and regular physical activity. ""We are also helping people be physically active and our three-year partnership with StreetGames will connect 110,000 young people with sport and create a new generation of coaches. Coca-Cola sponsors more than 250 physical activity and nutrition education programs in more than 100 countries and we are committed to sponsoring a program in every country that we operate by the end of 2015."" Jill McDonald, CEO, McDonald's UK: ""As a popular restaurant with millions of families here in Britain, I know that parents care most about the quality of the food that we serve. They also expect us to behave responsibly in all that we do. Day in and day out we take those responsibilities seriously. ""Here in the UK we offer broad choice on our menu and clear, easy to understand information to help parents make the choices that are right for them and their children. We also have a long-term commitment to reducing fat, salt and sugar across our menu that has seen us cut the salt content of an average Happy Meal by 46% over the last 10 years and the sugar content by 31%. ""In our marketing we go beyond this country's stringent regulatory requirements by finding fun ways to promote fruit and vegetables to children alongside organic milk or non-carbonated drinks. We also support hundreds of grassroots sports and volunteering programs across the UK through our long-term association with football and the Olympics. We are proud of our involvement with London 2012 and the responsible role we are playing in helping to make it an enjoyable Games and a great success."" Cadbury's declined to comment.

"(CNN) -- Alexandre Vinokourov claimed Kazakhstan's first medal at the London Olympics with gold in Saturday's men's cycling road race. Much fancied home favorite Mark Cavendish finished a disappointing 29th as the British team struggled to meet pre-race expectations. Colombia's Rigoberto Uran took the silver, while bronze went to Alexander Kristoff from Norway. The 38-year-old Vinokourov, who served a two-year ban for blood doping between 2007 and 2009, announced after the race that he may retire from the sport after Wednesday's cycling time trial. ""I will still race in the time trial on Wednesday but I have the gold medal I wanted and after that I will consider retiring,"" said the Kazakh cyclist. World champion Cavendish had been strongly tipped to finally claim the Olympic medal that had eluded him at the 2008 Games in Beijing, where he was the only member of Britain's track cycling team to return from the games without a medal. Despite the British team having control of the peloton throughout the race, they struggled to close the gap on the lead group and Cavendish was nowhere in sight as Vinokourov out sprinted Uran to the finish line in front of Buckingham Palace. ""There was a group of 22 who got away and we couldn't pull them back,"" said Cavendish. ""I can be proud of how the lads rode. They have got nothing left in the tank. Cavendish's hopes appeared to have been boosted when rival Swiss sprinter Fabian Cancellara crashed, but the peloton could not close on the leading group. With just under 10km to the finish line -- and a handy time advantage of 50 seconds -- the leading pack looked to be preparing for a sprint finish, but Uran made a break for it, and surprisingly Vinokourov was the only rider to respond. As the two riders rounded the final corner, the Kazakh made the most of his rival slowing to look back to check for pursuers and launched a sprint to the line. It was quickly clear that the Colombian had no answer to the Kazakh's attack and Vinokourov had a big enough lead to ride across the line with his arms aloft.","Kazakhstan's Alexandre Vinokourov wins gold .

"(CNN)  -- The head of the Anglican church expressed regret Saturday for comments he made about the Irish Catholic Church, which included saying that the Irish Catholic Church has lost ""all credibility"" following the abuse scandal, his press office said. In an interview to be broadcast Monday, Archbishop Rowan Williams called the issue ""a colossal corporate trauma"" for the Catholic Church, especially in Ireland. ""An institution so deeply bound in to the life of society suddenly becoming -- suddenly losing all credibility,"" said Williams, the head of the Church of England. ""That's not just a problem for the church, it's a problem for everybody in Ireland, I think."" Diarmuid Martin, the archbishop of Dublin, said he was ""stunned"" and ""discouraged"" by Williams' remarks. Pope's preacher compares abuse fury to anti-Semitism . Later Saturday, Williams and Martin spoke by telephone and the Archbishop of Canterbury expressed regret that the comments were made, Lambeth Palace's press office told CNN. ""The church itself continues to work tirelessly to tackle the issue of abuse,"" the office said. It was not immediately clear how Martin responded. Williams made the comments about the Irish Catholic Church on the BBC radio program ""Start the Week,"" airing Monday, as part of a general discussion about religion. Ireland has been rocked by a series of child abuse reports, both physical and sexual, by Catholic clergy going back at least seven decades. In his statement Saturday, Martin said that he has addressed the reports. ""As Archbishop of Dublin, I have been more than forthright in addressing the failures of the Catholic Church in Ireland,"" Martin said in a statement. ""I still shudder when I think of the harm that was caused to abused children. I recognise that their Church failed them."" However, Martin added that priests and parents are working to renew the Irish Catholic Church and remain committed to the faith. ""Archbishop Williams' comments will be for them immensely disheartening and will challenge their faith even further,"" Martin said. ""Those working for renewal in the Catholic Church in Ireland did not need this comment on this Easter weekend and do not deserve it."" A recent Irish government-backed report found the Archdiocese of Dublin and other Irish Catholic church authorities covered up abuse by priests from 1975 to 2004, and that child sexual abuse was widespread then. Two Irish bishops have resigned over the scandal, and Pope Benedict XVI issued a pastoral letter to the Irish church last month saying he was deeply sorry for the abuse. In his letter, the pope said ""misplaced concern"" for the Catholic Church's reputation and the avoidance of scandal contributed to the problems. Williams said that has been a lesson for the Anglican church as well. ""I guess that for an awful lot of Christian institutions, until fairly recently, the default setting would be, 'We've got to try and hang on to the institution's credibility,'"" Williams told the BBC. ""We've learned that that is damaging, it's wrong, it's dishonest, and it requires that very hard recognition which ought to be ... natural for the Christian church, based as it is on repentance and honesty. ""We've had to learn, well, honesty and truthfulness are the only way in which we can survive in any way as an institution."" The pope plans to visit England and Scotland in September, but Williams said that will not be a ""big deal"" for the Church of England. ""The pope will be coming here to Lambeth Palace,"" Williams told the BBC, referring to the archbishop's historic London residence. ""We'll have the bishops together to meet him. I'm concerned that he has a chance to say what he wants to say in and to British society, that we welcome him as a valued partner, and that's about it."" It will be the pope's first state visit to the United Kingdom, according to the British Foreign Office. A 1982 trip by Pope John Paul II was officially a pastoral visit. Relations between the Anglican and Catholic churches have been strained following the Vatican's outreach to disaffected Anglicans last year. The plan would enable groups of Anglicans to become Catholic and recognize the pope as their leader, yet have parishes that retain Anglican rites, Vatican officials said. Some observers said the Vatican's move would shatter more than 40 years of efforts to reconcile the two churches. The move came 475 years after King Henry VIII broke from Rome and created the Church of England, the forerunner of the Anglican Communion.","NEW: Archbishop Rowan Williams apologizes for saying Irish Catholic Church as lost ""all credibility"" in scandal .

"New York (CNN) -- A federal magistrate judge has ruled that al Qaeda, the Taliban, Iran and Hezbollah should pay more than $6 billion in damages to the families of victims killed on September 11, 2001, for supporting the attacks. The move is considered a symbolic gesture without expectation of collection of penalties for the relatives. Federal Magistrate Judge Frank Maas made the ruling Monday, after federal Judge George Daniels decided last year that the militant groups and Iran were liable. The initial filing made in 2003 had identified Iraq for its purported role in supporting the attacks, though attorneys withdrew it as a defendant when authorities later considered those claims unfounded. Iran also has maintained that it was not involved in the 9/11 attacks. ""I think the claim that (Iran) is complicit is a big one,"" said CNN Security Analyst Peter Bergen. ""There's a difference between acquiescence and complicity."" The 9/11 Commission Report mentions contact between al Qaeda and Iran-supported Hezbollah militants, which are based largely in southern Lebanon, where they received training and advice. The report also pointed to Iranian border inspectors who were told not to stamp the passports of al Qaeda members and who had facilitated travel of the would-be hijackers. But the report also stated that ""we have found no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah was aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack."" In October, 2011, Maas determined that al Qaeda should face $9.3 billion in penalties for the businesses and properties destroyed and damaged in the 2001 attacks.","A judge rules that al Qaeda, the Taliban, Iran and Hezbollah should pay billions in damages .

"(CNN) -- On a sunny day at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center in Pasadena, California, in 1991, photographer Kirk Weddle was setting up to shoot what would become an iconic image in rock music. Spencer Elden was chosen from pictures of 12 babies to grace Nirvana?s ""Nevermind"" CD cover. Weddle's close friend, artist and designer Rick Elden, remembers that day well because he had brought his 4-month-old son to the pool for Weddle to shoot. Weddle had been tapped to create the cover for what would become Nirvana's breakthrough album ""Nevermind."" ""We went to the same college together,"" Elden said of his friendship with Weddle. ""We were tight buddies and we'd been through a lot together."" To hear Elden tell it, the shoot was just another job in a long string of photo shoots for musical acts during his association with Weddle. ""Keep in mind we shot the Temptations, and so many bands,"" he said. On the day of the Nirvana shoot, Weddle was said to be working on an idea dreamed up by the band's relatively unknown frontman, Kurt Cobain, Elden said. ""Rumor had it that Cobain had the original concept of wanting to show a mother giving birth under water,"" Elden said. ""but the compromise was to have a baby swimming under water. Or so that's what I was told."" A dozen infants including Elden's first-born son Spencer were signed up for the photo shoot in the pool that week. On that particular day only Spencer was scheduled to swim for Weddle. Read more about what Spencer Elden is doing now . The boy was in good hands, said Elden, a certified lifeguard. And even at 4 months, Spencer was a good swimmer, he said. However, ""if you don't pull them up, they will drown,"" he joked. ""There's tricks to it: You blow in the kid's face and it creates a gag reflex. Infants have a gag reflex, as we all do. You hold him up really close to your face. You blow into him really hard. They gasp, and into the water they go."" Weddle then shot just 18 frames, according to Elden. ""We only had a half a second"" before the shoot was over and little Spencer was plucked from the water. ""Boom, boom, boom. End of story,"" he said. ""We got paid $200.""

"(CNN) -- According to Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, it is payback time for Greece. Despite being forced to ""clarify"" her comments after a furious reaction from thousands of Greeks on Facebook, there will, she emphasized, be no softening of the demands the stricken country will have to meet if it is to receive further aid. But what if Greece simply can't manage payback? As prescribed by the IMF itself, the normal remedy for a country that can't pay its debts would be devaluation and default. Locked in the eurozone, these options are not available. No one denies that the Greeks have very largely brought this disaster on their own heads. But, as anyone who has been there recently knows, they are now paying an excruciatingly heavy price for their past misdeeds. The public sector has seen its pay cut by an average of 40% over the last year, and most pensions have been reduced. In what is left of the private sector things are even worse, especially for those who have lost their jobs in the downturn and the young, 50% of whom are now unemployed. For them, when work can be found, the going rate is often half what it was before the crisis. Yet petrol, food and clothes all cost more than they do in Britain. Amazingly for Greece, even taxes are getting harder to evade. The property tax on many homes has trebled. Because it is levied via electricity bills, the only way to avoid it is to go without power. As the economy continues to shrink under the impact of austerity at home and recession abroad, it is little wonder that anxiety about the outcome of next month's poll extends far beyond Greece itself. We read a lot about the thuggish extreme-right party, Golden Dawn. But it is the rise of the left-wing Syriza grouping and its charismatic young leader, Alexis Tsipras, that has really got the markets and the European Union establishment rattled. To them, Tsipras is dangerous because he has pledged to tear up his country's controversial bailout pact with Brussels, despite saying he wants the country to stay within the euro. But he stands almost alone among leading European politicians in his ability to spell out two basic truths. Firstly, if the EU really wants to push Greece out of the euro, it should have prepared the way months, if not years ago, rather than leaving it to the last minute. Secondly, the sacrifices being demanded of Tsipras's countrymen are financially and politically impossible. There is no longer any point in pretending otherwise. Last week, Europe's assembled leaders once again told the Greeks that they should view the elections on June 17 as a referendum on whether or not they are going to stay in the euro. The not-very-subtle threat is that if they back Tsipras, they will be out on their ear. But, as the man himself frequently points out, if the new election is really to be treated as a referendum, the question won't just be whether Greece should stay in the euro. With the single currency in its present fragile state, it could very easily become whether the eurozone itself survives. Is this really something the rest of Europe wants Greece to decide? And even if the Greeks vote the way Europe tells them to, what will have been achieved? Everybody knows that the fundamentals won't have changed. The likelihood is that there will only be another crisis -- probably even bigger -- six months down the road. Seen in this light, Tsipras's demand that the EU should instead help them to find a realistic way to stay in the single currency suddenly begins to make sense. After leading in the opinion polls at the start of the campaign, the latest surveys have Syriza slipping behind the right wing New Democracy for what looks set to be another tight finish. The pressure from abroad may be beginning to have an effect. But given the mess both Greece and the euro are in, the threat that Athens could yet call the eurozone's bluff won't go away. That genie is now well and truly out of the bottle, whoever wins next month. This article is based on one that first appeared on theweek.co.uk, the website of Britain's biggest selling current affairs magazine The Week.

"(CNN) -- Two teenage girls from Great Britain will fly home Thursday after spending a year behind bars in Ghana for drug-smuggling, the British High Commission in the west African country said. The girls were stopped by customs officials at Accra trying to smuggle drugs back to Britain. Ghanaian police arrested the teenagers, identified as Yasemin Vatansever and Yatunde Diya, in July 2007 as they prepared to board a British Airways flight to London. When officials searched their laptop bags as part of departure formalities, they found about 13 lbs (6 kg) of cocaine. The girls, now 17, were 16 at the time of their arrest. They faced a maximum sentence of three years. UK media have named the girls as Yatunde Diya and Yasemin Vatansever of north London. In January, a juvenile court in Ghana sentenced the pair to nine months in jail for trying to smuggle cocaine out of the country. At the time, a British Foreign Office spokesman said the teens would not have to serve the full sentence because they had already spent more than six months in custody. But soon afterward, Ghanaian authorities changed their minds. The girls were housed in a correctional home for girls in the country's capital, Accra. Fair Trials International, a UK-based group that provided legal assistance to the pair, called the girls ""pawns in a larger operation."" Authorities in Ghana had said a man paid the girls £6,000 (about $11,700) to fly to Ghana to retrieve the laptop bags containing the drugs from two of his associates, according to the country's national news agency. Those men have not been caught. ""The girls have served their full sentences, but the men who groomed them and lured them to Ghana remain free to target other vulnerable young women,"" said Catherine Wolthuizen, Fair Trials' chief executive, in a statement this week. Ghana and other West African countries have become a transit point for drugs headed to Europe. The girls were arrested in a joint Britain-Ghana drug detection operation, the UK's customs agency said Wednesday.

"Washington (CNN) -- The day before Mitt Romney makes a highly publicized trip to Israel, President Barack Obama on Friday signed a bill passed by Congress designed to increase security ties with the Jewish state. Both the timing of Friday's event and the presence of TV cameras opened the White House to accusations of political maneuvering in a presidential election year. Obama's schedule for this week, distributed by the White House on July 20, made no mention of the signing of the United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act. The measure won final approval from Congress on July 17, receiving strong bipartisan support. White House spokesman Jay Carney denied any political intent with the timing of the bill signing, saying the measure passed last week and Obama was traveling from Sunday to Wednesday. ""The president's been on the road, and today was the day to sign it,"" he said Friday. Romney, the certain Republican presidential nominee, hammered Obama's Middle East policy in a recent speech to a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention. In particular, he accused Obama of failing to fully support Israel, an accusation the White House strongly denies. In signing the measure Friday, Obama spoke of the ""unshakeable commitment"" of his government to Israel's security and announced a previously authorized $70 million in U.S. funding for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system. Carney said Obama directed the Iron Dome funding in May and the money was transferred ""in recent days,"" leading to the announcement Friday in conjunction with the signing of the bill. ""This is a program that has been critical in terms of providing security and safety for Israeli families,"" Obama said of the Iron Dome system. ""It is a program that has been tested and has prevented missile strikes inside of Israel. And it is testimony of the leadership of folks sitting here that we are going to be able to lock in that funding to make sure that program continues and that we are standing by our friends In Israel when it comes to these kinds of attacks."" He also announced that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta would travel to Israel soon to discuss additional ways the two nations can cooperate on defense and security issues. A White House document issued after the event emphasized the steps Obama has taken as president in support of Israel to emphasize his commitment to Israel's security. Obama easily won the Jewish vote in 2008, but his sometimes strained relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have raised concerns among pro-Israel Americans. The act Obama signed Friday reaffirms ""unwavering commitment to the security of the State of Israel as a Jewish state"" and calls for providing Israel with ""the military capabilities necessary to deter and defend itself against any threat or possible combination of threats."" It also pledges a U.S. veto of ""any one-sided anti-Israel resolutions at the United Nations Security Council"" and outlines U.S. support for an expanded Israeli role in NATO, increased intelligence cooperation and increased training for Israel's air force. The event reinforced the Obama administration's support for strong ties with Israel as his GOP rival prepares to meet with Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders in a visit that begins Saturday. Such preempting of messages and events is a time-tested trick of campaign politics. For example, Romney's campaign has scheduled regular conference calls with reporters and events with surrogates on the same day, and often in the same city, as Obama campaign events. At the signing, Obama was flanked by the two California Democrats who were sponsors -- Sen. Barbara Boxer and Rep. Howard Berman -- as well as top figures of American Jewish organizations. CNN's Lesa Jansen contributed to this report.","The measure enhances security ties between the two allies .

"(CNN) -- Larry, one of the employees you supervise, hasn't been performing his job up to expectations. But you've been reluctant to take him aside and speak with him candidly: Like most senior people in the company, you are white. What if Larry, who is black, takes your criticism the wrong way or, worse, thinks you are racist? The last thing you want is for others to think your actions were influenced by race. So you've held off talking to him about performance issues that you'd likely have raised with your non-minority employees. You're relieved that a potentially thorny situation was averted, even pleased with your capacity to be so racially sensitive. But in fact, recent research suggests, you have not done your company, your employee, or yourself much good. However well-intentioned, striving to create the appearance of colorblindness by sidestepping the specter of race can be more of an obstacle than an asset to good management practice. Read more: Is your boss a psychopath? It's easy to understand the appeal of colorblindness: it seems to offer a relatively easy way to handle complicated and often divisive issues of race in business and broader society: after all, if we don't notice race, we can't act in a biased manner on that basis, right? Yet social psychological research shows that far from being a panacea, turning a blind eye to the realities and complexities of race can create more problems than it solves. It can even stand in the way of creating constructive and equitable race-related policies. You can pretend that race doesn't matter or that you don't ""see"" race, but quite often neither claim is accurate. In fact, research in social neuroscience suggests that people perceive others' race almost instantly (typically in less than one-seventh of a second). Rather than feeling reassured or comforted by your ability to avoid the race issue, consider that, according to research, minority employees like Larry are actually more (not less) distrustful of people who fail to acknowledge the elephant in the roomâ€”raceâ€”than they are of individuals who openly talk about it. Avoiding race can not only undermine minorities' impression of you, but also can make it harder for them to get better at their jobs. Managers who are petrified by the looming issue of race and the potential of appearing prejudiced can make the mistake of not giving the type of critical feedback to minority team members that they readily offer to white team members. I've seen this dynamic play out in a class activity I conduct in which students work in teams and then offer feedback to help one another strengthen their skills. It became clear to me that white students were not giving the same level of critical feedback to minorities as they were to white team members. Other studies have identified similar experiences among teachers and students: Teachers were not as likely to give critical feedback when grading a paper to black students because they did not want to be seen as insensitive. How do you expect those students -- and Larry -- to improve if no one's willing to give them the critical feedback that challenges them to do so? Read more: find your superpower . I'm not suggesting that as a manager, you walk into the office and point out a co-worker's background. But being more authentic and transparent about race can make people more relaxed in the workplace. Sometimes race clearly is relevant, and not talking about it can actually make things more awkward. Skilled managers need to be able to create a cohesive, trusting team climate in which people are able to acknowledge that John is black, Mary is older, and Steve is gay. It doesn't mean that such factors need to or should be in the forefront of discussion, but they shape who we are as people; allowing them to fester without acknowledgement can impede the effectiveness and openness of group discussions and teamwork. The fact of the matter is that women and minorities often experience organizational life differently. Perceptive managers understand that keeping their team happy and productive means recognizing this. The argument isn't that race should be overvalued, but rather that it should be a topic that is OK to acknowledge and discuss. Ironically, attempts to demonstrate how colorblind we are or how inconsequential race is in the workplace only illustrate how significant these issues really are. We're just not able to admit as much. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Evan P. Apfelbaum.","Trying to ignore race in the workplace can do more harm than good, says Evan Apfelbaum .
He says research suggests that people perceive others' race almost instantly .

"(CNN) -- To look at her, you'd never know Jessica Ordona, 25, has a problem with her jeans. ""I don't like the fact that when you sit down, your stomach comes over them,"" she says. Jessica Ordona (in white) disliked the fit of her jeans, so she signed up for a  class she says addressed the issue. A retail specialist with a commercial real estate firm in Bethesda, Maryland, Ordona knows image is part of success. That's why she has been diligent about hitting the gym four to five times a week. But even with all her crunches and lifting, she sometimes experienced denim frustration. Unhappy with her former gym, Ordona decided to join a national health club chain in her neighborhood. Much to her surprise, she found a class called  Skinny Jeans Workout, specifically designed to get rid of those annoying little bulges and bumps. ""It's different than your typical workout class,"" she says. ""It's not high-impact cardio, but you're sweating the whole time because you're working every muscle group."" The Skinny Jeans Workout concentrates on core muscles, balance and posture. A cross between ballet, butt-burning stretches and light weight lifting, the workout involves the entire body. Lisa Grimmer, a group fitness instructor, teaches the class. ""What I love about Skinny Jeans is it takes everything from Pilates -- the core workout, which would be the tightening around of your abdominal muscles, your lower back. People think of that as ""the core."" But there's also the shoulder girdle, which we work out a lot in Skinny Jeans, too,"" says Grimmer. ""So really we're thinking about anything that would be postural or placed into your jeans, so you've got your abdominals, of course, and we work the inner and outer thighs that go into the jeans."" The hourlong class is taught twice a week. Regulars swear they've dropped a jeans size or two since the class began four months ago. They say it not only tightens the tush, but the workout also helps develop the flexibility and strength to hold the back straight. Tracy Cherpeski Bannister, another class instructor, believes posture is key to fitting into tight pants. ""In addition to sort of holding it in, we're also lifting and lengthening and, as we do that, we sort of set our shoulders into place,"" Bannister says. ""I probably said it in class -- we 'tuck our shoulder blades into our back pockets' -- so we're opening the chest as well.""   Listen to Jessica talk about the class » . Bannister says so many of us spend portions of our day stressed, at our computer or rounded forward while driving. ""So this is a good way to kind of set the body back up. ... It makes everything more efficient,"" she says. The class is usually taught in bare feet, for maximum balance. It forces ""our bodies to be smarter,"" says Bannister. She reasons that by freeing up your feet, you have to use your brain as well. ""You have to think and feel what's happening. If you don't [go barefoot], then it's not a waste of time, but you don't get as much out of it as maybe you should.""  Watch Skinny Jeans class participants in action » . But like any exercise program, it's important to take it slowly. ""Any time you begin a new workout, you need to avoid doing too much, too soon. You don't want to go from zero to 60 in 10 seconds,"" says Dr. David Johnson, an orthopedic surgeon at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. ""One of the worst things a person can do is start exercising, overdo it, get hurt and become discouraged. You should look to your instructor for guidance and make sure that person is keyed in to your fitness level."" Johnson likes the concept of the workout. ""Exercises that develop the core muscles are important,"" he says. ""Not only does core strength decrease waist size, it increases your energy and endurance, which make it easier to engage in other physical activities such as golf, tennis -- even shopping for another pair of skinny jeans."" The Skinny Jeans Workout and other programs similar to it can be found at health clubs across the country. While the specifics of the workouts may vary, depending on the health club, the goal is pretty much the same: It's all about zipping yourself up into the smallest jeans in your closet. ""You do it right, you do it a few times, and then you're set,"" Grimmer says. ""My clients love it. ...They all come to the class, and they've seen such great results. I've had people go down sizes in jeans; I've had people tighten up. ... They're standing up a little bit taller, and everything's straighter and very proud.""","Skinny Jeans Workout tones core muscles so gym-goers can zip their skinny jeans .

"(CNN) -- Senegal's reward for qualifying for their first Olympic men's football competition is an opening match against hosts Britain, who could include former England captain David Beckham in their team. Senegal beat Oman in a playoff in Coventry on Monday to claim the last place in the 16-team draw for the Olympic competition, which begins July 26. In the draw completed Tuesday at Wembley, Senegal and Great Britain were drawn in Group A alongside Uruguay and the United Arab Emirates. Brazil, who are seeking their first men's football gold, were put in Group C with Egypt, Belarus and New Zealand. Defending champions Argentina failed to qualify. In the women's competition, Brazil and Britain were drawn together. Defending champions United States are in Group G with France, Colombia and North Korea. The games will take place at stadiums across Britain, with the finals to be held at Wembley. Britain will be competing in an Olympic football tournament for the first time since 1960. The national associations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland still oppose the plan because they fear it will threaten their independence. ""They're in a very tough group,"" world football expert James Montague told CNN World Sport. ""All of these teams look at the Olympic tournament in a very different way to the way the British do. ""There's been a lot of controversy over the British team, a lot of opposition to it. There isn't enough unity for the British team to thrive. A team like the UAE have had 10 qualifying games already and they've actually built a team. The Great Britain team only have a long list of 80 players -- they haven't played any games at all."" The 36-year-old Beckham has made no secret of his ambition to play a part in the British squad as one of the three permitted overage players in what is otherwise an Under-23 tournament. British coach Stuart Pearce said he will only select the midfielder if his form is good enough -- and not as recognition of Beckham's ambassadorial role. Pearce plans to visit the United States to watch Beckham play for LA Galaxy in the MLS. ""He's been a great ambassador but that's no guarantee he'll get in the squad,"" Pearce said. ""I'm picking on form and merit alone."" Britain will kick off the tournament against Senegal at Old Trafford on July 26 before playing the UAE at Wembley three days later and Uruguay in Cardiff on 1 August. Brazil are expected to include 20-year-old Santos star Neymar in their squad. They will play in Cardiff, Manchester and Newcastle. The Brazilian women's team could include five-time world player of their year Marta as they look to win gold for the first time, having lost the final to the U.S. in 2004 and 2008. ""The big game I'm looking forward to is the holders United States against North Korea,"" Montague said. ""North Korea have a fantastic women's side who have done very well in previous World Cups and Olympics. That's going to be the crunch game. ""Great Britain against Brazil will also be fantastic -- especially if the Brazilians take Marta along as well."" DRAWS . Men's: . Group A: Great Britain, Senegal, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay .

"(CNN) -- If all goes according to plan, cancer survivor Kyle Garlett will compete in October's Ford Ironman World Championship, a grueling triathlon made up of a 2.4-mile ocean swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and a 26.2-mile run. Heart transplant recipient and cancer survivor Kyle Garlett will compete in October's Ironman World Championship. And he'll do it with another man's heart pumping in his chest. ""I don't think there's anybody who wouldn't consider me a success story and a survivor,"" Garlett said. His medical issues began in 1989 when he received his first Hodgkin's disease diagnosis as a high school senior. In 1995, during his third battle with the cancer, doctors ceased his chemotherapy treatment when they discovered it had weakened his heart. Two years later, Garlett learned he had secondary leukemia as a result of chemotherapy to treat the Hodgkin's, and three more years of chemotherapy ensued. And after five years on the waiting list, he received a new heart in 2006. Now, the 37-year-old savors his body's capabilities. ""It's kind of like the starving person who all of a sudden finds himself in front of a buffet. And now I've got the buffet. I've got my all-you-can-eat plate, and I'm just loading it up,"" Garlett said. A heart transplant may seem extremely daunting, but Garlett saw it as a more hopeful operation than his years of cancer treatments. ""Going in for chemotherapy, as a patient you know what's happening. Your body is being poisoned and you know that when you come out on the other side of it, you're going to have given up something,"" said Garlett, a sportswriter and motivational speaker living in Marina del Rey, California. ""On the heart transplant, though, it was completely the opposite. I knew that from the day of the transplant on, every day I'd be getting stronger. And they were now doing something that was going to fix me, improve my life."" Garlett, who says he's ""not a klutz"" but ""definitely not a natural athlete,"" trains about 15 hours a week for October's Ironman in Kona, Hawaii. Closer to race time, he expects to spend 20 to 25 hours a week in intense training to achieve his goal of finishing within the 17-hour time limit. Garlett was invited to compete in the elite event because organizers believe he ""demonstrates the Ironman mantra: Anything is possible,"" said Blair LaHaye, director of communications for Ironman. LaHaye said a handful of athletes are invited to take part in the event each year, but their inclusion doesn't reduce the number of slots for those who get in by doing well in qualifying events, or by winning a spot through the Ironman lottery.  Garlett will compete in a half-Ironman or other long-distance event before Kona to validate his selection. The training and competition are demanding enough for competitors without health issues. But being a heart transplant patient comes with the extra challenge of getting the organ to beat at an acceptable rate. ""When the old heart comes out, all the nerves are severed. And when the donor heart comes in, the nerves are not connected,"" explained Dr. Jon Kobashigawa, medical director of the UCLA Heart Transplant Program, where Garlett is a patient. In a person whose heart is intact, ""the brain will tell the heart, 'Let's go, start exercising, let's start beating faster,' "" Kobashigawa said. A donor heart, however, relies on circulating adrenaline in order to get it going. As a result, heart transplant recipients must warm up thoroughly to get their heart pumping properly. The ""denervated"" heart works about 80 to 90 percent as well as a normal heart, Kobashigawa said, ""but through exercise, these patients who do strenuous activities, I believe, do get their exercise capacity almost to the normal range, if not normal."" It's also possible, doctors say, for the donor heart to re-innervate -- or grow nerves onto the donor heart. Following in his footsteps . Garlett is on a trail blazed by Dwight Kroening, the first heart transplant recipient to complete the Ironman, last year in Canada. Kroening, now 49, got a new heart in 1986 after his swelled to about twice its normal size for unknown reasons. He was 26 at the time -- a gym teacher, coach and athlete. At first, running with his students became a struggle. Within days, he couldn't walk up a flight of stairs without stopping to rest. Soon, combing his hair and brushing his teeth became too taxing, he said. When doctors examined him as a candidate for a heart transplant, they told him his heart was working at 8 percent of its normal capacity and he probably had about two months to live. Kroening began exercising a week after the surgery, but soon discovered he was incapable of athletic activities that required sprinting, he said. ""I [told my doctors], there's something wrong here. I'm not able to do these things. And they said, 'Of course not,' "" Kroening said. ""So being me, I was more or less bound and determined to prove that they were wrong, that I could actually train myself to be able to do these things,"" he said. But overcoming those hurdles wasn't easy, even after 22 years of practice. Three-quarters of the way into the Ironman's bicycle leg, Kroening felt ill and fatigued, he said. He questioned whether he would be able to finish. He did, in 15½ hours -- one hour longer than his target.  Watch Kroening compete in the Ironman » . ""When we test [heart transplant recipients] on the treadmill, their peak heart rate is around 140 beats [per minute] and they can maintain that for one minute. ... When Dwight did the Ironman, we recorded his heart rate, and he was able to exercise at a heart rate of 133 beats per minute for 15½ hours,"" said Mark Haykowsky, a professor of rehab medicine at Canada's University of Alberta. Haykowsky studied Kroening for research on exercise habits of heart transplant recipients. Since the Ironman, Kroening has competed in other events, including a marathon and a triathlon. He may compete in another Ironman next year in Arizona, the state where he received his heart transplant. ""I relate [the Ironman] to what I guess would be like childbirth,"" Kroening said. ""In the process, you're thinking, 'I'll never do this again in my whole life. This is absolutely crazy.' But I think probably about three days later that I started thinking, 'Now this might be something that I might want to do again.' "" 'The ultimate price' Both Garlett and Kroening say promoting organ donation motivates them to compete in these endurance challenges. Kroening also says he wants to make the most of his ""orphaned"" heart. ""I wish I could meet my donor family and ... thank them personally,"" Kroening said. ""[I want to let them] know for 23 years, I've been taking good care of their son's heart."" Garlett, too, recognizes his donor's family, who provided the heart of a 42-year-old construction worker who died on the job. ""I never lost sight of the fact that that moment for my family of great joy was only going to be coming ... with somebody else having to pay the ultimate price like that,"" Garlett said. ""And that always was in my head, and this man who gave me his heart would always be with me.""","Cancer survivor and transplant recipient Kyle Garlett will compete in Kona triathlon .

"(CNN) -- Who knew that fighting breast cancer for the third time in seven years would reveal my purpose in life. Triple negative breast cancer survivor hopes her story will inspire other people to ""live in the now."" I have never felt better about my life than now. My mantra each morning when I wake up, during the day between tasks, and at night before I go to bed is, ""All is well! Everything in this situation is working for my highest good and from this situation only good will come. All is well!""  After a right breast mastectomy with large margins excised due to cancer spread within the dermas, muscle from the back was removed to place on the chest wall and a skin graft from my right thigh. I was left with huge scaring both outside and within. The most regrettable loss was never being able to have reconstructive surgery to replace what I thought defined me as an attractive and sexy woman. After healing remarkably fast and well, I had to get back what I'd lost in order to move on and feel good about myself once again. First of all, I had to start looking at myself in the mirror with no clothes for longer than a second. I massaged my chest with special creams and oils everyday which forced me to look at the area and monitor its healing. After the healing was complete, I had to shop for a breast prosthetic. Wow, that was when my purpose in life was revealed!  Spencer shares her experiences with cancer » . I was given a prescription for a custom prosthesis and sent to an orthotics and prosthetics center where I was caught off guard by a prosthetic professional who sized me up when I walked in the door. ""You're not going to like what I have to show you,"" she said.  Confused and somewhat disappointed I asked, ""What do you mean?""   Well, she defined me by my professional attire and assumed the off-the-shelf prosthesis would not meet my expectations. She was right. After showing me what was available she suggested I look at a couple of custom breast prosthetic products she recommended. I thanked her for her honesty and help and went to investigate. After doing my homework on several companies, I chose one that actually used a plaster mold to fit me. I was disappointed to say the least and am currently wearing an off the shelf prosthesis that fits in a special bra or can be worn with a special sock or sleeve in a regular bra. Needless to say, the custom prosthesis was not as ""custom"" as I thought it would be. I said to myself there has to be a better product and at least more options available for women. My purpose in life is to provide women in need options for a better product and/or create and develop a product that meets the specifications of each and every woman no matter their size, amount of area, or specific shade or hue.  That is why I created a breast prosthesis called AugMe that focuses on specific color matching and contours from skin to prosthesis. I work for a large media corporation so my insurance paid for the custom prosthesis that cost $4,000.   However, for those women who don't have private insurance, Medicare does not cover custom breast prosthesis. Until Medicare changes their policy to cover custom breast prosthesis, there will be little demand for AugMe or any other custom product.   I have now joined forces with Dr. Susan Cassidy, the CEO of another custom prosthetic company, CountourMed, to hopefully change Medicare's policy. We are currently awaiting their decision after presenting letters from breast cancer professionals and organizations as well as seeking congressional attention. I am a triple negative breast cancer survivor. I hope that through my story, others will be inspired to ""live in the now"" and love every moment of it. I recently found out about Dr. Lisa Newman's annual trips to Ghana where she performs surgery on women with triple negative breast cancer. I asked her if she could use breast prosthesis for her patients. She was overwhelmed and said that she currently takes only a few and how helpful and meaningful that would be for her patients in Ghana.  Doctor travels to Ghana for cancer clues »  Well I'm sure you can assume that I am now on another journey to provide breast prostheses for those women in Ghana as well as women here in the United States. I am often asked do I wonder why ""I've"" been diagnosed with breast cancer and the answer is so obvious to me. Of course I know why. If it weren't for my diagnosis of breast cancer, I would be feeling sorry for others and fearful of what may happen to me. How selfish and non productive.  Now I waste no time feeling sorry for myself or others and I make sure every moment is spent making a positive impact on all those I encounter. It's not about how much time you have, it's about what you're doing with that time. I choose to spend it making people with breast cancer, happy. If you have had a mastectomy due to breast cancer and reconstruction is not an option, tell me your story and hopefully I can help you. Go to www.augmefoundation.com. You can also go to the site to make a donation to provide breast prostheses for women in Ghana.","Dawn Spencer has been battling a rare, aggressive form of breast cancer .

"(CNN) -- Former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky will appeal his convictions on numerous counts of child sexual abuse, a member of his defense team says. After a trial that featured emotional and often graphic testimony from eight of Sandusky's victims, jurors late Friday convicted him of 45 of the 48 sexual abuse counts he faced, involving a total of 10 victims. Painful chapter closes with Sandusky conviction . The eight victims who testified, now young men, said that they were boys when Sandusky forced them to engage in sexual acts with him. The acts occurred, they said, in showers in Penn State's athletic facilities; hotel rooms; and the basement of Sandusky's home, among other places. The abuse spanned more than 15 years. Praise for victims, jurors after Sandusky verdict . After being found guilty, Sandusky, 68, was taken immediately to the jail in Centre County, Pennsylvania. Judge John Cleland said Friday he will be sentenced in about 90 days. He likely will be sentenced to serve the rest of his life behind bars. iReport: Share your reaction . Sandusky's defense team plans to file a motion for appeal, claiming he had ineffective counsel, defense attorney Karl Rominger said Sunday. Under Pennsylvania law, that motion cannot be filed until after sentencing. If Cleland agrees to a hearing on the motion, lead defense attorney Joe Amendola would step aside and appear as a witness, the attorney said. Rominger said either he or another attorney would argue the motion. The appellate claim will be based on Amendola's ""talking to the media,"" Rominger said. And a linchpin of the appeal will be prosecutor Joe McGettigan's statements during his closing argument, when he told jurors that Sandusky could have proclaimed his innocence during an interview with NBC's Bob Costas. That violates Sandusky's right to post-arrest trial silence, Rominger said. Rominger said he will ask Cleland to sentence Sandusky to serve concurrent sentences, with the maximum being 20 years. At the very least, he said, he hopes to get Cleland to acknowledge the good works Sandusky has done in his life. Sandusky has a right to speak during sentencing, something Rominger said will be discussed in the coming weeks. Rominger said on Saturday that he and Amendola attempted to withdraw from the case before the trial, telling Cleland the day before jury selection began that they did not feel adequately prepared and that it would be ""unethical"" for them to move forward. Cleland denied their request, he said. Rominger said he did not mention the issue earlier because a gag order was in place. Sandusky's pastor addresses conviction from pulpit . If Cleland denies the appeal motion, it would be likely to become part of a broader appeal, Rominger said. Ineffective counsel is a common appeal tactic, but a broader appeal may cite other reasons as well. ""If you win on one of the appeal issues, everything probably falls,"" Amendola said last week. ""All we have to do is convince an appellate court that one of the issues we will raise is worthy of a reversal."" Rominger earlier pointed to ""a lot of unique legal issues where (Cleland) made rulings that could be overturned -- not because they were, per se, wrong, but because the law in the area was so unclear."" Asked about the appeal Monday, Nils Frederiksen, spokesman for the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, said, ""We're not going to fight the appellate process with press releases. We're confident that everything in the trial was handled appropriately."" Rominger acknowledged Sunday an appeal may present a tough challenge, as attorneys would have to prove they have significant evidence that could have altered the trial's outcome. And Cleland could easily rule that evidence presented at trial was so overwhelming -- the victims' testimony, for instance -- that it would not have changed the end result, Rominger said. Despite widespread speculation, Sandusky did not take the stand in his own defense. Amendola said after the verdict that decision was made because Sandusky's adopted son, Matt, was prepared to testify as a rebuttal witness that he, too, was sexually abused by Sandusky. As of Saturday, Sandusky was on what is commonly called suicide watch, Rominger said. That was not an indication that Sandusky is suicidal, he added, but Cleland and the jail warden just wanted ""to put the precautions in place first and then evaluate later."" The former coach will be classified at Pennsylvania's Camp Hill diagnostic facility before he is likely sent to a sex offender unit in the state prison system, Rominger said. If he is sentenced to more than two years, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections would determine the prison where he would serve his time. Sex abusers prey on kids' trust,experts say . Beyond the appeals process, Sandusky could face more charges, perhaps tied to claims made by his adopted son or related to alleged sexual abuse that took place outside Centre County -- including in hotel rooms in Texas and Florida, where some accusers say they accompanied him to Penn State bowl games. The university itself also still faces fallout from the case, which shook Penn State and raised questions about its response to the abuse allegations. Two former administrators -- Vice President Gary Schultz and Athletic Director Tim Curley -- are awaiting trial on charges of perjury and failing to report abuse. Prosecutors said the two did not notify police after former graduate student and football assistant Mike McQueary told them he saw Sandusky sodomizing a boy in a Penn State shower in 2001. Authorities didn't learn about McQueary's account until years later. It led to the ouster of iconic head football coach Joe Paterno and university President Graham Spanier. Paterno died shortly afterward of lung cancer. 'The Sandusky 8' describe seduction, molestation and betrayal . In addition to the testimony from McQueary and a former janitor at Penn State, several victims said they were repeatedly molested on university property. How the Sandusky case unfolded .

"Washington (CNN) -- When the National Rifle Association decided to keep track of those House members on both sides of the aisle who voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress last week, it was also sending a message to a number of embattled Democratic congressmen seeking re-election in conservative districts in the fall. The message: Vote right, or we'll let your constituents know. Though some Democrats say the NRA did little to influence their vote, for a handful of those in the House, the message may have been received loud and clear, experts say. A CNN analysis showed that of the 21 Democrats who voted to hold Holder in civil contempt of Congress last week over documents relating to Operation Fast and Furious, 19 received campaign contributions from the NRA during the last two election cycles. The truth about the Fast and Furious scandal . During that period, all of the 21 were targeted by the National Republican Campaign Committee, signaling the organization's desire to turn the competitive districts from blue to red. And of the 17 Democrats who voted in favor of criminal contempt Thursday, all received campaign contributions from the NRA during the same time and have faced similar Republican campaign committee threats. One Democrat who voted for the contempt charges said he did so on principle, not politics. ""The attorney general was asked to provide information, and he chose not to provide. So as a result, I had no other choice but to vote in contempt,"" Democrat and Pennsylvania Rep. Jason Altmire told CNN's Soledad O'Brien. Still, in this year's ultracompetitive seats -- particularly those that have been subject to redistricting -- a nod from the NRA for a Democrat could make the difference between re-election and retirement. The NRA raised the stakes of the vote for members in competitive districts when the organization announced that it would score the vote -- or publicly count any vote against holding Holder in contempt as a mark against a lawmaker seeking re-election. Out of those seeking re-election who voted in favor of contempt, more than half are listed in competitive districts by the Cook Political Report and rely on conservative support, including endorsements from the NRA, to survive their tough political battles. Efforts to seek comment from the NRA were not successful. Of the 26 Democrat members in the House who received money from the NRA in 2012, the 12 who abstained or voted against contempt do not have notably competitive races, a CNN analysis found. ""(The contempt vote) is a fairly low-cost way to demonstrate independence from your own party. The vote was going to pass anyway, so why not take the opportunity to say you can buck your own party,"" said Dave Wasserman, House race editor at the Cook Report. No criminal prosecution of Holder for contempt . ""Democrats in those types of districts love to have an NRA endorsement because it bolsters their standing with a demographic they need to cut into to survive,"" Wasserman said. Among them is Rep. John Barrow, D-Georgia, who is facing perhaps the toughest re-election campaign out of the 435 House seats up for election come November. Barrow, one of the few white Southern Democrats left, found himself in a more conservative district after the Georgia General Assembly completed a controversial congressional redistricting process last year that left 12 Democratic seats more uncertain than they were last election. In addition to the NRA's influential endorsement listed on his website, Barrow received $9,900 in 2010 and $4,000 this year in PAC-to-PAC contributions from the gun rights organization. The 26 Democrats to whom the organization contributed during the 2012 election cycle have received an average of about $2,100, totaling $54,450, according figures collected by the Center for Responsive Politics. Barrow declined a request for comment but released a statement before the vote depoliticizing his support. ""For me, this investigation has been about justice for Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and his family,"" Barrow said. ""The only way to get to the bottom of what happened is for the Department of Justice to turn over the remaining documents, so that we can work together to ensure this tragedy never happens again."" There is no doubt that Barrow is a Republican target. Fast and Furious investigation started with agent's death . ""It's pretty clear ... that these Democrats are going to do everything they can between now and November to distance themselves from the administration and the unpopular agenda,"" National Republican Campaign Committee Press Secretary Paul Lindsay said. Democratic leaders, meanwhile, aren't standing still. The DCCC launched Monday a campaign of its own to target House Republicans in key races this fall, highlighting their votes against health care reform. They will unleash a torrent of live and robo-calls, hitting 10 GOP House races where they perceive vulnerability â€” including Rep. Dan Lungren and Rep. Mary Bono Mack of California, Rep. Judy Biggert of Illinois and Rep. Chris Gibson of New York. And all 10 voted to hold Holder in contempt. For four-term congressman Altmire, he said he was being consistent in his vote against Holder, using the same strategy he touted during the 2010 election and in campaign ads. ""Too many people in Congress just tote the party line. Jason Altmire isn't like that."" his ad said. ""No doubt about it. You saw he voted against health care. Jason opposed the Wall Street bailout. I think Jason is not afraid to stand up to the president. And Nancy Pelosi. He fights for folks here,"" the ad continued. Altmire, who lost a primary battle to colleague Rep. Mark Critz after redistricting landed the pair in the same district, told O'Brien that he voted in favor of contempt because it was consistent with his vote to hold Bush administration White House Counsel Harriet Miers in contempt in 2008. Miers refused to show up for a congressional subpoena or to hand over documents relating to the firing of a large number of U.S. attorneys. ""I don't like to play those kind of political games. I stayed consistent with the vote I cast in 2008."" Approximately half of the Democrats who voted in favor of contempt also voted against health care reform, including Barrow; Rep. Ben Chandler, D-Kentucky; Rep. Larry Kissell, D-North Carolina; Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah; Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-North Carolina; Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minnesota; and Rep. Mike Ross, D-Arkansas. ""In some cases, it's a heartfelt vote, but in most cases, it's political survival,"" Wasserman said of the votes embattled lawmakers make across the aisle.

"(CNN) -- When Keren Charles works with teenage girls in Atlanta as part of her job at Operation Prom, she relies on her upbeat, positive nature and styling expertise to get her through an occasional tough appointment. ""I admit there are some who are very specific and will not try anything other than what they want,"" Charles says, ""Those I really have to work harder with and I'll try and find something to please them."" But Charles says many of the girls that come to her are so excited to just get a prom dress that they put away any preconceived notions. ""The majority of my young ladies that come in are open. They trust me, they trust my opinion and they're able to find something that they really like."" As was the case with 19-year-old high school student Zyna Williams, who came to Charles to find a dress a week before her prom. Zyna is getting her dress for free because of the work of Operation Prom, a nonprofit organization that helps teens in financial need, or who are sick or disabled, get formal wear for no cost. After selecting a few bright colors from her collection in her equally brightly colored private studio, Charles gently encourages Zyna to try on strapless dresses, a style she wouldn't normally choose. ""Again I always advise the young ladies that come in just to try on a dress because some things don't have great hanger appeal,"" Charles tells Zyna, ""but once you put it on you will probably fall in love with it, so let's just try."" Zyna ended up choosing a short, white, strapless dress that day to attend the Alpharetta High School prom, with Charles throwing in accessories and a free hair and makeup session. For Zyna's family, it couldn't have come at a better time. Zyna's adoptive mother, Yasaland King, says an expensive prom dress was just out of reach for her. She's a single mom with two other children and adopted Zyna, who has cerebral palsy, 2Â½ years ago. They came to the Atlanta Chapter of Operation Prom last year, and this year are again amazed by the outreach of the organization. King says Charles and Operation Prom are doing a phenomenal job of helping parents who are not fortunate enough to spend thousands of dollars on the whole prom experience for their children. Not having thousands of dollars for prom is something that Charles can certainly relate to. There was a time when Charles herself had to face starting over with very little. In August 2005, Charles thought what many in New Orleans did at the time. That Katrina was just another storm so she's take a break for a while and visit friends and family in Atlanta. It turned out to be anything but just another storm. Because they left everything back home in Louisiana, Charles and her family had to make a new life in a new city. ""Coming (to Atlanta) and having to start over, it was a tedious experience for my family, but I've grown up with some very strong women so there's nothing that we can't tackle."" After Katrina hit and Charles finally got back on her feet, the economy dealt her a second blow. Charles lost her job working as a corporate trainer, and says after those experiences she decided that she never wanted to feel like she was backed up against a wall with nothing to fall back on. ""I think with Katrina and moving here to Atlanta I always said to myself, I don't want to ever not have a second option."" Now styling girls like Zyna is just one part of Charles' busy schedule. She has a full-time job as the owner of Fashion Envy, a formal dress boutique in Atlanta. She is also a personal stylist and shopper. The styling goes hand in hand with her job as the Atlanta chapter director for Operation Prom. Charles does ""wardrobe audits"" with her clients and encourages them to donate dresses that are sitting in their closets. She also rents dresses to clients for formal occasions and donates those, as well. Charles says she got involved with Operation Prom so she could reach out to young women in the community and use her talent in the fashion industry to help people. As a business owner and a ""promologist,"" Charles is one of many chapter directors making a difference for Operation Prom. Formed in New York in 2005, Operation Prom was born when founder Noel D'Allacco saw a need in her own community in Yonkers. ""I was an event planner and I was meeting with brides and bridesmaids who had these gorgeous bridesmaid dresses that they spent a lot of money on that they were never going to wear again,"" D'Allacco says. This discovery inspired her to start collecting those unused dresses and donating them her alma mater, Saunders High School. Now Operation Prom has several chapters across the country, each one with their own ""promologist,"" a term D'Allacco says she came up with to describe the chapter directors because ""they know everything there is to know about prom."" And Operation Prom's reach goes far beyond just dresses. This year they paired with the Men's Wearhouse to offer free tuxedo rentals for guys. It's just another way D'Allacco and her promologists try to think of every angle that may be an added expense for teens. ""We want them to have the entire prom experience so it's not just the tuxedo, it's not just the dress. If we can purchase their ticket for them, we'll do that as well,"" D'Allacco says. ""If they need transportation we'll try to seek out local limousine companies or taxi services."" Everything that Operation Prom gives to students is free, but it does come at a price. Operation Prom requires that teens who receive their services fill out an application showing that they're in good academic standing and are eligible to graduate. D'Allacco adds that the organization does require that students demonstrate financial need, but she says she also realizes that with today's economy, many families are facing tough times. ""As long as they complete an application they can come to one of the dress giveaway events,"" D'Allacco says. Preparing thousands of dresses across the country is a tall order for Operation Prom, so they hold fundraisers, work with retailers and rely on personal donations and a huge army of volunteers to keep afloat. A night of glitz and glamour isn't reserved just for students struggling financially. Operation Prom also reaches out to a hospital in the Bronx, where each year they transform the cafeteria in to a dance hall. They give the 13- to 18-year-olds patients the total prom experience for one night including, dresses, tuxes, hair, makeup and dancing. ""Some of the patients there have told their nurses that they completely forgot they were in the hospital, completely forgot they were sick for that night they had so much fun."" D'Allacco says her all her chapters also work with their local Departments of Social Services. Through the social workers, Operation Prom is paired with students who are in foster care or are wards of the state to provide them with formal wear, as well. Beyond just dresses and tuxedos for a high school rite of passage, D'Allacco says Operation Prom has always been meant for much more. When she created the organization, she decided PROM would stand for Providing Resources, Opportunity and Mentoring. To fulfill that goal, Operation Prom grants one $1,000 leadership scholarship per year and also holds school-supply drives. For Zyna Williams and Keren Charles, the simple thrill of matching the right dress with the right girl is something they both leave feeling good about. ""It definitely made me feel really good because this is what our mission is,"" says Charles. ""We want to make young ladies have a dream prom.""","Operation Prom helps teens in need get formal wear for no cost .

"(CNN) -- Just a week after losing to Bubba Watson in a playoff at the U.S. Masters, Louis Oosthuizen bounced back with a three-shot victory in the Malaysian Open Sunday. Oosthuizen, who had a 30-hour journey to Kuala Lumpur after his near miss at Augusta, closed with a four-under-par 68 to hold off the challenge of Scotland's Stephen Gallacher. His 17-under total of 271 gave him his fifth European Tour win and for Oosthuizen acted as the perfect tonic after his Masters heartbreak. ""It was a long journey to get here and I have to be honest and say that I didn't expect to play this well because of the tiredness,"" he told the official European Tour website. ""Having a good week this week was important and playing well. I didn't want to come here and play bad but to win means a lot because I have been playing well for the last few weeks now and to win gives me a lot of confidence for the rest of the season."" Oosthuizen had to play 26 holes on the final day because of earlier delays and held a one-shot lead over Gallacher going into the last 18 holes. Gallacher, looking for his second European Tour win, was in touch until the back nine where his South African opponent birdied the 13th and 16th to pull clear. Last year's Masters champion Charl Schwartzel of South African was sixth, six shots back, while defending champion Matteo Manassero and former world number one Martin Kaymer tied for seventh at the $2.5 million tournament co-sanctioned by the European and Asian Tours. Oosthuizen, who carded a stunning double eagle in his final round of the first major of the season, lost out to Watson after the American's superb recovery shot on the second extra hole, but he has moved to second in the European Tour's Race to Dubai after his recent fine displays.","Louis Oosthuizen wins Malaysian Open by three shots .

"(CNN) -- Sweden's Peter Hanson will take a one shot lead into the final round of the Masters after posting a seven-under par round of 65 at Augusta National on Saturday. The 34-year-old made a late charge up the leaderboard with birdies at four of the last five holes to eclipse the efforts of home favorite Phil Mickelson. Hanson, who is playing in only his second Masters, said he will have to manage his emotions on Sunday. ""This is kind of a new situation to me, being in the spotlight like this, and playing the last group,"" Hanson said. ""So it's going to be about controlling my emotions and trying to be in the present and trying to play the same kind of golf that I've been doing today."" Mickelson, a three-time Masters champion, was also in scintillating form on the back nine taking just 30 strokes. Birdies at the par four 10th and the par-three 12th were followed by an eagle at the par five 13th which sent the Augusta crowd into raptures. Further excitement followed at the 15th as Mickelson claimed a birdie four with another coming at the 18th to leave the 41-year-old on eight-under par and in pole position to claim the fifth major title of his career. South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen is one shot further back after a composed round of 69 while playing partner England's Lee Westwood had to settle for an even-par round of 72 which leaves him in a tie for sixth on four-under par with Sweden's Henrik Stenson (70). America's Hunter Mahan and Ireland's Padraig Harrington are also four-under after both men shot rounds of 68 on Saturday. Bubba Watson continues to creep up the leaderboard after another sub-par round (70) moved him up to fourth place. Compatriot Matt Kuchar also shot 70 to finish one shot further back on five-under par. Overnight leaders Fred Couples and Jason Dufner couldn't keep pace with the fireworks of the leaders. Both men finished with three-over par rounds of 75 to drop into an eight-way tie for 11th place. Rory McIlroy is out of the running after posting a third round 77. A double bogey at the first was the first of six dropped shots on the opening nine with another coming at the long par-four 11th. The Northern Irishman clawed back a couple of shots, and nearly holed his approach to the 18th, but at one-over par for the tournament is too far back to mount a challenge. His playing partner, Spain's Sergio Garcia also had a disappointing day posting a three-over par 75 to leave him one-under after three rounds. Tiger Woods is also out of contention after another even par round of 72 left him 12 shots off the lead. ""I didn't play that badly. It was so close to being a really good round of golf. I did not play the par-fives that well. I just didn't take care of the opportunities when I had them,"" Woods said.","Peter Hanson leads the Masters with one round to play after shooting 65 on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- After finishing tied for 40th at the Masters in April, Rory McIlroy might have been expected to throw himself into a punishing training regime. After all, golf's U.S. Open champion was one of the tipsters' favorites to take the title in Augusta. But the 22-year-old Northern Irishman, so often hyped as the next Tiger Woods, failed to erase memories of his nightmare collapse at the same tournament 12 months previously. But McIlroy didn't brood. He didn't even pick up a club. Instead the world No. 2 flew to Europe for a vacation with his girlfriend, Danish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki. They holidayed in Copenhagen and Nice. And even flew to Belfast to watch Ulster's rugby team take on Leinster. Somehow they found the time to meet Britain's Queen Elizabeth at a horse racing event. Wells Fargo Championship leaderboard . It seems the green was the last thing on McIlroy's mind since that disappointing Masters performance. But now, as he returns to the PGA Tour for this week's Wells Fargo Championship -- a tournament he won in 2010 -- McIlroy says taking time out will be the key to his success. ""I don't want to be burned out by the time I'm 30. I want to try to prolong my career as much as I can. I sometimes take a little bit too much out of myself, especially at the end of the season,"" he said on the PGA Tour website. ""I'm trying to find the perfect balance between golf and having a normal life and everything else. For me there's more to life than just golf. I don't know if people are surprised to hear that, but I have a lot more going on in my life than just golf."" McIlroy has reason to be confident at Quail Hollow. It was here that he won his first PGA Tour title two years ago, shooting 62 in the final round to set a new course record. He also became the first player since Woods to win a PGA Tour event before his 21st birthday. ""It's always nice to come back to somewhere where you've had success,"" he said. ""I've got great memories of this course and of this tournament from 2010. I've played some great golf here and played not so great golf here last year. But I'm looking forward just to get back out on the course."" Wells Fargo is the first of four tournaments McIlroy will play before launching his U.S. Open title defense in June. He has drastically cut back his schedule to 23 starts this year -- seven less than 2011. But as he argues, it's all part of the game plan. ""Basically the most important time for me in the golf season is from the start of April until the end of August. That's when all the big tournaments are and that's when you want to play your best golf,"" he said. ""All the stuff either side of that is more preparation work and making sure that your game is getting ready and your body is physically ready for that time of the year. ""I know I've been criticized a little bit for not playing as much as some other guys leading into these few weeks, but I know I've got a big stretch coming up, and I want to be as fresh as possible for this.""","U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy returns to PGA Tour after a disappointing Masters, .

"(CNN) -- He became the youngest player in European Tour golf history after teeing off at the China Open and Guan Tian-Lang's record-breaking round was below par -- but not in a good way. The 13-year-old struggled as he joined the big boys at golf's top table, ending his opening round on five-over-par to sit 149th in a field of 156. Guan, from Guangzhou, endured a nervous start to his historic round as he joined the likes of Englishman Ian Poulter, who finished seventh at this month's Masters, competing for the $3.1 million tournament prize fund. He made three bogeys and one double bogey in his first six holes and ended the day 12 shots behind leader Matthew Baldwin, from England. But despite Guan's baptism of fire, playing partner Marcus Fraser, who ended the day two shots off Baldwin, said the schoolboy has a bright future ahead of him. ""I couldn't believe I was playing with a 13-year-old -- I am old enough to be his dad,"" Australian Fraser told the European Tour's website. ""It's pretty scary actually -- I thought I was still quite young. ""He was very impressive for someone who is 13 and a half years old. He hits it long off the tee and hits a lot of very good shots. ""His putting is good and he has good routines. You can see he is very competitive too which you need to be. If he keeps on the path he is on then he can be a great player. ""To be that age and be able to play at this level is amazing. I felt lucky to be out there with him because if he keeps going he will be in the top ten in the world pretty comfortably. ""He is very mature, very driven but he is not being pushed into by his parents -- he wants to go out there and play and improve and that is the main thing. ""A lot of kids get pushed into things but that is not the case here. He really wants it and it is pretty cool to see that in someone so young."" After shedding his early nerves, Guan was more consistent in the second half of his round and shot level par on the back nine. But despite his indifferent start, there's no taking away Guan's title as the youngest player at a European Tour event -- breaking the record set by by Taiwan's Lo Shih-Kai -- who was 103 days older when he played at the 2003 Hong Kong Open. The youngster now faces an uphill battle to fulfill his dream of becoming the youngest player to make the halfway cut and give himself a chance to qualify for the second major of the golf calendar -- the U.S. Open in June. If successful, he would break the record set by compatriot Jason Hak who was 14 years and 304 days old when he played at the 2008 Hong Kong Open. Guan will have his work cut out if he is to catch 25-year-old Baldwin at the top of the leaderboard, after his bogey-free opening round. Although a rookie on the European Tour, the Englishman showed no signs of inexperience as he carded seven birdies at Binhai Lake Golf Club in Tianjin. There is a six-way tie for second a shot behind Baldwin -- with his compatriot Gary Boyd, Dutchman Joost Luiten, Scott Strange of Australia, Jean-Baptiste Gonnet from France, Swede Fredrik Andersson-Hed and South African Jbe Kruger all hot on his heels. Poulter finished on one-under-par while former top ten player Paul Casey, also from England, was on four-under.","Guan Tian-Lang is youngest player in European Tour history, teeing off at Vovlo China Open .

"(CNN) -- South African pair Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel put their Augusta disappointments behind them to impress in the opening round of the Malaysian Open Thursday. Schwartzel finished 18 shots off the pace in his defense of the U.S. Masters crown, handing over the Green Jacket to Bubba Watson, who beat Oosthuizen in a dramatic playoff Sunday. Shrugging off jet lag after a 30-hour journey from Georgia to Kuala Lumpur, Schwartzel powered to an eight-under 64 to claim the first day lead. Oosthuizen, so close to winning a second major title until denied by Watson's brilliance, produced an excellent 66 to be tied for third. ""Louis and I got off to a good fast start at the beginning and it is always nice when there are a couple of you in the group playing well and pulling each other a long a bit,"" Schwartzel told the official European Tour website. ""Louis is playing so well right that it is impressive to watch and helped me on,"" he added. Oosthuizen conjured up six birdies and an eagle to continue the fine form he displayed in the first major of the season. ""It was a long haul getting here,"" he said. ""I think me and Charl knew the first round, concentration levels won't be great, but we did well. ""I knew the swing was still good. It was just adapting to the weather and the green speed, but I putted beautifully again today and hope to keep it going for the week."" Schwartzel is seeking his first win since claiming the 2011 Masters title and has a one-shot lead over India's Jeev Milka Singh. Oosthuizen is bracked with American Jason Knutzon and India's Jyoti Randhawa.

"(CNN) -- You'd be hard-pressed to find a major sporting event these days without its own dedicated smartphone app. No longer is it enough to simply watch the action, devoted fans are now demanding a blow-by-blow account, interactive maps and player profiles all in the palm of their hands. For young fans especially, such apps have become the must-have accessories -- and British golfing bosses have finally caught on. For the first time in six years, spectators will be able to use their mobile phones at the Open Championship this summer after organizers lifted a ban on Monday. Mobiles had been barred at the golf season's third of four major tournaments -- this year to be held at Royal Lytham & St. Annes -- since 2006 after players complained about distracting ringtones. But ruling body the R&A has now relaxed the ban for the July 15-22 event, and fans will be able to make calls in designated areas -- though photography and video recording is still banned. And to coincide with this, the tournament now offers its own mobile experience. ""We are offering spectators access to an enhanced range of apps for Android, iPhone and iPad that will offer live video of play and other attractions at The Open and will keep them up to date with essential championship information including scoring, tee times, news and an interactive course guide,"" R&A chief executive Peter Dawson said on the R&A website. ""There is no denying the attachment people feel to their mobile phones both in terms of gathering information and staying in touch with family and friends.

"Editor's note: A nationally syndicated columnist, Roland S. Martin is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says few have understood how much power is wielded by Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. (CNN) -- Five days after the 2008 presidential election, Steve Kroft of ""60 Minutes"" did a profile on ""Obama's brain trust,"" four political veterans that he reported were the president-elect's most important team members: David Plouffe, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod and Anita Dunn. When the report aired, I immediately asked myself, ""Where's Valerie?"" -- as in Valerie Jarrett, clearly the most important adviser to the president. After calling around, I discovered that Jarrett didn't even know about the sit-down interview. As Arsenio Hall used to say on his show, ""Things that make you go, 'Hmmm.' "" But after reading the New York Times Magazine cover story on the 52-year-old Jarrett, a longtime Chicago, Illinois, business executive, it's safe to say that that mistake will never happen again. Washington is all about power and the approximation to power. Who is in and who is out is the favorite parlor game among the elites, and the wide assumption by many was that when it came to whom the president relied on the most for advice and counsel, it would have been chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, senior adviser Axelrod and press secretary Robert Gibbs. Yet I'll be willing to bet you a few bucks that after the Times piece hit the streets, Washington power players were picking up the phone and trying desperately to get on Jarrett's calendar. And for those who mistook her as nothing more than a Chicago hack benefiting from a great friendship, they are trying to figure out how to get in her good graces. In the course of 8,100 words, writer Robert Draper made it clear that by her long association with President Obama and his wife, Michelle, no one in the White House knows them better than Jarrett, and that their longtime confidant and mentor is unmistakably the one voice, other than his wife, that the president relies on. ""Over time, I think our relationship evolved to the point where she's like a sibling to me. ... I trust her completely,"" he told Draper. Yet what was also interesting about Draper's article was the jealous nature of the men around the president. Now, I'm sure they will be quick to say that Draper focused on the negative aspect of their comments and not their effusive praise of Jarrett, but a read of the article makes it plain that there is friction there, which is nothing new in the White House. Axelrod came off as dismissive of Jarrett's contributions by asserting that she has best served on dealing with ""family issues."" In fact, there has been lingering resentment among some in the campaign going back to when Axelrod told a reporter with The Wall Street Journal that Jarrett was helpful to the campaign, namely with handling black media. I recall several officials inside and outside the campaign ticked off at the statement. Draper writes that Emanuel was none too happy when discovering that Jarrett discussed office space with Bush's chief of staff, Joshua Bolten, and actually confronted her. Emanuel called it a ""misunderstanding,"" but again, in Washington, power is often seen based on office size and proximity to the president, and it must drive the chief of staff nuts to know that his voice isn't the last one the president relies on. Plouffe, who ran the president's campaign, clearly is shown as not caring for Jarrett, telling Draper ""she wasn't terribly involved in strategic issues."" That's pretty funny considering she was knee-deep in the direction of the campaign. But she wasn't at all greeted warmly by the officials at the top of the campaign. If anyone says the two got along well in the campaign, trust me, they are lying. I'm sure the three of these gents are now asking themselves, ""What does the president think about the article?"" The last thing they want to do is to have the boss sense their dismissal of his most trusted adviser. Frankly, it's smart for Obama -- or any politician -- to have someone as close as Jarrett by your side. All too often in life, and especially politics, influential people have a group of ""yes men and women"" who aren't willing to challenge them to make the best decisions. As the article illustrates -- and I know of other instances -- where the candidate wanted to go one way, those close to him, unwilling to risk the wrath of Obama, capitulated. But on those occasions, Jarrett saw things differently, and because of her total and complete understanding of the candidate, he agreed to follow her instruction. Finally, it's worth noting that Jarrett's gender and race is also important to this equation. Her presence means that it's no longer about ""All the President's Men"" being a group of smart white guys. She brings her experiences as a woman, an African-American woman, a businesswoman, to the table, and she doesn't see the world through the prism of a white male. Our ethnicity and gender play a role in how we make decisions, whether we want to admit it or not. And it's high time that we have greater diversity among the upper echelon of a president's advisers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Roland S. Martin: Presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett has been underestimated .

"(CNN) -- Beaten again by a record-breaking effort from U.S. rival Ryan Lochte at the world swimming championships in China, Michael Phelps says he now has all the motivation he needs to bounce back at next year's London Olympics. Defending champion Lochte claimed the men's 200-meter individual medley title on Thursday in one minute 54 seconds, breaking the record he set in Rome in 2009 -- when Phelps did not swim in the event. He shaved a tenth of a second off that time to register the first long-course world record since the high-tech, polyurethane swimsuits were banned in 2010. Lochte's lead over Phelps -- who came home in 1:54.16 -- was never more than the 29-hundredths of a second he held at the final turn, having moved to the front in the second backstroke leg. Phelps ends gold drought in Shanghai . ""That's why we have records -- to get broken,"" Lochte told the U.S. Swimming website. ""I'm just happy that all that hard work I've done this year, and dedication is definitely paying off. Hopefully everyone now can start realizing, 'Hey, it's possible.' Hopefully a lot more records can fall."" Phelps, who has won a record 14 Olympic gold medals after bagging an unprecedented eight in Beijing 2008, was beaten by Lochte for the second time in Shanghai following his runner-up finish in the 200m freestyle on Wednesday. ""I think that race is going to be a lot of motivation for the next year,"" said Phelps, who won the 200m butterfly on Thursday. ""There's a lot of frustration right now going through my head, and this is going to help me through the tough months of training for the next year. ""(Lochte) is super focused right now, and I think you can see that. He keeps putting the races together that are helping him win. To be honest, he's just more prepared. That's really what it comes down to. Races are always won by people who are most prepared."" Lochte pips Phelps to freestyle title . At the last world championships in Italy, Phelps saw his previous dominance challenged by swimmers using the new-generation suits that were banned soon after. On Thursday he predicted that more of the best times set before the ban will be falling in the near future. ""I sat there two nights ago at dinner, and I was talking to some of the coaches about it that this was going to be the first world record that was going to be broken,"" Phelps said. ""It says something that we're still able to do those times, and that it's not impossible for us to see world records right now. I think we're going to start seeing more, and hopefully they're more often."" The U.S. also won gold in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, with Missy Franklin, Dagny Knutson, Katie Hoff and Allison Schmitt heading off Australia by half a second and defending champions China back in third. Franklin also won bronze in the women's 50m backstroke, which was won by Russia's Anastasia Zuevea from Aya Terkawa of Japan. Olympic swim champion Cielo escapes drugs ban . China won gold and bronze in the women's 200m butterfly, as Jiao Liuyang finished 0.04 seconds ahead of Britain's Ellen Gandy and 0.45s in front of Liu Zige. James Magnussen confirmed his undoubted promise as the 20-year-old became the first Australian to win the men's 100m freestyle title, heading home Canada's Brent Hayden and France's William Meynard. Defending champion and world record-holder Cesar Cielo finished back in fourth place. At the start of the championships, Magnussen helped Australia earn a surprise victory in the 4x100m relay, condemning Phelps' U.S. team to third place. Leading off the team, he set the fastest 100m time by a swimmer not using a banned suit since Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband, the 2000 and 2004 Olympic champion.","Ryan Lochte beats Michael Phelps for second time at 2011 world swimming championships .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods believes he has fixed the swing problems that led to his disastrous Masters showing last month, although he accepts that a chronic left knee problem will always compromise his efforts to improve. The former world No. 1 is getting ready for his first tournament since he finished way down the field in 40th at Augusta, his worst result as a pro at the tournament he has won four times. He had started the tournament as many people's favorite after winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational in the lead-up, but a string of wayward tee shots led to him failing to break par in any of the four rounds. ""At the Masters, I was kind of struggling with my ball-striking a little bit,"" Woods said during a question-and-answer session with his fans that was posted on his personal website. ""Sean (Foley, Woods' swing coach) and I fixed it. It had to do with my posture. My setup wasn't quite right as well as my takeaway, so we worked on that. ""I'm getting dialed in."" Woods will compete in the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow beginning Thursday. He won the PGA Tour event in 2007, although he missed the cut in his last appearance in 2010. ""I feel like if I can do the things that we've been working on, and get my posture and my takeaway dialed in, then yes, I have a good chance,"" said Woods, who will then play at the Players Championship at Sawgrass the following week. But the 36-year-old American said the left knee injury that has already needed surgery four times will be an issue for the rest of his career. ""I've trashed it pretty good over the years and we're working on things to alleviate the amount of stress (as much as) we possibly can on the knee so I can play for however long I want to play for,"" he said. ""And that's one of the reasons I've changed my swing over the years, to try and alleviate that stress. I've had four surgeries on the knee so let's just end it at four and have a nice happy, healthy life."" The video question and answer session was a first for Woods, who has opted not to carry out a news conference before the Wells Fargo tournament. Woods has appeared increasingly keen to engage his fans in recent years, and especially since the scandal about his personal life erupted in 2009. He answered 19 questions sent in via Facebook and Twitter in a 15-minute video. Woods said his favorite trophy was the claret jug awarded to the winner of the British Open, which he has lifted three times. His most memorable putt was the one he holed from four foot to par the 18th and win the 1997 Masters by 12 strokes. ""To set the record, all the history it meant at the time, to have my dad there at the back of the green,"" Woods said. ""By far it was the biggest."" Having taken a week off from golf completely after the Masters, Woods said he was excited about returning to action at Quail Hollow where Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson will be among his rivals. Masters winner Bubba Watson and world No. 1 Luke Donald are skipping the tournament. ""I didn't touch a club for a week and then the last couple of weeks I've got back into it gradually and started ramping up my practice schedule, my practice time,"" Woods said. ""I feel very excited about playing, and all the things that Sean and I have been working on, I just need to implement.""","Tiger Woods says he has worked hard on his swing with coach Sean Foley .

"(CNN) -- A group of passengers who were aboard a March 27 JetBlue flight out of JFK Airport that was diverted because of erratic behavior by its pilot have filed suit against the airline and pilot. The lawsuit, obtained by CNN, was filed Wednesday in New York State Supreme Court in Queens. It lists 10 plaintiffs and accuses JetBlue of being grossly negligent for allowing Capt. Clayton Osbon to fly, claiming the airline knew or should have known that he was unfit to fly an aircraft at the time of the flight. The lawsuit alleges that Osbon caused significant distress to the passengers, specifically by yelling obscenities and things such as ""Say your prayers,"" ""We're all going down,"" ""I'm going to show you Iraq and Iran right now"" and ""There's a bomb on board."" JetBlue Airlines does not offer comment on pending legal matters. Sharon Jones, spokesperson for the airline, did say that JetBlue was aware of the claim that was filed, but has not reviewed the complaint. On April 4, Osbon was ordered by U.S. District Judge Mary Lou Robinson to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. He is scheduled to attend a mental competency hearing Friday morning at the U.S. District Court in Amarillo, Texas, where the flight was eventually diverted. According to court documents filed April 18 by his attorney, Dean Roper, Osbon plans on using an insanity defense. Roper did not immediately return a call for comment . The co-pilot of the flight became concerned about Osbon's bizarre behavior early in the trip from New York to Las Vegas, according to an FBI affidavit issued shortly after the flight. As the Airbus A320 was climbing out of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, Osbon talked about his church and needing to ""focus,"" the affidavit says. He then told the co-pilot to take the controls and to work the radio, and began talking about religion, making statements that were incoherent, it says. The concerned co-pilot suggested they invite an off-duty JetBlue captain into the cockpit. Instead, Osbon ""abruptly left the cockpit to go to the forward lavatory,"" the affidavit says. The co-pilot used the opportunity to get the off-duty captain into the cockpit and change the combination to the door lock. When Osbon tried to enter his code into the cockpit door, the co-pilot announced over the public address system an order to restrain Osbon. Several passengers wrestled Osbon to the floor and restrained him. The lawsuit filed Wednesday does not specify the amount of damages the plaintiffs seek.

"London (CNN) -- British Home Secretary Theresa May defended Thursday the government's decision to bring in an additional 3,500 military personnel to ensure security for the Olympic Games, only 15 days before the event starts. She said it had only become clear on Wednesday that the contractor G4S was not able to provide all the security staff it had promised to the organizers of the London Olympic Games. But, May told the House of Commons, ""there is no question of Olympic security being compromised."" The government's decision to bring in additional troops, on top of the 13,500 already agreed, was the appropriate response to the shortfall in G4S staff, she said. Read more: Is Olympic-level security already under way in Britain? ""Contingency planning has always been central to our security work,"" May said. The deployment means that 17,000 troops will be on duty in the United Kingdom during the Games, compared with the 9,500 currently in Afghanistan. G4S had been expected to recruit a staff of more than 10,000 as part of a total security force of 23,700 for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. It will still provide several thousand personnel. Britain is on a heightened state of alert ahead of the Games, which open on 27 July. Grilled by opposition politicians as she gave an emergency statement to the House of Commons, May rejected suggestions that the government had either not been on top of planning for the event or had been misled by G4S about its preparations. ""This is not a lax approach to security, it is about the government ensuring we have the right approach to security,"" May said. Her opposition counterpart, Labour's Yvette Cooper, said it looked like ""another Home Office shambles."" Read more: Weather warning: London Olympics' biggest threat? May said it was the organizing committee's responsibility to ensure that G4S honored its contract and to enforce any penalties written into the contract, and that the British public would not pick up the bill for the security firm's failings. A Home Office statement released late Wednesday said: ""The government are committing Â£553 million for venue security and we remain confident that we will deliver within budget."" A G4S spokesman said in a statement that the contractor is ""committed to ensuring that London 2012 is safe and secure"" and that it understands the government's decision to bring in extra troops. G4S already has about 4,000 people at work across 100 venues and has more than 9,000 people going through the required vetting, training and accreditation process, the statement said. ""This is an unprecedented and very complex security recruitment and deployment exercise which is being carried out to a very tight schedule,"" it said. ""We have encountered some delays in progressing applicants through the final stages but we are working extremely hard to process these as swiftly as possible."" The military personnel on duty will include reservists, the Ministry of Defence said, and the Olympic organizers have agreed to give 10,000 tickets to the armed forces to compensate for the short-notice deployment. ""I can confirm that there remains no specific threat to the Games. Nor is there an increased threat to the Games,"" said Defence Secretary Philip Hammond. We are confident that the UK is ready and able to provide a safe and secure Olympic Games for the whole world to enjoy."" May also faced repeated questions from lawmakers over border control at Heathrow Airport, amid concerns over staffing levels -- as some visitors wait more than two hours to enter the country -- and the stringency of security checks. Staffing is being stepped up for the Olympics, with additional personnel being brought in to ensure all desk are manned, May said. The United Kingdom's independent chief inspector of borders, John Vine, said Wednesday there had been some progress since a critical report in February, but the extra staff drafted in to ease congestion ""often processed passengers less quickly and asked fewer questions."" He also cited concerns over efforts to detect forged documents in some of the airport's terminals. Meanwhile, work to repair the main route from Heathrow Airport into London continues, following the discovery of significant cracks in a viaduct. A section of the M4 motorway has been closed in both directions since the end of last week, resulting in broad delays for drivers forced to take alternative routes into the capital. The Highways Agency, which is in charge of the UK road network, said Wednesday that the road would remain closed because the complex repair work had reached a critical stage. ""The Highways Agency and its contractors are working around the clock and will reopen the motorway as soon as it is safe to do so,"" it said. ""Conditional on the repair work being successful, it is still expected that the work will be completed and the road reopened within the next few days.""","The UK government says 3,500 more troops are needed to ensure security .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A South Korean court has issued an arrest warrant for the brother of President Lee Myung-bak on bribery charges, a court official said Wednesday, dealing a blow to the governing party ahead of elections later this year. Lee Sang-deuk, a former six-term lawmaker, has been charged over allegations he received about half a million dollars from the savings banks Solomon and Mirae in exchange for exerting influence over officials investigating the banks, the court official said. He was taken to a detention center early Wednesday after the issuing of the arrest warrant, said the court official, who declined to be identified because she is not authorized to speak publicly on the case. Lee Sang-deuk is considered to have been the major force behind Lee Myung-bak's presidential election in 2007. The incumbent president won't be running for re-election later this year because the law limits presidents to only one five-year term, but the arrest taints the image of his governing party. Lee Sang-deuk's lawyer did not return calls seeking comment on Wednesday. The president's brother said he was sorry as he was taken to the detention center but did not comment further, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. The operations of Solomon and Mirae were suspended in May for six months by the authorities, prompting anger from people who were unable to retrieve money they had deposited in the banks. Lee Sang-deuk is not the first relative of a South Korean president to face criminal charges. ""Families of former presidents have been misusing power before,"" said Kwang Won-taek, professor at Seoul National University. ""The current's president's term is going to end soon and the suspicions are surfacing."" Former President Roh Moo-hyun committed suicide in 2009 amid an investigation into a bribery scandal that had tarnished his reputation. His older brother was convicted and sentenced to prison. And former President Kim Dae-jung's three sons were also imprisoned for corruption by the end of his presidential term. Lee Sang-deuk's arrest came after the announcement by Park Geun-hye, the daughter of former President Park Chung-hee, that she would be running for president this year. Park Chung-hee, who was shot and killed by his intelligence chief in 1979, stirs mixed reactions among South Koreans. Some members of older generations consider him a national hero who built up the nation's economy, but some critics say he was a dictator who abused human rights. Park Geun-hye said Tuesday that she would aim for ""transparent, capable, and service-oriented government"" if she were to be elected, Yonhap reported. Her mother was shot and killed in 1974 by a Japanese-born Korean who had close ties to North Korea.","Lee Sang-deuk is seen as a major force in the president's election .

"(CNN) -- If it was left up to Bubba Watson, he'd be at home changing diapers instead of defending his New Orleans title this week. Ahead of Thursday's opening round at the Zurich Classic, reigning champ Bubba admitted he'd rather be caring for his adopted baby boy Caleb than on the green at TPC Louisiana. In fact, the 33-year-old Masters champion is so unconcerned with his golfing triumphs, he hasn't even touched the coveted green jacket won in Augusta earlier this month. Well, only to post a picture of it on Twitter hanging next to Caleb's identical tiny outfit. ""Truthfully, I haven't thought about being a major champ,"" he told reporters. Just over a month after adopting Caleb with wife Angie, the devout Christian insisted: ""It's all about my son and being a better husband. ""I haven't seen the green jacket, the green jacket's been hanging in the closet since the Wednesday of all the media stuff so I haven't touched it since then. I held the baby jacket right up next to it for the Twitter photo but I haven't touched it, I haven't thought about winning."" But with money raised from the Fore!Kids Foundation throughout the tournament going towards helping rebuild a city still struggling in the aftermath of 2005's Hurricane Katrina, big-hearted Bubba admitted the Zurich Classic was simply too important an event to miss. Plus there's the fans who will be hoping to catch a glimpse of the reigning champ hitting the type of miraculous shot that won him the trophy in Augusta. Bubba burst into tears after escaping out of woods on the 10th fairway in a playoff against South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen. But despite bawling on his mother's shoulder in front of the media scrum, Watson insists he is unfazed by his wins. At New Orleans, there are more important things at stake. ""I thought about coming here because I owed it to the fans being the defending champion,"" he said. ""Winning a tournament, no matter if it's a major or not, it's a big deal, it's a major event for that city as it is about raising charity dollars -- especially round this place. They would love some charity dollars to build the city back up to where it used to be."" Fresh from the media whirlwind that has surrounded him since taking the Masters, Bubba played up to his ""average Joe"" appeal. ""I'm just Bubba from Bagdad, Florida,"" he said. ""Small town. Play golf because it's fun. Every day is different. Some days it's windy, some days it's not, some days the ground is firm, some days it's wet. You wake up, it's always a challenge. So you always challenge yourself, you always set goals for yourself,"" he said. ""I think that resonates -- that's a big word, there -- with everybody. It resonates with everybody because I'm from a small town, I played public golf courses growing up, and I think that everybody can see that. ""Everybody can see that my swing is homegrown.

"(CNN) -- With Facebook's announcement Wednesday that it will become a publicly traded company, lots of folks were talking about it. On Facebook. The company filed Wednesday to raise $5 billion in an initial public offering. Most analysts predict that Facebook's valuation will ultimately fall somewhere between $85 billion and $100 billion. Those staggering numbers had Facebook users -- those whose privacy settings defaulted to public -- largely pondering one major school of thought: ""Wow, that's a lot of money."" ""$5 billion IPO for Facebook?!?!? What the hell am I doing on Facebook???"" wrote a user named Jeff Pantridge. ""Screw this... I'm making Jeffbook. I should have something whipped up in an hour. Friend me, follow me... Whatever ... . It's time to get paid."" Facebook user Michael John Chaves pondered what the big-dollar opening says about careers in the tech industry. ""Hmm to become a hardware engineer or software engineer?"" he wrote. ""Facebook's IPO expected to create between 500 and 1,000 millionaires among employees. Soo the answer is: Software Engineer."" Gregory Luis Martinez had more humble ambitions. ""Anybody want to split a share 10 ways?"" he joked. Other users predicted a flood of would-be investors. ""I expect people will be crawling over each other to invest after the Facebook IPO,"" wrote Adam Saunders. ""It will be interesting to see whether Facebook can match the expectations that will come along with its new, and likely obscenely high, valuation."" Mostly, however, the big financial news inspired a lot of wry observations. ""Ironically Facebook could be dealing [with] the same problem with public scrutiny after the IPO as most of us do when deciding what to post on Facebook,"" wrote user Mark Glaser. User Larry Scudder lobbed this one: ""With facebook becoming a public traded company and making everyone go to the stupid timelines, what are the odds of it going the way of myspace?"" Well ... at its peak, Newscorp paid (some would say overpaid) $580 million for Myspace. That's hundreds of millions less than what Facebook earned just last year. And we don't see Facebook being sold for a paltry $35 million -- as Myspace was last year -- anytime soon. Facebook earned $1 billion last year on sales of $3.7 billion. The site said it now has more than 845 million daily active users. And that's the number that had user Phillip Pambrun thinking that maybe Facebook should spread the wealth a little. He even encouraged users to take their case to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""Ok, so. Facebook is about to IPO in a moment. Am I the only person that thinks every Facebook member should receive at least 1 share at initial post?If it wasn't for all of you loyal and faithful Facebookers, this would never have gotten this far. So, everyone, message the high ""Z"" for your minimum 1 share. Lol! "" Hey ... can't blame him for trying.

"(CNN) -- Three masked men allegedly bound a woman and carved words into her skin, police in Lincoln, Nebraska, said Monday. The incident has been classified as a hate crime because a derogatory term for lesbians was painted inside the home, said Officer Katie Flood, a spokeswoman for the Lincoln Police Department. Someone had carved words into the woman's body, police said, but investigators declined to elaborate. In addition, someone poured gasoline around the house and lit it, but the fire did little damage, police said. After the attack, the woman made her way to the home of a neighbor, Linda Rappl, who said she feared bad news about her husband, who is in hospice, when she heard someone knocking on her door before dawn Sunday. What she saw instead was her 33-year-old neighbor, she said, naked and bleeding. ""I was in shock,"" Rappl said. ""She was naked, her hands were tied with zip ties. All I could see was a cut across her forehead and blood running down."" The woman was sobbing. Rappl, 68, brought her neighbor inside and wrapped her in a blanket before calling 911. ""She had cuts on her arms and legs but I didn't want to humiliate her and stare,"" she said. It looked like she had endured torture, Rappl said. ""Some of the blood that was on her -- that had run down her legs -- was dried so I don't know how long it was before she got away."" When word got out about the attack -- and the words carved into the woman's skin and painted onto the walls -- people responded with anger and sadness on social media. Word of the incident spread quickly, said Tyler Richard, president of Outlinc, a non-profit organization for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered community in Lincoln. Members of the LGBT community organized a vigil at the capitol building Sunday night that he estimates more than 500 people attended. Opinion: Boy Scouts, end discrimination against gays . ""The most powerful thing to me was the amount of people there, the amount of people that wanted to support and say this is not something we're going to stand for in our community,"" he said. The city and its police force will do everything they can to ""ensure that justice is done,"" Mayor Chris Beutler said Monday. ""Hate crimes are despicable and appalling to me and to all Lincoln residents,"" the mayor said in a statement. ""Lincoln strives to be a community that embraces tolerance and equality. We stand united with our gay and lesbian citizens in denouncing violence directed at any group."" Though Rappl couldn't attend the vigil, she said it is good for the woman ""to know how many people care about her and support her."" The women have been neighbors for about seven years and have become good friends, she said.

"(CNN) -- There's a fine line between success and failure in top-level sports, perhaps nowhere more so than in track and field sprint events. Tyson Gay knows how true that is. The American was a triple world champion in 2007, but since then has seen Usain Bolt usurp him in the most spectacular way with records and titles galore. However, the difference between them is still only a few hundredths of a second. ""It's a huge difference -- not on paper, but in the race it is. In a race, a loss is a loss and you can see it clearly. So that's why I want to get what's on paper a lot closer,"" Gay told CNN's Aiming for Gold show. His quickest time over the 100 meters is 9.69 seconds, set in China in 2009. That matched Bolt's effort in winning Olympic gold in Beijing the previous year. When they went head to head at the 2009 world championships, Gay clocked 9.71 -- good enough for second place only as the Jamaican took his title with a new record 9.58. ""If I do my best and I don't win then I have to be satisfied with that,"" the 29-year-old Kentucky native said. ""So when I ran 9.71, I was mad I didn't run 9.69, but it was so close that it was almost like I couldn't be mad because I knew that we worked to do what we tried to do, and I just took the loss."" Gay has only beaten Bolt once in a 100m final, in 2010, and also had the edge in the 200m final at the 2007 worlds. But a hamstring injury suffered in the 2008 U.S. Olympic trials sent his performances into a spiral, and he did not qualify for the 100m final in Beijing. Overcoming adversity . ""It was like coming off a high and going to the lowest point of my life in a span of 12 months,"" he said. ""Being a champion I wanted to follow up with an Olympic medal, and after going through the trials and having the American record in the 100m dash I was feeling good, and then I pulled my hamstring in the 200m and that's when things just changed. ""I was down trying to rehab it, trying to go through a lot of things, ups and downs, struggles mentally trying to get my mind together. ""It was very tough. I believe when you run track and field, you're on that thin line between running too fast in practice, running too fast in meets, not having enough time to recover and so forth -- and that's just something I had to learn to deal with over the years."" Gay insists he is in much better shape to finally achieve his dream at this year's Olympics in London. ""I really believe that I'm going to be healthy this year and that's what I'm looking forward to,"" he said. ""Last year for me to run with basically one leg, I ran 9.7. I can be a lot more dangerous, as long as I stay healthy and get a lot stronger in the weight room."" Off-track issues . The Jamaican sprint team was hit by a doping scandal ahead of the 2009 world championships which saw five members -- not including Bolt -- under scrutiny, and last year their compatriot Steve Mullings was handed a lifetime ban after testing positive for a masking agent. Gay's fellow American, former world and Olympic champion Justin Gatlin, is on the comeback trail after serving a four-year ban for steroid use. With that context, London 2012 organizers have said that this Games will be heavily scrutinized to make sure illegal doping does not occur. ""That's one thing I respect about having the Games here in London, they don't play no games and they were big on the anti-doping thing,"" Gay said. ""There's a possibility that they're a little bit less forgiving than America is when it comes to that and I really respect them for that."" Family man . Gay is only too aware that he is a role model for aspiring athletes -- including his daughter Trinity. ""She is not a little girl anymore and she is at the age when she understands what I'm doing, so now I'm at a point where I want to be involved in more of her sports,"" he said. ""Last year was one of the first times going to one of her track meets and it was pretty amazing to watch her run and compete and still keep her spirits up high you when she didn't win. ""In that sense I am trying to balance my time so I can watch her career and I can finish up my career."" With that in mind, Gay is aware that London may provide his best chance to achieve his Olympic goals and leave a golden legacy. ""I really believe this is going to be one of the most exciting Olympics ever in history, and I like a challenge. I want to run with the best, run against the best; that's how I've always lived,"" said Gay, who has strong ideas of how he'd like to be recalled in the history books. ""As a great runner, as a clean runner, someone who accomplished things without going the other route. Being remembered as someone who gave his all, who ran with his heart. I want to capitalize that with a medal in the Olympics -- a gold medal.""","U.S. sprinter Tyson Gay is hoping to prove a point at the 2012 London Olympics .

"(CNN) -- O.J. Murdock, who signed with the NFL's Tennessee Titans last year, killed himself Monday morning in front of the Tampa, Florida, high school where he was a track and football star, police said. Murdock, 25, never played a game in the NFL because he had been sidelined with an injury since signing as an undrafted player a year ago. ""In his brief time here, a number of our players, coaches and staff had grown close to O.J., and this is a difficult time for them,"" the Titans said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- A tractor-trailer crossed the median of an Arizona highway Sunday and slammed into a van driving in the other direction, killing all seven of the van's passengers, a state public safety spokesman said. The two people in the truck -- the driver and his spouse -- were both injured in the crash and helicoptered to Banner Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, said Officer Carrick R. Cook with the Arizona Department of Public Safety. The woman has a broken back, and she and her husband are both in serious condition, according to the spokesman. The truck had been heading west on Interstate 10, about 40 miles west of Phoenix, about 11 a.m. when it went across the highway and struck the van, which was going east. Both vehicles went off the right side of the highway after the collision and caught fire, Cook said. Medical examiners are trying to determine the identities of the seven van passengers killed, she added. They are believed to be from western Arizona. The crash caused massive traffic issues, as authorities shut down Interstate 10 eastbound before noon and funneled drivers off the highway. One lane was reopened about 4:30 p.m., according to the state Department of Transportation's official Twitter feed. Are you there? Send us your stories and images. More CNN U.S. news: .

"Rakovski, Bulgaria (CNN) -- Greece's economic problems may be having a negative impact across much of Europe, but one country could be benefiting from its troubles. Greek investors are said to be jumping across their neighboring border to Bulgaria, money in hand. ""It's a very sad reason but it is happening actually,"" says Georgy Ganev, an economist from the Center for Liberal Strategies. ""Even some Greeks are transferring their monetary balances from Greece to Bulgaria -- obviously hedging the risk for Greece leaving the eurozone."" Leaving the eurozone is the solution to Greece's troubles, according to markets analyst Louise Cooper, from BGC Partners. ""Greece has to exit the Euro, it has to get competitive, has to devalue currency and then almost needs a Marshall Plan,"" she says. ""Austerity has destroyed the country."" Tough measures brought in to rescue the Greek economy have seen a massive drop in the standard of living, and it's brought pressure on the interim government. Whoever wins the national elections on May 6, the government needs to impose more austerity measures -- worth 5.5% of GDP, or $14.4 billion, plus a further $4 billion in taxes -- conditions of the EU/IMF bailout that is keeping Greece from going bust. Greek businesses are now looking at Bulgaria, to take advantage of its lower taxes and wages -- and to be more competitive. Staff Jeans is one Greek company that is making the move. Part of its production is already carried out in Bulgaria but after sales in its home country plummeted by 40% last year, it is now looking at moving all of its manufacturing across the border. ""What is happening in Greece right now is a tragedy,"" says Joseph Komninakidis from Staff Jeans. ""We are losing a lot of revenue and at the same time have large costs bringing our products back and forth between Bulgaria and Greece."" He says his company needs to reduce these costs to be more competitive in Europe. It's not just business that is shifting, but also private investors. Real estate brokers have noticed an influx of Greek buyers. ""It is not so far to travel for them,"" explains Boyko Boykov from B & H Real Estate. ""It's because of the prices and because of the location.""","Greek investors moving across the border to Bulgaria .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When you walk into a store, you may not realize that there's literally something in the air that's already trying to convince you to buy something. The invisible force is something called scent marketing, a concept used in Europe and the U.S. but is still fairly new to Asia. The idea is to infuse a certain smell in a retail shop that makes a customer linger and more inclined to make a purchase. Oriental Watch Co. is a large luxury watch retailer which has stores across Asia. The store hired a Hong Kong-based scent strategy company, Skywork Design Ltd., to create a store scent that captured the essence of the company. The lab created a special green tea smell for the store. Daniel Fong, creator of Skywork Design Ltd., felt that green tea mirrors the Chinese identity of Oriental Watch Co. ""When you see a watch, it's easy to forget it. But when you smell something, it's forever,"" Fong says. ""The smell goes directly to the emotional part of our brain."" For the past four months, Oriental Watch has used the green tea scent in all 12 of its Hong Kong stores. Salesman Ken To can't say definitively if the scent has led to a direct increase in sales but he is certain the scent relaxes customers. ""We see customers are willing to stay longer at our store, especially in the area close to the machine (scent diffuser). We can have more conversations with them and hopefully, we can make a sale,"" says To. ""Our staff like it too. We have a stressful job because we're dealing with $,1000 to $1,000,000 watches. So the scent helps lower the tension for the frontline staff."" After 20 years in the advertising business, Fong started Skywork Design last year to fill a niche he noticed was lacking in Hong Kong and China. He used his existing network of advertising clients and word of mouth to kick off his business. Today, his biggest clients are teen fashion store 2%, Oriental Watch Co., Peninsula Arcade and Hang Lung Properties. Fong says his young company became profitable four months after launching. There are companies that create scents for hotels and casinos. Fong says their goal is to create a pleasant experience for guests. His company has a different target and approach. ""My strategy is not to focus on hotels because there are a lot of competitors focusing on hotels and property management. Our strategy is targeting the marketing people, to increase the sales and the branding of a company....mainly in retail stores."" 2% is a Hong Kong-based teen clothing store. When you walk into the store, you will immediately breathe in a bubble-gum scent -- which Fong describes as ""juicy, girlish, sweet"" -- that circulates through a diffuser in the shop. He recently lingered outside a 2% store to watch customers. He saw a teenage girl near the store entrance and overheard her saying, ""Oh, that smell is 2%."" He took that comment as a successful sign in brand building. The clothing chain first hired him to work on two stores, sales increased and he now supplies the scent to all 35 stores in Hong Kong. Negotiations with 2% are underway to supply 100 of their stores in mainland China. Samsung recently put on several road shows to promote its new Galaxy S3 smartphone. Samsung says this new Android phone is ""inspired by nature -- it sees, listens, responds."" Its marketing agent asked Fong to create a special fragrance for several four-day road shows in Asia, a fragrance that embodied the image of nature. ""We were inspired by the new functions (of the phone) that related to natural behavior,"" Fong said. For example, the phone uses its frontal camera to follow the user's facial movements and the phone only goes into sleep mode when it knows the user is not looking at it. Because of contractual confidentiality, he couldn't tell me what fragrances he used for the Samsung scent but he did open the bespoke bottle and let me take a whiff. To me, it smelled like a cologne with a little metallic twist -- not so much ""nature,"" but more ""metal, gadget, male."" As Fong's creations are making cash for his young company, an international bank has asked Fong to create the ''scent of money'' for its offices in Hong Kong. He's playing with the idea of blending the bergamot, moss-like scent of chypre flowers with metal. ""But I'm still thinking about that one,"" he says.","Businesses use scents to try to draw and keep customers in stores .

"(Time.com) -- Years ago when I was a broke college student subsisting on ramen noodles and off-brand cereal, I used to fantasize that someday, when I had a good job, I would be able to afford to eat incredibly healthily. I planned to buy fresh vegetables every week, belong to a fabulous gym, employ a personal trainer and get regular massages. But today I still get sticker shock when I go to the grocery store. That's why I was so skeptical when a USDA study released a few months ago asserted that healthy foods are actually cheaper than the heavily processed stuff. These findings are based on the fact that the old method prioritized price per calorie, giving low-cost junk food an edge over fresh veggies. But, the report said, ""When measured on the basis of edible weight or average portion size, grains, vegetables, fruit, and dairy foods are less expensive than most protein foods and foods high in saturated fat, added sugars, and/or sodium."" Translation: now there's really no excuse not to eat healthier. Time.com: Why families who eat together are healthier . However, it's one thing to understand that grains and legumes are a cheaper source of protein than free-range chicken; it's quite another to try to get my meat-loving husband to have rice and beans for dinner every night. Similarly, gym memberships and personal trainers can be a big monthly expense, but they might be worth it if the only thing you'd do at home with your treadmill or dumbbells is occasionally wipe the dust off of them. Getting into shape -- and staying that way -- can save you some serious cash in the long run. Lifestyle changes can help stave off diabetes as well as joint replacement and other big medical expenses. So, with those motivators in mind, here are few tips to help minimize the cash you spend on the road to being active and healthy: . Prioritize your monthly budget. Sitting down and writing a budget that accounts for fixed and discretionary expenses is an important step for anyone who wants to be in control of their finances. Yet it can be difficult to decide what discretionary expenses are appropriate -- especially if there isn't much left over after paying the bills. It should be a conscious process: you need to figure out what is most important to you and then make some tradeoffs. For example, my friend Tracy hired a personal trainer, which strained her budget. She dropped the service, but became unmotivated to exercise on her own. I suggested she continue to work with the trainer while cutting down on eating out and also wait to go shopping until after she dropped to her desired pant size â€” both of which helped motivate her towards her weight-loss goal. If you can't have it all at once, invest in what makes you feel best. Time.com: Tips for a fitter summer . Plan ahead and eat in. My mother worked outside the home when I was growing up and always planned a week's worth of meals so we could do all the grocery shopping at once. We also do this in my household now, and this kind of planning not only saves me time, but also cuts down on us throwing out unused food. Thinking ahead makes it easier to budget in pricier selections, like fresh fish or more expensive cuts of meat, and also makes it less tempting to eat out, which can come with a high price tag â€” and calorie count. Comparison shop. If you like working out at a gym but want to save money, shop around. If the gym memberships in your area are too pricey, explore options at your workplace, local schools or community centers, which often offer free or low-cost activities. Browse the Internet to see if there are group sports activities, like hiking, biking or running that you may join for free or a nominal cost. And if you think you'd use them, consider at-home strength training or yoga DVDs. Time.com: NYC's trans fat ban worked: fast-food diners are eating healthier .

"(CNN) -- ""I consider myself normal,"" Michael Phelps told Piers Morgan. ""I've spent 20 years in the pool. I consider that something that's normal."" In an interview on Monday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" the American swimmer who has amassed 17 Olympic medals talked about his goals for the 2012 Games, his heroes, mistakes he's made, his impending retirement and much more. Phelps won six gold and two bronze medals at the Athens Games in 2004, and eight gold medals at Beijing in 2008. Last night, Phelps won his first ever silver as part of the 400-meter relay team. His medal collection leaves him a mere two medals away from becoming the winningest athlete in Olympic history. In Saturday's 400-meter individual medley, Phelps came in fourth place. Fellow USA teammate Ryan Lochte won the gold. It was the first time Phelps failed to win a medal in an Olympic event since 2000. Phelps, 27, is competing in his fourth and final Olympics before retirement. Phelps, who grew up in a suburb of Baltimore, began swimming at age 7. Michael Phelps cements legacy as one of all-time Olympic greats . Phelps at one point trained every day for five years. He spent three to six hours in the pool each day and exercised on dry land four to five days a week. Morgan pointed out that the number of Olympians who cite Phelps as an inspiration makes the swimmer an almost godlike figure, but Phelps said that his athletic role model has always been Michael Jordan. ""On and off the court, the guy made basketball what it is,"" Phelps told Morgan. Phelps has yet to meet the basketball Hall of Famer and six-time NBA champion, who also is a two-time Olympic gold medalist. But the two sports stars share a similar trait: Both men had a dream, reached for it and achieved it despite the sacrifices they made. ""I think one of the coolest things that I loved about him was it didn't matter what he had going on off the court or if he was sick or this, that,"" said Phelps. ""He never used an excuse. He came out every single night on the court and did what he had to do to get his job done. That's what champions do. It doesn't matter what else is going on when you walk in to your arena, whatever you excel at, you're there to take care of the job that you have to do."" Lochte vs. Phelps: Swimmer showdown heats up the Web . Morgan asked Phelps to recall the fallout from the 2009 incident in which a photograph of the swimmer allegedly smoking pot from a bong at a party surfaced. ""I'll make a million mistakes in my life but as long as I never make the same mistake again, then I've been able to learn and grow,"" said Phelps. He also said that the incident made him realize who his real friends were. With retirement clear on the horizon, Phelps told Morgan that he'd most like to be remembered for ""doing something that nobody else had ever done before, changing the sport of swimming. That's what I hope to walk out of this sport with."" One aspect of retirement that Phelps looks forward to is visiting oceans or resorts and not getting in the water. ""I don't want to get in the water,"" said Phelps. ""I spent so much time in the water; I'm like 'No I'll sit here on the beach. ... I don't want to get in the water and play.""

"Phoenix (CNN) -- Attorneys gave opening statements Thursday in a civil trial accusing an Arizona sheriff -- who bills himself as ""America's toughest"" -- and his department of racial discrimination against Latinos. The American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona and other attorneys are representing Hispanics in a class-action lawsuit accusing Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio of civil rights and constitutional violations. The bench trial is being held in the U.S. District Court in Phoenix. In his opening remarks, Stanley Young, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told the judge that Arpaio and his department violated ""the fundamental value of equal protection under the law"" through a ""policy of racial discrimination and mistreatment of Hispanics."" Tim Casey, an attorney for the sheriff, told the court that ""there is no evidence that race or ethnicity played a factor"" in the detention of the five named plaintiffs. ""Ethnic constituency of the neighborhood plays no role"" in the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department's selection of neighborhoods for saturation patrols, Casey said in court. Arpaio is expected to appear in court to testify early next week. Outside the federal courthouse, Arpaio critics demonstrated and carried placards stating, ""No justice. No peace. No racist police."" Get Real! Sheriff Arpaio renews birther debate . Among the first witnesses Thursday was Ralph Taylor, a Temple University professor of criminal justice. Taylor testified that he did a statistical analysis that shows Hispanics are more likely to be checked for immigration status during saturation patrols than non-Hispanics are. Arpaio is nationally known for his tough stances against illegal immigration, but critics have said for years that his approach has created a system of racial profiling. The U.S. Justice Department has also filed a civil rights lawsuit against him, but Thursday's trial is for a different lawsuit brought by Hispanics who say they were discriminated against. The class-action lawsuit, filed in 2007, claims that Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office ""launched a series of massive so-called 'crime suppression sweeps' that show a law enforcement agency operating well beyond the bounds of the law."" The plaintiffs are also being represented by the law firm Covington & Burling. ""They're never easy cases, there's no smoking gun,"" ACLU of Arizona legal director Dan Pochoda said of the class-action suit. ""We don't expect a memo in the file that says let's get these people solely because they're Hispanic. We believe the evidence will demonstrate that is indeed effectively what was done."" Arpaio and his attorneys declined to comment before the trial. In a CNN interview last year, Arpaio said his department would continue to pursue illegal immigrants. Overheard on CNN.com: Are there winners, losers in immigration policy debate? ""I know I'm doing the right thing. I'm not going to surrender by those little small groups, people that don't like what I'm doing. You think I'm going to surrender? It'll never happen,"" the sheriff said. The lawsuit charges that the sheriff's office ""unlawfully instituted a pattern and practice of targeting Latino drivers and passengers in Maricopa County during traffic stops,"" the ACLU said in a statement. The sheriff's tactics violate the Equal Protection Act by discriminating by race and result in prolonged detentions that violate protections against unreasonable searches, the ACLU said. The office's ""pattern and practice of racial profiling goes beyond these sweeps to include widespread, day-to-day targeting and mistreatment of persons who appear to be Latino,"" the lawsuit states. Among the plaintiffs is Manuel Ortega Melendres, a visitor to Arizona who possessed a valid visa. In September 2007, he was arrested after the car he was riding in was pulled over by Maricopa County deputies. The lawsuit alleges that Melendres showed the officers his identification but was nonetheless treated roughly and arrested. He sat in a cell for hours before a federal immigration agent confirmed that his documents were in order. As a result of his ordeal, Melendres was left ""frightened to walk on the street or be seen in public in Maricopa County because he fears that the sheriff's officers will come and arrest him again because he is Latino and does not speak English,"" the lawsuit states.

""It's really a gas and wind world today,"" said Jeff Immelt, referring to two sources of electricity he said most countries are shifting towards as natural gas becomes ""permanently cheap"". ""When I talk to the guys who run the oil companies they say look, they're finding more gas all the time. It's just hard to justify nuclear, really hard. Gas is so cheap and at some point, really, economics rule,"" Mr Immelt told the Financial Times in an interview in London at the weekend. ""So I think some combination of gas, and either wind or solar ... that's where we see most countries around the world going."" Mr Immelt's comments underline the impact on the global energy landscape of the US shale gas revolution, Japan's 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown and falling prices for some types of renewable power. The shale boom has sent US natural gas prices down to 10-year lows, a trend some analysts believe will spread elsewhere, while the nuclear industry faces added costs and uncertainty after Fukushima. At the same time, a 75 per cent fall in solar panel market prices in the past three years has made solar power competitive with daytime retail electricity prices in some countries, according to a recent report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, while offshore wind turbine prices have steadily declined. Such factors pose dilemmas for countries such as the UK, which is trying to build new nuclear plants without public subsidy. The ruling coalition is also split over whether to set a new target to make the electricity sector virtually free of carbon emissions by 2030 -- a plan George Osborne, the Conservative finance minister, opposes but many Liberal Democrats back. Mr Immelt lent weight to the Lib Dem argument, saying GE had found existing EU carbon targets helpful. ""I think standards sometimes really drive innovation,"" he said. ""To a certain extent at least, knowing what the rules are and being able to innovate against it is not a bad thing."" Mr Immelt played down the impact of changing energy trends on a company as large as GE, which reported annual profits of $13bn for 2011 (on revenues of $142bn) and sells products for every leading source of energy, from gas and wind turbines nuclear reactors and oil drilling gear, to gas and wind turbines. ""We've got them all, so in some ways when you have them all you don't have to be so smart about anything,"" he said. Analysts estimate GE's nuclear revenues, from a joint venture with Japan's Hitachi, at an estimated $1bn, or less than 1 per cent of annual global sales. Mr Immelt is visiting London during the Olympic Games, which GE sponsors. The company will announce on Monday that it has made more than $1bn in sales from Olympic host cities since 2006, including $100m from the London games, where GE has sold several power systems, 120 electric vehicle charging stations and thousands of lights. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","GE CEO: Nuclear power is so expensive compared with other forms of energy .

"(CNN) -- How on earth could a teenage swimmer at her first Olympic Games knock five full seconds off her previous best performance? That's what has left so many people scratching their heads after watching China's Ye Shiwen smash the world record in the women's 400-meter individual medley. The Chinese swimming prodigy's extraordinary swims during the first few days of the Olympics may have drawn praise from across the sport, but they've also raised suspicions of drug doping. The 16-year-old world champion won gold Tuesday in the women's 200-meter individual medley, three days after coming from behind to take one second off the world record -- and a whopping five seconds off her personal best -- during her gold medal swim in the 400-meter individual medley. The controversy over her record tear through the final 50 meters of Saturday's golden swim -- faster than the final leg of American champion Ryan Lochte's own gold medal performance -- began during the BBC's coverage of the race, when presenter Clare Balding turned to her co-presenter, former British Olympian Mark Foster, and asked: ""How many questions will be there, Mark, about someone who can suddenly swim much faster than she has ever swum before?"" John Leonard, the executive director of the American Swimming Coaches Association (ASCA) and the World Swimming Coaches Association, called Ye's swim ""disturbing"" and told the Guardian newspaper it brought back ""a lot of awful memories"" of doping scandals at previous Olympics. International Olympics Committee spokesman Mark Adams called doping allegations against Ye ""sad"" and ""pure rumor,"" and told CNN he had heard nothing from Olympics drug testers to suggest that anything was awry. More: Hi-tech tests to catch Olympic drug cheats . But while Ye's swimming has caused the most controversy in the first week of the Olympics, the swimming prodigy herself isn't exactly an unknown quantity. Born in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, Ye began swimming at the age of six after her teacher noticed she had large hands and feet, according to China's Xinhua state news agency. After winning the 50-meter freestyle swim in her peer group at the Zhejiang Province Games in 2006 at the age of 10, her coach predicted Ye would be an Olympic champion. Ye joined the Zhejiang provincial swimming team in 2007 and China's national team the year after. Ye arrived on the world stage in 2010 at the age of 14, winning a pair of gold medals at the Asian Games and two silvers at the World Swimming Championships in Dubai. On her Olympic profile, Ye's most memorable sporting achievement is listed as ""winning the 200m and 400m individual medley at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou."" View: Best hi res photos of London Olympics . But it wasn't until world champion Li Zhesi was banned in June 2012 for a positive drug test that Ye rose to the forefront of the Chinese swimming team. Ye won gold in the 200-meter individual medley at the 2011 World Aquatic Championships in Shanghai, but finished outside the top three in the 400-meter individual medley. Just one year later, Ye swam the race more than a second faster than any woman in history. Ye has attributed her success to her training schedule and hard work. ""If the coach asks me to practice 10,000 meters, I would never be a lazy player to swim 9,900 meters instead,"" the Beijing Morning News quoted her as saying. But practicing hard and destroying the 400-meter medley record by storming through the final 50 meters faster than anyone else, man or woman, are two very different things, and Ye's golden performance quickly raised suspicions of drug doping from Leonard, one of the most respected names in the sport of swimming. ""The one thing I will say is that history in our sport will tell you that every time we see something, and I will put quotation marks around this, 'unbelievable', history shows us that it turns out later on there was doping involved,"" said Leonard, who is also the executive director of the USA Swimming Coaches Association. South African sport scientist Ross Tucker expressed concern on his Science of Sport blog about the vast difference between the relatively average times Ye swam in the first three legs of the 400 meter race and her faster swim through the final 100 meters. ""The conclusion that I would draw from this is that her 100m freestyle leg is disproportionately fast not only by comparison to Lochte, but also to her peers, and to the best 100m freestyle swimmers,"" Tucker wrote. British Olympic Association chairman Colin Moynihan joined China's anti-doping chief in defending Ye, saying Olympic drug testing was ""on top of the game."" ""She's been through (anti-doping agency) Wada's programme and she's clean. That's the end of the story,"" he told reporters at a Tuesday news conference. More: Visit CNN's Olympic center here . Ye has denied doping allegations, saying, ""My achievements derive from diligence and hard work, I will never use drugs. Chinese athletes are clean."" Ye, along with many of her teammates, reportedly spent months training in Australia before the Olympics, and China's approach appears to be paying off. Sun Yang won China's first ever men's gold medal in swimming in the 400-meter freestyle final just 25 minutes before Ye's record swim last Saturday, and the Chinese swim team has also netted several other swimming medals. No one seemed more surprised about the outcome of the race than Ye herself, who said: ""I dreamed of winning the gold medal, but I never ever expected to break a world record, I'm overwhelmed."" The head of China's swimming team, Xu Qi, wondered aloud why similar allegations haven't dogged other top swimmers in recent years. ""Ian Thorpe was called a genius, Michael Phelps got eight gold medals in Beijing. Ryan Lochte, Missy Franklin are both recognised as geniuses. There were geniuses in France and South Africa. We admit and accept these geniuses, but why can't a genius come from China, a country with a large population?"" One person who doesn't seem in doubt is Lochte himself. He said: ""It was pretty impressive. And it was a female. She's fast. If she was there with me, I don't know, she might have beat me.""

"(CNN) -- Helena Morrissey has seen a shift in the mindset of business leaders. Previously the idea of more women in the workplace was dismissed as ""political correctness,"" but now she says the same people are asking how they can get the best candidates for the job. As CEO of Newton Investment Management, Morrissey oversees around $50bn of funds under management and almost 400 employees. She's also one of the few female CEOs in the City of London. The mother-of-nine says being passed over for a promotion after having her first child was ""an eye opener,"" when bosses doubted her commitment. She now spearheads the 30% Club, campaigning for greater female representation at the top of British companies. ""If you look at the state we are in, the financial crisis, there is a strong argument that there is an identikit culture in lots of boardrooms; white, mostly men, same sort of age,"" Morrissey says. Charlotte Beers: Women must lead on their own terms . Currently only around one in 10 board members in Europe's top companies are women. The figure is slightly better in Britain, where almost 15% of all FTSE 100 boards are now female. But British Prime Minister David Cameron says the country's economy is being held back by too few women in the key roles. At a summit in Sweden on Thursday, Cameron said evidence showed there's a positive link between women in leadership and business performance. This can be seen with Burberry -- which leads the FTSE 100 pack with three out of eight members of the company's board being female -- where despite the UK's retail downturn, the group recently reported strong sales. Luxury goods stay on trend . ""If you want to change the way business decisions are made and ultimately how shareholders receive returns, you need the best person for the job,"" says Morrissey. ""Or a different sort of person than there was in the past."" Several European countries are adopting quotas for the number of women in the boardroom. Cameron says he's looking to countries such as Norway, which has spearheaded change in the boardroom, and has already reached its 40% mandate. But Morrissey objects to the idea of set quotas, saying it is demeaning to women. ""It suggests it's a numbers game and not about getting business results,"" she says. Some businesses are setting their own goals, such as France Telecom Orange, which aims to have the same proportion of women on its boards as it has working in the company. ""I see this (as a) concerted effort, led by business, supported by government,"" says Morrissey.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In a move that is surely music to the ears of Apple fans in Asia, the U.S. technology giant has rolled out its online digital media store, iTunes, in a dozen territories, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. While Apple's wildly popular Mac computers, iPhones, and iPads are widely available in the Asia-Pacific region, its customers outside of Australia, Japan, and New Zealand have previously been unable to purchase music, movies, and other media from iTunes without a gift card or credit card attached to a billing address in a country with an iTunes store. Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Macau, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam complete the list. Curiously, mainland China is the obvious absentee, despite being the California-based company's second largest market and the site of five Apple retail stores. Apple would not comment on the company's plans to launch iTunes in China. The tech giant's sales in China surged to a record high of $7.9 billion for the first quarter of 2012, putting it on course to double the $13.3 billion it made for the whole of 2011. Apple has sold more than 16 billion songs via its iTunes Store since it was launched in 2003, according to the company.","U.S. technology giant has rolled out its online digital media store, iTunes, across Asia .

"London (CNN) -- Former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond has hit back at British lawmakers who suggested he misled them over concerns voiced by the country's financial regulators. CNN can also reveal that those very same regulators will now be called to testify next week alongside a key Barclays executive, who Diamond said had mistakenly told traders to lower their submissions to the London Interbank Offered Rate -- or Libor. Adair Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority watchdog, has been been called to the Treasury Select Committee Monday afternoon with the head of the FSA's bank supervisory body Andrew Bailey, the man famous for warning Barclays of failings in its culture. Turner and Bailey will appear after panel members take a pre-arranged briefing from the Bank of England Governor Mervyn King. Officially King is slated to present the central bank's quarterly update on the UK economy and interest rates. However, sources say the discussions are likely to focus heavily on the issue of Libor after King's deputy Paul Tucker refuted suggestions he leaned on Barclays to lower its rate submissions. Jerry Del Missier, former Barclays Chief Operating Officer, will also give evidence Monday, in what is likely to be the most keenly watched testimony of all. Diamond's right-hand man also quit last week after the bank was fined a record Â£290 million (US$449 million) for fixing the interest rate floor upon which trillions of dollars worth of financial contracts are based. Diamond gives up $31 million bonuses . Del Missier will come in for questioning about claims he misread an email from Diamond asking him to lower Libor submissions following a conversation between Diamond and Tucker. Questions also remain about whether or not Diamond was aware of correspondence between the FSA and Barclays about the bank's alleged use of financial structures ""at the aggressive end of interpretation of the relevant rules."" At the time of writing, four out of the 13 lawmakers on the committee charged with investigating the Libor scandal said they would like to see Diamond be recalled to clarify his earlier statements. Inside Barclays: Morale at all time low . In a letter obtained by CNN from Diamond to UK Treasury Select Committee Chairman Andrew Tyrie dated July 10, the 60-year-old American-born banker seemed keen to get a second chance to speak. Diamond said the comments made at the hearing had had ""a terribly unfair impact"" upon his reputation, a reputation which Diamond said was ""of paramount concern to me."" He added: 'I look forward to discussing this issue with you further if you wish to do so."" Yet those close to the parliamentary body say it is unlikely Diamond will have a second chance to put on a polished appearance because the committee is due to be reshuffled next week. ""It's not the complexities of this that are the problem. It's the evidence that's the problem,"" said one unnamed member. ""Also time is working against us."" Another doubted Diamond would become embroiled in the Serious Fraud Office's recently launched Libor probe, even if sources at Barclays confirmed to CNN they are bound by Diamond's contract to cover his legal costs, should he face any. All the while Diamond has waived his right to Â£20 million (US$31 million) in deferred compensation and bonus payments, walking away instead with a tenth of that amount. John Mann MP, a lawmaker and member of the committee that interrogated Diamond last week, said: ""You only give up your job and your pay if you've got no cards to play. ""This has never been how Bob Diamond has ever operated."" Bob E. Diamond Jr's letter to Treasury Select Committee Chairman Andrew Tyrie . July 10, 2012 . Dear Mr Tyrie, . Having watched the Committee's session today I was dismayed that you and some of your fellow Committee members appear to have suggested that I was less than candid with the Committee last week. Any such suggestion would be totally unfair and unfounded. The focus of your concern appears to relate to correspondence between Messrs. Turner and Agius in April 2012. The questions asked of me, however, concerned the period of promotion in September 2010 and the board meeting I attended in February 2012. As the letters of April 2012 make clear, those letters followed an April meeting between Messrs. Turner and Agius, which I did not attend. I was not asked about the April 2012 meeting nor was I asked about, nor shown, the follow up letter to that April meeting at our session. I trust this addresses any concerns you may have had. The comments made at today's hearing have had a terribly unfair impact upon my reputation, which is of paramount concern to me. I look forward to discussing this issue with you further if you wish to do so. Yours sincerely, . B.

"(CNN) -- Eurozone finance ministers meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Monday will discuss giving Spain an extra year to meet its deficit targets. Spain had been told to cut the difference between its income and spending to within 5.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of 2012. But European Union sources tell CNN that ministers will probably revise that goal upward to 6.3% Monday, in accordance with a draft put forward by the European Commission late Friday. As part of the plan, Spain will be asked to cut its headline deficit to 4.5% of GDP for 2013 and 2.8% for 2014, the sources said. The ministers are meeting 10 days after their heads of government agreed to use the bloc's temporary bailout funds to recapitalize Spain's ailing financial system and to set up a joint supervisory body for the area's lenders. The aim of Monday's summit is to figure out how to implement those proposals, though EU insiders are doubtful the politicians will put numbers on the page yet. One official close to Monday's discussions said they are likely to include the so-called Troika group of lenders, which includes the EU commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. ""There's still some technical work that needs to be done,"" said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""As such, they (finance ministers) are aiming for more of an agreement in principle rather than a commitment."" A month ago, the same eurozone finance ministers agreed to put aside 100 billion euros ($150 billion) to shore up the capital base of Spain's banks -- money that will come initially from the region's nonpermanent European Financial Stability Facility. Audits commissioned by the Spanish government recently showed the sector is likely to need 60 billion to 70 billion euros in extra cash to stay solvent. But the eurozone seems to be far from the point of disbursing that money. '""We may well hear talk of brackets rather than final numbers,"" the official told CNN. That may be hard for the bond markets to digest. Ahead of the gathering, the yield on Spain's 10-year bonds surpassed the 7% level that forced Greece, Ireland and Portugal to accept bailouts. When it comes to Greece, it seems that Brussels is less optimistic about whether any headway would be made. ""The expected outcome is likely to be less concrete,"" the official said. ""The idea is essentially for the new Greek finance minister to outline his government's policy intentions and for the Troika to give an initial reading about how things have gone thus far.'' Finance ministers for the eurozone will meet at 5 p.m. local time in Brussels on Monday. A broader gathering among the full EU finance ministers will take place Tuesday.","Eurozone finance ministers meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Monday will discuss Spain .

"(CNN) -- Canadian authorities were preparing Friday to file warrants for murder against a 21-year-old security firm employee in the robbery of an armored vehicle at the University of Alberta that left three other security employees dead and a fourth critically injured, police said. Edmonton police were in the process of filing Canada-wide warrants for three counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder against Travis Brandon Baumgartner of Edmonton, said Bob Hassel, superintendent of the Edmonton Police criminal investigations division. ""With the approval of the Crown, we now believe we have reasonable, probable grounds, that this is the person responsible for this terrible crime,"" Hassel told CNN. Police said they believe Baumgartner is ""armed and dangerous"" and are urging the public to use extreme caution should anyone happen to encounter him. Baumgartner is an employee of the security firm G4S, company spokeswoman Fiona Walters told CNN. The firm, which specializes in outsourcing, has more than 657,000 employees and operates in 125 countries, its website says. The three people killed and the one person critically injured are also G4S employees, Walters said. ""We are shocked and horrified by the incident and would like to express our heartfelt condolences to the victims' families and to all of our employees in Edmonton,"" the firm said in a statement. ""We are doing everything we can to assist the Edmonton Police with their investigation."" Earlier in the day, Canadian authorities said they were searching for Baumgartner as a ""person of interest"" in the shooting at the university in Edmonton early Friday. An emergency notice by the university said the shooting happened during an armored car robbery. Investigators were trying to find Baumgartner because he ""is believed to be one of several armoured company employees that attended the U of A around midnight"" on Friday ""to make a delivery,"" Edmonton police said in a written statement. Authorities also released a photograph of Baumgartner. Investigators ""confirmed the shootings were the result of an armed robbery of an armoured vehicle making deliveries at the U of A's Hub Mall building,"" police said in their statement. Officers were called to the campus and found three bodies and a fourth victim with life-threatening injuries, police said. 3 dead 3 wounded in Auburn shooting .

"(EW.com) -- It's like ""Deal or No Deal"" crossed with your own holiday party game. NBC has ordered a new game show from Howie Mandel based on a popular gift-swapping tradition. In ""Howie Mandel's White Elephant,"" six contestants will select one package from an assortment of wrapped gifts containing millions of dollars in prizes. Using strategy, luck, and good guessing, contestants will decide whether or not to steal prizes that have been previously revealed, or gamble that the item in their unopened box is worth more. The contestant with the least valuable prize at the end of every round is eliminated. The concept seems to have the tense ""take it or leave it"" simplicity of ""Deal,"" but adds the allure of using tangible gifts instead of dollars and has the contestants' gameplay impacting each other. The final two players will face a tough choice, based on the classic psychology experiment ""prisoner's dilemma:"" They're presented with a box filled with two life changing prizes. They must choose whether to share the gifts, or steal the other player's gift but risk walking away empty handed. NBC has ordered seven episodes from Mandel (who will host) and Mike Marks. There's no premiere date yet, but next holiday season would seem like a neat fit. See the full article at EW.com.

"(EW.com) -- This week's episode of ""How I Met Your Mother"" featured a pretty unforgettable smile-inducing kicker. After Ted found himself bemoaning his romantic setbacks and lack of personal progress, a look into the not-so-distant future revealed he had a daughter. Tear up? Join the club. But would you have guessed that the moment wasn't even part of the greater plan for the season? ""We had a week of treading water, to be honest,"" says co-creator/executive producer Carter Bays. ""We have the arc of the season going, but this was one week where there wasn't one, specific big event happening. We always get nervous about those kinds of episodes because you want to know that the story is moving forward."" So, he says, they took a ""step back,"" and decided to put a little perspective on the overall story of the series. ""We were really telling the story that a father probably should tell his kids because it was only 22 minutes as opposed to seven seasons,"" he jokes. Indeed the flashbacks and talk about the past was a nice reminder of where we've been with the gang. But as Bays sees it, it's also a great reminder of where we're going -- without giving everything away. Yes, he admits, they made sure Neil Patrick Harris hid his left hand so we wouldn't know whether or not Barney would be married three years from now. ""He's so good at making that look natural,"" he says, laughing. ""He's a magician; he's good with his hands. He knows what he's doing"" But does Barney? This episode saw the once notorious womanizer seemingly settling into life as a one-woman man. To be fair, Becki Newton previously warned EW that Barney and Quinn would be on the fast track. But after just a few episodes of courting, they're living together...and liking it! Is it all too fast? Bays doesn't think so. ""I think Barney is in love. At a certain age, you stop worrying about the pacing so much and you sort of realize you're only on this planet a short time so you might as well be with the person you care about the most,"" he says. ""And I think that's Quinn right now for Barney."" The best way to show that, he says, was to break barriers -- by breaking wind. ""We put off having a fart sound effect on our show for seven years, and we did pretty well without it. And it was one of those things as a showrunner that you know two things right away: You're going to be embarrassed that you're doing it at the table read, and you know that in the final cut, it's going to be the funniest moment and get a laugh,"" he says. ""And it's not 'Blazing Saddles' -- cowboys sitting around eating beans â€” it's actually a very real threshold to cross in a relationship. It's a big relationship moment."" So where do they go from here? For one, Quinn and Barney will continue moving pretty quickly, he says, and next week, we'll see more from Robin (Colbie Smulders) than we did in this episode. ""Robin, there is some excitement in her life coming up, especially next week's episode,"" he says. When we pick up, Robin and Ted still aren't talking and viewers are going to see how that affects their lives and friendship. ""We went for the reality of those situations,"" he says. ""I feel like on this show we've gone as far as we can go where it's just the gang hanging out at the bar week in and week out, with these big thing happen to them that don't really change things. Ted and Robin have now reached the point where it's not as simple as hanging out at the bar and forgetting the fact that Ted's in love with her, and she's not in love with him. It's complicated."" But, not to worry, he says. ""I feel like [there's] a satisfying ending -- the way it all wraps up as the season comes to a close."" See the full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- In the new HBO comedy ""Veep,"" Anna Chlumsky plays the young chief of staff to the Vice President of the United States played by ex-""Seinfeld"" star Julia Louis-Dreyfus. If the actress looks familiar, it may be because a few decades ago she starred in ""My Girl"" opposite an equally adorable Macaulay Culkin. The 31-year-old Chicago native took a break from acting, went to college and even worked as an editorial assistant for a year until she found her way back to her thespian roots. She recently spoke to CNN about the new show, politics and what it was like being a child star. CNN: Are you interested in politics? Anna Chlumsky: I'm interested in current affairs and social policy as a whole, but I don't watch politics for sport. I think people can get really wrapped up into it. When I was in college I was much more into it. I was an international studies major. CNN: What does that mean? That you wanted to become a diplomat? Chlumsky: It's a liberal arts education. You study things you like to learn, not to necessarily be anything in particular. CNN: Did ""Veep"" make your more cynical about politics? Chlumsky: I find it to be kind of liberating in a way because really the spotlight that is put on people in politics is that they're people. Some people are really good at their jobs, some people are really bad. People have good and bad days. Everyone uses the restroom. Personally I find that to be liberating because when we mythologize our politicians, we put too many expectations on them, both positive and negative, and we kind of make them supernatural in a way. I think a better way is to think of politics as a pragmatic discipline. The idea that people are trying to work things out and make deals like anybody else kind of takes the scariness out of it. CNN: You became a big star when you were a kid. Chlumsky: (Laughs) I wouldn't say star. CNN: Come on! That movie was huge! Chlumsky: Yeah the movie was big. CNN: Was it weird having adults groveling and treating you differently? Chlumsky: It definitely makes you start to see the world in a different way in the sense you start to weigh who your friends were before and who your friends were after. As far as adults groveling, my mom was really wonderful about that on set. Anytime somebody would ask what I wanted and I didn't ask her first I would get into trouble, and that was absolutely right. She was very sensitive to people treating me differently than anyone else on the crew, and I'm so grateful she made a point of that. CNN: Still, you're on movie sets. Chlumsky: I think what affected me the most was being taken out of school for a few months every once in a while. When I say I wasn't a star, the reason why is most of my time was spent in school in Chicago. The movies felt more like a hobby. CNN: You dropped out for a while. Chlumsky: It was not my decision at first. It was me going through puberty and not being cute on screen. I auditioned a lot during my adolescence for things and it just didn't take, so that took its toll because being an adolescent it can be less than fun to be told that someone doesn't like you anymore. So that was pretty much what drove me to the conscious decision to give it a rest. Also in college you learn you have all these other interests, and you really want to commit to them for the time being so that's what I did. I thought I was not going to be an actress. I moved to New York right after college and you see enough Broadway shows, and I was inspired again to really give it a go for all the right reasons. CNN: You must have been nervous diving back in that you might not get work. Chlumsky: Yeah but that's what was so great about coming to the decision as an adult because I kind of know that's a hazard of the job. I had to prepare myself and know that I'm strong enough to persevere through that, and I am rational enough to realize that only one person can get any role, and it doesn't mean it's personal. It doesn't mean you're bad. I came at it from a much healthier point of view.","Anna Chlumsky plays Amy Brookheimer, Julia Louis-Dreyfus' chief of staff .

"Akron, Ohio (CNN) -- The Akron warehouse is bustling with activity: Forklifts buzzing across the floor. Boxes stacked neatly by the loading area. Vans lined side by side to take deliveries. CEO Daniel Flowers shows it all off with a clear sense of pride and accomplishment. He just wishes he wasn't so busy. Yes, a CEO who wishes supply outpaced demand. ""We have had a steady increase in the number of people who seek emergency food assistance,"" Flowers tells a visitor. It is impossible not to be impressed by the operation. Flowers is president and CEO of the Akron-Canton Regional Food Bank, which now operates out of what once was a beer distributorship. It is also impossible not to be numbed by the numbers: More than 2 million people in Ohio -- 18% of the state population -- face what the government terms food insecurity. That means they go hungry or are not able to maintain normal and consistent eating patterns because they cant afford it. Poll: Obama leads in Ohio, swing states, tops 50% . The Akron-Canton facility serves eight counties and reaches about 180,000 people. Strikingly, about 45% of those who get help don't qualify for government assistance because they work and don't meet government income guidelines, but they still don't make enough money to make ends meet. Akron is in Ohio's Summit County, a blue-collar battleground within perhaps the 2012 campaign's defining battleground state. The experience of the food bank -- and the charities it helps -- mirror the campaign economic debate: Are things better off than they were when President Barack Obama took office in 2009? Flowers said demand at the food bank is higher than ever, which could be seen as evidence that things have not gotten better in this swing state. But, one could look at it this way: back in 2008 and 2009, demand grew 25% from year to year. This year it is up 3% from last year. ""It is almost a sad fact that that feels like a win -- that it is not so bad,"" Flowers told CNN during a visit on Tuesday -- just 98 days, or 14 weeks, until the November election. Obama is returning to the area Wednesday -- his ninth campaign visit to Ohio this year -- and his team can make a statistical case that the state is in better shape. In Summit County, for example, the unemployment rate is 7% -- down from 9.3% when the president took office. Republicans argue GOP Gov. John Kasich deserves credit more than the Democratic president, but their bigger push is to make the case the recovery would be stronger if not for an administration they say stifles job creation with regulation and new mandates like the Obama health care law. ""The president's not only demonstrated that he tends toward more of a government-oriented solution toward the economy, but Gov. Romney has proven firsthand he knows how to create jobs,"" state Sen. Frank LaRose told CNN during a visit to a Mitt Romney campaign Summit County office in Stow, where a dozen GOP volunteers were making voter calls. The strategy of the swing states . Ohio is a fascinating county-by-county chess game. Republicans don't expect to carry Summit County, for example, but Romney won't have a prayer statewide unless he improves on Sen. John McCain's weak 41% performance here in 2008. With so much TV ad money being spent here, LaRose argues there will be a ""saturation point,"" and that Ohio in the end will be decided on the strength of grassroots organizing. ""In '08, that enthusiasm wasn't there as much as it could have been,"" LaRose said. ""I get calls all the time from people that say, 'What can I do to help Romney win?'"" And what does he say to those turned off by the already nasty campaign? ""I tell them that's like saying, 'I don't get involved in the weather.' It's going to effect you."" The president's recent ""you didn't build it"" remark that the Romney campaign characterizes as an insult to entrepreneurs and small businesses plays heavily in the GOP strategy now. Pawlenty: 'Obama is all foam and no beer' Ohio is full of small towns and medium-sized cities -- like Akron and Dayton -- where Romney and his surrogates make the case that remark, and the Obama record, prove the president sees government as a stronger force than the private sector. Most Republicans here push for Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman to share the ticket with Romney. But former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty had an Ohio audition of sorts while the candidate was overseas this week. At the Dublin Pub in Dayton, Pawlenty drew laughter when he asked patrons how they would feel if the owner promised a cold beer then served them a glass of foam, and then added: ""President Obama is all foam and no beer."" Turning more serious, he said government was choking business expansion with regulation while also running up huge deficits. ""The hour is later than people realize,"" Pawlenty said. Dayton is another critical piece of the puzzle -- and another area Team Obama can cite some progress. Unemployment was 11.1% in the county in February 2009; it is 8.1% now. County by county analysis . Again, Montgomery County -- home of Dayton -- is a key test of Romney's Ohio viability. President George W. Bush essentially split the vote with Democratic challenger John Kerry here in 2004 - the Democrat had a slight 51% to 49% edge. Obama, on the other hand, beat McCain 53% to 46% here -- one of the many swing counties key to the big Democratic 2008 Ohio edge. Hamilton County -- the Cincinnati area -- was the surprise piece of Obama's 2008 Ohio rout. Look at a 2008 map and it is shaded blue -- carried by Obama. Look at the close 2000 and 2004 races, when Ohio was carried both times by Bush, and Hamilton County is shaded red for Republican. ""I think Hamilton County is the key to winning Ohio, and winning Ohio is the key to the president's re-election,"" the county Democratic chairman Tim Burke said in an interview at his Cincinnati law office.African-American turnout was critical to Obama's Hamilton County win four years ago, and Burke says the campaign and state party are increasing field staff and other resources to prove wrong those who believe that turnout among that voting bloc will slip some this year. He also predicted Kasich's clashes with organized labor will benefit the president in November.""Some of the more conservative unions -- like the police and fire unions -- which have trended toward the Republicans, they're back in the Democratic camp, and they're going to be there in the fall,"" Burke said. Jobs rate, auto industry improving . In Burke's view, recent improvement in Ohio's jobless numbers will make it harder for Romney and the GOP to win the ""Are you better off?"" debate in this state. ""Just take the auto industry and how that has seen a resurgence in the state of Ohio,"" Burke said. ""We've got three quarters of a million jobs that are auto related here in Ohio, and we are seeing the benefits of that for President Obama."" Some, though, have a different test than the unemployment rate. George Camilletti is at the Akron food bank four or five days a week for five years now, packing his wife's minivan with supplies for the Good Neighbors charity. Five years watching the changing face of hunger and struggle -- watching economic anxiety spread to folks who had never experienced chronic unemployment or hunger. ""I think it is worse than three years ago,"" Camilletti says. ""It is migrating. ... I'd say we are going into the middle of the middle class now. We are reaching up to the suburban people. To people who used to have a nice home, a nice car. ...It is worse than it was three years ago."" Better or worse: The defining question in what could well be the defining battleground.","Economy is improving, but many still not better off in Ohio .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The health of several of the world's biggest banks has been called into question following the decision by Moody's to downgrade their credit ratings. In all, 15 institutions were downgraded after Wall Street closed Thursday, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HSBC, Credit Suisse, UBS, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Canada. ""All of the banks affected by today's actions have significant exposure to the volatility and risk of outsized losses inherent to capital markets activities,"" Moody's Global Banking Managing Director Greg Bauer said in a statement. How the major banks are affected . The banks were unimpressed with the move, with many questioning how the ratings agencies make their decisions. Citi called its two-notch downgrade ""arbitrary and completely unwarranted,"" according to CNNMoney. So how did the global economy become so dependent on the opinions of three companies? Who are the credit rating agencies? The ""big three"" are Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings. All originated in the United States, although Fitch has dual headquarters in New York and London. What do they do? Before you can get a credit card, banks run a credit check on you. Similarly, the ratings agencies run credit checks on companies, countries and financial products -- and banks themselves. The agencies assess their the ability to pay off loans or investments and then rate them on a sliding scale, ranging from AAA to D. In the case of government bonds, anything that slips to BB+, as was the case with crisis-hit Greece, is considered a ""highly speculative"" investment: or ""junk bonds"" in the parlance of the markets. Stocks plunge on downgrade fears . In the context of Thursday's announcement, Moody's grouped the 15 banks into three categories based on their credit worthiness. JPMorgan, HSBC and the Royal Bank of Canada made up the top group, which Moody's said had solid capital buffers and ""contained"" exposure to the European crisis. The second group included Goldman Sachs, Societe Generale, Barclays, Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS. Moody's said these firms had varying risk factors, from high dependence on capital markets operations to limited liquidity and exposure to Europe. Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) made up the bottom -- and weakest -- group of banks. Moody's said these companies experienced problems with volatility and risk management, while their financial ""shock absorbers"" are in some cases thinner or less reliable than their peers. Credit Suisse took the biggest hit from the Moody's announcement, suffering a three-notch downgrade, just days after Switzerland's central bank warned it to bolster its capital. What does a debt rating downgrade mean? Banks could see their costs rise as it becomes more expensive for them to borrow money. Officially they are now a riskier proposition for lenders because of their exposure to events such as the European debt crisis. These additional costs -- potentially billions of dollars -- could eventually be passed to the banks' customers through higher interest rates on loans and mortgages. Why do the agencies wield such power? Investors across the world look to credit ratings agencies to judge where to place their bets in the market. For governments, the ratings agencies have a lot of power over the popularity of bonds: cash given to governments like Greece by investors that, over time, will pay a return on the original investment -- unless the government defaults. The downgrade of Greece signaled Standard & Poor's belief that Greece has a higher likelihood to default on investments. It caused investors to lose their appetite to invest in bonds from Greece, which imperils the nation's ability to pay down its deficit. How are ratings agencies paid? Historically, they were created to give investors an unbiased assessment of investments and investors paid for access to the ratings. In the 1970s, however, credit rating agencies started charging the issuers of new investments fees for ratings. In 1975, U.S. legislators -- fearing a proliferation of unscrupulous ratings agencies -- designated Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch as the only ratings organizations banks and brokers could use to evaluate the credit worthiness of their products. What are the complaints against the firms? Critics complain the agencies have lost their ability to independently judge the risk on certain investments -- especially in light of AAA ratings given to mortgage-backed securities that imploded when defaults on U.S. home loans shot up, triggering the 2008 financial crisis. Critics also note that the agencies are paid by the very entities they rate, raising questions about their trustworthiness. Lawmakers in the United States, the European Union and other countries around the world are now reviewing regulations on the credit ratings agencies. Credit ratings agencies, too, have revamped their procedures and have argued their ratings are merely opinions -- it's up to the markets to decide.","""Big Three"" are Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Gunmen shot and killed nine prison guards in eastern Pakistan on Thursday after gaining entry to a building where they were staying, officials said. Thirty-five prison guards were in the building in the city of Lahore when four to six gunmen entered, said Muhammad Rashid, a Lahore police official. The guards, most of them from the volatile northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, were in Lahore for training, Rashid said. Habib Ur Rehman, the police chief of Punjab province, said the attack killed nine prison guards. Lahore is the province's capital. Shortly afterward, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the act. Ihsanullah Ihsan, a spokesman for the group, said the attack was meant to send a message that no area of the country is outside Taliban reach. Security forces in Pakistan are often the targets of violence, with militant groups active in different parts of the country. In a separate attack Thursday, armed militants killed six coal miners and a doctor in southwestern Balochistan province five days after they kidnapped them, a senior government official said. ""All victims have received multiple bullets on their heads and chest,"" said Muhammad Hashim Ghilzai, the deputy commissioner of Quetta, the provincial capital. All seven were killed while in custody of the Balochistan Liberation Army, an insurgent group that has claimed responsibility for several bombings in the country, he said. The group demands Balochistan be made a separate independent state free from Pakistan's rule. Ghilzai said militants abducted the coal miners on their way back to the city from a private coal company. An investigation is under way.","NEW: Militants kill six coal miners and a doctor in Baluchistan province .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Two billionaire brothers who control Asia's biggest property development company have been charged with corruption, anti-bribery officials in Hong Kong said Friday. Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP) co-chairmen Thomas and Raymond Kwok were among five people charged with a total of eight offenses, including conspiracy to offer advantages to a public servant and misconduct in public office, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said in a statement. Hong Kong's former chief secretary Rafael Hui, banker Francis Kwan and Thomas Chan -- responsible for land acquisitions for SHKP -- were the other men charged after one of the biggest anti-graft probes in the banking hub's history. Tycoon arrests rock Hong Kong . Hui, the city's former No.2, faces charges related to misconduct in public office, including the acceptance of rent-free apartments and unsecured loans. All five men were granted bail after a hearing on Friday afternoon, with the court case adjourned until October 12. Hui and Kwan were instructed to surrender their passports. The ICAC revealed the offenses took place between 2000 and 2009 as investigators probed land sales overseen by Hui involving SHKP. The case has caused a media frenzy in the city, where real estate is a local obsession. Sun Hung Kai, which helped to build some of the tallest buildings in the city's celebrated skyline, contributed to the Kwok brothers' estimated $18.3 billion fortune. The brothers, who were arrested in March, have protested their innocence. ""I can say that personally I have done nothing wrong. And I can vouch for Mr. Thomas Kwok that he has done nothing wrong either,"" Raymond Kwok said at a news conference on April 3, referring to his brother. ""I hope this investigation will clear my name,"" he said. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, is considered to be one of the world's least corrupt territories. According to Transparency International's 2011 Corruptions Perceptions Index, Hong Kong is the 12th least corrupt territory in the world -- with the United States, by comparison, ranked 24th. CNN's Andrew Henstock and Tim Schwarz contributed to this report.","Thomas and Raymond Kwok among five people charged with a total of eight offenses .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- An Indian court has ruled that the organizer of the scandal-plagued 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi is forbidden from attending the opening ceremony of the London Olympics. The presence at the ceremony of Suresh Kalmadi, who was arrested last year on corruption charges related to the Commonwealth Games, would be ""contrary to national interest,"" the High Court of Delhi said Wednesday. The legal action seeking to restrict Kalmadi's movements was filed after a different court had authorized him to travel to London. He had sought permission for the trip in order to attend meetings of the International Association of Athletics Federations. The Delhi high court allowed him to go ahead with his visit. But it said he couldn't leave India until Friday, the day of the opening ceremony, and should honor a pledge not to attend any Olympic events ""in any official capacity."" Kalmadi still holds a number of high-profile sports administrative roles, including the presidency of the Indian Olympic Association. In a statement, he said he was ""never planning to attend"" the opening ceremony and had never sought permission to do so. The petitioner who brought the litigation, Rahul Mehra, said Kalmadi's presence at the Olympics would be ""extremely embarrassing"" for the athletes and India. Mehra described himself as a ""patriotic citizen of the country."" The Indian government also is not in favor of Kalmadi attending the Olympics while he still faces corruption charges, according to the text of the high court's judgment. The 2010 Commonwealth Games, which India had hoped would burnish its image as a rising economic power, was marred by accusations of graft, missed construction deadlines and cost overruns. An Indian court granted bail to Kalmadi in January after he had spent nine months in jail following his arrest. The police detained him over allegations that as the head of the games' organizing committee, he bought a time, scoring and result system from a Swiss company at an inflated price. Kalmadi is also a lawmaker in the Indian parliament, where he represents the governing Congress party. Corruption has plagued India for years. A series of high-profile scandals rocked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's administration in its second term, as well as investor confidence in Asia's third-largest economy.

"(CNN) -- It is the dismal weather Olympics organizers and spectators feared as Great Britain endures some of its wettest summer months for over a hundred years. And according to London's 2012 chairman, weeks of torrential rain has forced his team to make contingency plans if the sporting spectacle becomes a washout. In the first of what will be daily Olympic media briefings, Sebastian Coe said the bleak conditions were posing a huge problem for London. With some forecasters predicting the wet weather may be about to lift prior to the Games opening on July 27, Coe said alternative arrangements were in place if the deluge continued. Weather warning: London Olympics' biggest threat? ""I spent most of Sunday in the Olympic stadium watching a goodly chunk of our 15,000 volunteer cast heroically rehearsing in the rain,"" he told the assembled media. ""I've joked in the past about the challenge of putting a roof across the whole country but this is actually proving quite a challenge to us. ""We've got waterlogged sites, we've got resurfacing that's taking place in some of our areas, particularly some of our more sensitive rural sites."" London has spent seven years planning to hold the Games and a spokesman from the London Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) told CNN last week that every eventuality had been accounted for. According to the UK's national weather forecaster, the Met Office, June was the wettest since records began in 1910, and that July had continued in similar fashion. But though there is hope of better weather ahead Coe confirmed there was enough maneuverability in the Olympic schedule to be able to rearrange events if they are blighted by wet conditions. ""We've got the contingency of extra days available to us in rowing and in equestrian sports, as a last resort of course,"" Coe added. ""We've got an alternate sailing course available to us at Weymouth and of course we've got the famous roof at Wimbledon."" As athletes continue to arrive in London, Coe said he was satisfied with the early stages of the Olympic operation, despite American hurdler Kerron Clement complaining that his bus got lost on the way to the Olympic village. ""But for a missed turning and a couple of Tweets, we're in pretty good shape,"" Coe joked. ""I don't think we should get out of proportion some of these issues. We had a tweet yesterday talking about a four-hour delay, it was actually two-and-a-half. We had a driver that missed a turnoff. Athletes fret on lost bus as wave of Olympic arrivals begins . ""Out of 100 coach journeys that's likely to happen. The majority of athletes got in in good shape and on time. Getting in from the airport and to the village is important, and 98% of those journeys went without any hitch at all yesterday."" Meanwhile, it was revealed on Tuesday that there are four parties bidding to take over the Olympic Stadium after the Games have finished, including one connected with Formula One racing. The London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) said that English Premier League soccer club West Ham, third-tier side Leyton Orient, the UCFB College of Football Business and Intelligent Transport Services had declared their interest. The latter are connected with a bid to turn part of the Stadium into a Formula One track and the sport's supremo Bernie Ecclestone confirmed to the Daily Telegraph newspaper he had been consulted on the scheme. The LLDC said they would now consider all four bids, with a decision expected towards the end of the year.","London's Olympic chairman says weather proving a challenge for Games organizers .

"(CNN) -- He's one of the poster boys of the London Olympics, which is being staged a few miles down the road from where he grew up, and soccer star David Beckham has confirmed to CNN he will have a role in Friday's glittering opening ceremony. The L.A. Galaxy midfielder, who has also played for Real Madrid and Manchester United, has played a pivotal role in bringing the Games to his hometown but was controversially omitted from Team GB's football squad last month. Beckham was on hand to welcome the Olympic torch to the English capital from Athens before it embarked on a 70-day tour around the UK but has ruled out the possibility of lighting the flame inside the Stadium, saying that honor should be bestowed upon a person who has competed at the Games. The 37-year-old told CNN World Sport that he would play a cameo role in Friday's ceremony to officially open the Olympics, which is due to be watched by billions around the globe, but was tight lipped when asked what his part in film director Danny Boyle's show would entail. The 10 strangest Olympic sports . ""No, I'm not allowed to,"" he said. ""But it's exciting, I'm excited to be part of such a huge occasion for our country and for everybody involved in these Games. ""It's exciting to have the Olympic Games in the East End of London and for myself to be part of that, I'm very honored."" Beckham confirmed that his role would not include children, animals or footballs, but when asked if a flame might be involved he replied: ""I think I might have one."" The former England star, who has 115 caps for his country, was part of London's bid team that won the right to stage the biggest sporting spectacle on earth back in 2005 and has worked closely with Games organizers since. Beckham was born in Leytonstone, just three miles from the site of the Olympic Stadium, and said anticipation was building as London prepares to present to the world an event that has been seven long years in the planning. ""It was seven years when this whole process started and being part of bringing the Games to a part of London where I grew up, its exciting to see everything come together,"" he added. ""I was at the stadium yesterday -- I've not been there for a few months -- and to see the change that has happened and also to see the change that's happened around the area, it's really incredible. ""You can feel the atmosphere building around the stadium now, it's great to see the athletes arrive and the interest become bigger."" Beckham had been preparing to participate in the Games, as one of three players over the age of 23 allowed in Team GB's football squad, but he was controversially left out by coach Stuart Pearce. Though he missed out on competing, Beckham says he will try and take his family to as many events as possible, despite trying to juggle his commitments back in America with the Galaxy. He also implored the whole of the United Kingdom to get behind their athletes as they attempt to thrive under the pressure of performing in front of what is sure to be a partisan home crowd. ""I'm interested in all the GB athletes,"" he said. ""I think it's important for us to support every one of them. It's such a huge sporting occasion -- we've got so much talent in our country it's exciting to have so much on display. ""Obviously, I've got a busy week but there will be a few events I'm hoping to get to and take my kids down to so it will be fun, hopefully."" Since Beckham left Manchester United in 2003 he has been based away from the UK, winning a Spanish League title in the last of his four seasons with Real Madrid before moving to the Galaxy in 2007. And though he says his family have been warmly welcomed by the public in the United States since they made the move across the Atlantic, there is no doubt who the Beckham household will be rooting for to win more medals. ""Oh no, (my family's) loyalty obviously lies with Team GB but they'll still be supporting the U.S. team because we've lived there now for six years, we've been bought in by the American public and people in L.A."" Beckham faces a hectic schedule during the Games, none more so than this week where he will return to the States from London to play for the MLS All-Stars against European Champions League winners Chelsea before jetting back for Friday's opening ceremony. But it is a price he is willing to pay to be involved in both showpiece occasions. ""It is what it is,"" he said. ""It's my life, I wouldn't change it or swap it for anything. Obviously, I didn't think I was going to be able to make the MLS All-Stars game but fortunately I can fly over, fly in and fly out. ""It's exciting because I'm very proud to be involved in the All-Star game and to be picked again this year. Coming up against Chelsea, the European Cup winners, it's an exciting thing to be involved in."" One of his commitments in the build up to the Games was to attend an event with former world heavyweight boxing champion, and Olympic gold medallist, Muhammad Ali, a man he regards as one of the greatest sportsmen of all time. ""I don't think there is a bigger sporting icon in the history of sport than Muhammad Ali,"" he explained. ""He stood for so many amazing things and did so many amazing things, his whole career and his whole life was about survival whether it was boxing, whether it was his life in general, whether it was outside of the ring, it was always about survival and for me he's the most amazing sportsman I've ever met.""","David Beckham tells CNN he will have a role in the opening ceremony of the Olympics .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Members of Egypt's Olympic team were given fake Nike gear to wear during training in London, athletes and a distributor said. Synchronized swimmer Yomna Khallaf described the kit Egypt's athletes received in a series of Twitter posts this week. ""The bags for example have (a) big Nike logo in the front and the zippers are Adidas,"" Khallaf wrote. Officials accepted a bid from an unauthorized vendor who offered Nike gear at half the price, according to Adly el-Shafie, the commercial director of Nike's only agent and distributor in Egypt. El-Shafie said he notified Egyptian officials twice that they had purchased counterfeit gear from an unauthorized distributor, but received no response. ""The scandal was clear when Egypt's Olympic fencing team approached us complaining about the sizes of their training kit and attire to be worn around the Olympic Village,"" said el-Shafie, commercial director of Allied Trading and Consulting. A senior official from the Egyptian Olympic Committee's London delegation declined CNN's request for comment. But Egypt's top Olympics official defended the move in an interview with the state-owned Ahram Online news site. ""We bought the clothing from a Nike agent. You can never tell the difference between the original and the fake ones,"" Gen. Mahmoud Ahmed Ali, chairman of the Egyptian Olympic Committee, told Ahram Online. ""All Nike products in the Egyptian market are made in China. They all have the same logo. How can you know?"" Ali urged the U.S.-based company to trace the agent who sold them the counterfeit clothing and to ""sue him."" ""It's like if somebody created false coins and you happened to possess them. Is it your fault then?"" he said. In a statement Thursday, Nike said it was discussing the allegations with Egyptian officials and trying to reach a solution for Egypt's Olympic team, which has 113 athletes competing in 19 sports. ""Nike is highly concerned that if these allegations are true, the athletes will have received products that do not meet Nike's quality standards,"" the company said in a statement. ""Nike's authorized distributor in Egypt sent two official communications to the EOC on this issue weeks ago and on July 20, 2012, Nike also sent a written communication to the EOC requesting the Committee to take immediate action."" Officials responded for the first time Wednesday, Nike said, adding that the company believes the issue with the Egyptian Olympic Committee is an ""isolated incident."" ""We are currently cooperating with the EOC toward reaching a solution within the next 48 hours,"" el-Shafie told CNN on Wednesday. In the meantime, Khallaf said in a Twitter post that she shelled out 2,000 Egyptian pounds ($330) of her own money to buy new gear. ""It's so frustrating that we had to pay extra...to have other proper stuff to wear so that we can look okay, not even good,"" she wrote.","A swimmer says bags have Nike logos and an Adidas zipper .

"(CNN) -- David Haye says he would relish a fight against reigning World Boxing Council (WBC) champion Vitali Klitschko after beating fellow Briton Dereck Chisora at Upton Park football stadium in London on Saturday. ""I held a version of the world heavyweight championship and I would like to regain a version of the world heavyweight championship ... I would love to challenge him for his title,"" Haye said at a news conference. ""After a performance like that and him getting on, if you were one of his advisers you wouldn't tell Vitali to fight me,"" the 31-year-old added. Haye retired after losing to Vitali's brother, Vladimir on points in July 2011, but came out of retirement to fight Chisora after the British pair brawled at a press conference which followed Chisora's loss on points to Vitali in Munich last February. ""I've proved my punching power against someone who pushed Vitali to the wire. It was a measuring stick to show how I performed against his last opponent. I would be very confident of beating Vitali,"" Haye said. But the 40-year-old's future in the sport is uncertain. His next fight against Germany's Manuel Charr is scheduled to take place in Moscow on September 8, but it could be his last as the Ukrainian looks to concentrate on a political career. Former world heavyweight champion, Haye impressed on his return to the ring stopping Chisora in the 5th round of the much-hyped grudge match. The fight was a predictably lively affair, with Haye and Zimbabwe-born Chisora finally exchanging blows after trading a string of insults in the weeks leading up to the fight. Haye vs. Chisora? That's just handbags - watch the women at the Olympics . But it was Haye's power allied to some trademark nimble glove work which finally prevailed as the 10-round fight sanctioned by the Luxembourg Boxing Federation neared the halfway stage. Towards the end of the fifth round, the 31-year old unleashed a devastating left-hook before a follow-up right hand floored Chisora. The Zimbabwe-born fighter made referee Luis Pabon's count comfortably but crashed to the canvas again seconds later following a barrage of punches from Haye. He staggered to his feet a second time but Pabon stopped the fight leaving Haye to milk the cheers from a boisterous 30,000-strong crowd. Sworn enemies before Saturday's fight, Haye and Chisora finished the night exchanging pats, smiles and handshakes in front of photographers, before both publicly declaring a truce to their bitter war of words. ""Whatever beef I had with Dereck before the fight is over now from my side and I hope it's vice versa,"" Haye told Sky Sports. ""After sharing a ring with Dereck I have a new found respect for the man. I had respect for his boxing ability but I never believed he could be as good as he was tonight. He raised his game,"" Haye added. Chisora agreed. The two men had made up and could now ""eat in the same restaurants and go to the same clubs,"" the 28-year-old said. ""It was a great fight and everything is done."" Khan stunned in Las Vegas . It was a less happy night for Briton's Amir Khan, who suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Danny Garcia in their light-welterweight world title clash in Las Vegas. The referee stepped in to stop the fight in the fourth round after WBC champion Garcia launched a series of blistering attacks on Khan which saw the Briton felled three times. ""I always knew I had it in me. I feel like the great fighters bring the best out of me and Khan is a great fighter,"" Garcia said after the fight. Khan, who has now lost three times in 26 professional bouts, posted an message on his official Facebook page saying: ""Can I apologize to my family friends and everyone. I got caught with a shot and I know millions of u are upset but that's boxing for u."" The 25-year-old lost his World Boxing Association (WBA) and International Boxing Federation (IBF) belts to Lamont Peterson in December 2011, but was reinstated as the WBA champion earlier this month after the American failed a drugs test prior to their scheduled rematch in May. The IBF are still to decide on what course of action they will take regarding the original fight.","Former world heavyweight champion David Haye keen to fight Vitali Klitschko after beating Dereck Chisora .

"(CNN) -- It was first blood to South Africa in their battle for cricket supremacy with No.1 ranked England as the tourists wrapped up an innings and 12 runs rout in the first Test at The Oval Monday. South Africa will usurp England as the best Test team in the world with victory in the three-match series and took a giant step towards that goal with their decisive victory. Hashim Amla's record breaking triple century, with admirable support from captain Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis, knocked the stuffing out of England as they spent two days in the field while South Africa amassed 637 for two wickets. Top ranked bowler Dale Steyn finished off the job as England battled to salvage pride and a draw on the final day. He took five wickets for 56 runs to leave England all out for 240 in their second innings. Leg spinner Imran Tahir provided fine back up with 3-63 including the final wicket of James Anderson, trapped leg before wicket to leave the South Africans celebrating and with England to reflect on a rare heavy defeat at home. Smith was delighted to take such a decisive lead in an all important showdown. ""It's certainly an extremely proud moment for all of us to have achieved a Test victory in the first Test of what is a big series and play as well as we have,"" Smith told gathered reporters. England had resumed on the fifth day with four wickets down for 102 runs and still facing a 150 run deficit just to make South Africa bat again. Steyn removed Ravi Bopara for 22, the batsman playing a lazy shot to chop the ball onto his stumps, but this was South Africa's only success as Ian Bell and Matt Prior battled to the lunch break. But Tahir removed Prior for 40 to an ill-judged sweep shot and England's chances of survival sank. Steyn with the second new ball had Bell caught in the slips for a fine 55 and the rest was a formality. Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann both fell to the paceman before Tahir finished off the job. England, who have 122 points at the top of the rankings to 113 for currently third placed South Africa, made a fine start to the match making 267 for three wickets on the first day. But a Morne Morkel inspired collapse saw them all out for 385 on a generally placid batting pitch on day two. South Africa took full advantage as Amla, Smith and Kallis all passed three figures, the former setting a new Test record for his country with 311 not out. He shared the headlines in the morning newspapers in South Africa with their golfing hero Ernie Els, who won the British Open at Royal Lytham and St Annes. The second Test starts at Headingley on Thursday week.","South Africa beat England by an innings and 12 runs in first Test at The Oval .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Twenty years ago, when Paul McCartney turned 50, he remembers his then-manager pushing the idea of retirement. ""It's only right,"" he was told. ""You really don't want to go beyond 50, it's going to get embarrassing."" In June, McCartney will be 70 (""I'm never going to believe I'm 70, I don't care what you say,"" he says. ""There's a little cell in my brain that's never going to believe that""), and he still has no plans to stop touring or recording. ""You get the argument 'Make way for the young kids,' "" he says. ""And you think, 'F*** that, let them make way for themselves. If they're better than me, they'll beat me.' Foo Fighters don't have a problem, they're good. They'll do their thing. ""If you're enjoying it, why do something else? And what would you do? Well, a good answer is 'Take more holidays,' which is definitely on the cards, but I don't seem to do that. I love what I do so much that I don't really want to stop. I'm just kind of casually keeping an eye on how I feel, and onstage, it feels like it's always felt. So for the time being, the band's hot, I'm really enjoying myself, still singing like I sang, not experiencing, touch wood, any sort of problems to speak of. If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" It doesn't hurt that his touring schedule has been reduced to shorter, intense bursts in recent years, largely because of his shared-custody arrangement for his 8-year-old, Beatrice. ""We don't do the big sloggo tour, we don't do the big U2-Stones go-out-forever thing, and get a bit fed up with it,"" says McCartney, who's planning some dates for later this year. ""What we do now is events and selective dates. Because of my custody situation, I can only do that. At first, we thought, 'Oh, God, is this going to be a problem?' and it's actually turned out to be some kind of a blessing."" He can see himself rocking well into his eighties.

I broach the idea of actually dying onstage -- would he be into it? He recoils slightly, then smiles. ""What kind of question is that? I must say, that's not in my imagination. Rocking on until a grand old age... the only thing would be when it's not pleasant anymore, then it would be 'That's a good time to stop.' But it's way too pleasant at the moment. And it pays.

"(CNN) -- ""I don't know the ins and outs of his politics (but) for his procession to become President I was in America and his speeches were spine tingling. Barack Obama can talk, and coming after Bush it was something to behold. In my humble opinion, if he loses the next election to the other bunch then, good Lord, I will run myself."" So says Noel Gallagher, former creative force of British band Oasis and one of rock 'n' roll's biggest mouths. Singer-songwriter, brother to Liam and now a U.S. presidential candidate: 2012 promises to be quite a year for the 45-year-old whose song-writing talent has taken him from unemployment in a city called Manchester in northern England to sell-out stadium tours around the world, playing to millions. By September, Gallagher will have completed the tour of his first solo album since the demise of Oasis in 2009; an expedition entailing 81 shows across Europe, the Pacific (Japan and Australia) and America as well as being a voyage into the unknown for the forthright backing-singer-now-frontman. It was initially intended as a small affair, but such has been the demand for the new record -- ""Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds"" topped the charts in the UK in October 2011-- theaters have rapidly been upgraded to arenas to cope with demand. A move that surprised the man himself and maybe explains the overriding mood of calm satisfaction the guitarist exudes from beneath a leather jacket as he sits down with a coffee to talk to CNN. ""The amount of tickets I've sold, the amount of records I've sold ... I (just) didn't have any expectations for the new record. I thought I might stall at playing theaters for a couple of years but I've gone up to arenas before the end of the first year, so I'm blown away by that. ""Part of me thinks: 'Of course I'll be playing arenas because I'm f****** brilliant and the songs are f****** brilliant so it's inevitable, but the other part of me says I don't have any divine right to do that and I've got to work at it. Turns out, the former was correct! I am very grateful though."" It is not the first time the man dubbed ""The Chief"" by former band mates, has experienced a wave of success. Until 2009, Gallagher had been the artistic catalyst and the calmer half of the capricious brotherly partnership that saw Oasis, with their mix of Beatles melodies and Sex Pistols attitude, conquer charts around the world and become one of the planet's biggest-selling bands. Oasis' second album (What's the story) Morning Glory? broke into the Billboard top ten and sold nearly four million copies in the United States alone. But this figure proved to be seven times the sales of the group's next three albums put together according to USA Today, a position that left many critics to argue that, unlike other British musical exports that had gone before them, the Gallagher's had not been taken to heart by the American music-buying public. It's an assertion the writer of Wonderwall contests. ""We got off on the wrong foot with Americans because they are extremely professional corporate people and we kind of treated that attitude with contempt. The only time we were ever on the cover of Rolling Stone they set aside eight hours for a photo shoot. Eight hours! I think we stayed for an hour ... and they couldn't believe it. (But) we just couldn't understand why you have to enter into theatrics with Rolling Stone magazine on a day off, because we were s***-kickers from the streets and didn't have time for that. ""Four American tours in a row were either never started or never finished (with Oasis) and we were subtitled on television because of our accents ... basically people couldn't understand a word we were saying. We also didn't have a front man like Bono or Chris Martin, we had a different kind of front-man who was like Johnny Rotten, but I don't think anybody ... would look back at it with regret, we did what we did on our own terms."" A staunch defense maybe of a band Gallagher currently has no plans to reform, but for someone so imbued with a British identity, the new album has particularly strong American sentiments. The new band includes an American guitarist, the first single release -- 'The Death of You and Me' -- has a New Orleans-style brass section, and the videos for all the singles so far -- including 'Dream On' and 'AKA ... What a Life!' -- have a 1970's Americana theme with Noel as a central figure. Despite this, when asked if this had been a conscious thematic move, Gallagher remains adamant there is no new ambition to ""crack"" the United States. ""(Oasis) never had a number one album, we had a number two album ... we nearly got there. I don't even know what cracking America is supposed to be though? If it's playing arenas everywhere, 10 thousand people a night then we did it. Not that I've got to justify it but we did sell out the Hollywood Bowl and Madison Square Gardens regularly and I've got gold and platinum discs (and) the house to prove it, Sonny Jim (sic). We never won any Grammys, we never got nominated, but those people like Green Day and Hootie and the Blowfish; f*** me, enough said."" The solo album has received good reviews broadly speaking so far. Rolling Stone magazine gave it 3.5 out of five with the recommendation that Noel had: ""Cook(ed) down the Beatles' LSD pop into MDMA head-rushes like Oasis did, he does his old band proud. ""Shout it out for me!"" he declares in 'Dream On,' making you want to do just that."" So did the album feel like a renaissance as it was being created? ""I've made enough of my records to know this was a pretty good bunch of songs. When I heard the final mixes, I wanted to stand behind them, they were good. Whether it gets five stars out of five or seven out of ten doesn't make it any better or worse an album for me - or if it sells 700 thousand compared to 100 thousand - it is a good album because it is. ""Every album I've ever been involved in, on the day that it came out I believed in it. Believed in them all equally but it's evident that Morning Glory and Definitely Maybe have lasted for 18 years and some of them haven't. We won't know where this sits in the canon of what I've done for another five years but I'm confident it will be up there though, in fact I know it will."" The music on the new album breaks new ground for Gallagher, both in musical terms -- the Dixieland band on 'The Death of You and Me' and the driving, repetitive beats of 'Everybody's on the Run' and 'AKA ... What a Life!'-- and in the song's lyrical content. They verge, even revel, in romance. ""I don't know how that happened! My wife would say I'm not romantic at all but I would say that I'm the ultimate romancer because I write about ... life being brilliant. Not like the Indie (independent) music scene where I come from, they like to sing about the news don't they? There's nothing good on the news. You're not telling me CNN is all cats in trees are you? Nothing can be that good if Piers Morgan is in it, you know what I mean? ""So the themes (of the album are) escapism, love, romance; to be on a journey - though I don't like that word, people say that on reality shows don't they - you know when a fat person becomes skinny they've been on a amazing journey. No they haven't, they've been on an amazing treadmill. Basically, the album includes brilliant and very well crafted songs, deceptively fantastic lyrics, all brilliantly played with the minimum of fuss and which are criminally underrated particularly in America,"" Gallagher surmises in unabashed appraisal. But though his unshakable faith in his music remains the same as his halcyon days with Oasis, touring is now a different proposition. As a father of three life on the road now also means life apart from his young family too. ""The boys (Donovan and Sonny) don't like me going away but I can't wait until they're old enough so I can explain to them: 'You see all this all this multi-colored stuff (in our house), where do you think it comes from? Well, it doesn't come form Father Christmas, somebody's got to work for it and that somebody is me. So you jog on and go to bed and I'll see you in a month.'"" And with that Noel Gallagher leaves the room to prepare for his latest arena show, played on this occasion in the Scottish city of Glasgow, a stone's throw from the tiny venue where Oasis were first discovered all those years ago. Maybe now it is time for establishment acceptance of Gallagher in America, even if it is not in the White House.","Noel Gallagher, 45, is former musical force behind British band Oasis .

"(Rolling Stone) -- It's been four years since Brandy released her last album ""Human"" and many things have changed, including her. ""I'm reinventing myself and I feel fearless,"" Brandy told Rolling Stone. ""I haven't done R&B in a very long time. This album is rooted in R&B. The sound is different, it's about love. It's mature, it's gritty, it's edgy."" The former teen star and mother of one is hard at work on her sixth album and recently wrapped the video for her first single, a duet with Monica called ""It All Belongs To Me."" This is first time the two have recorded together since their 1998 Grammy Award winning hit, ""The Boy Is Mine."" ""Monica and I have a bond as women and as mothers, working with her doesn't feel like work,"" Brandy says. ""Chris Robinson directed the video and we're both in dysfunctional relationships. We're helping each other through both situations, it's sort of like a 'Thelma & Louise,' girl empowerment video."" Recruiting producers like Rico Love, who wrote and produced ""It All Belongs To Me,"" Jim Jonsin, Danja, Timbaland, Chris Brown and longtime collaborator Rodney Jerkins, Brandy's also seeing what two Canadians have to offer. ""I heard the song that Drake did and I loved it,"" Brandy says of working with the Cash Money MC and his primary producer Noah ""40"" Shebib. ""I haven't recorded it yet but I'm looking forward to it because it's such a great melody and the beat is nice. It's a vibe that I haven't dipped into and I think the fans would get a kick out of hearing my voice over a record like that. I'm not sure if Drake's going to be on it but I'm a huge fan of his. His melodies are beautiful, I like the way I sound in the shower singing his songs."" Singer-songwriter Frank Ocean is also contributing to her new project, and according to Brandy, their relationship is more than just professional. ""He's like a little brother to me,"" Brandy says. ""He wrote a song called 'Scared of Beautiful' about women who are afraid to be beautiful in their full potential as women. I've been there before so I know a lot of women can relate."" Despite moving from her initial record label home Atlantic to Epic and now RCA, Brandy says she finally feels supported. ""RCA reminds me of how Atlantic used to be, they really believed in my vision as an artist when they signed me at 14,"" she shares. ""RCA welcomed me and Breyon Prescott and Peter Edge showed such passion for what I wanted to do."" See the full article at Rolling Stone.

But thankfully, Apple's back this year, and to celebrate, she's giving the world what she knows it wants: another alarmingly long album title. It's 67 words shorter than than her last long-titled album, but the songstress' new one is still a 23-word-deep doozy. Here it is in all its randomly capitalized glory: .

"London (CNN) -- The chairman of the London 2012 organizing group Friday rejected concerns over security staffing ahead of the Olympic Games, which start in two weeks. Sebastian Coe told reporters he was ""extraordinarily impressed with"" private contractor G4S so far. His comments follow the announcement by the British government Thursday that an extra 3,500 military personnel are needed to cover a shortfall in recruitment by G4S. Coe said he was happy with the security staff on site and that while G4S has ""challenges,"" it will get there. No one can underestimate the task ahead, he said. Coe would not comment on the ""robust"" contract the organizing committee (LOCOG) has with G4S. Home Secretary Theresa May addressed the issue Thursday. ""There is no question of Olympic security being compromised,"" May said. Going to the Games, or watching from home? Send us your pictures and videos . She said it became clear Wednesday that G4S was not able to provide all the security staff it had promised to the organizers of the London Olympic Games. The government's decision to bring in additional troops, on top of the 13,500 already agreed, was the appropriate response to the shortfall in G4S staff, she said. The deployment means 17,000 troops will be on duty in the United Kingdom during the Games, compared with the 9,500 currently in Afghanistan. G4S had been expected to recruit a staff of more than 10,000 as part of a total security force of 23,700 for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. It will still provide several thousand personnel. A G4S statement Thursday said the company has about 4,000 people at work across 100 venues and has more than 9,000 others going through the required vetting, training and accreditation process. British newspaper reports Friday highlighted concerns over the training given to G4S recruits and the use of thousands of young people in security roles. G4S said the scheme to involve young people was run by LOCOG and was aimed at students. ""While they form a vital part of the security workforce, they will be performing more of a support function than the trained security personnel from G4S, or the armed forces,"" a spokesman said in a statement. Young people do a ""fantastic job"" in a similar role at the annual Wimbledon tennis championships, and there's no reason to think they won't perform well at London 2012, the spokesman said. Britain is on a heightened state of alert ahead of the Games, which open on July 27. CNN's Jim Boulden and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","NEW: Security firm G4S says young people employed for the Olympics will do a good job .

"(Rolling Stone) -- For most of his life he's been Gene Ween, the nimble-voiced frontman of one of rock's great genre-hoppers -- but Aaron Freeman is finally ready to put his alter-ego to bed. ""It's time to move on,"" Freeman told Rolling Stone from his home in New Jersey. ""I'm retiring Gene Ween."" So does that mean the end for Ween, the band that Freeman formed with high school friend Mickey Melchiondo (a.k.a. Dean Ween) in New Hope, Pennsylvania, in the mid-Eighties? ""Pretty much, yeah,"" says Freeman. ""It's been a long time, 25 years. It was a good run."" Freeman, who released his solo debut ""Marvelous Clouds"" earlier this month, says there's no animosity towards his bandmates or Melchiondo, who he met in the eighth grade. He says the pair are still on speaking terms, even though he's been contemplating the decision for the past eight years. ""For me it's a closed book. In life sometimes, in the universe, you have to close some doors to have others open,"" says Freeman. ""There's no, 'Godd**n that such and such!' For me, I'd like to think it's a door I can close finally."" Freeman and Melchiondo released a slew of home-recorded tapes in the Eighties before they tasted unlikely MTV success in 1992 with ""Push th' Little Daisies,"" from their major-label debut ""Pure Guava."" After that novelty single, Ween went on to release albums that reflected their intense love of music, from metal to MOR and all points in between. On 1996's ""Golden Country Greats,"" they brought in Nashville session players for an album of country originals, while saxophonist David Sanborn guested on ""Your Party,"" from Ween's most recent album, 2007's ""La Cucaracha."" But question marks over Ween's future were raised following an onstage meltdown by Freeman at a show in Vancouver last year. The singer spent several weeks in an Arizona rehab facility battling substance abuse issues. Back at home and in good spirits, he says that his solo debut helped him get back on track. ""It's a nice recovery record, definitely,"" he says. Like most of Ween's oeuvre, ""Marvelous Clouds"" is another unexpected detour: a covers album of tunes by the reclusive Sixties songwriter Rod McKuen. In his heyday, McKuen was penning songs for the likes of Frank Sinatra, Johnny Cash and Perry Como, but he's become somewhat of an obscure figure since he retired from the stage in the early-Eighties. ""I was struck by the simplicity and power of songs,"" says Freeman, who came to McKuen through ""Golden Country Greats"" producer Ben Vaughn. ""Anybody that can accomplish that kind of thing is great."" Freeman recently spent an afternoon with the 79-year-old singer in his Beverly Hills home. ""He's got this incredible studio downstairs in his house -- it hasn't been touched since 1973. He's got a room full of master tapes ... He's got probably thousands of songs that haven't seen the light of day."" So is another volume of McKuen covers on the cards? ""I could make five more Rod McKuen records, but that could get a little weird,"" jokes Freeman, who plans on releasing an album of original material next. ""It's important to know that this isn't a side project. I'm forging a new thing for myself. So that's all. There's no plans for any records or touring for Ween from my end.""

"(Rolling Stone) -- While gearing up to take Poison on tour with Def Leppard this summer, Michaels found time to assemble an all-star cast of guests for his new LP, ""Bret Michaels and Friends: Get Your Rock On,"" due out in September. ""Every song on it is a collaboration with other musicians,"" says Michaels. ""And it's such a diverse range of people, from Loretta Lynn and Joe Perry [who play on a reworking of the Poision hit ""Every Rose Has Its Thorn""] and Jimmy Buffett to Lil Jon, Michael Anthony, Ace Frehley, all the Skynyrd guys, guys from .38 Special and Blackfoot and Rascal Flatts' Jay [DeMarcus]. These are friends and people I've played with, partied with, jammed with throughout the years."" A new rendition of Poison's ""Nothin' But a Good Time"" unites Frehley, Anthony and Lil Jon. ""Ace Frehley is the real deal,"" says Michaels. ""He laid down this amazing solo and then Michael Anthony came in, he did the backups, and I was like, 'Just play some Michael Anthony licks.' He did, and that's what made magic on the song."" While many of the featured artists are now friends of Michaels, they started off as his rock & roll heroes. That's most apparent on his rendition of ""Sweet Home Alabama."" ""I did [it] with all the guys from Lynyrd Skynyrd, the guys from Blackfoot and .38 Special,"" he says. ""That was amazing because probably my first foot in the door as a child was traditional country, then I got turned onto the Beatles and Stones. Then I immediately fell in love with Southern rock, which was kind of a perfect mixture of country and rock."" Michaels isn't done recruiting collaborators. He hopes to get Zakk Wylde to come in and redo ""Go That Far,"" the theme from Rock of Love. And after checking out Cheap Trick in concert recently, he got another idea. ""I'd like to get Rick Nielsen to come in to play on 'Talk Dirty to Me,'"" he says. ""I think that'd be great to have him come in and put his style on a song that I remade in an over-the-top, punk-metal fashion."" Though Michaels says, ""This could be the never-ending record,"" he's focused on finishing the LP and can't help but get excited about the prospects of future collaborations. ""If I was to do another one of these records, it's overwhelming the amount of possibilities,"" he says. ""I've been onstage with Jimmy Page, he's come and played with Poison in Reno, Nevada, and it was an amazing night. And last year, I played with Toby Keith and partied with him.

"(CNN) -- Brooklyn noise-pop duo Derek Miller and Alexis Krauss, aka Sleigh Bells, may have just released ""Reign of Terror,"" the follow-up to their critically acclaimed debut, ""Treats,"" but, believe it or not, they have only written one song together so far. ""Comeback Kid,"" the lead single and last song that made it to ""Reign of Terror,"" was their first collaborative effort. As Sleigh Bells' story of origin goes: Miller, a former guitarist for the Florida hardcore band Poison the Well, was writing what would become ""Treats"" while waiting tables in New York. He served Alexis Krauss, a former teen-pop singer, and her mother. Miller mentioned he was looking for a singer for his unfinished demos and Krauss' mom stepped in to broker the deal. Miller and Krauss recorded ""Treats"" and, within a year, they went from strangers to the pair behind one of the best albums of 2010. At the same time the group was taking off, Miller was struggling with both the sudden death of his father in a motorcycle crash and his mother being diagnosed with cancer. He wrote everything but ""Comeback Kid"" during this dark period. ""'Reign of Terror' isn't a clever title,"" he has said. ""That's what I felt like I was going through the last two years."" Now, things are looking up. Miller's mother is doing well, the album has scored top reviews, Sleigh Bells performed on ""Saturday Night Live"" and Miller is already working on new material. For their third album, he says, Krauss' influence will be much more obvious. In the meantime, the band is opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on tour and they have announced more summer shows. CNN: How did coming up through the Florida hardcore scene affect what we hear in Sleigh Bells today? Derek Miller: That's the music that was happening in my backyard and it was a great outlet for all of the directionless anger and aggression that young men have when you hit puberty. Just angry at the world for no g--d--- reason. Hardcore was perfect for me. Up until that point, I was as determined to become a professional surfer, but after I got a guitar, it took over my entire life. I just never left my room. And it hasn't really changed since. I mean, I've since become a producer and gotten into beat making, but that was it. That was the shift. CNN: Since you hadn't worked with Alexis before ""Treats,"" was there a particular a-ha moment when you knew there was something to your collaboration? Miller: I could hear it. I'm not saying that I knew the music was really good, I'm just saying that I knew it deserved to exist. I didn't how it would be received, but I knew that, at the very least, I had broken through that wall of mediocrity that I had been smashing myself against for so long. I knew it. I was like, oh my God, finally. This is what I've been waiting for. I can't tell you how excited I was. It came at a very dark time and I just completely made it my life. The whole thing seemed so improbable. I had been waiting tables for four years. I was the waiter who was going to make records and I'd tell anyone and everyone. And they were like, yeah, yeah, that's nice. An old Poison the Well fan came in to the restaurant and recognized me. He had a Poison the Well tattoo and I showed my manager; I was like, look, this is my old band! See? And he'd be like, that's very nice Mr. Miller, but can you please bus table 22? CNN: It seems like from the moment you two hooked up, success with Sleigh Bells came very quickly. Did it feel that way for you as well? Miller: I'm comfortable with the perception that it happened very quickly, even though I know how hard I worked on it for so many years and how much growing I had to do, how many horrible mediocre songs I wrote and threw away. But nobody needs to hear about that. From the outside looking in, it looks like it happened very quickly. I think the reason we've been able to really sustain it and turn it into something other than a flash in the pan is because there's a lot of work and a lot of serious focus. I was working very hard for it for a long time and failing. CNN: What did you learn from the success of ""Treats"" that you brought into ""Reign of Terror""? Miller: Creatively, it was as simple as having a guitar in my hands every night. That is a boring answer, but before we went on tour for ""Treats,"" I hadn't been on tour since I was 22 and I got into production. All I was thinking about was rhythm and I was making a lot of beats, then suddenly I'm on tour for 15 months playing guitar on stage every night. It was just by proximity that I just started writing on guitar again. CNN: What were some of your influences? Miller: Lyrically, I worked through a lot of the stuff that was f--king my head up on ""Reign of Terror"" and it helped me grow. This is borderline corny, but it was really therapeutic. It was like one long therapy session for me, just sort of working out some things. ""Hysteria,"" the Def Leppard record, had a really strong grip on me. I love the songs, but especially the production as well. What Mutt Lange put on that record, I was obsessed with. But I'm moving away from those influences. I've been working on a ton of new stuff and branching out so it's an exciting time. I'm in a much better headspace and I think that that's reflected in the new stuff, which obviously won't be out for a little while, but the spark is there. CNN: What direction will the new material be taking? Miller: I'm going to be collaborating a lot more with Alexis this time around. We got a lot closer on ""Reign of Terror,"" but really the last song we worked on was ""Comeback Kid."" I sort of just gave her the instrumental. I had the lyric and half an idea for a melody, but that's our first true collaboration and it's my favorite song on the record. I think really we have not utilized any of her talents. She is incredibly gifted when it comes to coming up with really memorable melodies, what I consider to be great melodies. There's so much of her in ""Comeback Kid"" and I love it. I happen to play in a band with her, but I'm also a fan. CNN: So you don't ever resent her getting more attention than you even when you created the whole band and the music initially? Miller: I actually push that, to be honest. We just did the cover of Spin magazine. When I saw that it's just a beautiful portrait of her, I was like, yes! Thank God! I'm not self-loathing or particularly insecure in my day-to-day, but I really hate being photographed. I hate looking at pictures of myself. I immediately just start tearing it apart. It's a lot like the creative process as well. I'm just really, really hard on myself. I like having her be the face of the band. She loves performing and she loves being photographed and she loves making videos. She looks great and she's confident. I'm the polar opposite. Even live, I'm never front-lit. I prefer to have the music speak for me. CNN: How was it for you to perform on ""Saturday Night Live""? Miller: I didn't want to do ""SNL,"" but we couldn't say no. You're a total a**hole if you turn it down. The only reason not to do it would be fear of failure. Like I said before, I know failure very well. I don't want to get into it, but I was particularly unimpressed by our performance. I watched it once and I'll never watch it again. But ""SNL"" was an incredible experience. CNN: How did opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on tour come about? Miller: Flea came out to a show in New York City and somebody introduced him to me. He was like, hey, I'm Flea. I obviously knew who he was. He was incredibly nice and he was like, would you guys be interested in playing shows with my band? I was like, you mean the Red Hot Chili Peppers? Sure! It was literally that simple. There was no politicking, no agents or anything. It was just dude to dude. I really appreciated that. I think they're all going to be really great people and I'm pretty psyched on it. They're one of the biggest touring bands on Earth, which is a strange sentence. They're, like, top two or three on the planet. I'm interested to see how a production like that works.","Sleigh Bells has released their second album, ""Reign of Terror""

"(CNN) -- To an outsider, Dr. Dog has all the makings for the stereotypical ""eighth-graders start making scrappy recordings in their home and become overnight sensations"" ""Behind the Music"" special. Only nothing about the band's success -- which includes six albums, performances on ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon"" and ""Conan,"" among others, and touring as an opening act for My Morning Jacket -- has come overnight. ""We've been doing it for a long time,"" said Scott McMicken, one of the band's founding members and lead vocalists. Co-founder Toby Leaman, the band's bass player who shares lead vocal responsibilities with McMicken, agrees. ""I feel like everything we've done has been this slow burn,"" Leaman said. True, despite the guys knowing each other for 20 years, Dr. Dog isn't exactly living the large, rock-star life that fans might think. ""It's kind of disappointing,"" McMicken said with a laugh, ""Twenty years and this is it? ""If I was not me and I saw me -- I would assume, 'This guy's got like a million bucks. He's a superstar. He's been on ""David Letterman."" His life is insane.' But (that life) has nothing to do with mine,"" he said. In almost two decades of existence, Dr. Dog has been able to make a living with its music, currently headlining a tour to promote the album ""Be the Void."" ""We worked hard for it,"" McMicken said of the band's accomplishments. McMicken and Leaman met in suburban Philadelphia in the 1990s when they were in the eighth grade, and the duo began a creative relationship that involved writing and recording songs onto tapes. Unlike bands that develop a following on the road, Dr. Dog evolved in the opposite direction. They made an impression on fans in the Philadelphia area and enjoyed creating songs at their home studio. Not until McMIcken's then-girlfriend slipped a copy of an album to My Morning Jacket frontman Jim James did the possibility of Dr. Dog becoming a touring band ever come up. Liking what he heard on the album, James sent the members of Dr. Dog a ""really nice letter,"" McMicken recalled, asking if they'd like to come on tour. The letter also asked a lot of questions and sought details about Dr. Dog to which McMicken didn't have the answers. He finally had to say to James, ""This band is just some dudes in a basement."" Joining My Morning Jacket on tour proved to be a valuable experience, and group members credit that band with giving them their ""first step into working"" as a touring act. But both McMicken and Leaman remain the most passionate about writing and recording a song. Leaman said, ""The process is the important part. ... It's the only thing with real meaning."" There is a vulnerability involved in writing a song and bringing to the band to play for the first time, he said. The results can be and have been ""devastating,"" he said. But for the most part, ""(The song) becomes everybody's and that's my favorite part,"" he said. McMicken agreed. ""Sometimes it's terrifying,"" he said of the band connecting to a song and playing it together for the first time. ""As soon as you realize you have something, you are aware that it can fall apart."" That same feeling of fragility doesn't apply to the band, McMicken said. During a long career, Dr. Dog has signed with different labels, seen members come and go and brought new ones aboard. And yet the band has remained true to the process, allowing members a level of success with ""more opportunities and more time to play with,"" McMicken said. And if the ability to make a living touring and selling records went away, he said he'd be just fine. ""We did this to no reward for so long and were completely unconscious of that fact for so long. And we still got so much out of it,"" he said.","Dr. Dog has recorded six albums and performed on ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon"" and ""Conan""

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Several dozen protesters picketed a cultural center in Kiev, Ukraine, on Saturday as part of continued demonstrations against a controversial regional languages bill. At least 12 people have joined a hunger strike over the past two weeks in protest of the bill, introduced in May by the ruling Party of Regions. One student was hospitalized Saturday in life-threatening condition after seven days on hunger strike, according to Kiev Mohilyan Academy, where the young woman studies. In total, four protesters have been admitted to clinics for treatment over the past three days, Ukraine's health ministry and the protest movement said. The protesters fear that the future of the Ukrainian language will be severely undermined by the bill, which aims to provide regional status to the 18 languages spoken by ethnic minorities in Ukraine, including Russian, Romanian and Tatar. Under the bill, minorities would be able to have their mother tongue taught in schools and use those languages in official documents, among other benefits. The architect of the bill -- parliament deputy from the ruling party Vadim Kolesnichenko -- says such legislation is necessary if Ukraine wants to become part of the European Union. ""We've had many checks on the human rights issues in Ukraine by European organizations -- and they noticed many violations. Minority languages has been one of them. Our bill is written in full compliance with the European charter for minority languages, which is aimed at preserving minority languages and protecting them,"" Kolesnichenko said. The bill doesn't stipulate that Ukraine may have several official state languages -- something which can be changed only through a nationwide referendum. However the opposition insists that providing even a regional status to the Russian language -- widely spoken in 13 regions of the country by roughly 20 million people -- would severely undermine the development of the Ukrainian language. The protesters fear that should the use of Russian be legalized, nobody would want to learn Ukrainian. Parliament sessions in recent months on the controversial bill have erupted in fistfights between Ukraine's legislators as deputies opposing the bill clashed with those from the ruling party. Earlier this month, the bill passed the second hearing in the Rada with 248 deputies voting for it. The opposition claims the vote was rigged and called on President Viktor Yanukovich not to ratify the bill and prevent it from becoming law. The president hasn't yet responded to those demands. ""We issued an ultimatum to the authorities to abolish this bill. There has been no intention or even a hint from President Yanukovich that he could do so. That's why our hunger strike would continue for weeks or months -- as long as we are alive,"" said Oleksandr Mishura, a member of the protest movement. Valeriy Shevchenko traveled to Kiev on Saturday all the way from a village in Western Ukraine to participate. ""We have to defend our language and our culture -- the two things most dear to us,"" he said. While protesters continue their standoff, the government is producing few comments on the matter. The final say is with Yanukovich, who is still weighing whether to put his signature on the bill, but promises to respect all sides of the conflict. But Ukraine's leader already said that if the crisis is not resolved, a dissolution of parliament and an early ballot cannot be ruled out.","Protests, including a hunger strike, have been ongoing for the past two weeks .

"(CNN) -- No doubt there is a sizeable audience primed for the latest Nicholas Sparks flick, and chances are quite a chunk of that crowd is looking forward to seeing how former teen idol Zac Efron sizes up now he's graduated from ""High School Musical."" Well, he's bulked up quite a bit, and he's sporting something a little more than stubble, but the strong, silent type is not his natural forte. In ""The Lucky One,"" Efron plays Logan, a Marine with three tours of Iraq under his belt. If he's come out alive he owes it to the photograph of a pretty girl he picks up in the rubble one day -- a snapshot that seems like a lucky talisman, protecting him while so many of his comrades fall. Back home, he swears he will track down his guardian angel and tell her what she has meant to him. The lighthouse in the background gives him a clue as to where to start. They say that some soldiers develop a thousand-yard stare in combat. Whether that's what the 24-year-old star was aiming for is hard to say, but he sleepwalks through this tearjerker with a blank look and delivers his (admittedly awful) lines with numb detachment. If Efron's going to make it as leading man he's going to have to dig a lot deeper than this. Because nature abhors a vacuum, Taylor Schilling (""Mercy"") steps it up and brings at least a modicum of life to the party as Beth, the divorced Louisiana kennel-owner who happens to be in the market for a dog walker. Having walked all the way from Colorado with his German Shepherd Zeus, Logan seems disturbingly well qualified. As for the plot, there isn't one. Beth has a gifted, but insecure son (Riley Thomas Stewart), one of those wry grandmas you see in this kind of movie (Blythe Danner), and an ex-husband with a sheriff's badge and a real bad attitude (Jay R. Ferguson, from ""Mad Men""). Logan walks the dogs, mends the guttering, fixes the tractor and bonds with the boy. No wonder Beth gets into a lather washing the dishes as she watches him. He even gets her motorboat ticking over again. Director Scott Hicks (""Shine"") bathes the whole show in an amber halo that makes the Deep South look like an antiseptic shampoo commercial and shies away from anything that might be dramatically sticky, complex or even halfway interesting. The ex is such a boorish bully it's laughable when Logan assures him he's ""not a bad guy"" (this after the drunken cop has threatened to shoot him and his dog); Logan himself has the opposite problem -- he's just too good to be true. It's nice to see that Sparks believes in virtue and decency and everyone just getting along. But virtue untested is not much of a subject, and this slight, unconvincing romance is a walk on the mild side.","The strong, silent type is not Zac Efron's natural forte .

"(CNN) -- It's been a busy year for the British royal family. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall alone covered almost 48,000 miles to undertake 804 official engagements between April 2011 and the end of March this year. So who pays the bills? Prince Charles' office at Clarence House released its annual review Friday, shedding light on how money is spent on the couple, as well as Princes William and Harry and, of course, the newest addition to the family, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. As the queen's eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales, is mostly funded by the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate consisting of more than 200 square miles of agricultural, commercial and residential land mostly in southwest England. In the 2011-12 fiscal year, the prince's private income from the duchy rose by 3% to slightly more than $28.5 million. He received an additional $3.42 million in public funding from Parliament and government departments, a year-on-year increase of 11.8%. With more private and public income, Prince Charles' household spending increased by 4.1% to $15.3 million, and all 135 full-time staff members received a pay raise of 3%. Nine of those employees work for Princes William and Harry, and for Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. So what is the expense of the royal family's newest member? ""It's actually quite minimal,"" said Prince Charles' communications secretary, Paddy Harverson, ""There's been quite a lot of focus on things like clothes but actually, when you look at the numbers, it's mostly absorbed into the existing expenditure."" A royal aide added that it would be ""rather impolite"" to disclose how much money had been spent on the dresses that hit front pages of newspapers around the world every time Catherine steps out in public. What we do know, though, is that Prince Charles pays for his daughter-in-law's outfits for official engagements out of his private income. Anti-monarchy groups such as Republic have criticized the royal family for using public money to travel. ""Prince Charles gives little back to the country yet has a deeply held sense of entitlement when it comes to accessing public funds,"" Chief Executive Graham Smith said Friday. ""We believe time is long overdue that the government brought royal spending under proper control."" However, Harverson maintains: ""Members of the royal family do a huge amount of work. ... We really feel it's fantastic value for money. As it happens, 90% of it is his (Prince Charles') own income, so it's not coming from central government coffers."" Royal aides champion the continued success of the prince's group of 16 charities as the greatest example of the royal family giving back to the public. Between April 2011 and the end of March this year, the Prince of Wales directly or indirectly raised more than $200 million for his charities, which support young people, the environment and enterprise. After last year's royal wedding and the recent Diamond Jubilee celebrations, polls have showed that the British royal family is as popular as ever. Riding high on that wave is the household of the Prince of Wales, as exemplified by the 76,825 letters received from the public in 2011-12. That is more than double the mail from the previous year.","Clarence House releases its annual review of royal household costs .

"London (CNN) -- French swimmer Yannick Agnel won his second gold of a triumphant Olympics with a dominant performance in Monday's 200 meters freestyle final. South Korean swimmer Tae-Hwan Park and Yang Sun, of China, share silver after both finishing with a time of 1 minute 44.93 seconds. American medal hope Ryan Lochte struggled to keep up with his rivals as he finished fourth. ""Not so happy about that swim tonight... you live and learn. Tomorrow I will be better,"" Lochte tweeted. French President Francois Holland was in the crowd to see Agnel recorded the fastest time ever by a Frenchman, as Agnel demolished a strong field. Park, Sun, Agnel and Lochte had already won medals in London. The cheering Holland enjoyed his compatriot Agnel repeat his performance from the 4x100m relay, where he surged past Lochte in the final leg to claim gold, to claim another French swimming gold. With three gold medals, the French are now one short of their swimming gold medal total from all previous Olympics. The U.S. did enjoy some success in the pool later, with two consecutive gold medals ensuring they ended the day second in the medal table. Seventeen year old Missy Franklin claimed her first ever gold medal in the 100 meters backstroke, barely twenty minutes after competing in the 200 meter freestyle semi-finals. Australian Emily Seebohm won silver, with Aya Terakawa taking bronze for Japan. Matt Grevers, the six foot eight inch American, set a new Olympic record to claim the men's 100 meter backstroke title. Nick Thoman made it an American one-two, with Ryosuke Irie claiming another bronze for Japan. In the 100 meter breaststroke final, fifteen year-old Lithuanian Ruta Meilutyte edged out American world champions Rebecca Soni by eight-hundredths of a second to win Lithuania's first ever swimming gold. ""I tried to retain my speed with a little sprint over the last 50. I'm really happy it worked."" ""I guess sometimes you win, sometimes you lose,"" Lochte told the Canadian Broadcasting Company. ""There's no doubt about it. Agnel's quick and he showed it last night and tonight. I'm happy for him.""","French swimmer Yannick Agnel wins his second gold, Park, Sun share silver .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- The American exploration vessel ""Nautilus"" was supposed to begin broadcasting its undersea archeological and environmental exploration of the Black Sea July 7, according to the expedition's Facebook page. Instead, two days before the launch date, the ship was in Syrian territorial waters in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, assisting with the recovery of the bodies of two Turkish pilots killed when their reconnaissance jet was shot down by Syrian anti-aircraft defenses. The military search and recovery operation marked an unexpected change of course for a research expedition led by Robert Ballard, the undersea explorer who gained fame for discovering the wreckage of the Titanic in the Atlantic Ocean in the 1980s. Syria, Turkey spar over downed jet . ""I think it was our luck that the Nautilus was already docked in Istanbul,"" said Selcuk Unal, a spokesman for Turkey's foreign ministry. ""It had (previously) applied and been approved by our government to perform scientific research in the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea."" Unal told CNN that after the Turkish Phantom RF-4 reconnaissance jet was shot down June 22, Turkish authorities recognized the need for resources capable of operating at extreme depths for the salvage operation. ""When this incident happened, we immediately looked into our resources, including the military and private sector,"" Unal said. But he added that few governments or corporations had submersibles capable of traveling to depths of more than 1,000 meters. The Nautilus, however, specializes in this type of work. ""E/V Nautilus is a 211-foot research vessel equipped with state-of-the-art exploration and telepresence technology,"" said a statement on the expedition's official website. ""Our rotating Corps of Exploration aboard Nautilus will be mapping the geological, biological, archaeological and chemical aspects of these regions to depths of approximately 2,000 meters."" The website also said the Nautilus was equipped with several remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) that typically worked at extreme depths. ""We started to talk to them,"" Unal explained. ""They were kind enough to postpone their scientific research for some time and join the search and rescue operation... they departed Istanbul immediately, and they arrived to the search and rescue area in two-and-a-half days."" Opinion: Why do planes still crash? The Turkish military already had a number of vessels and aircraft operating in the crash zone, an area within Syrian territorial waters. But the operation was tense; Turkish officials said Syrian defenses opened fire on a second Turkish plane that was brought in after the Phantom RF-4 was initially shot down. Turkish officials say the Nautilus is effectively under Turkish military command while participating in the recovery operation. ""We can't risk anything,"" Unal said. ""As part of our agreement, there are still people as we speak from my ministry and from the navy and Turkish air force for coordination purposes on board the Nautilus."" According to a Turkish military statement, the ""Nautilus ship continued a deep search at points determined by Turkish Coast Guard (ship) Cesme by sonar, on 3-4 July, 2012, and the bodies of our pilots and some parts of the plane were reached."" The bodies of Gokhan Ertan and Hasan Huseyin Aksoy were recovered Thursday. They await a memorial ceremony at a Turkish airbase in Malatya on Friday. When contacted by CNN, a spokeswoman for the Nautilus' National Geographic-affiliated expedition said the group would not be commenting on its participation in the Turkish recovery operation. Scientists at the expedition's command center on the campus of the University of Rhode Island also said they could not comment on the emergency operation, though one scientist told a colleague that after the unexpected delay, he was ""eager to get back to doing science"" as soon as possible. The Turkish armed forces have released photographs of pieces of the downed Turkish jet resting on the Mediterranean sea bed. It is highly likely that the photographs were taken by the Nautilus' ROVs. These photos could hold valuable evidence about what weapon was used to shoot down the jet. The Syrian government insists anti-aircraft cannons brought the jet down when it flew within sight of the Syrian coast. Turkey says the jet was flying 13 nautical miles off the Syrian shore, in international airspace, when it was struck by a Syrian surface-to-air missile. Syria's president suggested the military may have thought it was a plane belonging to Israel.

"Farnborough, England (CNN) -- There's no better feeling when you're showing off to your friends. Sharing with them something you are proud and excited about. After giving journalists a tour pointing out features around the cabin of his new Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al Baker became excited. He said goodbye to me and hello to Willie Walsh. Akbar attentively showed him every nook and cranny of the aircraft, crouching down to recline the new business class seat that Willie was in, showing him the new touch screen control panels and glossy fold away trays. As we plugged in the microphone to ask Willie one question about what he thought of the plane, they headed to the front. After waiting for a few minutes, I crept forward to have a quick look what was going on. The cockpit was packed. Suddenly I heard ""Ayesha!!"" the CEO of Gulf Air Samer Majali's head emerged from the cockpit. ""Wait, wait!! Three CEOs in the cockpit?!!! This never happens!! I said. There they were - Samer in the Captain's seat, Willie in the First Officer's seat and Akbar in the jump seat. ""Three CEOs in the cockpit conspiring what to do in the aviation industry in the next 12 months"" joked Akbar, before I crawled in with a microphone. Infographic: State of global aviation in numbers . Qatar Airways has 60 Dreamliners on order and will hopefully get five delivered this year, followed by Etihad with an order of 41 and Gulf Air with 24. Willie said that he was very envious of Akbar receiving his 787s before him and how the aircraft's fuel efficiency will help the industry in such a difficult economic climate, which was reflected by the subdued mood at this year's Farnborough. They were great sports for an impromptu interview. It felt like chatting to three guys who were old friends, having a laugh which was a rare informal side to see for men in their positions. I forgot I was talking to CEOs - they were just three men in a cockpit.","CNN's Ayesha Durgahee has been at the Farnborough Airshow this week .

"(EW.com) -- EW has confirmed that producers Mike Tollin (""Varsity Blues,"" ""Coach Carter"") and Glenn Rigberg (""Struck By Lightning"") have obtained the rights to make a feature film biopic about Henry ""Hank"" Aaron, the baseball legend who broke Babe Ruth's decades-long career home-run record on April 8, 1974. This project has instantly become one of the hottest sports movie projects in Hollywood. Barry Levinson (""The Natural"") is attached to direct, working with screenwriter Adam Mazer, who wrote Levinson's HBO biopic on Jack Kevorkian, ""You Don't Know Jack,"" which Rigberg exec produced. Based on Howard Bryant's book ""The Last Hero: The Life Story of Henry Aaron,"" the film will trace the two years from 1972 to 1974 during which Aaron chased, and bested, Babe Ruth's record -- an accomplishment that was met with both breathless media coverage as well as death threats. Aaron, who has been reportedly reluctant in the past to agree to a film version of his life, will consult on the film. He first worked with Tollin on the latter's Oscar-nominated 1995 feature documentary, ""Hank Aaron: Chasing the Dream,"" and the two have remained friends since. Tollin sits on the board of the Hank Aaron Chasing the Dream Foundation, and tells EW he plans for proceeds from the film to be funneled back into the Foundation. ""This [film] is something we've toyed with and talk about all the time,"" Tollin says. ""It's challenging for Henry, because in some ways, it was the darkest time of his life, even though it was the most triumphant in professional terms. But as we talked about it, I think he grew more comfortable with our approach to it and having it shine a light on where America was in those times, and how far we've progressed -- and maybe how far we still have to go."" Casting will not begin in earnest until the script is completed. The hope is to go into production next year, and release in 2014, in time for both the 40th anniversary of Aaron's record, and the man's 80th birthday. See the full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Some generations get ""American Graffiti"" as a monument to their youthful folly: gleaming hotrods, drive-ins and Booker T. & the MGs. Others get ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" or ""Dirty Dancing."" But if you were graduating high school around the summer of 1999, chances are your collective cinematic talisman involves horny Jason Biggs pleasuring himself with an apple pie. ""American Pie"" spawned two sequels in rapid succession, taking sex-mad Jim, Oz, Stifler and pals through college and even into matrimony (""American Wedding""), but it's a surprise to reconnect with the old gang nine years later, older, milder, but still hungering for a bigger slice. The reunion is the brainchild of Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, the writers-turned-directors who made their name on a different but not dissimilar series, ""Harold and Kumar."" The original director, Paul Weitz, has long since graduated to bigger, not necessarily better, things such as ""Little Fockers"" and ""Being Flynn."" It's not a bad idea at that, even if Adam Sandler's recent ""Grown Ups"" covered many of the same bases. Hurwitz and Schlossberg respect the formula: whackily contrived sex gags sugared with sentimentality and a sliver of feminist sanity; multiple humiliations for the nice but naughty Jim; worse still for the cocky Stifler; and embarrassingly crude heart to hearts with Jim's loveable dad (caterpillar-browed comedian Eugene Levy). Fans will appreciate the filmmakers' dedication, and if they're not particularly adept in the execution, maybe they don't have to be: nostalgia is the most forgiving mistress. Jim (Jason Biggs) is still married to Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), but both are mired in parental sexual frustration. Oz (Chris Klein) is now a cable TV celebrity with a model for a girlfriend. Kevin (anyone remember Thomas Ian Nicholas?) is terminally boring. And Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) has been around the world twice and has the scars to prove it. As for perpetual bad boy Stifler (Seann William Scott), he's assistant to a bullying business executive, but still a legendary jerk in his own puerile imagination. Some of the girls are back too (Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, even Natasha Lyonne in an afterthought of a cameo), but predictably, the movie only pays lip service to gender equality. Younger, hotter newcomers Ali Cobrin, Katrina Bowen and Dania Ramirez get more screen time. Where Ramirez picked up her strong Dominican accent is a mystery, but along with John Cho, she's one of East Great Falls' few concessions to ethnic diversity. The hard truth is time has not been kind to most of the cast. They were always a funny looking bunch. Many of them were in their mid-20s but able to pass for teenagers back when the first film was shot. Today, they seem pale, pinched or gaunt -- thoroughly ordinary-looking in a way that would normally have casting agents glazing over. Only the effortlessly egregious Seann William Scott still has a viable career in leading roles, and it's hard to see Stifler as anything more than a step backward for him. Of course, this is the film's greatest weakness and its secret strength: the unspoken appeal of a reunion is the chance to go back, measure up your peers and perhaps find that they're not doing any better than you are. It's certainly the most endearing aspect of a spotty, crude but affectionate sex comedy that's been thoroughly superseded by the rude sophistication of the Judd Apatow comedies ""American Pie"" inspired in the first place.","The film's greatest weakness and its secret strength is the unspoken appeal of a reunion .

"(EW.com) -- If anything can make you long for the hang-loose 1970s, it's the prospect of looking for love in an era when dating is governed by more regimented thinking than the old Soviet Union. First came ""The Rules,"" which said that the best way for women to nab a mate was by refusing to give it up (basically the code of the 1950s). Then came ""The Game,"" which said that if women are playing by ""The Rules,"" then the only way for men to push past those defenses is to pretend to be even bigger cads than they are (which, according to the theory, secretly flatters women by tapping their desire to tame the male animal). Then came Steve Harvey's ""Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man,"" which funneled ""The Rules"" and ""The Game"" into one book by explaining to women all the ways that men are trying to outthink them. Romantics of the world, do your heads hurt yet? ""Think Like a Man,"" an amorous ensemble comedy based on Harvey's 2009 best-seller, follows a dozen mostly African-American men and women as they attempt to navigate the brave new world of love by the book. The movie, which is very sitcom-setup-driven (it's ""The Best Man"" meets ""Valentine's Day""), introduces its embattled pairings with titles like ''The Non-Committer vs. The Girl Who Wants the Ring'' and ''The Dreamer vs. The Woman Who Is Her Own Man.'' For a while, the cookie-cutter behavioral tics are funny in an overly broad way, even if the dialogue is basically stand-up patter turned into glib, fast conversation. And the actors make good company. I especially liked Romany Malco as the velvet-smooth player Zeke; Meagan Good as the spiky Mya, who finds it hard to stick to her dating-war codes; and Kevin Hart as the hilariously raging Cedric, who can't stop jabbering about the divorce he only thinks he wants. Yet ""Think Like a Man"" is so busy tracking courtship as if it were a science project that the bite-size love stories lack spontaneity. When the women first get hold of Harvey's book, the manipulations that ensue are fun. When the men read the book and try to out-psych the women, the film should grow ever foxier in its complications -- but instead it comes down to a bunch of horndogs pretending to be chivalrous, which is repetitive and kind of soggy.

"(CNN) -- Emily Blunt may be the most vivacious and personable light comic actress in the movies right now. She has something of Carole Lombard's instinct to take a tired scene and give it a good kick in the pants. And Jason Segel's forlorn and directionless Tom in ""The Five-Year Engagment"" could use it, too. Segel is the anti-matter to Blunt's shooting star: doughy (well, he is playing a sous chef here), oversized and doleful, he's one of those actors who has learned to capitalize on his flaws, exposing his inadequacies as often as possible to lugubrious comic effect. We've all seen lopsided couples like this, but the central flaw in ""The Five-Year Engagment"" (which Segel also co-wrote with his regular collaborator, director Nicholas Stoller) is that despite their regular protestations of love, for most of the movie, Segel's Tom and Blunt's Violet make a miserable team. She's selfish, he sacrifices his career, are you laughing yet? We are given to understand that wedded bliss would make all the difference, but somehow they just can't get their act together. Tom proposes in the movie's very first scene. There is an engagement party, everything is going swimmingly, but events overtake them. Violet's sister (Alison Brie) gets pregnant by Tom's best man (Chris Pratt, doing a big-screen tweak on his ""Parks and Recreation"" persona), so their nuptials take precedence. There are religious and geographical divisions to be ironed out -- Tom's family is Jewish, Violet's Church of England. Then she's offered a place at the University of Michigan, and while Tom renounces his promising culinary career in San Francisco to be with her, somehow the circumstances don't seem so propitious for a wedding ceremony. She's still happy, but he's stuck in a rut and losing his grip. Delay and deferment don't seem like the ideal building blocks for comedy, especially when this couple already lives together. Are we expected to care that much if they tie the knot? Does their hesitation reflect misgivings about the institution, or doubts about the relationship itself? The latter, naturally, but only because Tom is asked to play second fiddle to his more goal-oriented fiancÃ©e. In other words, to play what is traditionally the part of the supportive wife. What is a man to do when he's no longer the principal breadwinner? Michigan is cold, and they hunt things there. Going native involves home-knitted sweaters, crossbows and lots of facial hair. Clearly, this is not going to work. The movie occasionally throws up scenes or situations adults might recognize from their own attempts to reconcile romance and professional fulfillment, but no more than you might find in an average sitcom. This being a Judd Apatow production, that would be a sitcom afflicted with Tourette Syndrome and more male nudity than usual, but still essentially a sitcom nonetheless. Ungainly and uneven, the movie offers some compensation in the peripherals (whoever cast Jacki Weaver, the terrifying matriarch from ""Animal Kingdom"" as Violet's mum has a wicked sense of humor, and Rhys Ifans is lively as a charismatic psychology professor) but struggles to convey any sense of purpose in its story. Rom-coms traditionally end in marriage, convenient shorthand for the fairytale happy ever after, and ""The Five-Year Engagement"" is no different; it just takes an awfully long time to get there.","Jason Segel is one of those actors who has learned to capitalize on his flaws .

"(EW.com) -- The MPAA has come under some flack of late for its one-size-fits-all rating system and vague-at-best explanations for those ratings. But there's a fun flip-side to the murkiness: Speculating on what those ratings and their explanations might infer about the movie in question â€” in this case, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The MPAA handed a PG-13 rating today to ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" for ""intense sequences of violence and action, some sensuality and language."" The rating itself does not mean the movie is totally done -- films often screen well before the director is finished with technical elements like visual effects, sound design, and color timing. But it does provide us with a tantalizing indication for what may be in store with a wildly anticipated film that has otherwise put a high premium on plot details. Namely: Language? Sensuality? Intriguing! As a point of comparison, 2008â€²s ""The Dark Knight"" won its PG-13 for ""intense sequences of violence and some menace""; 2005â€²s ""Batman Begins"" was a PG-13 due to ""intense action violence, disturbing images, and some thematic elements."" Beyond the obvious differences between ""violence and action,"" ""violence and some menace,"" and ""action violence [and] disturbing images,"" it appears that the final film in this trilogy is branching out into some new territory for the franchise. The ""sensuality"" could mean Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) gets horizontal with a cat-suited Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). And ""language"" suggests masked villain Bane (Tom Hardy) could provoke Batman's potty mouth. If that means we get to see more of Bale's physique and legendary way with four-letter words, so much the better. See the full article at EW.com.

"(EW.com) -- Captain America is being redeployed. The coda to last year's ""Captain America"" set up ""The Avengers"" and, in turn, ""The Avengers"" is apparently setting up a ""Captain America"" sequel. Marvel Studios and parent company Disney announced today that Chris Evans' patriotic superhero will go straight into a stand-alone followup scheduled to debut April 4, 2014. While the original ""Captain America"" began in the 1940s and saw scrawny Steve Rogers become a chemically enhanced super-soldier who helped save the Allies during World War II, the sequel will, understandably, keep him in his chronological position in the present day. After being frozen for decades, and resuscitated in the strange new world of contemporary New York City, Cap is now planning to take it one day at a time. Marvel's announcement said the sequel will pick up where ""The Avengers"" (out May 4) leaves off, ""as Steve Rogers continues his affiliation with Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. and struggles to embrace his role in the modern world."" What we can infer from that (apart from the obvious, that ""Captain America"" survives the ordeal of ""The Avengers"") is that Samuel L. Jackson sounds like he will be a significant part of the sequel, as opposed to the glorified cameos he has done in other Marvel movies. No other details about the project were released. ""Captain America 2"" (or whatever it is eventually called â€” let's pray it's not ""Cap2n America,"" or some such) won't be the first sequel to hit theaters after ""The Avengers."" That honor goes to ""Thor 2,"" which is aiming for release Nov. 15, 2013, with ""Game of Thrones"" director Alan Taylor taking over for Kenneth Branagh. One question, though: After all he's been through, isn't it time Captain America got promoted? ""Major"" America? Guess that doesn't have the same ring. See the full article at EW.com.

"London (CNN) -- France beat the United States in the men's 4x100-meter swimming relay on Sunday, with Michael Phelps and the United States taking a silver medal. The medal is the 17th for Phelps, and puts him one behind Larisa Latynina, a Soviet gymnast who earned nine golds, five silvers and four bronzes between 1956 and 1964. The U.S. held the lead for three of the four legs, but Yannick Agnel caught Ryan Lochte just after the turn and pulled away at the end. France won in 3:09.93, with the 20-year-old Agnel swimming the last leg in 46.74. The U.S. finished in 3:10.38 ahead of Russia (3:11.41) and Australia (3:11.63). It was a bit of payback for the French who lost in similar style in 2008. Lochte will have a chance for personal revenge during Monday's 200-meter freestyle final. Meanwhile, one of the Games' showcase teams, the U.S. men's basketball squad, easily won its first game, beating France 98-71. Kevin Durant led the United States, made up of NBA all-stars and the college player of the year, with 22 points. Kevin Love scored 14 points and Kobe Bryant had 10 for the U.S., which next plays Tunisia on Tuesday. ""We still have a lot of work to do, but that's the beauty of it all,"" Durant said. ""We're all coming together in such a short time. We're having fun playing. Guys don't worry about points, rebounds, assists; we just want to play to win."" Coach Mike Krzyzewski was pleased with his team's effort. ""I thought we did a good job defensively,"" he said. ""We share the ball. We assisted on 27 of our 31 buckets and we rebounded the ball very well."" Many are hoping to see how this year's American squad stacks up to the legacy of the 1992 U.S. basketball team, known as the Dream Team, which trounced the competition at the Barcelona Games by an average of more than 40 points. Some analysts called it the greatest sports team ever assembled. There was a surprise for the U.S. gymnastics team when Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas finished ahead of world champion Jordyn Wieber in the all-around competition qualifying round. Each country can only send two athletes to the final so despite Wieber being fourth overall, she was eliminated from the individual competition. She will still compete for the U.S. in the team phase. The United States topped Russia 181.863 to 180.429 in qualifying. The top eight countries will compete in the team finals Tuesday night. The U.S. team, dubbed the ""Fab Five,"" carries the pressure of bringing home America's first team gold medal since the ""Magnificent Seven"" did so at the 1996 games. But they must contend with the defending Olympic champion China, as well as Romania and Russia. In the pool, Dana Vollmer of the United States set a world record in winning the 100-meter butterfly, becoming the first woman to go under 56 seconds. A second world record saw South African Cameron van der Burgh claim the men's 100-meter breaststroke gold with a 58.46 seconds clocking. And American Allison Schmitt, who took silver behind France's Camille Muffat, set a U.S. record in the 400-meter freestyle. The host nation got into the medal count standings when Lizzie Armitstead won a silver in the road cycling event for women. Marianne Vos of the Netherlands won the 140-kilometer (87-mile) race. There was sad news for Great Britain when world record holder Paula Radcliffe said she was withdrawing from the women's marathon, according to the nation's track and field team website. ""However hard today is, finally closing the door on that dream, at least I can know that I truly have tried absolutely everything,"" she said, according to United Kingdom Athletics. A recent foot injury was too much to overcome, said the 38-year-old. U.S. marathoner Desiree Davila also dropped out of the August 5 race with a leg injury. A gymnast from Uzbekistan was suspended provisionally for failing a drug test. Luiza Galiulina tested positive for the banned substance furosemide, the IOC announced, in the second drugs suspension of the Games. Queen Elizabeth's granddaughter Zara Phillips made her Olympics debut on Sunday, riding in the British equestrian team as her mother, Princess Anne, and grandfather Prince Philip looked on. Phillips was ranked joint 15th with 57 riders having competed. In skeet shooting, Kim Rhode became the first American to medal in five consecutive Olympics when she won gold with a world-record tying 99 (of 100) score. In football, Spain, one of the pretournament favorites, was knocked out of the Olympics with its second group-play loss, this time falling to Honduras 1-0. Brazil, another favorite, clinched a quarterfinals spot with a 3-1 victory over Belarus. China stayed on top of the medal count, adding six Sunday, including golds in synchronized diving and women's 10-meter pistol. The United States has won 11 medals, including three golds. Meanwhile, the London organizing committee said Sunday that security workers who have completed their shifts will be able to sit in vacant seats. ""If they want to sit there and watch, they can,"" said Sebastian Coe, chairman of the organizing committee. ""It's not mobilizing the army to solve this."" Students will also have access to the seats, organizers said. They said they would also ""recycle"" tickets at events where fans are leaving after watching their team play an early game.

"(CNN) -- Perched on the River Rhine with Germany and France bordering it on either side, the Swiss city of Basel stands at a crossroads between the three countries. Basel sits on the Rhine at the crossroads of three European countries. In the past its location on the Rhine made it an important city, it is home to the oldest university in Switzerland and Europe's oldest government-rated five star hotel, the Hotel Drei Kronige. A stroll around Basel's beautifully preserved Old Town taking in the Munster, its red sandstone gothic cathedral, will give the visitor a sense of the city's historical significance. To delve even further into the area's past though, you need to go 12 miles east of Basel to the 2,000 year-old Roman settlement of Augusta Raurica, located on the south bank of the Rhine. The oldest Roman colony on the Rhine, the site contains a well-preserved theater as well as the remains of a forum, amphitheater and aqueduct. At an open-air museum visitors can see a reconstruction of a Roman house and recreations of daily life from the period. If after this you've had your fill of delving through dusty artefacts, it might be time to shake off the cobwebs with an adrenalin-charged toboggan ride. At 1.8 miles long, Hasenhorn (located around 25 miles east of Basel) is the longest toboggan run in Germany and open all year round. After taking a chair lift up the mountain, buckle in for a heart-in-the-mouth ride of steep curves and white-knuckle loops. For a more sedate leisure experience, you can head back to the city for a late afternoon art fix at the Kunstmuseum, on St Alban-Graben 16. Open daily from 10am -- 5pm, the museum has an impressive collection of works by Holbein, Picasso and Chagall inside. In the courtyard you'll find sculptures, the centerpiece of which is Rodin's famous ""Burghers of Calais."" As night falls it's time to enjoy some food and drink in the convivial surroundings of the Fischerstube Microbrewery, Rheingasse 45, where the heady menu features beer on every course, including a beer-soaked dessert.","Basel was a major town in the middle ages, a legacy of this is the pretty Old Town .

"(CNN) -- ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"" (38 Studios, Big Huge Games) blends the best of role-playing and fighting game mechanics, then uses them to back up a deep, rich story, resulting in a fresh-feeling entry into the world of fantasy gaming. The game, released last week, boasts quite a bit of star power with New York Times best-selling author R. A. Salvatore building the story; comics superstar and ""Spawn"" creator Todd McFarlane directing the art and action; and role-playing game-design legend Ken Rolston putting it all together. Brought together by Curt Schilling, former baseball star and founder of 38 Studios, the team set out to meet high expectations for a title that was inevitably going to be compared to blockbusters like ""Skyrim"" and ""Dragon Age."" The role-playing elements are open, allowing players to pick and choose from different destinies (might, finesse, sorcery) and refine their characters with specific skills and abilities. Victories in combat and other skill challenges help hone particular skills, while other abilities (for instance, the always-handy teleportation skill) become part of your character's repertoire as he or she grows stronger. Players can mix and match talents, but to really obtain the mightiest powers, they should focus on one ""destiny"" area. Sure, it might limit some things you want to do right out of the gate, but super-sizing your skills in one particular area will eventually let you make up for those early deficiencies. Read about the vision behind the video game . And if you change your mind and really want to find out what the other destinies are like, there's a nonplayer character called a Fateweaver who will allow you to redistribute all your ability points and skills. That way, players can play as a mage for part of the game, redistribute to play a powerful fighter, and then switch back again if they so choose. There is a cost associated with each new ""fate-weaving,"" but it is a fun dynamic to have this much flexibility in character creation. Pro tip: Max out the ""Detect Hidden"" skill, and it will reveal nearly everything on your map. Otherwise, a majority of the items (enemies, chests, lorestones, etc.) can't be found unless you just stumble across them. A massive 170-plus quests (and I know I still haven't found them all) drive the far-reaching story line. Some are simple (gather items and return), while others are more intricate and linked together. The main quest drives the story, but you'll want to explore the faction quests, side quests and tasks to gain as much experience and power as you can before the final showdown. Salvatore envisioned and wrote 10,000 years' worth of history for Amalur, the equivalent of 10 novels of information. Each book, item and location in the game is full of history and legend and, united, make the story feel alive. So-called ""lore stones"" are placed throughout the lands, offering everything from bits and pieces of that rich history to simple gossip about love triangles in a nearby town. As in nearly all RPG games, you are encouraged to interact with other people you meet. Interestingly, Salvatore did not write any of the nearly 50,000 lines of dialogue present in the game. A radial response system offers conversation choices, but some of those choices can be rather frustrating. There is no way to get a good feel for the person you are chatting with and determine if your response is going to result in something positive or offensive to them. I backtracked a couple of times when I thought my response was going to be helpful, but did not give me the result I expected. There is crafting of potions and forging of weapons and armor by collecting pieces of other weapons. But unless that is something you really enjoy, there are enough potions and weapons to be found from dead opponents and sealed chests that you don't have to do it if you don't want to. The game changer for this RPG title is the combat. In an effort to stand out and be different from similar games, developers searched for a way to create a dynamic fighting system that didn't detract from the feel of role playing. Players get two weapons, a primary and a secondary, and a single button on the controller activates each one. There are so many different types to choose, from very fast daggers to very slow hammers. Ranged weapons include staffs, bows and chakrams (whirling discs that return to the throwers' hand after each attack). Different combat techniques are used, depending on how you tap the button and your character's position relative to your opponent. It makes combat simple, while still providing nice effects. Melee not your cup of tea? Magic can be easily accessed with the press of a couple of buttons. As with weapons, how you tap or hold down the buttons affects how your spells work -- for example, tossing a ball of lightning with a tap while electrifying the ground by holding down the same button. Having easy access to weapons and magic makes battles fun and fast-paced. There's no waiting to access different inventory screens to get the right sword or finding the right drop-down to cast the spell needed. Players can shoot an arrow, toss a fireball, roll into melee range and slash with a broadsword all in four button pushes. It is a combat mechanic more commonly found in fighting games, but it goes very well here without detracting from the role-playing game feel. There are a few weaknesses in ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning."" For example, all of the interior rooms start feeling the same after a while, and there aren't enough decisions to be made in conversation that actually make a difference. But there's nothing here to truly detract from the superb role-playing and fighting action. It is a deep and rich experience in a world that has a wonderful back story and vibrant environments. The familiar role-playing elements are all there, along with a flexible and powerful combat system that ramps up the enjoyment factor. Whether you plunge right into the main quest and ignore all others or decide to investigate every book and runestone throughout the land, ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"" is ready for the challenge. Are you? ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"" is available in North America and Europe. It is for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Windows PC, and is rated M for Mature because of blood and gore, intense violence and suggestive themes.

"New York (CNN) -- Brooklyn gave roller coaster fans something to scream about Saturday. This weekend marks the 85th anniversary of New York's most esteemed roller coaster, the Cyclone. Nostalgic local residents and excited tourists gathered Saturday at Luna Park in Coney Island to help celebrate the anniversary of the treasured landmark. The Cyclone, which debuted on June 26, 1927, helped revolutionize entertainment in amusement parks across the United States. The roller coaster, made mostly of wood, has an 85-foot drop to start and is followed by several drops and turns. Luna Park honored the ride's original fare of 25 cents for the first 85 minutes Saturday. The 2012 price to ride is $8. Players from the Brooklyn Cyclones minor league baseball team were on hand around the park for a ""meet and greet"" with fans. The day's festivities, many of them free, were to be followed by a fireworks display over the Coney Island beach. ""This ride has really stood the test of time"" said Johanna Zaki, marketing manager for Central Amusement International. ""It's been around for so many years that families get to share their experiences from generation to generation,"" she said. Zaki said visitors lined up three hours before the park opened Saturday.

"Washington (CNN) -- Fueled by a close call on a runway two years ago involving a U.S. senator, general aviation pilots will soon have increased leverage when facing FAA disciplinary action under a bill awaiting President Barack Obama's signature. The legislation was spearheaded by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, whose own piloting incident led to increased scrutiny by the Federal Aviation Administration. Inhofe, an experienced pilot with more than 10,000 flying hours, faced an FAA investigation after landing his private plane on a closed runway, sending ground workers scrambling for safety. In the October 2010 incident, the investigators said the runway was clearly marked with a large ""X"" indicating it was closed. Additionally, a notice warning pilots the runway was closed had been issued. Such notices, called NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen), are supposed to be checked by all pilots prior to departure. Inhofe said he didn't check for FAA warnings. Supporters of the ""Pilot's Bill of Rights"" say the new measure passed by the House and Senate gives general aviation pilots the ability to fight charges levied against them by FAA officials. Highlights of the bill include: . -- Allowing pilots to appeal National Transportation Safety Board rulings in federal district court. Previously, pilots could only appeal FAA findings to an NTSB administrative law judge. -- Requiring the FAA to inform pilots when they're being investigated and notify them that any response by the pilot can be used as evidence against them. -- Forcing the FAA to share all evidence with the pilot before any enforcement action is enacted. -- Requiring the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review the FAA's medical certification process. Pilots have argued that current FAA medical forms are easily misunderstood, resulting in those who are under investigation being accused of falsifying the documents. ""This bill remedies many of the most serious deficiencies in the relationship between general aviation and the FAA, and ensures that pilots are, like everyone else, treated in a fair and equitable manner by the justice system,"" Inhofe said after the bill passed by voice vote in the House. Pilot advocacy groups lauded the news. ""This is a landmark bill for general aviation, and protecting GA pilots' freedom to fly,"" said Lorraine Howerton, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association vice president of legislative affairs, said on the AOPA's website. Inhofe told the Washington Post at the time, ""I called the [Federal Aviation Administration] when I landed to tell them what had happened"" and to see if there was any problem ... Since there was no accident, there appeared to be no significant problem."" Pilot rescued after U.S. jet crash in Japan . GAO investigators: Some student pilots in U.S. illegally .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Airways has agreed to buy L'Avion, the French all-business class carrier and plans to integrate the airline into its recently launched subsidiary, OpenSkies. L'Avion was launched in January 2009 and employs 77 staff in Paris. The $108 million (£54 million) deal marks the departure of the last stand-alone all-business airline following the demise of MAXJet, Eos and Silverjet over the last six months. OpenSkies, launched on June 19 between Paris Orly and New York JFK, already operated a codeshare agreement with L'Avion that flies out of Orly to Newark, New York. Following integration, OpenSkies will increase the frequency of its Orly-JFK service to three daily flights. OpenSkies currently operates one Boeing 757 with 24 flat-bed berths in business class, 28 seats in premium economy and 30 in economy. L'Avion, launched in January 2007, flies two Boeing 757s with 90 business-class seats. BA is yet to decide whether L'Avion planes will be changed to a three-class layout. ""L'Avion is a successful airline that has built up a premium business between Orly and New York in a relatively short period of time,"" said British Airways' chief executive, Willie Walsh in a statement. ""It has many synergies with OpenSkies and buying it provides OpenSkies with a larger schedule and an established customer base in the Paris-New York market."" Christophe Bejach, co-founder and chairman of L'Avion, said he was happy with the deal. ""This transaction will strengthen our current base and enable the combined airline to grow faster and stronger."" Completion of the deal is expected this month and, if approved, full integration will take place in early 2009.","British Airways has bought French all-business carrier L'Avion for £54 million .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- After four years and 11 rounds of hard negotiation, the introduction of the ""Open Skies"" agreement in March was greeted with a sigh of relief. This was not just from airlines, but also their passengers. If talks in the second phase fail, the entire Open Skies deal could be torn up. The deal that allows airlines to fly anywhere in the European Union to anywhere in the United States and vice versa promised to increase competition between carriers and possibly cut ticket prices. But the relief could be short-lived. On Thursday, the EU and the U.S. began talks in Ljubljana, Slovenia for the second phase of the deal. This time round there's an even tougher set of issues on the table. And if an agreement is not reached by 2011, either side can pull the plug on the whole deal. Such a move could be crucial for airlines that have already invested hundreds of millions of dollars in preparation for reduced restrictions. Carriers have added and increased frequency of services, with some paying as much $60 million to get their hands on limited Heathrow slots. British Airways will also launch a new business-only airline following the deal between either Paris or Brussels and New York's JFK airport this summer. One issue the stage-two talks will address is cabitage, or rights for European airlines to operate domestic American routes. European critics have said the current deal offers greater advantage to U.S. carriers by allowing them to operate within the EU. An American airline can, for example, fly from New York to London, where they could pick up passengers and then fly to Germany. But as John Byerly, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Transportation Affairs and chief negotiator for Open Skies, explains to CNN, this is a red herring in terms of importance in aviation law. ""Not one U.S. airline has taken advantage of the right because it doesn't make commercial sense,"" he says. ""The aircraft that's right for transatlantic flights is ill-suited for operation within the highly-contested European Union market."" What's more, adds Kieran Daly, editor of Air Transport Intelligence, there isn't a simple quid pro quo in terms of cabitage. As he explains, the EU is not a single market in the same way that the U.S. is, and the travel patterns on both sides of the Atlantic are different. ""Nobody is really sure what the equivalent right would be in Europe for the American carriers,"" he says. A more important, and arguably more contentious, issue is around ownership and control. U.S. laws currently cap international ownership to 25 percent of voting stock, and prohibit ""actual control"" by foreign citizens. If these restrictions are removed it could pave the way for transatlantic airline mergers. Steve Ridgway, CEO of Virgin Atlantic Airways expresses his frustration that airlines are the only companies that cannot be owned by foreign buyers in the U.S. ""An airline is no different to a car company or a telephone company,"" he says. ""As long as there are proper competition rules in place, and dominance is not allowed, why does there have to be artificial restriction?"" Last August, Virgin completed a five-year battle to start a low-cost service, Virgin America, in the United States. The British company won regulatory approval by agreeing to distance ownership from the Virgin Group. In effect, the Virgin brand is licensed to an American-owned company. But Ridgway wants more. ""It took five years for us not own an airline,"" he points out. Yet despite Virgin's expansion into ventures such as Virgin America as well as Virgin Blue in Australia and V Australia, the carrier has not yet decided to follow British Airways' lead by launching services from other European capitals following the removal of restrictions under Open Skies. And considering how tempting a Madrid to Miami, or Paris to Los Angeles route could be to a non-flag-carrying carrier such as Virgin Atlantic, this is significant. Ridgway says a time will come for such routes. ""We need the right aircraft, we need the right market conditions, and we need to make sure that we are fighting the right battle here in our home ground. Because this is where our strength is,"" he says. But the other reason for hesitancy comes down to a lack of confidence for phase two of negotiations, he adds. Byerly doesn't deny the difficulties and political hurdles negotiators face. Opening up ownership to foreign companies has implications for homeland security, he explains. ""We rely on U.S. airlines to transport our troops and military cargo in time of war of emergency."" They must also tread carefully with airline labor unions. ""There are serious concerns about how to maintain a level playing field if you've got two unions, one in Europe and one in the United states, working for an airline,"" he says. But signs are that the U.S. is willing to keep an open mind. On Tuesday, United States surprised EU negotiators by proposing to drop investment restrictions for airlines for more than 60 countries. Senior airline executives have also voiced encouragement for an easing of ownership restrictions. Jeff Smisek, president of Continental Airlines told CNN: ""anything that would open up a freer flow of capital between the European Union and United States would be a positive influence."" As Byerly said, the U.S. is willing to envisage a positive outcome from the outset. ""We're committed to working in very good faith and with a lot of energy in the second stage of negotiations to try and reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial. That's our goal.""","The EU and U.S. have begun talks for phase II of the Open Skies air transport deal .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- A Spanish politician is facing a charge of vehicular homicide for the car crash that killed prominent Cuban dissident Oswaldo Paya, Cuba's state press said Tuesday. Angel Carromero could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. He is accused of speeding and then losing control of a car that he, Paya, Swedish politician Jans Aron Modig and Cuban dissident Harold Cepero were traveling in. Paya and Cepero were killed when the car struck a tree Sunday near Las Gavinas, Cuba. The men had been traveling across the island to meet some of Paya's supporters in Santiago de Cuba when the crash occurred. The Cuban government said the crash was the result of a single-car accident. Paya had tried for decades to change Cuba's single-party system of government. He delivered thousands of signatures in an unsuccessful attempt to force a national referendum and was a constant critic of the Cuban government. But Paya also had called for reconciliation between the polarized extremes that dominate the debate over Cuba's future. Following Paya's death, his family immediately accused Cuban authorities of foul play and said they had received information that another vehicle had forced the car Paya was in off the road. ""I can't take the word of the same government that wants to kill my husband, that threatened his life a ton of times,"" Paya's widow, Ofelia Acevedo, told CNN. Acevedo said over the years her family suffered frequent intimidations at the hands of Cuban state security. She said she would continue to have doubts about her husband's death until she had the opportunity to interview both Modig and Carromero herself. ""I am asking for the intervention of an international organization that could send investigators here to do an analysis of the accident,"" she said. On Tuesday, Cuba's official press published a 1,539-word editorial on the crash titled ""Truth and reason."" The editorial announced that Carromero would face charges and that Modig would be permitted to return to Sweden. Both men had been held by Cuban authorities since the crash. Again the Cuban government denied any hand in Paya's death. ""It's not Cuba but the United States that displays a shameful record of political assassinations, extra-official executions, including drone strikes,"" the editorial said. On Tuesday, Modig spoke to reporters at a hastily organized news conference. Members of the international media in Cuba were asked to arrive at the Cuban Press Center and then were taken by buses to a house were officers of Cuba's Interior Ministry stood guard. Jans Aron Modig then walked into the room where the press had gathered. Sitting at a table with Cuban officials, Modig said he was sorry for having traveled to Cuba on a tourist visa to meet with members of the island's dissident movements. He said he had come to ""understand that these activities are not legal in Cuba and I would like to apologize for coming here and doing illegal activities."" Modig denied that another vehicle had been involved in the crash. ""I have no memory of any other car,"" he said, but refused to elaborate on how the accident took place. After less than 10 minutes of speaking to the press, Modig said he did not want to take any more questions and left the room. On Monday night, Cuban state-television showed about 20 minutes of video of the meeting with foreign journalists along with video of a separate and apparently longer news conference that Modig gave solely to Cuba's government-controlled media outlets. Officials said holding two news conferences was necessary due ""to space issues"" at the house where Modig spoke. Carromero, the Spanish politician, did not speak, but a clip of a video was shown by officials in which Carromero also said that the crash had been an accident. ""As far as the news reports that they have let me read, I ask that the international community focuses on getting me out of here,"" Carromero said, ""and not use a traffic accident that could happen to anyone for political purposes."" Cuban state media usually does not discuss in such depth traffic accidents, much less what officials called ""small factions of dissidents."" Dissidents like Paya are generally referred to as ""traitors"" and ""sell-outs"" who have sided with the United States government over Cuba in the still-simmering war of words between the two countries. Paya's family said they were trying to adapt to life without him and with the added scrutiny his death brought. ""All these things we have seen on TV and the accounts of what they call an accident is very unusual,"" said Acevedo, Paya's widow. ""But they don't talk about who was Oswaldo Paya.""","Angel Carromero could be sentenced to 10 years in prison if found guilty, state media says .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will this week make her first visit to South Sudan, a nation barely one year old that is locked in a bitter dispute with its northern neighbor, as part of a six-country tour of Africa. Clinton sets off Tuesday on the 11-day trip, which is intended to emphasize U.S. efforts to strengthen democracy, encourage economic growth and further peace and security in Africa, Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement Monday. The visit begins in Senegal, a small country on Africa's west coast that has been an outpost of democratic stability in a region with a history of electoral chaos, civil wars and coups. Despite outbreaks of violence in Senegal earlier this year surrounding former President Abdoulaye Wade's decision to seek a controversial third term in office, power passed peacefully to the eventual victor in the presidential election, Macky Sall. Clinton will meet with Sall and ""deliver a speech applauding the resilience of Senegal's democratic institutions and highlighting America's approach to partnership,"" Nuland said. The secretary of state will then travel to one of the tensest areas of Africa: South Sudan, which has edged close to full-scale war with Sudan, the nation from which it separated in July 2011 after decades of bloody conflict. The two African countries still disagree over the demarcation of the border between them and the transportation and processing of oil from South Sudan, which obtained around 70% of the formerly united country's reserves when it became independent. The U.N. Security Council is pressuring the countries to find a peaceful resolution of the disputes. Border clashes have displaced at least 150,000 people and created a huge humanitarian crisis. While in South Sudan, Clinton will meet President Salva Kiir in order to ""reaffirm U.S. support and to encourage progress in negotiations with Sudan to reach agreement on issues related to security, oil and citizenship,"" Nuland said. Clinton's next stop is Uganda, where the authorities are dealing with an outbreak of the highly infectious Ebola virus that has killed at least 14 people this month. Uganda is ""a key U.S. partner in promoting regional security, particularly in regard to Somalia and in regional efforts to counter the Lord's Resistance Army,"" Nuland said. A highly effective celebrity-backed social media campaign earlier this year by the nonprofit group Invisible Children focused worldwide attention on the Lord's Resistance Army and its leader, the fugitive warlord Joseph Kony. The African Union has stepped up efforts this year to capture Kony, deploying 5,000 troops in March after a resurgence in attacks by his forces displaced thousands of people in Uganda, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, according to U.N. estimates. Kony is wanted by the International Criminal Court at the Hague for war crimes and crimes against humanity, stemming in part from allegations of his vicious tactics to conscript children as soldiers and sex slaves in his army. President Barack Obama ordered 100 troops to central Africa last year to help in the hunt for Kony. The troops are advising regional forces. After Uganda, Clinton will visit Kenya, where she will meet local officials, as well as Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, president of the transitional government of Somalia, which is trying to emerge from years of civil war. Security appears to be improving in Somalia, long considered a failed state, since African Union troops pushed Al-Shabaab, an Islamic militant group affiliated with al Qaeda, out of central Mogadishu last year after prolonged urban fighting. Clinton will then head south to Malawi where she will ""discuss economic and political governance,"" Nuland said. Lastly, she will visit South Africa to participate in a strategic dialogue between the two countries and pay her respects to Nelson Mandela, the former president. The frail icon has not appeared in public for years, but he was celebrated worldwide on his 94th birthday earlier this month for his role in reconciling a country torn apart by apartheid.","South Sudan, the world's youngest country, is in conflict with Sudan .

"(CNN) -- Gadget fans waiting anxiously for the next iPhone to be released may be reaching the home stretch. Apple, which has made no official announcement, is planning a September 12 event at which the next generation of the iconic smartphone will presumably be announced, according to multiple reports. iMore, an Apple-oriented blog, was the first to report that ""sources who have proven accurate in the past"" said the phone will be introduced at an event that day and released nine days later. Observers are calling it the iPhone 5, although no name has been announced. Others, including The Wall Street Journal's All Things D blog, followed with similar reports. Quoting anonymous sources at Apple, All Things D said an event is planned for the week of September 9. The 12th would be a Wednesday, which follows with previous Apple events. A September release would be slightly ahead of Apple's established one-iPhone-per-year pace. But the iPhone 4S took longer than usual, its October unveiling coming about 16 months after the iPhone 4. A fall iPhone release has been considered a foregone conclusion by most observers for months. Speculation has focused on a handful of expected new features, including a slightly larger screen, a smaller dock connector and NFC technology that would make it easier for shoppers to make payments through their phones. iMore also says that the mythical ""iPad Mini"" will be unveiled at the event. Speculation has increasingly ramped up that Apple, faced by competition from Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7 tablets, is making a smaller version of the iPad. The move would fly in the face of statements made by the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who favored full-size tablets. But Apple faces unprecedented competition in the space and may argue that screen technology that would have made a smaller iPad impractical before is now available. On the smartphone front, Apple also faces a landscape that's arguably more challenging than it's seen in a while. The iPhone is still the most popular handset in the field, but the total number of phones running Google's Android operating system has been greater for some time. And while competitors in the past have arguably spent the time between iPhone releases trying to catch up, many reviewers feel that several models among the current crop of Android phones have surpassed the 4S in terms of features and performance. Notably, the Samsung Galaxy S III has topped 10 million in sales in two months -- a number it took the Galaxy S II five months to hit. Reviewers have praised its bigger screen, sleek design and a set of new features. The iPhone 4S was, in some senses, a glorified update of the iPhone 4, with its advances coming in new software features and improved camera and display. It outsold its predecessor, although with anticipation high for the looming iPhone 5, sales have begun to flag. According to its recent earnings report, Apple shipped 26 million iPhones from April to June, which was less than the 28 million to 29 million that Wall Street analysts had predicted. It was a steep drop from the 35.1 million that the company sold in the previous quarter.","A September 12 event would be 11 months after iPhone 4S rolled out .

"(CNN) -- I strongly believe being mayor is the public post in which you have the greatest opportunity to change peoples' lives for the better. People live in cities, not states or nations. As a mayor, you are connected directly to citizens. And cities are increasingly the preferred place for most people to live. Today, half of the world's population is settled in urban areas. By 2050, seven out of 10 people will live in cities, according to United Nations projections. I like to say I have the best job in the world. Rio is an incredible place, a vibrant place, full of energy, culture and virtues. In the recent past, the city and its people seemed to be be headed down -- after 1960, Rio was was no longer the capital of Brazil and it faced economic difficulties and bad public management, which helped aggravate urban problems such as poverty and violence. Watch Eduardo Paes' TED Talk . But those days are over, and that's symbolized by the fact that Rio will host the fist Olympic Games in South America in 2016. It was not easy to get there. Our Olympic bid had to be selected over strong candidates such as Madrid, Tokyo and Chicago. But the International Olympic Commitee found our proposal was the one that would leave the greatest legacy. With dedication, inspiration and professionalism we have shown that things can be done. TED.com: Jaime Lerner sings of the city . Running a city is a great challenge. But it turns out that you don't have to be powerful or rich to be innovative and find good forms of urban development. I believe there are four basic commandments that serve as pillars for building a better city: . Commandment 1 -- A city of the future has to be environmentally friendly . Rio is an energetic, vibrant place, full of beauty and nature. But we face the kinds of problems any developing metropolis does -- with pollution, traffic congestion, poverty. Distribution of green areas, for example, is not uniform. Madureira, the heart of the suburb in Rio, is a concrete jungle. You have to find open spaces and make it so people can get to them. We are building the third-largest park in the city in Madureira, the temperature will drop 2 to 3 degrees centigrade. Every time you think of a city you have to think green, green, green. Commandment 2 -- A city of the future has to deal with mobility and integration . Cities are packed with people. How can you move people around effectively? High-capacity transportation usually requires a lot of money. A solution we found was Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), presented by a former mayor of Curitiba, Jaime Lerner. You transform a bus so that it functions virtually as a train car, with dedicated lanes and the same comfort and features as a subway station. A kilometer of BRT costs 10 times less than a subway and it gets built much faster. We will see the proportion of Rio's population served by high capacity transportation rise from 18% today to 63% by 2015. TED.com: Why the world needs charter cities . Commandment 3 -- A city of the future has to be socially integrated . In Rio, 1.4 million of the 6.3 million people live in favelas, or slums. They are all over the city but favelas are not always a problem -- sometimes they can be a solution, if you have the right public policies. What you need is to change from a vicious circle to a virtuous circle: Bring basic services inside the favelas with the same high quality you have in richer areas. The second aspect is to create open space in the favelas and develop infrastructure. By 2020, Rio aims to have all its favelas completely urbanized. Commandment 4 -- A city of the future has to use technology . We use technology to be flexible. In Rio we built a Center of Operations, a situation room that gathers information from municipal departments and allows us to manage and help decision-making. I can check the weather, the traffic and the location of city's waste collection trucks. Each of 4,000 buses in the city has a camera connected to the situation room. That help us manage emergencies and extreme situations. At the end of the day, when we talk about a city we are talking about a gathering of people. We cannot see that as a problem. The city of the future is a place that cares about its citizens and brings them together.","Eduardo Paes: More than half the world's people now live in cities .

Rio is using ""bus rapid transit"" as an alternative to building costly subway lines, he says .

"(CNN) -- A campus police officer who sprayed seated protesters with pepper spray during a police attempt to clear out an Occupy encampment at the University of California Davis last year no longer works at the school, a university spokeswoman said. But she declined to specify whether the officer, Lt. John Pike, quit or was let go. ""We can confirm he is no longer employed as of today ... but we cannot confirm anything else because of privacy guidelines,"" said Claudia Morain, News Service Director at U.C. Davis. Video footage of Pike spraying student demonstrators in November 2011 with the irritant at close range went viral online, provoking widespread criticism of school authorities and making him the brunt of Internet ridicule. The group of about a dozen protesters had sat down on a path with their arms interlocked as the police moved in to clear out the Occupy encampment. Police officers forcibly removed the demonstrators after they had been sprayed. UC-Davis placed Pike, a second officer and Campus Police Chief Annette Spicuzza on administrative leave after the incident. The pepper-spraying was an ""objectively unreasonable"" use of force by the campus police, a 190-page report by a University of California task force said in April. The report also accused Pike of misusing his now-iconic weapon. The bright red pepper-spray canister he brandished to the crowd before discharging was ""not an authorized weapon"" under campus police guidelines, and ""is a higher pressure type of pepper spray than what officers normally carry on their utility belts."" It was designed to be used at a distance of at least six feet. ""And Lt. Pike did not use it correctly,"" the report found. The task force also blamed members of the UC-Davis leadership, citing ""systemic and repeated failures"" among campus administrators that ""put officers in the unfortunate situation in which they found themselves."" It described the campus police command structure as ""very dysfunctional,"" with Spicuzza's lieutenants refusing to follow orders and getting into ""heated exchanges"" with the chief during the protests. But Pike was primarily responsible for the ""objectively unreasonable decision"" to pepper-spray the demonstrators, it concluded. Pranksters across the Internet have inserted the image of the helmeted policeman into famous paintings, photos and movie scenes, while the hacking collective Anonymous published his home and cell phone numbers online.","Officer who sprayed seated protesters no longer works at the university .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek President Karolos Papoulias is to hold talks in the next day with party leaders in a bid to create a national unity government, his office said Saturday. Evangelos Venizelos, leader of the country's socialist party, PASOK, met with the president Saturday after it became the third party to fail to form a coalition, a week after parliamentary elections gave no one a majority. Speaking after the meeting, Venizelos said PASOK, New Democracy and the Democratic Left have said they would be willing to go into a grand coalition on the condition of remaining in the euro, offering a possible way out of the impasse. But this could still be problematic as the Democratic Left has previously said it will only join a coalition if the party which placed second in Sunday's election, the Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, also joined. Papoulias described this as a ""grain of hope."" He said he hoped he could help form a unity government, adding that ""things in Greece are quite difficult."" Papoulias is expected to meet with the leaders of PASOK, New Democracy and Syriza at noon Sunday, his office said. He will meet with other party leaders later. If the president's bid to form a unity government does not succeed by May 17, fresh elections must be called. They would take place next month. Deep uncertainty surrounds the political situation in Greece after large numbers of voters in last Sunday's election backed parties opposed to the country's bailout deal. Severe austerity measures are required under the terms of the bailout, agreed by the outgoing coalition government of PASOK and New Democracy. Headlines in Saturday's papers talk about ""Elections on the Titanic"" and ""Opening the door to an exit from the euro."" A poll earlier this week suggested that if new elections are held, Syriza would come first with 28% of the vote, although without achieving a majority. Syriza came in second in Sunday's election with 16.8%. The party is opposed to the terms of the bailout agreed with the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, and has even suggested implementing a moratorium on part of the repayments. The country's lenders have said that if Greece does not comply with the bailout terms then payments will stop. Greece has been forced to impose punishing austerity measures to get international loans that have kept it from defaulting on debts so far. But this week's election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the economic measures, which include policies to cut spending and raise taxes to reduce public debts. Seven parties won seats in parliament, but none captured more than 19% of the vote, leading to a week of political turmoil. The stakes are potentially huge for the rest of the eurozone, the group of 17 European countries that use the euro as single currency. There is concern that the lack of leadership could jeopardize Greece's bailout agreement. That could lead to a disorderly default by Greece, which would force the nation out of the eurozone. A default by Greece also could drag down other troubled governments such as Spain and Portugal. The eurozone economy is fragile, and any financial shock could plunge the region into a deep recession, a development that would ripple across the globe.","NEW: Greece's president will meet with party leaders on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has refused to be drawn over speculation on the future of Felipe Massa at the legendary Formula One marque. While Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso leads the standings after six races with 73 points, his Brazilian teammate Massa, whose contract with the Italian team runs until the end of 2012, is back in 14th place having picked up just 10 points this season. Massa has struggled for form after fracturing his skull during qualifying at the Hungary Grand Prix in 2009. ""In this moment my concentration is everywhere except the drivers,"" Di Montezemolo told CNN in answer to a question whether Ferrari were looking at new drivers. ""It's too early in the season and we will see after that."" Alonso: F1 runs risk of losing credibility . However the Ferrari chief did make a point of praising Massa's performance at the Monaco Grand Prix when the Brazilian finished sixth. ""I'm pleased to see Felipe Massa did a very good race weekend in Monte Carlo,"" said di Montezemolo. ""Because the more the car has improved, the less difficult it is to drive and good for Felipe. I count on him to take off points for Fernando's competitors."" By way of contrast the Ferrari president was fulsome in his praise of Alonso. ""I think I have the best driver in the world that is Alonso, said Di Montezemolo. ""Alonso, particularly in the races has been fantastic and I like his attitude to work very closely with the team as Michael Schumacher was able to do. ""Alonso is a driver with attention to the details but most of all what I like about him is that he is always positive - even in the difficult moments he is always positive. This is very important for the psychological attitude and psychological reaction of the team, this is what I like the most."" The scenario of the Scuderia leading the drivers' standings after six races seemed unlikely at the start of this season, when Alonso and his Italian team publicly doubted the race pace of the two Ferraris. ""Now we are in the lead of the championship, it's only up to us to win the championship,"" added di Montezemolo. ""So each of us has to look at the pole position of our jobs, to be perfect, to improve, to look inside ourselves what we can do to improve because in a competition in which you can win or lose for half of a tenth of a second - you have to perfect, in the start and in the pit stop.""","Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo will look at team's drivers at the end of season .

"(CNN) -- They laughed, they cried, they celebrated a young life lost too soon. Those attending Jessica Ghawi's memorial service Saturday at a San Antonio church heard numerous adjectives describing the hockey fan and aspiring sports broadcaster. ""Spitfire."" ""Spunky."" ""Clumsy."" ""Tough."" The descriptions punctuated a service that lauded the life of a woman killed while in pursuit of her dreams. Ghawi was among the 12 killed in the July 20 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. Dozens of others were wounded. Her service was one of four held Saturday for victims of the massacre. Matt McQuinn was remembered in Springfield, Ohio; Alex Teves was honored in Phoenix; while a private funeral was held in Illinois for John T. Larimer. Remembering the victims through photos, memories . Ghawi's family created the Jessica Redfield Sports Journalism Scholarship Fund in her name to help others who dream of pursuing careers in journalism. Ghawi, 24, went by the name Jessica Redfield on-air. Several speakers humorously recalled when Ghawi, as an intern wearing high heels, fell three times on the ice while interviewing members of the San Antonio Rampage hockey club. A video of the falls was shown at the service. Pastor Robert Emmitt of Community Bible Church said Ghawi -- despite the pain and embarrassment -- got back up. He called her a ""strong-willed child."" The victim's brother, Jordan Ghawi, referring first to the suspect in the Colorado shooting, had two messages for the audience. ""If this coward could have done this with this much hate, imagine what we can do with this much love,"" he said. ""If you are putting your dreams on hold, you stop that right now. You chase those dreams. You don't know how long you have here."" Mom who lost daughter in shooting has miscarriage . Jessica Ghawi, who moved to the Denver area to pursue her career, narrowly avoided another shooting incident in Toronto just last month -- an incident that prompted her to reflect on life on her blog. The Toronto shooting at the Eaton Centre left one person dead and seven injured. ""I was shown how fragile life was on Saturday. I saw the terror on bystanders' faces. I saw the victims of a senseless crime. I saw lives change,"" she wrote at the time. ""I was reminded that we don't know when or where our time on Earth will end. When or where we will breathe our last breath."" The young woman's boyfriend, minor league hockey player Jay Meloff, said, ""She drank in life and celebrated the things that made us uniquely us."" Tales of heroism abound from Colorado movie theater tragedy . In Ohio, McQuinn's family is still trying to make sense of his heroic death. McQuinn, 27, died shielding his girlfriend, Samantha Yowler, during the shooting. She attended Saturday's memorial service, where Quinn's portrait sat near rows of flowers in the front of Maiden Lane Church of God in Springfield. Herb Shaffer said during the service that his nephew's core goodness and selflessness came out during that midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in Aurora. ""In a moment of crisis, you don't have time to think about what you're going to do, all you have time is to react,"" said Shaffer, who is also a pastor. ""And we saw a picture of Matt in that moment of crisis. ... His immediate response was to protect the one that he loved."" Alex Teves, 24, also died while protecting his girlfriend, Amanda Lindgren. More than a week later, his friends and family gathered in Phoenix to remember his spirit and life. Attendees, including Teves' parents, attended the memorial service in white T-shirts and blue jeans, just as Teves routinely did while in high school and beyond. Teves graduated in June with a master's degree in counseling psychology from the University of Denver. ""He wasn't very vain, he was more interested in relationships,"" his father, Tom Teves, told reporters Saturday before entering Corpus Christi Catholic Church for the service. ""... He put people first, always."" About 1,700 miles away in Crystal Lake, Illinois, Larimer received full military honors at his funeral. The Navy petty officer 3rd class had been in the military for about one year. Like his father and grandfather, the 27-year-old Larimer chose to join the U.S. Navy. He was serving at his first post, said his father, Scott Larimer. Meanwhile, a court document filed Friday showed suspect James Holmes was a patient of a University of Colorado psychiatrist before last week's attack at a movie theater that killed 12 people and wounded scores. The disclosure was in a request by Holmes for authorities to immediately hand over a package he sent to Dr. Lynne Fenton at the university's Anschutz Medical Campus. According to Holmes' request, the package seized by authorities under a July 23 search warrant was a protected communication. ""The materials contained in that package include communications from Mr. Holmes to Dr. Fenton that Mr. Holmes asserts are privileged,"" said the document filed by public defenders representing Holmes. ""Mr. Holmes was a psychiatric patient of Dr. Fenton, and his communications with her are protected."" Victims remembered with poignant stories . In response, prosecutors asked for Arapahoe County District Judge William Sylvester to deny the request by Holmes, saying it contained inaccuracies including claims of media leaks by government officials that in reality may have been fabricated by news organizations. Sylvester granted a hearing on the request for Monday, the same day that Holmes is scheduled to be formally charged in the case. Eleven wounded survivors remained hospitalized Saturday at three facilities, including five in critical condition. One of them, Ashley Moser, underwent ""an additional surgery"" on Saturday morning and also suffered a miscarriage due to ""the extreme trauma she sustained,"" her family said in a statement. Moser's 6-year-old daughter, Veronica, was the youngest person killed in the shooting. How to help the victims .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Among the tens of thousands of people happily enduring the freezing temperatures in Moscow's Bolotnaya Square is Alexey, an international lawyer. He tells me he's never protested before. ""I'm not a political person,"" says Alexey, who asked his full name not be used. ""I'm just a simple Russian citizen."" Alexey says the day after Russia's parliamentary elections he asked his friends and colleagues who they voted for. Not one said United Russia. ""It was some kind of astonishment for me to understand how a party for whom nobody voted could win the elections,"" he says. It was enough to inspire Alexey to protest. His story is not unique. Police estimate 25,000 people gathered in Moscow; protest organizers told the crowd they thought some 80,000 gathered. There are many in the crowd who until recently chose apathy over politics. But the elections on December 4 changed them. The protesters are demanding an annulment of the election results - which saw Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's United Russia party win 238 seats - and a new vote. Writer Dmitry Glukhovsky says it was the first time he voted. The experience transformed him into another first time protester. ""I decided to try to influence the destiny of my country. I came to the polling station, I cast the ballot and it's stolen,"" Glukhovsky says. Another man in the crowd, Vyacheslav Zhmakin, vents similar feelings. ""I'm a little bit angry because they told me, 'give us free time to hear our positions' and so on. And then 'give us your free time to come and vote'. I see my country does not really need my vote,"" Zhmakin says. ""So you want new elections. Do you want anything else?"" I ask. ""Me personally? No,"" he replies. It's another point often repeated by the protesters -- they don't want a revolution. Tamara Mamedova and her friends laugh when I use the R-word. ""We just want free elections. And that's all. We don't want revolution,"" Mamedova says. ""We just want our rights back and that's all."" But the protest movement of this Russian winter does appear to have one thing in common with the Arab Spring. Social networks played a vital role in mobilizing these educated, middle class people to stand in the snow and demand political change. ""I think without the Internet, without Facebook and without Russian parallel social network services, this would not have been possible,"" Glukhovsky says. Many in this crowd are politically inexperienced. None of them is naive. No one here believes this one gathering will convince Prime Minister Putin to annul the vote and hold new elections. But it has inspired hope and the protesters say that's a profound change. ""I feel one, a union, with all these people,"" Mamedova says. ""I believe we can do something. Something really great that can change the whole political situation in Russia.""","Police estimate 25,000 gathered in Moscow to protest recent election results .

"(CNN) -- Silas Redd, who last year racked up five consecutive 100-yard games as tailback for Penn State's Nittany Lions, is leaving the troubled team to head west. ""We welcome Silas Redd to the Trojan Family,"" said the University of Southern California's athletic director, Pat Haden, in a statement on Tuesday. ""He is an outstanding student and athlete."" The 5-foot, 10-inch, 200-pound junior from Norwalk, Connecticut, gained 1,241 rushing yards in his sophomore season, the 10th-highest total in Penn State history. His departure could heighten a fear of attrition that was already hanging over Penn State's football program in the wake of a child sex abuse scandal and as the NCAA has limited the number of scholarships it can offer while allowing current players to transfer. Sandusky voice mails released; abuse victim to sue . The Harrisburg Patriot News had reported that Redd was only one of a handful of players who were planning to leave. His transfer was announced on the same day that Penn State's football team returned for a preseason workout as it heads into its first season in decades without head coach Joe Paterno, who died in January during the sex abuse scandal. Fans, many dressed in the school's royal blue and white and holding signs of support, greeted athletes arriving for the 7 a.m. workout with chants of ""For the team!"" and ""PSU!"" Do sanctions alter history books on legacy? ""It's a crucial time for Penn State Football,"" a university sports radio broadcast called ""The Goon Show"" posted days before on its website in its call to Tuesday's rally. ""It's up to you to show the players why they should stay at PSU."" The fans, who belted out support for Bill O'Brien, Penn State's new head football coach, numbered in the hundreds, CNN affiliate broadcaster WGAL said. Such morale boosters could prove key to the team, which saw NCAA sanctions wipe out more than a decade's worth of wins after the scandal involving former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted on 45 counts of child sex abuse against 10 boys. iReport: Penn State team returns to cheers . Vestiges of Paterno, including his bronze statute in front of Beaver Stadium, vanished amid the scandal. The NCAA slapped the school with a four-year postseason ban and imposed a $60 million sanction after investigators blamed top university leaders, including Paterno, for showing ""total and consistent disregard"" for victims while a sexual predator lurked on campus. Paterno's official record dropped from 409 wins to 298, while the NCAA also struck down six bowl wins and two conference championships. ""We're not giving up on them,"" said Don Smith, a longtime fan. ""What happened was unfortunate, but we're going to come back. Penn State is going to come back stronger than ever.""

"(CNN) -- Team Sky's Bradley Wiggins moved closer to Britain's first overall victory at the Tour de France, maintaining his two minute five second lead over his rivals. Wiggins, who was wearing the leader's yellow jersey for an eleventh straight day, never looked troubled on the 222.5 km route from Blagnac to Brive-la-Gaillarde. His teammate Mark Cavendish reinforced the British team's dominance with a spectacular sprint over the final few hundred meters to claim his second victory of this year's race. The day's stage had earlier been interrupted by a dog breaking onto the course, resulting in a four bike crash. Cavendish, a sprint specialist who will represent Britain at the forthcoming Olympic Games, has spent a lot of the Tour supporting Wiggins' attempt to claim the overall title. ""Cav has waited a while for that and he's been patient. It's been difficult the last couple of weeks, we've had to put his goals and aspirations aside really,"" Wiggins told the Tour website. Wiggins admitted his team mate had sacrificed himself for the yellow jersey chase, but claimed Cavendish had ""been the first to say, 'look guys, I think the general classification is more important."" Cavendish's victory in the 222.5 km stage between Blagnac and Brive-la-Gaillarde was his 22nd stage win at the Tour, moving him up to fourth in the all time records. He is now level with American Lance Armstrong and legendary French sprinter Andre Darrigade. ""Twenty two stage wins... has it sunk in? Yeah! Because I've been waiting to do it for nearly three weeks now,"" Cavendish told the Tour website. ""I'm now equal with Andre Darrigade: he won 15 sprints but 22 stages of the Tour de France. So to match him is something, it makes me happy"" The first incident of the day occurred 120 km into the stage when a large dog ran onto the course, causing a crash. Four riders were unseated in the collision, notably Philippe Gilbert of the BMC team. The former Belgian national champion took a moment to remonstrate with the dog's owner before climbing back onto his bike. Gilbert later received treatment during the race from Tour medical staff. Team RadioShack-Nissan rider Franck Schleck, who withdrew from this year's Tour after a failing a doping test, has protested his innocence after announcing that his 'B' sample also tested positive. ""The result of the counter test was positive, but for me nothing changes,"" he said in a statement. ""I just know that I did nothing wrong. I will therefore continue my search to find out ho the substance could have entered my body.""

"(CNN) -- Christopher Carlson sprang into action when smoke and embers ushered a fire that threatened to envelop his Noble, Oklahoma, home. After taking his 12-year-old stepson to safety, Carlson raced against time to assist neighbors and try to save his trailer from one of more than a dozen wildfires that, as of Saturday, had destroyed more than 120 structures. ""That's what we do in Oklahoma,"" Carlson told CNN on Saturday from Norman. ""We help each other because we are prone to tornadoes, disasters and fires."" Conditions across the state remained critical, state officials said, with high temperatures and winds stoked by a cold front. The Noble fire in Cleveland County, south of Oklahoma City, affected about 7,800 acres and had destroyed 25 structures -- including homes and outbuildings -- as of Saturday, officials said. Residents Friday helped shovel dirt around Carlson's residence to protect it from flames. He checked on neighbors to ensure they were aware of the danger. Dressed in flip-flops and shorts, Carlson doused the outside of his home, which eventually lost several rooms to the fire. Carlson, who has asthma, said he suffered minor burns, smoke inhalation and respiratory failure. Fourteen fires were burning Saturday across the state, according to Michelle Finch-Walker, spokeswoman for Oklahoma Forestry Services. Gov. Mary Fallin toured Luther, where at least 56 structures were lost to a 2,600-acre fire. Resident Joe Love told CNN Oklahoma City affiliate KOCO that he stayed in his residence as long as he could. ""When I left, the fire was right at my back door,"" said Love. ""I don't know what to think right now. I'm just numb to the whole deal."" A fire in Creek County, southwest of Tulsa, had mushroomed to 32,000 acres. Forty structures were reported lost. ""Those numbers are going to grow,"" said Finch-Walker. ""It is rolling. It is a big fire."" Weather has been a fierce enemy . Six helicopters had been deployed, according to Jerry Lojka, spokesman for the state department of emergency management. Officials were unable to handle additional requests. ""This is a repeat of yesterday,"" Lojka told CNN. ""The fires that started to come under control last night are back to full fire."" Oklahoma City tied a record of 113 degrees on Friday, and Saturday's reading was expected to be around 107. Oklahoma, like much of the nation, has been locked in an extreme drought, making fire conditions critical. Officials are urging residents to have an evacuation plan ready and to take extreme precautions outdoors, including limited outdoor grilling and not driving vehicles across bone-dry grass. ""It doesn't take much to strike a blaze in these conditions,"" said Finch-Walker. ""Once the fire gets into a highly vegetative area with a lot of trees it will create its own wind,"" Lojka said. Marc Austin, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Norman, said the region will see somewhat better conditions Sunday, but temperatures will stay in the low 100s next week. Rainfall for the year is 2 inches below normal, but the deficit for the summer is 6.2 inches -- meaning most of the rain fell by spring. A cold front in northwestern Oklahoma brought increased wind speeds to an area enduring sweltering temperatures. ""It makes for a pretty nasty fire weather scenario,"" said Austin. Heat, long tours take toll on firefighters . The wildfires posed special challenges for firefighters, many of whom were getting little sleep. Supervisors were closely watching their crews in the searing, wind-fed heat. ""They can only fight minutes at a time, come out to drink some water and go back in,"" said Capt. John Conkling of the Bristow Fire Department, which is helping combat the Creek County blaze near Freedom Hill. ""Within 15 minutes your socks are squishing wet,"" from perspiration, he said. With winds at about 30 miles per hour and a temperature of about 107, the strategy Saturday was to protect homes, he said. ""To fight this fire offensively would be dangerous."" Still, homes were lost Friday and Saturday. ""You want to try to help people and do the best that you can,"" Conkling said. ""Sometimes you have to pull people back and say we can't do this because it is too dangerous."" Conkling said a couple firefighters were treated for heat exhaustion. Seven firefighters suffered heat-related injuries Friday in Luther, northeast of Oklahoma City, said Lojka. One of them and a trooper were transported to a hospital for treatment. David Richardson, spokesman for the Midwest City Fire Department in suburban Oklahoma City, said many crews are using lighter-weight and specialty gear in the wildfires. ""You've got to rotate those guys out,"" he said. ""You have to look out for their safety."" Regan Siler, wife of Bristow firefighter Mike Siler, said Facebook and other forms of social media are getting the word out to communities about how to help neighbors and fire victims. Residents across the affected areas also were donating snacks, water and Gatorade to fire crews. ""Everybody has come together to try to help,"" said Regan Siler.

"(CNN) -- Bradley Wiggins all but secured his maiden Tour de France victory on Saturday with a storming ride in the 19th and penultimate stage of the race from Bonneval to Chartres. The 32-year-old Sky team rider crossed the finish line in first place, completing the 53.5-kilometer time trial in one hour, four minutes and 13 seconds. The win extends Wiggins' overall lead to nearly three-and-a-half minutes over his teammate Chris Froome, and more than six minutes over Liquigas rider Vincenzo Nibali who is third. ""I don't know what to say. Only one more day to go, and I've won the yellow jersey,"" Wiggins said. ""I've a lot of emotions and a lot of relief it's finished. It's a dream come true, but I've been working to win this for the past five years. The job is done, almost,"" he added. Sunday's final stage to Paris does not traditionally involve a contest for the coveted yellow jersey meaning Wiggins has virtually guaranteed his place in history as the first British rider to win the Tour. Dave Brailsford, manager of the Sky team said: ""We made it our objective to win this race within five years with a clean, British rider, and that's what we've done. It might be a surprise to everyone else, but it's not a surprise to us."" Defending champion Cadel Evans had another disappointing day. The Australian finished the stage in seventh place overall, nearly 16 minutes behind Wiggins. Following his stage win, Wiggins' wife, Cath tweeted: ""Right everyone I am calling it. Operation drink as much champagne as you can. GO.""","Bradley Wiggins on the brink of claiming Britain's first win in Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- Ryan Lochte won the United States' first gold medal at the London Olympics with an outstanding performance in Saturday's 400m individual medley. Swimming superstar Michael Phelps, who has 14 Olympic gold medals from his three previous Olympics, could only manage fourth place in a disappointing performance. ""I think I am in shock right now. Going into these Games I knew I was capable of getting the win. I'm happy that I was able to do that,"" said Lochte. The rivalry between Lochte and Phelps has dominated the build up to this year's swimming competition, but Phelps couldn't live up to the hype as he struggled to find the form that helped him win eight golds in eight days at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. With First Lady Michelle Obama in attendance, Lochte, the current Fina male swimmer of the year, dominated the race from the start. The six-time Olympic medal winner, including three golds, opened up an early lead and never looked liked being caught in the race that combines four different strokes. Phelps hasn't missed out on a medal since finishing fifth in the 200m butterfly at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but he ends day one empty handed after finishing behind surprise medal winners Thiago Pereira and Kosuke Hagino. ""It was just a crappy race. They swam a better race than me, they swam a smarter race than me and that is why they are on the podium,"" said Phelps, who is scheduled to compete in seven events at the Games. ""It's just really frustrating to start off on a bad note like this, it's pretty upsetting."" ""The biggest thing now is to try and get past this and move forward. I have a bunch of races and hopefully we can finish this a lot better than we started. Brazilian Pereira won his first Olympic medal, having previously competed at the 2004 Athens and 2008 Beijing Olympics.

"(CNN) -- Heavy rains from the outer bands of Typhoon Saola, which hovered near the Philippines beginning last week, have left 23 people dead and another five injured, an official with the National Disaster Coordinating Center said Thursday. The center's executive director, Benito Ramos, told CNN in a telephone interview that another 129 people -- most of them fishermen -- had been rescued. Forty-four evacuation centers were opened as Manila and the cities of Valenzuela and Malabon north of the capital along Manila Bay remained flooded, he said. In all, Saola dropped as much as half a meter (1.5 feet) of rain over the Philippines, said CNNI Meteorologist Taylor Ward. Rains over the Philippines were only intermittent by Thursday at about 4 a.m., when the typhoon -- packing winds of 157 kph (98 mph) was making landfall in northeast Taiwan, said Ward. Taipingshan, a mountainous in northern Taiwan, got more than 1.7 meters (5.6 feet) of rain. ""The mountains really help enhance the rainfall,"" Ward said. ""They basically force the air upwards, and that squeezes out the possible precipitation."" He described Saola as the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane in the Atlantic when it made landfall in Taiwan. It was expected to continue at similar strength into China, striking 300 to 400 miles south of Shanghai at about 10 p.m. Thursday (10 a.m. ET). The U.S. government's National Hurricane Center describes a Category 2 storm as one with sustained winds of 154-177 kph (96 - 110 mph) that ""will cause extensive damage."" Another typhoon -- Typhoon Damrey -- was expected to strike about 150 miles north of Shanghai, Ward said. Damrey was expected to be slightly weaker -- the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane in the Atlantic, he said. The hurricane center describes those as packing sustained winds of 119-153 kph (74-95 mph) that ""will produce some damage.""

"(CNN) -- ""Twisted Metal"" introduces a new generation of gamers to the mechanical mayhem of the smash-'em-up series' previous games, while actually adding in a little bit of a story to tie all the action together. The new game from creator David Jaffe and Eat Sleep Play not only brings back some familiar and twisted characters, but it also reworks a demolition-derby style of combat that pits vehicle against vehicle with explosive results. The game sticks to the basic plot of the 1995 original -- winning a tournament to gain a granted wish. In single-player mode, gamers will play three of its classic characters -- Sweet Tooth, Mr. Grimm and Dollface -- in succession. Vehicles for combat are chosen before each battle. Players can usually select three for each scenario and change them out at a garage, theoretically ensuring them a nonbusted ride at all times. Starting with Sweet Tooth's iconic ice cream truck, the virtual garage includes a motorcycle, a helicopter, a semitruck and even an ambulance that vaguely resembles Ecto-1 from ""Ghostbusters."" Selection is limited at first, but more vehicles are unlocked as missions are completed. Each vehicle has its own specialized weapons -- Kamikaze has a flame thrower, while Reaper can fling chainsaws. More weapons and ammunition are scattered all over the playing field. There are also spots to restore health, so players can get a bit of a boost even if they can't make it back to their garages. Cars can also be customized, if that is your thing, and any driver can use any car. The battle areas vary in size and scope. Some smash-ups are played out in little towns with residents running for cover (or, inevitably, getting run over). Many of the buildings are destructible and some are even large enough to drive into and engage opponents in combat. There is a battle-dome type area with multiple levels and hidden passageways. A new superopponent, The Juggernaut, not only takes you on himself, but also spawns other foes who drive out of the back of his massive tractor-trailer. Since the object of each battle is to be the last one driving, taking out the Juggernaut is something that needs to be done but doesn't happen easily. The combat gets progressively harder as the game moves through the stories of the three main characters. Boss battles are appropriately tough, but some fights are so difficult, you'll want to snap your controller. (Resist that temptation). The story that acts as a backdrop for the behind-the-wheel chaos makes learning about combat fun. Sure, it's all about destroying your opponents. But having a reason to do it, rather than destruction for destruction's sake, makes more sense. Cinematics are smartly handled with both live actors and animationm, providing nice background into each character's history and reason for wanting to win the tournament. The character Calipso returns as the ringmaster for this violent contest and has the power to grant a single wish to the winner. But be careful what you wish for. Multiplayer action pits faction against faction and really lets a player's violent streak come through. Teams are based on popular characters from the franchise -- The Clowns, The Dolls, The Skulls and The Holy Men (led by the Preacher). There are several game modes available to allow for split-screen action and online play. While most combat is of the last-man-standing variety, a new mode offers a bit of levity to the bloodshed. Called the ""Nuke"" mode, it also requires the most teamwork. Players must kidnap an opposing team's leader, take them back to their base and then sacrifice them to a missile launcher. The launcher then fires off a nuclear missile, which must be guided to strike a giant metal statue being held aloft by a helicopter. Do this three times and you win the match. It is slapstick comedy with a morbid twist and is perfect for this franchise's long-established play on humor with a sense of the macabre. ""Twisted Metal"" is a great outlet for mindless destruction and unintentional levity all wrapped up into neat little, blood-soaked boxes made of metal. It isn't meant to be deep, meaningful or even realistic, but it achieves what games should be all about -- it is fun. ""Twisted Metal"" is exclusive to the PlayStation 3, and available now in the United States and on March 7 in Europe. It is rated M for Mature because of blood and gore, intense violence and strong language. This review was completed with an advance Limited Edition copy for the PS3.","Game brings back familiar characters and a demolition-derby style of vehicular combat .

"Beijing (CNN) -- It has been called the first ""Twitter Olympics"" in the West, including on CNN. But in China -- where the government has long blocked the popular U.S.-based social media site -- the London Games are undoubtedly the first ""Weibo Olympics."" Micro-blogging sites -- called ""Weibo"" in Chinese -- have exploded in China since one of the country's biggest web portals, Sina, launched its Twitter-like service in 2009, a year after the Beijing Olympics. Now several leading Weibo sites give an estimated 250 million users a platform for unprecedented diversity of opinion on the world's biggest sporting event and beyond. Million of comments are being posted about Olympic-related topics, with many echoing the state media coverage's cheers and celebration over Chinese athletes' stellar performance, especially the two record-shattering swims by the country's gold medalist Ye Shiwen. Read more: Ye's Shiwen's 'unbelievable' swims are talk of Olympics . State media covered allegations raised by Western coaches and journalists that Ye had been doped with nationalistic fervor, prompting countless profanity-filled tirades against her accusers on Sina Weibo. However many cooler heads also reminded their fellow countrymen to look at the overall international reception to Ye's achievements. ""I'm actually surprised to see that 99% of Americans seem to be defending Ye's innocence in their comments on CNN's story on her,"" posted a user named Muyao. ""We can't simply say Western media did this or that -- they don't speak with one voice,"" wrote a user named Hongwenkaiqiang. Read more: China says West being 'petty' over Ye . Others also pointed out that state media has largely failed to mention the 1990s, an embarrassing period for Chinese swimmers during which several female stars tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. ""The impact of the scandals back then is still being felt today,"" said user Dahaoheshan. Many Sina Weibo users, who continue to brave the seven-hour time difference to stay up late for live Olympics coverage, have also exchanged views on China's state-sponsored sports system -- thoughts often too provocative to be heard in state-controlled media. Read more: Doping expert: 'Only 10% caught' Some had harsh words for the seemingly cruel aspects of the system's ""gold-medal-at-all-cost"" mentality, for example, when diving gold medalist Wu Minxia's mother told domestic media that she hid the news of the passing of Wu's grandparents as well as her own breast cancer so not to distract Wu from her training. ""Is a gold medal so important that even the deaths of her grandparents should be kept in secret?"" asked user Binghanyulin. ""Is a gold medal more important than family ties?"" A similar sentiment emerged following reports in Chinese media that Zhang Chenglong, a member of the gold-winning men's gymnastic team, had spent only 17 days at home with his family in the past 14 years. ""I wonder if this is any different from being sent to prison -- except even prisons allow visitors,"" commented a user whose lengthy handle begins with ""Shenme."" ""How would seeing your family have a devastating impact on your sports performance?"" Read more: Olympics Day 5 sees scandals, joy, world records and controversy . There has also been an outpouring of online sympathy and support for athletes who have failed to reach the top in London, like weightlifter Wu Jingbiao who cried uncontrollably after winning a silver and apologized on national television for ""letting the country down. ""You don't have to apologize -- I don't think gold medals equal the Olympic spirit,"" said user Yuzili. ""We all cheered for you -- it was just a game."" Besides all the serious reflection on the country's sports system, some Weibo posts also touched the lighter -- albeit no less sensitive -- side of Chinese athletics. After Team China captured the top prize in men's gymnastics, one member, Feng Zhe -- a prolific poster on Sina Weibo with almost two million followers -- received more than just heartfelt congratulations. A one-line message he posted in October 2010 was dug up, generating thousands of retweets and comments within hours. The post teased: ""The reason you're not gay is because you haven't met the man who can capture your heart."" While some thought it was just Feng being his facetious self, the overwhelming response appeared to hail a rare coming out for gay Chinese athletes. The post soon disappeared from Feng's public feed. Even at the free-spirited Weibo Olympics, some taboo subjects seem to remain.","Unprecedented Olympic chatter in China over micro-blogging sites .

"(CNN) -- The former head of media baron Rupert Murdoch's News International was formally charged at a London police station Thursday in the eavesdropping probe that has rocked the News Corp. empire and British government, London police said. Authorities announced last week that Rebekah Brooks -- who besides being a onetime chief executive of News International, which is the division of News Corp. that includes the company's British newspapers, also had been editor of The News of the World tabloid -- was among those being charged in the high-profile case. On Thursday evening, she ""answered bail"" at Lewisham police station in the British capital and ""was charged"" with several offenses, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a written statement. She posted bail and is scheduled to next appear in court on September 3. The long-running police investigation prompted by illegal eavesdropping at the defunct Murdoch tabloid The News of the World has expanded into probes of computer hacking, bribery and corruption. Brooks served as that newspaper's editor before taking the same role at The Sun and eventually rising to the CEO position with News International. The announced names of the suspected hacking victims include some of the world's biggest celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Jude Law, Paul McCartney and soccer star Wayne Rooney. The phone-hacking accusations have reverberated through the top levels of British politics and journalism, led to the major tabloid's closing and prompted a parliamentary committee to issue damning criticism of Murdoch. Others charged in the case include Andy Coulson, an editor at News of the World who went on to become director of communications for British Prime Minister David Cameron before resigning. According to Thursday's release from London police, Brooks was charged on three offenses. The first claims that she -- along with Coulson, Stuart Kuttner, Greg Miskiw, Ian Edmondson, Neville Thurlbeck and James Weatherup -- conspired between October 3, 2000, and August 9, 2006, ""to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority."" Specifically, the charge asserts that they listened to ""voice mail messages of well-known people."" Another charge accuses Brooks, Coulson, Kuttner, Miskiw, Thurlbeck and Glenn Mulcaire of intercepting messages of Milly Dowler, the 13-year-old British schoolgirl who was abducted and murdered in 2002. Lastly, Brooks, Mulcaire and Miskiw are charged with, between December 3, 2002, and January 22, 2003, conspiring to intercept the messages of firefighter trade union boss Andy Gilchrist. Brooks has previously vigorously denied the charges against her, saying she was ""distressed and angry."" The scandal exploded with the revelation that the phone of Dowler was hacked after she disappeared in 2002. She was later found murdered. Indications that her voice mail had been accessed had given her parents the false hope she was still alive. Prosecutors allege there were more than 600 victims of phone hacking between 2000 and 2006. The investigation and public notoriety has been damaging to News Corp. and Murdoch, who stepped down from a string of company boards of directors earlier this month and further distanced himself from the print business that first brought him fame and fortune.","Rebekah Brooks is charged on 3 offenses at a London police station, police say .

"Houston (CNN) -- For the God-fearing, Harvard-educated NBA star Jeremy Lin, it's deja vu all over again except for two things: This time he's entering Houston's Toyota Center with an fat paycheck in his pocket and inflated expectations in the stands. ""I still have to kind of remind myself that this is actually happening sometimes,"" Lin told reporters in Houston, where he was making his redux debut as a Rocket on Thursday before a phalanx of reporters and cameras after the New York Knicks failed to match Houston's three-year, $25 million offer for the point guard. ""But it's a huge blessing from God, and I can't believe how it all shaped up for me, and for me to be able to be here right now, I'm definitely excited and thankful."" Over the past seven months, the 6-foot-2, 200-pound, 23-year-old of Taiwanese descent has made quite a leap. Lin was waived by the Golden State Warriors on December 9 and was picked up by Houston on December 12. He appeared in two pre-season outings with the Rockets before the team let him go on December 24. The undrafted point guard then burst into the consciousness of the sports world in early February when then-Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni called him off the bench as the team was struggling with an 8-15 start. As Lin's heroics led the Knicks on an improbable seven-game winning streak, ""Linsanity"" entered the national lexicon and Lin's previous employer was among the millions who were paying attention. ""We made an error by letting him go, and I think we rectified it now,"" Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander told reporters Thursday. Lin said the Rockets' approach came as a welcome surprise. ""I didn't know that they were that interested, but when I heard I was excited, just because I knew what the franchise was about."" And this time, he won't be sleeping on a teammate's couch, as he did last year when he was just trying to make a roster. ""It's definitely nice to be able to have more job security,"" he said. ""It isn't necessarily the amount of dollars; it's the fact that I signed a three-year deal so I get to play this game in the NBA for three more years. I don't think it's all about money, but I think, at the same time, how much they put shows their investment and their belief in you as a player."" As for Houston, ""I've heard the fans here are very loyal and very crazy,"" Lin told CNN's Mark McKay. ""I'm going to have fun playing here. However big the spotlight is, as long as me and my teammates are having fun playing basketball, that's really all that matters."" Asked if he was concerned he might prove to be a flash in the pan and not a perennial all-star, Lin said, ""No one has the answer to that question. The only thing I can tell them is I'm going to work as hard as I can and I'm going to buy into this team and I'm going to try to help the team become as good as we can. It's not about how many times you can become an all-star, it's about your own team's success."" Lin said retired Rocket Yao Ming, a Chinese basketball star, sent him a text message of congratulations after his return to Houston was announced. ""I've always had so much respect for him,"" Lin said. ""I would watch him when I was a kid, anytime he would come to the Bay area, I would buy tickets and go watch him play."" But now, the economics major is thinking about his own brand and, ultimately, his legacy. ""When I'm done playing basketball, I want people to think of me a certain way, and that is to play basketball the right way, play as a team, play unselfishly, play hard and then, off the court, to really serve and love other people. That's where I want to go in terms of the brand."" Being a role model for younger Asians is also important for him, Lin said. NBA stars have game off the court, too . ""I have a strong desire in my heart to be able to break certain stereotypes about Asians and Asian-Americans, especially in sports,"" he said. ""I just think as time goes on, I think we'll start to see more Asian-Americans in sports. Hopefully, we will be able to continue to earn more and more respect when it comes to sports.""","""We made an error by letting him go,"" Rockets owner says .

"(CNN) -- Spanish rider Alejandro Valverde won stage 17 of the Tour de France on Thursday, as Bradley Wiggins edged closer to Britain's first overall victory in cycling's premier race. With three stages remaining, Wiggins leads his Team Sky colleague Chris Froome by just over two minutes. Valverde finished 18 seconds ahead of Wiggins and Froome on the final stage in the Pyrenees, recording Team Movistar's first win at this year's Tour. The 32-year-old had a lead of 2:35 as the riders began the final 15-kilometer climb, but struggled to maintain his advantage as the two British riders closed in and finished just 19 seconds ahead. ""When I felt that Froome and Wiggins were approaching me on the final climb, I gave everything I could to resist their chase and, after 500 meters from the finish line, I started to tell myself that it was good,"" Valverde told the Tour website after finishing first on the 143.5 km route between Bagneres-de-Luchon and Peyragudes. ""I've had a lot of bad luck since the start of the Tour, and it was very difficult to manage. I fell three times in two days, and it wasn't looking good,"" said Valverde, referring to the crashes suffered by Team Movistar in the early stages of the race. ""I focused on a stage win. I really tried; until now far it hasn't worked but we had to keep fighting the bad luck."" Valverde's best finish is sixth in 2007, but he has only returned to cycling this year following a doping ban. ""This is a very special victory for me,"" he said. ""I'm back in the squad and I'm winning again, like I did before. For two years I had to stop competing but I never stopped working. ""This is why I was on the podium in a world of my won, and I was not able to restrain my tears."" Wiggins has worn the yellow jersey for most of the three-week event and is now almost certain to become the first Briton to win the prestigious race following its final day in the mountains. ""It was the first time I allowed myself to think that I've won the Tour. All the way up, the last bit my concentration had gone,"" said Wiggins ahead of Friday's leg from Blagnac to Brive-La-Gaillarde -- which will see the focus go back on the sprinters. ""The nature of the Tour is that people fall by the wayside as the race goes on. That's the effect of the length of the race and how hard it is; it's the nature of the Tour de France.

"(CNN) -- Officials in Michigan and Canada announced Friday that they have agreed to build a new bridge linking Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. The bridge is estimated to cost around $950 million, and should help create as many as 10,000 jobs in Michigan alone, according to the office of Gov. Rick Snyder. The project includes the bridge, Canadian and U.S. inspection plazas and an interchange with Interstate 75, according to the office of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. It will be funded by Canada and is expected to take four or five years to complete. ""Our government is taking the measures necessary to facilitate trade and investment between Canada and the United States in order to generate jobs, economic growth and long term prosperity,"" Harper said in the statement. ""This new bridge will reduce congestion at this critical Canada-U.S. border crossing, support the creation of new export-related jobs and investment opportunities along the Quebec City-Windsor corridor, increase the competitiveness of the North American manufacturing sector, and provide thousands of construction jobs in Ontario and Michigan,"" he added. Harper appeared at an afternoon news conference, alongside Snyder and U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. It will be the second to span the Detroit River. The existing bridge is the busiest trade crossing on the U.S.-Canada border, serving about 8,000 trucks each day, Snyder said. ""It's time for a new crossing. It's time because trade demands it.

"(CNN) -- We had no idea five guys with a clever photo tradition would capture so much interest. But the overwhelming response to a recent story about high school friends who've kept in touch over three decades through summer lakeside reunions and a commemorative photo shoot made us wonder what other creative ways people document their travels, relationships and experiences. If you're traveling with Andrew Bennett, you know he'll hand over a camera to capture him doing a handstand in front of some of the world's noted landmarks. Is the photo better than the vacation? Bear, an aptly named stuffed animal, is likely to turn up in Sue Brady's travel shots. Claire Warmenbol doesn't need any help or props: She simply points her camera at her feet to get the right shots. In an era of digital photography and smartphones, it's easier than ever to create special traditions. The photo essay is no longer limited to professional photographers or people documenting the first day of school, Christmas or a college reunion. Seven beauties of the British Isles . Where the tradition starts . iReporter Bennett wanted a twist on the usual smiling-in-front-of-a-landmark shot. ""I thought to myself, 'I bet there aren't too many pictures of people doing handstands in front of the Eiffel Tower,'"" wrote Bennett, an Austin, Texas, resident who started his tradition in 2007 when he was studying abroad in Spain. ""So I started doing handstands everywhere we went. I've traveled abroad several times since that trip, most recently to Israel this summer, and the tradition has continued."" Geneva-based iReporter Claire Warmenbol, who has been taking pictures of her feet around the world for about 10 years, thinks she started snapping shots in response to the question, ""Why do you travel so much?"" Her answer: ""Itchy feet!"" Warmenbol often travels alone for the great sense of freedom it gives her. From the stoop to social media . Steve Springer's photo project didn't start with photography or travel in mind. On August 25, 1971, his Bronx-based trio of childhood friends were in high school when they decided to meet at the stoop where they always hung out in exactly 10 years. They didn't take a picture that day, but found a photo later taken about that time and decided to replicate it each decade. Every 10 years, Springer, Steve Haimowitz, Errol Honig and other friends and assorted spouses and children travel from Florida, Washington, D.C., California and just around the block to meet at the stoop to take the picture (standing in the same positions), play stickball and reminisce. Now the photos are posted on former CNN staffer Springer's blog and the group's Facebook page. The men even made a YouTube video of their photo shoot. ""That stoop was our hangout, it's where if we weren't playing ball or going to movies or playing records, that's where we hung out,"" said Springer. The tradition and the electronic community the men have created is ""simply a continuation of a friendship built 40 years ago, and we're trying to keep it going and keep it alive. People post every day on our Facebook page. It's like we're hanging out on the stoop."" Last year's 40th anniversary celebration was delayed by 24 hours because Honig was driving his daughter to start college in upstate New York. ""That seemed an awfully good reason to delay things by 24 hours,"" wrote Springer on his blog. 27 must-sees on Earth . Gratitude for many things . While the photos bring back memories, they also remind people of their families, friends and other items on their gratitude lists. ""I think about how blessed I've been to have had the opportunity to go to all these places,"" Bennett wrote. ""Some were during study abroad, some were on family vacations, and some were for work with ISA (International Studies Abroad). I also try not to take myself too seriously, so doing handstands is my way of keeping a light heart during my travels. Warmenbol's ritual reminds her why she travels. ""It's 'me' moments on holidays, key moments of being somewhere special; capturing stillness whilst being on the move,"" she wrote. It's not too late to start a tradition . A friend gave ""Bear"" to Sue Brady of Los Banos, California, after Brady's gentleman friend of 22 years passed away three years ago. Brady, 63, had always traveled with her companion, and now preferred to travel alone -- except for Bear, the stuffed polar bear.

"(CNN) -- A Virginia woman is being hailed as a hero after she reportedly lifted a car off her father and performed CPR, saving his life. Alec Kornacki was in the family garage Saturday working on a car when a jack holding it up slipped, according to Kristen Kornacki, another one of his daughters. Lauren Kornacki, the daughter who rescued him, found her father pinned to the ground and unresponsive. ""She proceeded to lift up the car, pull him out and then give him CPR,"" said Kristen Kornacki. Lauren Kornacki, 22, who lives in Glen Allen, near Richmond, is trained as a lifeguard, according to CNN affiliate WWBT. ""It flashed like, oh my God, I'm going to lose my dad,"" she told the affiliate. ""I knew I had to get his heart beating again."" Alec Kornacki is being treated at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center. A call seeking comment on his condition was not immediately returned. He has several broken ribs, some numbness and other fractures, but likely suffered no permanent damage, according to WWBT. He is still in the ICU. According to his daughter Kristen, Alec Kornacki is ""healing fantastically."" His family shot a brief video of him walking in the hospital hallway, slow but steady. ""He is walking and talking and laughing and joking. He's feeling pretty good,"" she said. ""He's Superman, that's for sure.""

"(CNN) -- Over the past couple of days, I've listened with mounting frustration as people debate whether Penn State University should remove from its campus the 900-pound bronze statue of Joe Paterno, its once-legendary football coach. It's as if, to the folks who demand action, taking away a metal JoePa would serve as another blow to the real JoePa; one last spear in the heart of the fallen hero who apparently looked elsewhere as Jerry Sandusky, his longtime assistant coach and friend, molested one child after another. Sadly, it just doesn't work that way. As much as I have come to abhor Joe Paterno's indifference and arrogance and self-serving loyalty (to himself and his image and his stupid little football program), I fail to see how digging out a statue does anything but conflict with (what should be) one of the most important elements of higher education: Open and honest and intelligent dialogue. Were I in command of this decision, not only would I make certain the statue stays, I'd surround it with flood lights and fireworks and hire Flavor Flav to hype its very presence. ""Come one, come all! Camp out! Bring classmates! Observe the bronze Joe Paterno! Debate away!"" Truth be told, the last thing we (and Penn State) should be doing right now is trying to hide and forget what happened. Bronze Joe Paterno needs to remain, because we need to talk about this. We need to discuss ways to stop child abuse. We need to discuss the courage it takes to step forward, especially when it's significantly easier to remain silent. We need to discuss the goals of college. Mostly, we need to discuss statues themselves -- and what they reflect. The reason Jerry Sandusky was able to perpetrate his evil is because at Penn State (as at hundreds of other Division I schools across America) sports have exceeded academics in importance. The athletic programs are responsible for large dollars; for large enrollments; for national attention; for eternal glory. They are not to be stopped or interfered with or questioned. University: Paterno statue to be removed . Joe Paterno has a statue for the same reason Auburn University built one for former quarterback Cam Newton (a non-graduate who attended the school for one year) -- because football (literally, the launching of a synthetic oval contraption through the air) exceeds all else. Why, in 2007, five Penn State scientists (Richard Alley, William Easterling, Klaus Keller, Michael Mann, Anne Thompson) shared the Nobel Peace Prize for their work on climate change issues. None of them have statues (rest assured, had any committed Sandusky-like acts, they would have been turned over to the authorities in minutes). None of them will have statues. Ever. That's pathetic. Bronze Joe Paterno needs to stay because, deep within his metallic eyeballs, there is a story to be told. Years and years from now, when most of us are gone and this scandal is merely a blip in history, he will hopefully serve as the essential reminder that, once upon a time, we deified people for their ability to win ultimately meaningless and trivial games. And we paid a dear price for doing so. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"(CNN) -- France's Pierrick Fedrigo won stage 15 of the Tour de France on Monday, as Britain's Bradley Wiggins consolidated his hold on the leader's yellow jersey. The 158.5-kilometer ride between Samatan and Pau saw a further six riders withdraw from the race as cycling's premier event entered its third and final week. Fedrigo became the fourth Frenchman to win a stage at this year's race when he beat Christian Vande Velde in a sprint to the line in Pau. The two racers had surged ahead of the leading pack with 6.5 km to go. ""I don't know why I attacked, it was just instinct. But when Vande Velde stopped giving me relays in the last kilometer I knew that I would soon have to sprint,"" Fedrigo said. ""Thankfully, I've got a little more punch than him."" Wiggins edged nearer to a place in the record books with a solid, if uninspiring, ride. No Englishman has won the Tour de France before, and Wiggins' Team Sky have made it clear they value the yellow jersey above the other titles on offer. Last year's green jersey winner Mark Cavendish would have expected to be part of the pack sprinting for a stage win, but he stuck to team orders and helped protect Wiggins as he rode to maintain his overall lead. The 32-year-old, who was born in Belgium where his Australian father was based, finished in the peloton 11 minutes and 50 seconds behind Fedrigo. Wiggins remained two minutes and five seconds ahead of teammate Chris Froome, with Italy's Vincenzo Nibali third at 2:23 behind and Australia's defending champion Cadel Evans fourth (3:19). The leader described Cavendish as ""a great champion and a great friend"" after the race, and admitted that his teammate had ""been so committed to my cause -- to the yellow jersey."" Chasing down history: Wiggins' Tour quest . Team Sky will, however, try to give Olympic hopeful Cavendish a chance to win Sunday's final sprint stage in Paris. ""Obviously there is still the stage to Paris for him, and we're going to lay it down in Paris for him and try to get him the win there,"" Wiggins said. ""He's also got the Olympic road race, that's his main objective this year. In the end, we've got a difficult task on our hands to try to win the yellow jersey."" With only five stages left in this year's Tour, the field is now down to 156 riders following 42 withdrawals. Sylvain Chavanel was Monday's most notable retiree. The French time trial champion was struggling to breathe as he felt the effects of a chest infection. ""He's lost his voice and he'd been finding it hard to breathe,"" explained his team Omega-Pharma's sporting director Brian Holm. ""This morning he was really sick. He spoke with the doctors of the team and they've advised him it would be best to pull out of the Tour."" The riders have a rest day on Tuesday before resuming with a 197 km ride from Pau to Bagneres-du-Luchon, including four mountain climbs, on Wednesday.","Pierrick Fedrigo becomes fourth French stage winner at this year's race .

"(CNN) -- Wednesday marked Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day. Across the United States, conservatives gathered in chicken restaurants to show support for the company after its president, Dan Cathy, came out against gay marriage. Democratic mayors in Chicago and Boston at first threatened to halt expansion of the Chick-fil-A chain to their cities, which turned a question of sexual morality into a debate about freedom of speech. The motto of conservative Christians seems to be, ""They'll take my chicken from my cold dead hand..."" Writing as a European, this story combines two of the things we most readily associate with America: Jesus Christ and fast food. It certainly reflects a uniquely American phenomenon. There are religious businesspeople and raging conservatives in other parts of the world, but only the United States enjoys all the elements that could turn a statement of conscience into nationwide movement. Where else in the world would a) the president of a chicken restaurant chain feel it was within his remit to publicly endorse ""the traditional family,"" b) liberal mayors totally overreact by trying to stop his business' expansion, c) a former presidential candidate declare an ""appreciation day"" for the restaurant, and d) hundreds of people actually show up to eat there in solidarity? Opinion: Chick-fil-A and free speech . The whole scenario seems so preposterous as to be contrived, which makes me wonder if it was a brilliant sales gimmick. Yet, we have no reason to doubt the strength of Cathy's faith and, after all, Chick-fil-A isn't the only company with a taste for Christian witness. Norm Miller, chairman of Interstate Batteries, discusses his faith on his company's website and offers advice on prayer. In-N-Out Burger prints ""John 3:16"" on the bottom of its paper cups. Hobby Lobby says it is committed to ""honoring the Lord"" and closes all its stores on a Sunday. Are there other corporations out there with a hidden religious agenda that we all missed because we weren't looking for it? Is Ronald McDonald the acceptable face of Seventh-Day Adventism? That this story revolves around a chicken restaurant might incline us to be skeptical about its political significance. But don't forget that the tea party started with a trading floor rant and was initially lampooned for its innocent association with the tea bag. In America, businesses have often been the battlegrounds for political conflicts, think of the civil rights movement's lunch counter sit-ins. Time will only tell whether or not this is an important moment in the revival of conservative religious activism. However, it does offer two immediate warnings about the November election. Opinion: The right way and the wrong way to protest Chick-fil-A . First, culture will matter. There's always a tendency to presume that in presidential elections ""it's the economy stupid."" The polls confirm that voters still place moral questions very low on their list of priorities. But cultural issues keep on coming up in ways that we didn't expect: contraception in February, gay marriage in May, guns in July, and now we're back to gay marriage. It could be that bad jobs reports are so common that they've become the background noise of the campaign, while the matters related to sex and violence compete more colorfully for our attention. But no, something more complex is taking place: Economics and culture are becoming synonymous. News: Jim Henson Co. ends five decade relationship with Chick-fil-A over gay marriage stance . In rallying to Cathy's defense, some conservatives have pointed out that his company has created jobs and that attempts to block its growth are bad for middle-class Americans. They made the same case against Michael Bloomberg's war on supersized drinks. There's a theme to the complaints emerging: that in their pursuit of liberal ends the Democrats are costing jobs, while patriotic conservatives like Cathy are repairing the economy and spreading the gospel. Mitt Romney is now running billboard ads that lampoon Obama's claim that businesses need government support to flourish. The implicit choice that the right is trying to establish is ""hardworking, self-reliant Christian businessmen"" vs ""welfare-supporting, anti-growth, atheistic bureaucrats."" Hence, debates that can seem only to be about culture can actually become a way of discussing who is to blame for our economic woes. Second, the sheer number of people involved in the Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day suggests that turnout will matter in November. A common theme among tweets coming out of the restaurant demonstrations Wednesday was that conservative strength lies in numbers. One photo caption read, ""Hey liberals, the turnout for Chick-fil-A appreciation day is a preview of the polling stations in November."" Maybe, maybe not. But the polls are close and the number of undecided voters is falling. America is settling down into two, surprisingly partisan, camps of voters who probably won't change their minds significantly until voting day. If that pattern holds, then turnout is all important. In 2004, the ability of the Bush team to get out their religious vote swung them a relatively close election. If Mitt Romney can effectively establish the link between economics and culture, and then motivate conservatives to turn out in big numbers, then the Chick-fil-A moment could prove prophetic.

"(CNN) -- Former Baltimore Orioles ""Iron man"" Cal Ripken Jr. said Friday that his 74-year-old mother is doing well after being abducted by a gunman last week, but he thinks the kidnapping might have been premeditated.

She was found about 6:15 a.m. Wednesday in the back seat of her vehicle near her home. Her hands were bound but she was otherwise unharmed. Once she realized that she was alone in the car, the elder Ripken managed to stick a sweater out of the car window to attract attention, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. Aberdeen authorities say they are still looking for motives in the case and haven't found evidence of ransom demands for the elder Ripken. ""At this time I can say we know of no ransom demand,"" Police Chief Henry Trabert told reporters last week. He also said police don't know of any relationship between the suspect and the Ripken family. The suspect apparently put sunglasses on the woman and they drove around all day and made stops for gas, but made no mention of Cal Ripken Jr., Trabert said. The gunman did take the elder Ripken's credit cards and it appears he used them at several places, the chief said. Police are looking for a white male with a light, thin build in his late 30s to early 40s last seen wearing a light-colored shirt, glasses and ""camo pants."" Police consider the man armed and dangerous. Authorities are currently trying to enhance video of surveillance footage from a nearby store, the source said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jermaine Jackson retracted his signature on a letter made public last month criticizing executors of Michael Jackson's estate and his mother's advisers Monday. His expression of regret came as a letter from sister Janet Jackson's lawyer surfaced that suggested the pop star's professional reputation has suffered ""significant harm"" from media reports about the controversy. ""After much soul-searching, it is clearly time for us to live by Michael's words about love not war,"" Jermaine Jackson said in a statement given to CNN. ""In this spirit, I offer this statement by way of extending an olive branch."" It was the letter, originally signed by Jackson siblings Jermaine, Tito, Randy, Janet and Rebbie, that triggered a series of dramatic and public events over the last two weeks that created a deep divide in the famous music family. They demanded that executors John Branca and John McClain resign, accusing them of emotional and financial abuse of Katherine Jackson. ""Your actions are affecting her health, and on top of that, we've just found out she recently had a mini-stroke,"" it said. ""Please understand, she's not equipped to handle the stress load you are putting on her."" Jackson family drama an unwanted reality show . Her lawyer later said Katherine Jackson, 82, had not suffered a stroke and was in good health. The letter also called the will, which left Michael Jackson's wealth to his mother and three children, giving nothing to his siblings, ""fake, flawed and fraudulent."" Jermaine Jackson said he has decided the letter should never have been made public, but that his concerns about the estate and will should be expressed through ""a private dialogue, not public conflict."" ""Accordingly, I rescind my signature from the letter which was sent to the estate, and which should never have gone public,"" he said. Tito Jackson retracted his signature last week amid the controversy over his mother's whereabouts and the lack of a phone call to Michael Jackson's children. Katherine Jackson had custody of Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson since her son's June 25, 2009, death, but a judge suspended it last week when her lawyers told the court she had been missing and out of communication for 10 days. Jermaine Jackson said his motivation in taking part in a plan with Janet, Randy and Rebbie Jackson to isolate their mother at an Arizona spa was ""rooted in the welfare of our mother in the environment where she lives."" ""No one on the outside has a clue about the stresses and pressures she has been under long before recent events and I, like everyone in the family, adore the ground she walks on,"" he said. ""Rest was the sole reason she went to Arizona,"" he said. ""Prince even carried her bags down the stairs and urged her to rest up, because we all come from the same caring place."" Despite 'Unity' concert, Jackson family feud simmers . Prince and his sister, however, became vocal through their Twitter accounts about their grandmother's absence and lack of calls. They thought she was flying to a Jackson brothers concert in New Mexico and would return soon, her lawyer said. ""There was never a malicious attempt to 'block' the kids from talking with her,"" Jermaine Jackson said. ""We simply worried that a call home would first entail, or lead to, conversations with individuals we are in dispute with and that would, therefore, increase pressure on Mother -- and pressure was what a doctor said she didn't need."" His statement also addressed the dramatic confrontation on Monday, July 23, at Katherine Jackson's home in Calabasas, California, which sheriff's deputies say ended in a ""scuffle."" ""We went to the house in Calabasas to talk directly with the kids and merely discuss arrangements for them to meet with their grandmother,"" Jermaine Jackson said. ""We were denied that access by security -- and it was clear that mutual suspicions had allowed events to spiral out of control."" Security camera video did not show security guards interfering with Jermaine, Randy and Janet as they entered the Calabasas property. The video shows Prince and Paris initially greeting the visitors, but it quickly became a confrontation, according to witnesses. T.J. Jackson, brothers inspired by famous uncle . ""Where is my grandmother? Where is my grandmother?"" Prince repeatedly asked Randy Jackson, according to a witness. As Prince retreated into the house, entering through the security office door, Randy Jackson followed with his cell phone raised, apparently recording video. The video then shows Janet Jackson apparently trying to take a cell phone away from Paris Jackson in the driveway. She scolded her niece for using her phone to write about family issues on Twitter, according to the three sources. Paris Jackson posted a Twitter message about the time the incident ended: ""gotta love fam."" She also tweeted: ""8 days and counting . something is really off , this isn't like her at all .. i wanna talk directly to my grandmother!!<|3"" Janet Jackson later challenged a TMZ account of the incident through a lawyer. The celebrity news website retracted its report. The lawyer's letter, obtained by CNN on Wednesday, said the TMZ report was ""highly damaging to Ms. Jackson's reputation and ha(s) caused her significant harm."" Read the letter from Janet Jackson's attorney . Jermaine, Randy, Janet and Rebbie have been banned from visited their mother's home for now, according to an e-mail written by estate lawyer Howard Wietzman. That restriction prompted his ""olive branch,"" Jermaine Jackson said. ""Yesterday, I had a phone call with my son Jaafar that broke my heart,"" he said. ""He asked: 'Is it true that we cannot visit grandmother's house as a family anymore?' Enough has become enough."" He suggested the family engage in a private ""collective dialogue"" to find peace. ""Mistakes have been made and irrational things have been said on both sides in a highly charged emotional environment,"" he said. ""It is time for us all to draw a line in the sand and move towards peace, cooperation, love and healing. I truly hope that we can find it in our hearts to do so.

"(CNN) -- A North Dakota newspaper is reviewing its policy against printing same-sex wedding announcements in response to a social media campaign that has drawn international scrutiny. It took less than 12 hours for the Fargo Forum to address the controversy Monday after the paper's ""celebrations editor"" e-mailed Allison Johnson, saying the paper would not publish her wedding announcement. Dianna Baumann also promised to refund the $25 publication fee. Johnson, 31, channeled her disappointment into social media, drawing support from as far as Europe and Australia and sparking a petition on Change.org. By Monday night, the Fargo Forum editor had posted a statement on the paper's Facebook page saying it was ""reviewing its policy about publishing same-sex announcements."" ""This is the second such request in recent months. We will communicate a decision once it's made,"" Forum Editor Matt Von Pinnon said. On Tuesday, Johnson and her fiancee, 27-year-old Kelsey Smith, met with the paper's editor and publisher and said they left feeling hopeful. Johnson and Smith met in Minneapolis six years ago and became a couple in 2008. The proposed wedding announcement described their plan to marry in New York on August 1, followed by a reception on August 4 in Fargo, where Smith was born and raised. After receiving the rejection e-mail, Johnson took a screen shot of it and shared it with friend and iReporter Gia Rassier, who posted it on Twitter, CNN iReport and Facebook. The image was shared more than 600 times and ""spread like wildfire,"" Rassier said. Johnson followed up with an open letter to the Fargo Forum and the mayor of Fargo and shared it on Facebook. ""It is a sad day when two people so in love, about to commit their lives to one another, cannot even engage in the smallest of privileges to honor this union,"" she wrote. ""I ask each of you reading this to explain to me WHY, in a city that we call home, where we are days away from becoming homeowners in Fargo, where we support every person that does good for their community, are we excluded from being able to announce our wedding celebration? What makes two women or two men any different from other taxpaying married citizens of Fargo, N.D.?"" Regardless of the outcome, they said they knew the paper's policy doesn't reflect Fargo's welcoming attitude toward the LGBT community. Besides, they said, the ensuing support has outweighed all the initial negativity. ""This is 10 times better than a little announcement in the local paper,"" said Smith.

"(CNN) -- A nationwide manhunt ended Friday when authorities found the body of a surgeon who had been sought in connection with the deadly shooting of a 33-year-old woman at an upstate New York hospital, police said. Investigators found Dr. Timothy V. Jorden dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in a wooded area near his home Friday, according to Buffalo Police Commissioner Daniel Derenda. Jorden, a surgeon who had worked at Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo since 2003, was linked to the death of hospital clerk and ex-girlfriend Jacqueline Wisniewski on Wednesday morning, police said. After piecing together evidence, including surveillance video from Jorden's home and the medical center, police believe that the doctor called Wisniewski Wednesday morning, lured her to a stairwell and shot her five times at close range, Derenda said. ""Had the doctor been alive, he would have been charged with murder today,"" he added. Shortly after the shooting, police said surveillance video showed Jorden emptying the shell casings from his gun in his office and proceeding to leave the medical center. He then returned home, where video showed him leaving through the back door to the woods where his body was found, Derenda said. Federal, state and local investigators had been searching for Jorden since the shooting Wednesday. Jorden and Wisniewski had broken up after dating for four years, Buffalo Police Chief Patrick Pascall told CNN. The surgeon graduated from the University of Buffalo School of Medicine in 1996, according to Joe Cirillo, a spokesman for Erie County Medical Center. After graduating, Jorden served two years of his residency at a military hospital in Tacoma, Washington, before going to Atlanta and then returning to Buffalo to finish his term.","Investigators found Dr. Timothy V.

"Washington (CNN) -- Makers of silicone breast implants have not followed up on thousands of women who received them as required by the Food and Drug Administration as a condition of approval, agency advisers said Wednesday. Mentor Worldwide and Allergan Incorporated received FDA approval for their silicone gel-filled breast implants in 2006 after agreeing to do large, 10-year post-market studies. But in a two-day meeting to update two FDA panels on the status of those trials, the companies admitted they had lost track of large numbers of women after implantation. Mentor's study enrolled more than 40,000 patients but after three years had a follow-up rate of only 21%. Allergan enrolled more than 39,300 women with a follow-up rate of 60% after two years. Christopher Allman, a spokesperson for Mentor, said since launching the post-approval studies, the company has stressed the importance of follow-up to both the women participating and their doctors. He says it remains a challenge. ""At Mentor's request, letters from FDA were sent to physicians and patients to encourage follow-up and state the importance of follow-up; unfortunately, there was minimal impact with respect to the follow-up rate,"" Allman said. ""We continue to encourage women to participate in these studies. ""Typically, it is not standard of care for breast implant patients to visit their plastic surgeon annually. Patients most likely to follow up with their physician are those who experience complications."" During an open public comment session, some patients and patient advocates told of the horrors they've encountered with silicone implants, in some cases imploring the manufacturers to make sure future studies are well-designed and protect women. Susan Dorsey from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, replaced her saline implants with silicone six years ago and enrolled in Allergan's study. She said her symptoms began within months. ""I had difficulty raising my arms over my head, I had flu-like symptoms, neck and shoulder pain that resulted in physical therapy three times a week,"" Dorsey said. ""Blurry vision, tingling, loss of appetite, insomnia, joint pain, anxiety, dizziness. Every day seemed to bring new symptoms."" Carolyn Wolfe of Virginia had her implants for 28 years and says she had multiple symptoms. Three years ago she was found to have connective tissue disease, chronic fatigue, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and irritable bowel syndrome. An MRI revealed 20 lesions on her brain and two collapsed implants with very little silicone left inside. She had them removed. ""Is the FDA willing to publicly state that silicone and platinum leaking into women's bodies year after year is safe?"" she asked panelists. In contrast, Nicole Noel told the panel she would again get silicone implants after the birth of her second child. ""After having two children I had lost all volume. I had no breast tissue. I have more self-confidence and am more proportional."" Dr. Susan Wood, with George Washington University's School of Public Health and Health Services, is a longtime champion of women's health. The former director of policy and program development at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office on Women's Affairs said that unfortunately, time and time again, safety data have come up short. ""For more than 20 years, FDA has been asking manufacturers to conduct and report rigorous studies on the safety and effectiveness of breast implants. This committee is now very aware of the limitations of the current post-approval studies. This leaves us in much the same place as in 2007, or indeed as in 1992,"" Wood said. ""FDA approved these products by two companies contingent on adequate post-approval studies. These studies do not seem to reach the bar."" Wood says real enforcement procedures need to be in place, including consideration of withdrawal of approval, requirements for sponsor-funded but independent research conducted for these studies, significant financial penalties, and major labeling or patient information changes. But Jeffrey Kenkel, professor and vice chairman of the Department of Plastic Surgery at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical School at Dallas and president of the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, says the implants are still safe and effective. He says there are a number of well-designed studies that document that claim. ""I think both ASAPS as well as the FDA are confident that breast implants are safe and effective. We're fortunate that we have a very high patient satisfaction rate -- above 90%. Ninety percent of breast implant patients are happy with their outcome and report an improved quality of life and body image."" Kenkel said the measures established five years ago by the FDA were very difficult because a study with 40,000 participants is very hard to track. ""Multi-investigators have a difficult time getting patients who are feeling well and back to their normal routine after surgery to come back in for their follow-up."" But Dorsey said she had a very different experience. ""I was forced out of the study when I decided to remove the silicone implants to save my life,"" she told the panel. ""All of my records were deleted -- as if I never existed."" Dr. Edward Melmed, a plastic surgeon from Dallas, told the panel the implants were an ""industrial toxin."" ""The symptoms, they are real,"" he said. ""I answer five to seven e-mails a night from women all over the world asking. 'What do I do about these symptoms?' "" Melmed said that by 10 years after patients get them, 50% of silicone implants rupture; 72% by 15 years; and 94% rupture by 20 years. ""Why is the FDA continuing to allow a device to be placed in young women that is guaranteed to fail 80% in 10 years? Would they allow that in hip replacements? Would they allow it in men?"" According to ASAPS, more then 318,000 breast augmentations were done in 2010 -- more than any other surgical procedure. Sixty-two percent of those were silicone implants. Both Mentor and Allergan's implants come with a warranty that offers free replacement in case of rupture or deflation. It offers surgical cost assistance for replacement surgery. Another hotly debated topic was MRI screening. Product labeling calls for patients to get an MRI three years after implantation and then every two years after. MRI picks up about 90% of ruptures, but the procedure is costly and some experts expressed concern over false positive readings. But the FDA says the MRI is the gold standard for detecting silent rupture. The agency says it will continue to look into its clinical value. Looking to the future, the agency said it will see the current studies completed, make sure follow-up rates improve and will look into the creation of a breast implant registry -- possibly on an international scale. Mentor recommended a number of ways to get robust data on long-term safety, including enhanced post-market surveillance, and reviewing published literature and existing external databases like TOPS -- a physician website managed by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. ""We believe these sources may provide the data FDA requires on potential medical conditions in women with breast implants and would most likely capture any early 'safety signals,' "" Allman said. ""This therefore reduces the need for another large epidemiological study. If any new safety signals are identified, we would work with the FDA to define a targeted study design."" FDA spokeswoman Erica Jefferson said the agency has a lot to consider. ""The past two days have provided some very compelling information for the FDA. We took away several meaningful recommendations during the meeting."" Jefferson said the FDA's next step will be to review the recommendations and outline the suggestions they think should be implemented. They plan to engage stakeholders including sponsors, professional groups, patients, consumer groups and academia before making any decisions.","Mentor, Allergan admit they've lost track of many patients .

"(CNN) -- In a few weeks, South Sudan will turn a year old. It ought to have been a joyous occasion. Instead, the world's newest nation is coping with a massive humanitarian crisis wrought by fighting between the armed forces of its nemesis to the north and an affiliate rebel movement. The fighting is hardly new. For decades before South Sudan's independence in July, civil war raged over territory, oil and religion. Now, aid groups warn that another nightmare looms as millions of people are on the move, desperate to flee fighting and find a safer place to live. The United Nations refugee agency said this week that the situation had sharply deteriorated in South Sudan's Upper Nile state, flooded with refugees crossing the border from Sudan. About 150,000 refugees from Sudan are currently in South Sudan. That presents an enormous logistical challenge for aid agencies. ""This is a dramatic change in an already difficult humanitarian situation,"" said Antonio Guterres, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees. ""Not only are refugee numbers suddenly much higher, but the condition that many of these people are in is shockingly bad,"" he said. ""Some have been eating tree leaves to survive along the way."" In a statement issued Wednesday, the United States expressed its concerns over the dire situation in South Sudan. Deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner urged international partners to join the efforts ""to relieve suffering and assist those affected by the ongoing violence."" The United States government said it ""has stepped up to help prevent further suffering"" by providing more than $34 million to support the emergency response to new Sudanese refugees in the region The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has appealed for $145 million to help resolve and prevent a humanitarian crisis in the region. Enough Project, which works to stop genocide and crimes against humanity and has been monitoring the situation along the Sudanese border, blamed Khartoum for targeting civilians. ""The refugees are pouring into South Sudan because the government of neighboring Sudan is using starvation as a weapon in its South Kordofan and Blue Nile regions,"" said John Prendergast, co-founder of Enough Project. In temporary refugee camps, people are living in wretched conditions, say international charities working in the area, . Jean-Marc Jacobs, head of the Medecins Sans Frontieres mission in South Sudan, described the transit camp of Rim as a remote and inhospitable place where people are seeking shelter under the shade of trees. ""People have walked for several days with no food and no water,"" he said. The agency has been running a substantial emergency medical operation for the refugees in Upper Nile State. This week, Medecins Sans Frontieres called on the United Nations to identify a suitable place for more than 30,000 refugees who have crossed the border from Sudan's Blue Nile State into South Sudan's Upper Nile State over the past two weeks. Many are hungry and face other dire problems like not having access to clean water and proper sanitation. But it's not just refugees who are suffering. ""The ones who are strong enough to make the long trek to the border do so; the ones left behind face a bleak future,"" Prendergast said. Another monitoring group, Amnesty International, visited eight refugee camps between March and April and found people in some instances waiting 10 hours to receive a single container of water or three weeks for food rations. Amnesty International also documented human rights abuses. People ""faced risks such as forced recruitment into armed groups and sexual violence, in addition to food and water shortages,"" the group said. Women and girls spoke of their fear of rape and sexual violence. In refugee camps in Upper Nile State, Amnesty received reports of ""boys and young men being forcefully recruited into the armed opposition group, the Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement-North."" ""We can run away from bombs but not from hunger,"" one refugee told Amnesty International. Amnesty urged the United Nations to accelerate efforts to feed people and to make sure protective measures are in place for the vulnerable. Despite the bleak reality in South Sudan, many of its people are eager to return home. This week, the International Organization for Migration relocated more than 6,000 South Sudanese from Khartoum to Juba. The operation between the two capitals took more than 11 days and about 40 flights. The majority of the returnees were previously stranded in Kosti, 300 kilometers (186 miles) south of Khartoum. It's not even 1 year old, and South Sudan is facing myriad problems, Prendergast said, . ""The cutoff of oil production, state corruption and a state of near-war with Sudan have created massive hardships among the civilian population in South Sudan,"" he said. He said it was imperative for the United Nations Security Council to make good on its threat to impose sanctions -- on Sudan and on South Sudan -- if they continue to impede progress toward a lasting peace deal and an end to the fighting. The challenges are many. Still, South Sudanese are optimistic about their return. ""I left South Sudan in 1951, when I was just a boy,"" Amol Jok Ajak Deng told the International Organization for Migration. ""I return as an old man, but I am strong, and I am willing to work.""

"London (CNN) -- Wednesday saw scandal at the Olympics as eight athletes were disqualified for trying not to win matches, joy as the U.S. continued its dominance in swimming and controversy as the chairman of the Games organizing committee declined to call Michael Phelps the greatest Olympian of all time. The disqualifications came in badminton, after two matches Tuesday night in which female athletes were accused of playing to lose so they could face easier opponents in future matches. A Chinese pair, two South Korean pairs and an Indonesian pair played so badly that they were booed by the crowd. The Chinese pair of Wang Xiaoli and Yu Yang is the world's No. 1 women's duo. The Badminton World Federation disqualified all four pairs, but the South Koreans and Indonesians are appealing. The Chinese Olympic delegation said that it ""fully respects"" the decision to punish its two players and that it would carry out its own investigation. ""The actions of Yu Yang and Wang Xiaoli on the court have violated Olympic principles and the spirit of fair athletic competition,"" it said in a statement. ""The Chinese Sports Delegation feels saddened. We resolutely oppose and severely criticize such actions. The Chinese Olympic Committee has always been against anyone or any team that violates sports spirit and ethics in any form."" The joy of obscure Olympic sports . There was more joy for the United States in swimming as Nathan Adrian shocked the 100-meter freestyle field, beating world record holder James Magnussen for gold by .01 second. ""I kinda touched well and 'Oh, sweet, I've won,' "" he said. ""Then there's 10 to 15 seconds. Holy crap, this is the Olympics. I've been watching this since I was a kid."" The Americans added yet another gold -- their eighth in swimming -- when the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay team rallied to beat Australia. ""I knew it was close, I saw it was neck-and-neck all race,"" anchor Allison Schmitt said, ""and I just wanted to swim my own race like in the 200 meters last night. I just wanted to feed off that energy and bring home the gold."" Few cheaters caught, doping chief says . There were two world bests at the London Aquatics Centre. Hungarian Daniel Gyurta swam the 200-meter breaststroke in 2:07.28 to win gold, and Rebecca Soni of the U.S. clocked 2:20.00 in the women's 200-meter breaststroke qualifying. For the host nation, it was a golden day. Cyclist Bradley Wiggins, fresh off a win at the Tour de France, won gold in the men's time trial, and countryman Chris Froome captured bronze. The victory makes Wiggins, a former track cyclist, the most decorated British Olympian, with seven medals. When asked by a BBC presenter to turn around and show his fans the gold medal, which made the big crowd roar, Wiggins joked, ""I know how the Beatles felt now."" An American Armstrong won the women's race. Kristin, no relation to Lance, defended her Beijing Games title. After the race, she retired -- again. ""Today, my focus was 'this is it,' "" she said. ""I have to live with this result, and whatever I do today, I have to look back on. No matter what athlete you are, you're only as good as your last performance."" Earlier in the day, rowers Helen Glover and Heather Stanning brought Great Britain its first gold medal of the 2012 Games. In the men's artistic gymnastics individual all-around final, Japan's Kohei Uchimura took the gold with an outstanding performance, while Team USA's Danell Leyva rallied to take bronze. ""To win an Olympic medal is a dream come true,"" Leyva said. Swimmer Michael Phelps became not only the most decorated American on Tuesday but the most decorated Olympian of all time. Many, including CNN partner Sports Illustrated, hailed Phelps on Wednesday as ""Simply the Greatest."" But Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London Olympic Games Organizing Committee, distinguished between ""most medals"" and ""greatest."" ""You can say by medal tally, he is the most successful, but I'm not sure if he's the greatest. But he's the most successful athlete; that goes without saying,"" said Coe, himself a multiple-gold-winning Olympic runner. At the same time, Coe paid tribute to the crowds who have flocked to watch the events, saying they have created an ""extraordinary atmosphere."" ""I have now visited 16 sports, and I have been absolutely blown away by the noise, the vibrancy, just the humor and excitement there,"" he said, adding that Olympic Park was ""buzzing."" Paul Deighton, chief executive of London 2012, said 3 million spectators had poured into Olympic venues over the past five days. 2012 Olympics: Live blog .

"London (CNN) -- The widow of an Israeli Olympian killed in a terrorist attack on the 1972 Munich Games made an urgent plea Wednesday for a minute of silence at the opening ceremony to remember her husband and 10 other Israelis murdered 40 years ago. Ankie Spitzer was joined by three members of Congress and top American Jewish community leaders in the effort to make the International Olympic Committee change its stance. The head of the International Olympics Committee has rejected repeated calls for a moment of silence during the opening ceremony, despite the urging of President Barack Obama, his Republican rival Mitt Romney, and other public figures. ""We feel that the Opening Ceremony is an atmosphere that is not fit to remember such a tragic incident,"" Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee, said Saturday. He reportedly participated in a small ceremony in the Olympic Village on Tuesday, but William Daroff of the Jewish Federations of North America said Wednesday that was not good enough. ""There is a need for a larger moment that the world can participate in,"" he said. More than 106,000 people have signed an online petition calling for a moment of silence in memory of the 11 Israeli athletes and coaches killed by Palestinian militants at the games in Munich, Germany, 40 years ago. A German policeman and five of the attackers also died. Rep. Eliot Engel, a New York Democrat, Wednesday accused the IOC of ""playing political games."" ""For those of the IOC who say that this (moment of silence) is political, I would say just the opposite: If this were any nation other than Israel, there would have been a moment of silence long ago,"" he argued. The 1972 attack ""disrupted the sanctity of these Games, which are not supposed to be political,"" he said, calling a minute of silence ""a matter of decency."" Engel, Rep. Nita Lowey of New York and Rep. Ted Deutch of Florida, all Democrats, have written a joint letter to the IOC urging it to allow the minute of silence on Friday. Read more: Obama says yes to Olympic tribute . Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon has also been a vocal proponent, campaigning on Facebook and Twitter for ""Just One Minute"" of silence. The refusal of the IOC to back the plan ""told us as Israelis that this tragedy is yours alone and not a tragedy within the family of nations,"" Ayalon said in May. Spitzer, whose husband, Andrei, was among those killed, was the first to sign the petition. ""They came to Munich in 1972 to play as athletes in the Olympics; they came in peace and went home in coffins,"" she writes in the online plea. She says she has ""no political or religious agenda. Just the hope that my husband and the other men who went to the Olympics in peace, friendship and sportsmanship are given what they deserve. One minute of silence will clearly say to the world that what happened in 1972 can never happen again."" Rogge said Saturday that the IOC would ""be present"" at the September 5 ceremony honoring the dead at the site where they were killed in Germany. ""We are going to pay a homage to the athletes, of course, as we always have done in the past and will do in the future,"" he said. The attack began in the early hours of September 5, 1972, when eight Palestinian terrorists disguised in track suits broke into the Olympic Village in Munich. Read more: Can we feel safe in a crowd anymore? They stormed the apartments housing Israeli athletes and coaches, killing two and taking nine others hostage. Hours later, the world woke up to the image of a masked man on the balcony of the Olympic Village. From the Olympic Village, the militants demanded the release of 200 Arab inmates from Israeli prisons or they would start killing the athletes in Munich, one every hour. Israel refused to negotiate, and the terrorists demanded an airplane to Egypt. The German government then attempted a rescue at the airport. When it was over, all the Israelis, five terrorists and one German police officer lay dead. The Munich Games were temporarily suspended, and a memorial service attended by some 80,000 people was held at the Olympic Stadium. Opinion: Olympics, mark dark day in Munich . CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Tour de France champion Bradley Wiggins doubled Britain's gold medal tally, just hours after the host nation won its first event at the London Olympics on Wednesday. With his seventh Olympic medal, four of them gold, Wiggins is now the most decorated British Olympian, while the morning's medal ensured Heather Stanning and Helen Glover became the first British female rowers to win an Olympic title. Wiggins had been the favorite for gold after winning both time trial stages en route to becoming Britain's first Tour de France Champion last month this year, and his dominance was clear to see as he finished eight seconds ahead of the Germany's 2011 world champion Tony Martin. Wiggins' teammate Chris Froome claimed the bronze, as former Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara ended a disappointing seventh. The Swiss rider injured his shoulder in Saturday's road race and was clearly in pain when he crossed finish line. American Taylor Phinney finished fourth, nine seconds off a podium place. Earlier, 27-year-old Stanning and Glover, 26, established an imperious lead from the start in the coxless pair's. -- stretching it to as much as two lengths at one point -- as they opened Britain's gold medal account. Australia's Kate Hornsey and Sarah Tait claimed silver, with Juliette Haigh and Rebecca Scown of New Zealand a mere 0.33 seconds behind in third. Tens of thousands of British fans -- eager for a first victory for the Olympic hosts -- had lined the banks of Eton Dorney to witness the Britons finish in 7:27.13, three seconds ahead of Australia. Moments later Britain were on the podium again, as the men's eights put in a battling performance in the to claim bronze, behind a resurgent Canada in second and a dominant German team in first. Britain's cycling and rowing medal successes helped GB move up in the medal table from 21st to 10th, with hopes high that there could be more medals for the hosts at the Aquatics Center in Wednesday's evening session.","Team GB win their first gold medals on day five of the Olympics .

"(CNN) -- James Sallis may be the best crime writer you've never heard of. In an award-winning career spanning some forty years, he's written more than two dozen volumes of fiction, poetry, essays, criticism and biography inspiring a small but cult-like following of readers. Now his fan base is about to get a big boost. His newest novel, ""The Killer is Dying"" is drawing praise from critics all over the world, while his 2005 noir classic, ""Drive"" arrives on the big screen this week. ""Drive"" features an all-star cast, including Hollywood hunk Ryan Gosling in the starring role as Sallis describes, ""a guy who does stunt driving for movies by day and drives for criminals at night."" Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn won best director at the Cannes film festival for ""Drive"" earlier this year. Sallis also has a new novel out, ""The Killer is Dying."" It's the story of three strangers who unwittingly cross paths in the sun-scorched sprawl of Phoenix. There's Christian, a dying hit man on his final job, Sayles, the detective trying to catch him, and Jimmie a teenager abandoned by his parents, who is somehow seeing Christian's dreams. It's Sallis at his existential best; minimalist noir with a cinematic feel. It's pulp fiction for the 21st century. Not just a writer, Sallis is also a poet, professor and musician. CNN recently caught up with him to talk about his new novel. Sallis, a man of letters but few words, gave us some insight into his work. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: ""The Killer is Dying"" is not your typical crime novel, how would you describe it? Sallis: As a novel about three isolated people living in a huge makeshift city in the middle of forbidding desert, three people who in the course of the novel find community of a sort. CNN: Tell me more about your three main characters, Christian, Sayles & Jimmie. Sallis: Christian is a hired killer dying of an unspecified terminal disease. He goes to fulfill his final contract but is beaten to the punch, and sees his mark taken down by someone else. With no knowledge at all of Christian, Sayles is the detective investigating that attack. He is cut off from others and from his own emotions, with only his job to hold him in place; his wife is dying of cancer. Jimmie is a teenager abandoned by both parents and living by his wits, buying and selling on eBay to get by, expecting any day to get caught and taken away. Then suddenly, in the third chapter, Jimmie is having the killer's, Christian's, dreams. CNN: Phoenix really comes alive in your book, what is it about the city that interests you as a writer? Sallis: It's the nation's fifth largest city, a triumph of will and engineering over common sense, surrounded by miles of what looks at first to be almost nothing. Sprawling, various, indefinable, ungraspable. If ever there was a melting pot, this is one. Kinda south, kinda west, kinda old, kinda ageless, kinda middle America, kinda Hispanic.... CNN: You're something of a renaissance man, beyond your crime novels, you're also a poet, a translator, a biographer, a musician and a teacher. How do these various disciplines influence your work overall? Sallis: Take any one of those away, the work would be quite different. I would be quite different. CNN: Did you always want to be a writer? Sallis: I think I knew pretty early that that's where I was headed. Like the automobile wreck in JB: ""Saw it start to, saw it had to, saw it happen."" Or as someone once described noir fiction: ""force of circumstances driving protagonists to the commission of dreadful acts."" CNN: One of your most popular novels, ""Drive,"" is out now as a Hollywood movie. How involved were you in the adaptation and what do you think of the movie? Sallis: I had no involvement beyond providing the novel -- the buzzer in the chair that got everyone up and moving. It's an astonishingly fine movie, one that will be talked about and referenced, I suspect, for many years. Nic Refn's direction, Ryan's acting, Albert Brooks' bad guy - all tremendous. Brilliant. Read more about the movie and see a trailer for ""Drive."" CNN: What have you read recently that really made an impression on you? Sallis: Mostly rereads: a collection of Barry Hannah's stories, ""Long, Last, Happy."" Danny Woodrell's ""The Bayou Trilogy."" Also ""The Collected Stories of Carol Emshwiller."" CNN: What's next for you? Sallis: I'm a hundred-plus pages into a novel about Driver seven years further along, when the mob shows up, apparently to kill him. After that, back to reworking the draft of ""Others of My Kind,"" about a woman abducted as a child and kept in a box under her abductor's bed, and who is now one of the world's good people. A brief portion of this appeared in my friend Patrick Millikin's anthology Phoenix Noir. Oh -- and a lot of playing festivals and coffee houses with my band, Three-Legged Dog.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A wheelchair-bound Israeli veteran died Wednesday, days after setting himself on fire in a protest over his economic situation, a spokeswoman for Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv said. Akiva Mafa'i, who was badly injured two decades ago during his service in the Israel Defense Forces, had set himself alight Sunday. The 45-year-old poured gasoline over his body and ignited it at a bus station in the town of Yehud. Passersby extinguished the flames with bottles of water and a fire extinguisher but he was left with 70% burns. The veteran had spent four months in a coma at the Beer Sheva Medical Center after he was injured at age 23, according to local media reports. He was to be married a month after he was hurt but the marriage was canceled. Mafa'i is the second person to die in a self-immolation in Israel in less than a week. Moshe Silman, a bed-ridden member of a movement to lower the cost of living in Israel, set himself alight during a demonstration in Tel Aviv on July 14. He died two weeks later. Teenage monk self-immolates in China . According to local media reports, he left a note accusing the conservative Netanyahu government of ""taking from the poor and giving to the rich."" Israeli media have reported other suicide attempts apparently motivated by economic hardship. The social protest movement has been gaining ground since large demonstrations were held in cities last summer, led by members of Israel's middle class, over soaring costs of living. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the self-immolations as tragic. Such incidents are unusual in Israel. A self-immolation in Tunisia in December 2010 by Mohamed Bouazizi, a young street vendor, was the spark that ignited the protests and revolutionary fervor of the Arab Spring. The desperate measure is a more common form of protest in some Asian nations, in particular for Tibetans who want autonomy from China. Some 44 Tibetans, many of them monks, have self-immolated since 2009, according to the Central Tibetan Administration, which functions as the government of Tibetans outside the Chinese territory. Opinion: Why the Dalai Lama cannot condemn Tibetan self-immolations . Chinese official interference with Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and nunneries contributed to at least a dozen self-immolations in 2011, according to the U.S. State Department's International Religious Freedom report. In Europe, where self-immolation is also a rare form of protest, a 55-year-old Greek businessman set himself alight last September, overwhelmed by despair and anger over the debt crisis engulfing himself and his country. Apostolos Polyzonis, who survived after being rescued by police and spending days in intensive care, told CNN in April: ""At that moment, I saw my life as worthless. I really didn't care if I was going to live or die."" My Take: Dalai Lama should condemn self-immolations .","Akiva Mafa'i was injured during his military service as a young man .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Call it a crisis of faith. A co-worker and I walked into the office break room Wednesday, national Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day, to find a dozen or so foil-wrapped sandwiches beckoning us from the counter. This being Atlanta, home of Chick-fil-A, we recognized them immediately, and a closer look at the puck-sized packages bearing the iconic scribbled red logo confirmed our suspicions -- and deepened our paranoia. ""Is this a trick?"" my co-worker asked as he stood frozen in front of the counter. ""Will someone judge me if they see me eating one?"" We had no idea where they had come from and still don't, but our break room is often the dumping ground of leftovers from business meetings where food is served. I also froze in silence because I knew that the answer was yes, some would judge him, at least for the time being, while the company's stance on same-sex marriage is in the spotlight, sparking impassioned op-eds and fiery debate on cable news networks and Facebook Walls across the country. Supporters on both sides of the debate have staged demonstrations, starting with Wednesday's appreciation day and Friday's same-sex ""kiss day"" at Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country. Are you going to ""kiss day"" at Chick-fil-A? Share your story with CNN iReport . Ever since Truett Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A Restaurant at a mall in suburban Atlanta in 1967, the company has made no secret of its dedication to Christian values. Its corporate purpose is to ""glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us"" and ""to have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A."" All of its locations are closed on Sunday. Chick-fil-A controversy shines light on company's charitable giving . Within this context, many Americans -- including residents of Atlanta, the ninth ""gayest"" American city in 2012, according The Advocate magazine -- have chosen either to enjoy Chick-fil-A's sandwich variations or to not patronize the restaurant because of its values. Or, you might be like one of my gay friends, who would ask others to stand in line for his Chick-fil-A lunch, lest his boyfriend find out. But for many, COO Dan Cathy's recent comment that he supports the ""biblical definition of the family unit"" has forced their hands, compelling them to publicly choose a side and politicize their eating habits. Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day was proposed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in an effort to show support for the company's viewpoint. Those who chose to support Chick-fil-A on Wednesday led to record-breaking sales, the company said, though it did not provide specific sales numbers. ""Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day was not a company promotion; it was initiated by others,"" said Steve Robinson, executive vice president for marketing, in a statement Thursday. ""The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect, regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender."" Time will tell whether Chick-fil-A suffers any actual fallout from the controversy or if it's just another ""media-driven controversy,"" as some have suggested. After all, Ben & Jerry's is still going strong despite coming out in support of same-sex marriage with flavors like Apple-y Ever After and Chubby Hubby. Californians still swear by In-N-Out Burger regardless of whether their burger comes with a large drink and a citation from a Bible passage. In the meantime, both sides have fanned the flames with high-profile demonstrations and heated rhetoric. Others are left somewhere in the middle, still craving an original chicken sandwich but reluctant to subject themselves to the scrutiny of friends and colleagues, like my co-worker. Heather Roberts of Sugar Land, Texas, made a point of patronizing at Chick-fil-A on Wednesday while visiting Atlanta for a conference. ""We wanted to eat here today, especially to show support not just for Christian values but for his right to express his beliefs,"" Roberts said shortly after finishing a chicken sandwich and waffle fries from a Chick-fil-A stand in the CNN Center food court. She said she shared Cathy's position on same-sex marriage, acknowledging that if the controversy centered around his support for it, she wouldn't have participated in appreciation day. Normally, though, she eats at her local Chick-fil-A at least once a week because she appreciates the food and the customer service -- not because of its Christian values. ""I'm allowed to eat where I want,"" she said. ""We need to be appreciative that we live in a country where we can say what we want and eat where we want."" Even some people who oppose Cathy's views didn't feel the need to boycott the restaurant, especially if those views don't lead to discrimination against customers or employees. ""I don't agree with the owners' beliefs, but they publicly state that they will serve all who enter the door,"" CNN commenter Doug Barger said. ""I believe in religious freedom,"" the Greenwood, Ohio, resident wrote in an e-mail. ""Because the owner's personal opinions differ from mine points to a healthy society."" For many, Cathy's views are secondary to his right express them, even among members of the LGBT community. ""Mr. Cathy has been unfairly attacked for his statement that he doesn't support same-sex marriage,"" said Matt Zieminski, a 20-year-old iReporter from California. ""As a gay man, I say, let him not support gays. When the gay community and gay activist groups push on anti-gay people and organizations to change their minds and opinions via bullying or forced involvement, I fear it would make whatever accomplishments taste cheap like a greasy coin. Ultimately, the acceptance of the gay community and the right of gays to marry will not be achieved through violent means, physical and verbal, but through peaceful and honest negotiations."" How the Chick-fil-A same-sex marriage controversy has evolved . Predictably, Cathy's stance on same-sex marriage kept others away Wednesday. ""I think the (COO) has made eating at Chick-fil-A a political statement. I wouldn't (have) had a problem eating there before, but now that the restaurant has turned into a campaign to bash the rights of the LGBT community, I realize I can put my money somewhere else,"" CNN commenter Wade Pierson said. ""As a born-again gay Christian, it saddens me to see Christians feeding into politics. Politics just divides people and stirs up a lot of anger."" As counterprotests in the form of ""kiss-ins"" take shape Friday, some would just as soon stay away from Chick-fil-A this week to avoid making the act of eating chicken political. ""Both sides have very good points, but both sides are also wrong, and they're both making this into something far bigger than it needs to be,"" said an Atlanta-based CNN commenter who preferred not to be named. ""Both sides just quite honestly need to grow up and stop acting like 2-year-olds just because somebody said something they didn't like."" The Atlanta resident says she does not plan to boycott the chain altogether because she agrees with both sides. And she likes the food. Plus, if you start boycotting Chick-fil-A because you disagree with the COO's views, how far will you take your principles? ""I'm very impressed with people that try to avoid right-wing companies from profiting off of them. Trying to avoid Koch products would be really hard. I mean, they even make asphalt!"" a friend said in response to my Facebook question, ""are you conflicted over buying Chick-fil-A?"" ""It's not a political issue for me. I think it's more of a way for people to define themselves in front of their friends,"" she said. ""It reminds me a lot of KONY, people getting riled up over something as a way to define themselves.""

"(CNN) -- Don't worry if you did not hear the news about Paraguay impeaching its president. After all, it happened so fast that even Paraguay's neighbors are figuring out how to react. Paraguay, the small South American nation known as an ""island surrounded by land,"" often goes unnoticed outside of South America. But there is an absorbing story behind the impeachment of Fernando Lugo that has turned into a regional crisis that is still unfolding. The impeachment procedures appear to have been carried out in accordance with the Paraguayan Constitution, but some Latin American presidents are calling it a coup d'etat and refuse to recognize the new president, Federico Franco. Paraguay swears in new leader after impeachment . Lugo went from president to disgraced leader in less than 48 hours. In the United States, nearly three months passed in 1998 between the time lawmakers announced they were considering impeaching Bill Clinton and the actual vote. In Lugo's case, it took one day. Clinton's lawyers spent 30 hours over two days on his defense, not counting witnesses they called. Before the Paraguayan Senate, Lugo's defense team had two hours. The biggest difference: Clinton survived, Lugo was swept out. Eight days ago, there was no reason to believe that Lugo would find himself out of a job before his term ended in August 2013. He was an unpopular president among lawmakers, and many had concerns about his credibility as a leader after the former Catholic bishop admitted to having fathered at least two children. In all, four women claim they had babies by Lugo while he was bishop. There had been calls in the past for his impeachment, but the scandals did not rock his position too much. That changed on June 15, when police and landless peasants clashed in eastern Paraguay, resulting in 17 deaths. Peasants fired on police who were trying to evict them from private property, initiating the deadly confrontation, local authorities and state-run media said. The violence occurred in Curuguaty, a remote community about 240 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of the Paraguayan capital, Asuncion, near the Brazilian border. In response to the incident, Lugo replaced his national police chief and interior minister. The country's liberal party, which backed Lugo, were incensed to learn that the new minister was from another party. As the outcry over the deadly clash continued, the liberal party announced Thursday that it was withdrawing its support of Lugo, and an impeachment vote was heard in the lower chamber of congress that day. The vote in favor of impeachment was 76-1. The next day, Lugo's defense team had two hours to defend Lugo from what it call vague charges of incompetence. The Senate impeached the president in a 39-4 vote. That was it. ""Paraguayan history (and) its democracy that has been deeply wounded,"" Lugo said after accepting his fate. But the swiftness of the action has led to condemnation, or at least criticism from other Latin American countries. ""If indeed it is recognized that the impeachment process happened according to the procedure established in the Paraguayan Constitution, Mexico considers that the process did not offer President Lugo the space and time for a proper defense,"" Mexico's foreign ministry said. The presidents of Venezuela, Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic said they will not recognize Franco's administration, and Argentina on Saturday withdrew its ambassador to Paraguay. Bolivia ""will not recognize a government that does not rise from the ballot box and the will of the people,"" Bolivian President Evo Morales said. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said, ""I have no doubt that President Fernando Lugo was not given a right to his defense, it happened from one day to the next, and the sentence was decided before the trial."" As of Friday night, not a single international leader had called him to congratulate him on his being sworn in as president, Franco told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. ""Of course it worries me. I am aware that I am assuming the presidency in an unfavorable condition,"" he said. Franco reiterated that the impeachment happened within the parameters of the constitution, and pointed to the large margins by which Lugo was voted out of office. ""It means that here we have a unanimous position. The Paraguayan people, I think, are satisfied with this decision,"" he said. Despite the cold shoulder from neighboring countries, Franco said he will reach out and explain the legality of Lugo's ouster and seeks to have good international relations. His goal is for Paraguay to be recognized internationally by the time he hands the government over to the next president next year, he said. ""I have the duty and the responsibility to initiate a process that the next government can continue,"" he said, especially when it comes to important domestic issues such as security and family agriculture. Most of the countries opposed to Franco's presidency belong to the Union of South American Nations, known as UNASUR. The foreign ministers of that regional body were in Paraguay to study the issue. The UNASUR ministers ""have an attitude of respect for the sovereignty of Paraguay, but also an attitude of respect for democracy,"" Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said. Brazil is one of Paraguay's most important neighbors, and Rousseff declined to give a strong position one way or another over the recent events. ""From this situation I am sure there will be a consequence,"" is all she said. In a news conference Saturday, Franco said he hopes relations with Brazil will remain ""harmonious,"" according to Brazil's state-run Agencia Brasil news agency. The United States also weighed in a more neutral manner. ""We urge all Paraguayans to act peacefully, with calm and responsibility, in the spirit of Paraguay's democratic principles,"" State Department spokeswoman Darla Jordan said. CNN's Fernando del Rincon contributed to this report.","NEW: Argentina withdraws its ambassador to Paraguay .

"(CNN) -- It is the question that has followed Usain Bolt for the past four years, the answer to which will not truly be known until the final for the men's 100 meters sprint in London has been done and dusted. Just how fast could he have run on that night in Beijing? It seems a crazy thing to ask. After all, the Jamaican smashed the world record with a time of 9.69 seconds, winning gold and saving the Olympics' marquee sport from itself after successive drug scandals. And he has run faster since, setting a new record a year later at the World Championships with a time of 9.58 seconds. More: Artist turns Usain Bolt into street hero . But Beijing was much more than a world record. It was the manner of his victory that catapulted him into the kind of international fame not seen in track and field since the U.S. Olympic legend Carl Lewis. Not only did he blow the rest of the field away, he cantered across the line with 20 meters to go, chest turned to the cameras, arms wide open. A new hero . Other athletes past and present, not to mention the International Olympic Committee president, derided his showmanship. But the public had made their mind up. They had a new hero. ""My one aim was just to be a champion. That is what I came here to do,"" Bolt, then 21, said after the race. ""I told you I was going to be number one and I did just that ... It was crazy, phenomenal."" Ever since he has rightly been heralded as the greatest sprinter of all time. But the celebration and the criticism left that one question hanging in the air. Just how fast could he have run? The press, coaches and fellow athletes all speculated. The trainer credited with Bolt's rise, Glen Mills, suggested that he could have run under 9.6 seconds. Academia even got involved. The University of Oslo's Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics, which deemed the issue of such importance that it dedicated some of the finest minds on the planet to the quandary, predicted that he would have run 9.55 seconds. Now all the talk is of this Sunday's 100m final at London 2012. Is 9.4 possible? Bolt could become the first sprinter since Carl Lewis to defend an Olympic 100m title. But no one is talking about 9.69, 9.58 or 9.55. Now Bolt is looking at breaking the record again and seeing if the human body can be pushed further, through the 9.4 second barrier. ""Everyone has been talking about 9.4 all season,"" Bolt explained in an interview with CNN in July, when asked whether he could run that time at London 2012. ""If it's possible I am the one."" One study by Dutch mathematicians at Tilburg University concluded that, theoretically, Bolt's dream could be realized. ""According to our results this is achievable,"" the co-author of the report Sander Smeets said in an interview with AFP. ""The absolute limit for a world record at the moment is 9.36 seconds,"" he added. The theory, along with Bolt's rhetoric, sounds fine. But the reality is that Bolt comes into the Olympics having struggled with injuries this season and seen a genuine threat to his title emerge in the shape of training partner Yohan Blake. ""He [Bolt] has had some problems this year,"" 200m Olympic champion Michael Johnson told CNN's Piers Morgan this month. ""But he can still run two tenths (of a second) quicker than anyone else... he doesn't need to be 100 per cent."" Winning would be enough of an achievement, one that would bookend and incredible four years since his record run in Beijing. That run transformed Usain Bolt's life. He is now mobbed wherever he goes, adorns billboards from Tokyo to Mexico City and has written his first autobiography. As former Olympic gold medalist Linford Christie remarked during a recent interview with Bolt for CNN, the Jamaican is the most famous athlete, not just in the world, but of all time. Where it began . Bolt's journey began, like many other world record sprinters, in the Jamaican district of Trelawny where other greats such as current Olympic women's 200m champion Veronica Campbell-Brown also have roots. Although he was Canadian, Ben Johnson was also born here. It is an area famed for breeding sprint stars thanks largely to a fiercely contested four-day race championships where crowds of up to 30,000 fill the national stadium in Kingston. Over a million people watch the young sprint hopefuls live on TV for what is often the springboard towards the Olympics. ""I feel we push our young athletes,"" Bolt told CNN when asked why Jamaica produces so much sprinting talent earlier this year. ""There is this thing called the Boys and Girls Championships in Jamaica, which showcases the talent. The level of competition is really high because it pushes you every day to be the best in your event, in your class."" Bolt came on to the sprint world's radar at the 2003 Boys and Girls Championship when, at just 16, he posted times in the 200 and 400m good enough for the Olympic finals in Sydney three years earlier. Going pro . He went pro a year later but his failure in the 200m at the Athens Olympics helped him to recalibrate his life and focus on his training. Coach Mills eventually allowed Bolt to run the 100m too, a discipline seen as too difficult for a man the size of Bolt (he is six foot three inches tall) to excel in. It was a path that would take him to his coronation in Beijing, where he also won gold in the 200m and 4x100m relay in world record times. Yet four years on and the task of becoming only the second man -- after Lewis -- to retain the 100m Olympic title has become far harder than many people thought it would be. Many expected Bolt to dominate the games for years to come. But the emergence of his compatriot Blake -- who beat Bolt in both the 100 and 200m at the Jamaican Olympic trials this year -- has added the one ingredient needed in any classic final: a genuine rival that could prevent him from equaling Lewis's record. ""We're training partners so we're really close,"" Bolt says of Blake, who won the 2011 world 100m title after his compatriot's false start in the final. ""We laugh even when we're warming up. We're cool but as soon we're getting on the track line up it's a different story."" In 1988 Lewis had his own fierce rival from Trelawny: Johnson. Lewis famously came second in the Seoul final and only became the first man to win back-to-back Olympic 100m titles by default after Johnson failed a drugs test. Lewis was handed the medal in his hotel. A rival to Lewis . Lewis is sceptical that Bolt could match his achievement. ""Carl Lewis is totally preoccupied by Bolt and sees him not as a successor but as a rival to his legacy,"" says author Richard Moore, who recently wrote a book about the 1988 final called ""The Dirtiest Race in History."" ""When I asked him about Bolt he said, 'It will be really tough for him, no one has defended an Olympic title before.' Moore pointed out to him that he had, technically, defended his 100m title at Seoul and Lewis corrected himself: 'I said no one else BUT ME!'"" Bolt and Blake have none of the enmity that Lewis and Johnson had, but if Bolt can defend his Beijing title then it would surely stand above Lewis' achievements, simply because that second gold medal in Seoul was won in such unprecedented circumstances. ""There's no way to describe it. For me it is amazing to think that I am faster than everybody,"" Bolt said when asked how it feels to be the fastest man in the world. The worry for Bolt is that Blake isn't his only rival. U.S. sprinter Tyson Gay has run the second fastest time ever. The 2004 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin, also from the U.S., is returning after a doping ban while fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell once held the world record himself. Anyone of them could snatch gold if Bolt's injury problems are worse than his bravado suggests. That tongue in cheek bravado might have helped make Bolt such a star; but the Jamaican is not afraid to show a more serious side when he talks about the sprint challenge ahead. ""All I can say,"" Bolt told CNN last month, ""(is) Yo, let's go if you want a piece of me."" Four years later, under the intense pressure only an Olympic 100m final can bring, we may finally know how fast Bolt really can run. The stage is set for for the most eagerly awaited track event at an Olympics. And no one, even given the talk of injuries, should discount that come Sunday, the world would have witnessed the fastest race in history too.","Usain Bolt could make history during this weekend's 100m final .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Thwack, thwack, thwack. The sound of a hoe hitting the earth breaks the silence of a cold, crisp Atlanta early spring morning. Wearing a brightly colored, tribal patterned piece of material as a skirt over her pants, Halieth Hatungimana works hard turning the soil over in preparation for seeds. Her worn hands grip the hoe with ease, the thwacking noise rhythmic. Slowly, other women start to join her. They're bundled up against the cold but still make a point to sing out to each other in greeting. A child's runny nose is tended to and then he's left to play. The women are farming a piece of land in the unlikely location of Atlanta. They're planting spinach and beets and carrots in anticipation of a late spring harvest. It's work they're familiar with, work they're good at. See, these women aren't originally from Atlanta. They're refugees from Burundi. Burundi is a small African country that shares a border with Rwanda to its north and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west. No stranger to political instability and unrest, Burundi started out as a monarchy though was later colonized by the Belgians. Independence came in 1962, but damage to the relationship between the country's two main tribes, the Hutus and the Tutsis, had already been done. One coup after another eventually led to military rule. A captain and a colonel later, Burundians found themselves without a constitution or opposition parties. Tensions between the ruling Tutsis and majority Hutus grew and grew until another all-too-familiar wave of violence broke out in 1988. It's estimated that 150,000 Burundians were killed, and tens of thousands sought refuge. Burundi briefly looked to be back on track a few years later, but after the country's first Hutu president was assassinated, the nation was rocked by civil war. All this happened before the Burundian and Rwandan presidents were killed in a plane crash April 1994. That crash marked the beginning of the better-known Rwandan genocide and only served to exacerbate the tensions in Burundi. It wasn't until a cease-fire was negotiated in 2006 that Burundians could exhale. And while the situation still isn't fully resolved, the violence has for the most part stopped. Waves of Burundians came to the U.S. during that turbulent time. Atlanta was a popular destination for them because the city is constantly growing, and it was looking to diversify the population. For the refugees, escaping war was only the beginning. Transplanted into a world that looked different, smelled different and spoke an entirely different language meant many challenges. In Burundian culture, the women are responsible for farm work. Without knowing English, many struggled to find a way to fit in, let alone provide for their families. FIFA co-opts first woman from Burundi to its executive committee . A guiding light for the women . For these 15 refugees, Susan Pavlin changed all that. A former immigration lawyer, Pavlin knows how hard it can be just to get to the United States. She wanted to take her love of gardening and combine it with her passion for those in need. She gave up her well-paying job and started Global Growers, an organization that offers refugees a second chance at a new life. Global Growers operates a few farms and farming programs, but the Umurima Wa Burundi is just for Burundian refugees. Halieth is the de facto leader of the group. She's been farming since she was a little girl. When she came to America after fleeing Burundi, she had no means of income. She couldn't speak or read English, and had a hard time navigating her new city. Now, she can take the local rail transportation and read which spot she needs to get off. Her English isn't fantastic, and she still needs a translator to explain some larger concepts, but you can tell from the way her eyes soften when she smiles that she's happy. Originally the garden intended to give the Burundian women a chance to do at which something they're good, to empower them and perhaps the chance to take something home to their families. It's since evolved into a means for the women to make money. They now sell whatever they don't take home at farmers' markets. This year, they also started a Community Supported Agriculture program, or CSA. Members of the community pay a fixed sum and get roughly 12 weeks worth of vegetables from the farm. They get whatever comes out of the ground that morning, and the women wash and sort the veggies with care. Because the CSA members come and pick up their weekly allotment from the garden in person, they get to meet some of the Burundian women. ""I like the concept,"" says CSA member Don Bender, ""I know some of the folks who work here, and they bring with them skills from Burundi that they're able to use in this, and it feels good to see them be able to continue with what they were doing there to do it here. ... I think plants reflect better taste when they're raised with love."" For Halieth, the relationship is mutually beneficial. Through a translator, she says, ""If you are working, then ... you are going [to feel] very better, but if you're going to sleep in, you're going to [get] in trouble."" She means the garden gives her a purpose in life, that she's not just sitting at home doing nothing all day. Her goal for the farm is for it to become big enough ""to produce the things that are going to help our family or to help grow up our kids."" Burundi faces growing unrest . Another harvest from garden: leadership . Susan's role is more as a coordinator, making sure the garden is permitted correctly and handling the administrative tasks. The rest is run by the women. She's noticed some residual benefits of the garden as well. ""There's really a leadership process that has evolved,"" she says, ""We have regular team meetings with the women who are in the leadership of the farm and we look at what has been successful selling at the market and we also look at what are some of the crops, the food that the women want for their own homes that they can't typically get in the marketplace here. So we do a combination of growing things that are harder to find in the markets like African greens ... and then also growing for markets."" The women are also responsible for deciding what farming techniques to use. They often plant two beds of the same crop, to see which one does better. They're used to a less-structured growing approach. Seeds are scattered over an area, as opposed to being planted in rows. They've recently expanded their growing space so they have more room for muchicha, an amaranth green prominent in Burundi. When they first picked out what they'd grow, a language barrier caused some confusion. The women saw a picture in a seed catalog of what they thought was muchicha; turns out it was basil. The women's approach to their crops is also commendable. They use as much of the plants as they can; even taking bean leaves to prepare at home like spinach. As she reflects on the garden, and how far it's come, Susan says ""probably the biggest thing I've learned is how incredibly important it is for human beings to have something they can take ownership of and feel strongly about. ... And with that also comes a tremendous amount of confidence and really a comfort level of being in this country, having an opportunity to share it with their children. ... It's been really amazing to see that grow because it tells the story of people getting a chance to do something that's good for them and good for their families, but really is central to who they are and it makes people so much stronger."" Stronger, more empowered and happier. They may not be in Burundi, but Global Growers is providing these women with more than just the ability to farm. They're integrating them into a community so that one day, maybe they'll feel like they're home.

"(CNN) -- Football is part of the lifeblood of the people of Brazil, who have seen their heroes lift the FIFA World Cup a record five times since 1958. From the legendary Pele, who inspired that initial success in Sweden and also played in the 1962 and 1970 winning teams, through to the eras of Romario, Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, ordinary Brazilians have delighted in their exploits. Because Brazil's ""Samba Boys"" don't just win, they win in style, capturing the imagination of a population often struggling with poverty and inequality. ""I would say it is all about the joy football brings,"" Manchester United's Brazilian star Anderson told CNN. ""It's about the children who maybe don't have enough food at home, who don't have a dad or a mum, but they go outside to play football even with bare feet and they feel joy and happiness to do it. It happened to me and many of my friends when we were growing up. ""Football helps a lot of people in Brazil. If you took football away from Brazilians, you would be affecting the nation's heart."" A rocky road to Rio and the 2014 World Cup? That's why it's a matter of some national concern that Brazil, a football-mad country with a seemingly neverending conveyor belt of talent, has never won the Olympic tournament -- not with its men, or its also highly-talented women. And with Brazil hosting the 2014 World Cup, and the Olympics two years after that, the pressure is on. The 2008 Beijing Games provided the latest disappointments, with a men's team sporting the likes of two-time world player of the year Ronaldinho and future AC Milan star Alexandre Pato crashing out in the semifinals to Argentina, losing 3-0 and ending up with the bronze medal. The women's side, including five-time FIFA World Player of the Year Marta, had to settle for silver for the second straight Olympics. Work and play - Brazil's samba star Neymar has it all . Midfielder Anderson, who played in the Argentina match, admits that the failure hurt -- and not just because Brazil's South American archrivals went on to claim the gold medal for the second successive time. ""We had hoped to win the gold medal because we had great players like Ronaldinho, Pato ... I was there, other stars as well, but we couldn't do it,"" he said. ""To be honest it didn't hurt more to lose to Argentina. What hurt is that we lost the chance to win a gold medal that we could take home and show our family and our kids. That's what hurt the most. We were sad, our families were sad. To me and the rest of the squad it was very sad."" Anderson is unlikely to be part of Brazil's bid for golden glory at London 2012, having been left out of coach Mano Menezes' provisional 52-man squad. Booming Brazil lures immigrant workers . It's a powerful lineup which includes rising stars Neymar and Paulo Henrique Ganso, who both ply their trade for Santos in the Brazilian league but have been linked with several top European clubs. Ronaldinho, Chelsea defender David Luiz and Barcelona's Dani Alves are among the more established stars hoping to be named as one of the three players aged over 23 who will be allowed in the final 18-man squad. Anderson knows the pressure of expectation on their shoulders, and what winning the tournament would mean to the players and his nation. ""To win a football gold medal at the Olympics for Brazil would be like winning the World Cup,"" he said. ""I am really hoping and praying that we can do it."" Sugar seats' at Brazil's 2014 World Cup? Anderson's Manchester United teammate Rafael da Silva has also been picked, and will likely be battling Alves for the right-back berth. The 21-year-old has a burning ambition to be part of Brazil's first gold medal-winning team. ""You can't even describe how much I want it -- I really want to play these Olympics, I want to win them,"" Rafael told CNN. ""It will be an enormous pride to win this for Brazil."" His twin brother Fabio, also part of United first-team squad, may have to wait to achieve his Olympic dream after being left out of the provisional squad. ""We started having this dream since we were about 10 years old,"" Fabio said,""because Brazil never had won this medal and I would talk to my brother and say, 'It would be great for us to get that gold medal, that Brazil never had.' "" FIFA beer battle about cash, not game . This time the Olympic tournament will be missing Argentina, who failed to qualify, but Anderson is warning against complacency. ""Of course Argentina have great players and are a great team, but there are other teams we must worry about because at the Olympics you never know what you are going to get since every nation wants to take home a medal. It's a tough competition, a great competition,"" he said. Fabio agreed: ""There are also strong sides coming from Africa and even the Great Britain team, they have good players and they have home advantage."" Rafael chipped in: ""Imagine playing against Britain in the UK... Imagine... Old Trafford... semifinals!"" Before the excitement of the Olympics, United's Brazilian contingent have their parts to play in bringing a record-extending 20th English title to Old Trafford. Teixeira quits as Brazilian football chief . Neighbors Manchester City provide the main challenge, having headed the standings for much of the season until United took over at the top earlier this month. ""City are now a real contender while we have had a history of success for many years,"" said Anderson. ""We have had a lot of injuries but now we have most people fit and when that is the case we are very hard to beat."" The top two meet at City's Etihad Stadium on April 30 in what many believe will be the EPL title decider, but Rafael believes the games before that showdown will be equally decisive. ""We need to think about winning games that we have, particularly away from home. When it's closer, we can start thinking about the game against them, which it will be a great match of course,"" he said . All three Brazilians are indebted to the guidance they have received from legendary United manager Alex Ferguson in their time with the Red Devils. ""He's a manager with a lot of experience and he passes on a little bit of everything he says,"" was Fabio's verdict. ""He tries his best to be honest with the players. I think that's really important,"" said Rafael. Anderson said that when the 70-year-old finally decides to retire, it will leave a massive void. ""When Ferguson leaves Manchester United, the club will miss him a lot. He is fundamental for this club. When he leaves, I am telling you, people will be so sad because he is special, he is different. His history of success shows that.""","Brazil favorites for the Olympic football tournament at London 2012 Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme was released from federal custody Friday, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons said. Lynnette ""Squeaky"" Fromme, left, appears in court in Los Angeles, California, in December 1969. Fromme was convicted in 1975 of pointing a gun at then-President Gerald Ford in Sacramento, California. She was released Friday morning from Federal Medical Center Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas, said Felicia Ponce, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in Washington. Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, pointed a gun at Ford a year after he became president. Secret Service agents prevented her from firing; the gun was later found to have ammunition in it, but no bullet in the chamber. In a 1987 interview with CNN affiliate WCHS, Fromme, then housed in West Virginia, recalled that the president ""had his hands out and was waving ... and he looked like cardboard to me. But at the same time, I had ejected the bullet in my apartment and I used the gun as it was.""

"(CNN) -- Medals and reputations will be won and lost at the London Olympics -- but forget the events, just who will triumph in the fashion stakes at the Games? It is not just the kit athletes will wear on the track or in the pool which will make a splash, it is also the official uniforms which will be worn for Friday's opening ceremony. As a designer, striking the right style chord can ensure your kit will be immortalized and cherished in the memories of a nation. Get it wrong, and the fashionista police will never let you forget it. And with styles under forensic examination -- from journalists and paparazzi alike -- Olympic associations have left no seam unturned to ensure their athletes scrub up well. It is not surprising given the convergence between sport and fashion. The global sportswear market is estimated to be worth $120 billion, which illustrates just how much is at stake for manufacturers to create the perfect impression. Adidas, who generated sales of $16.3 million in 2011 and supply Team GB's apparel, have their eyes on upping their share of a British sportswear market worth $5.5 billion. The German company has a long-standing relationship with Stella McCartney, the daughter of music legend and former Beatle Paul McCartney, and she has designed the uniforms for the host Team GB squad. ""This project has really means a lot to me being a British designer and working with Team GB at a time like this, when we are hosting the Games in London for 2012,"" McCartney told CNN. ""It really goes beyond anything I've ever done before and it's just such an incredible honor. ""Being a designer, a fashion designer this is not the type of opportunity that normally comes your way and I feel really very lucky and privileged. It's been a really exciting challenge."" McCartney is facing some top-level competition from the likes of French fashion house Hermes as well as Prada, Armani and Ralph Lauren, who have been brought in by other Olympic associations to work on their kits and uniforms. ""There were a million different things to consider with this role,"" explained McCartney. ""Number one was trying to identify what makes a country, to show the pride of the nation and translate that into clothing, while taking into account the necessary technical achievement. ""It also involves looking at the best athletes in the world and how to do them proud and to help enhance and support their performance."" While making sure the kit is fit for purpose, McCartney was also keen for each kit to safeguard the masculinity and femininity of competitors. ""Every athlete I talked to have said they perform better when they feel confident about how they look, so I really tried to do that,"" said McCartney. ""Another thing is how to look masculine and feminine with that and still keep the dignity of the athlete. ""Also, how everything will come across visually on television, when billions of people are watching it, to try and make it different. There are a million things to think of, working with a lot of guidelines."" McCartney's efforts have received the backing of one of Team GB's leading lights, the nation's first Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins -- sort of. Wiggins, who will make his London 2012 bow in the cycling road race on Saturday, said on Twitter: ""Just arrived at the Olympics, got all me kit, still think Stella was a bit Lucy in the Sky when she knocked this one up,"" a reference to one of McCartney's Dad's classic records. ""In a good way, certainly gonna (sic) stand out,"" added Wiggins in a subsequent tweet. The confidence gained from looking slick is something Willie Walters, fashion course director at London's Central Saint Martins college of art and design, believes could give athletes the edge when it comes to winning medals. ""It is important that leading athletes are given the confidence of looking their best at such an important occasion when all the world is observing them,"" said Walters. ""This should be provided by the best designers available. A versatile designer can turn their talents to a range of aesthetics within the parameters of sporting attire."" Walters also detailed the possible benefits for designers able to attach their name to a successful Olympic squad, both in terms of reputation and financially. ""The coverage of the Olympics brings the attention of a much wider audience to these designers work. ""(Designing sportswear) cannot be easy and would require a lot of research on the part of the designer and their team; I would think it should be well remunerated.""","A host of high-profile fashion names have been asked to design Olympic kits .

"(CNN) -- Low humidity and strong winds Friday helped fuel a half-dozen wildfires in Oklahoma that have so far burned at least 65 structures and are threatening more. The largest of the fires is just south of Oklahoma City in Cleveland County, according to Jerry Lojka, spokesman for the department of emergency management. ""The metro area is not in danger, but there are still homes out there, and there are subdivisions that are in those wooded areas,"" he said.

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported some road closures. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Evacuations are under way in a part of Oklahoma County where the sheriff's office said it was seeking a possible arson suspect.

"(CNN) -- Joe Paterno's family said Friday it intends to appeal the National Collegiate Athletic Association's sanctions against Penn State University in the aftermath of the child sexual abuse scandal. But the family's plans hit an immediate roadblock. ""Penn State's sanctions are not subject to appeal,"" said NCAA spokesman Bob Williams. Calling it ""a stark wake-up call to everyone involved in college sports,"" the NCAA in late July announced a $60 million fine against Penn State University and stripped 14 seasons of football victories from the late Paterno. Penn State President Rodney Erickson said the university had accepted the decision and would not appeal. Former senator to be integrity monitor for Penn State . Wick Sollers, attorney for Paterno's family, said the sanctions caused ""enormous damage"" to Penn State, students, athletes and Paterno. The sanctions are part of the continued fallout from the child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted in late June of 45 of the 48 counts he faced involving 10 young victims. The NCAA action followed an independent investigation led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, whose report held Paterno and other top Penn State officials responsible for failing to stop the abuse beginning in 1998. Paterno's family sharply objected to Freeh's findings and criticized the NCAA and university leadership for accepting the report's conclusions. The Freeh report, Sollers wrote, ""is incomplete, rife with unsupported opinions and unquestionably one-sided."" Soller's letter also argued the NCAA acted hastily and without regard for due process. The family contends it can appeal because Paterno was named in the consent decree and in the Freeh report. Penn State faced a multiyear shutdown of its football program had it not agreed with the sanctions, Erickson told CNN. Complete coverage of the Penn State scandal .

"London (CNN) -- Michael Phelps wasn't done making Olympic history. On Thursday, he became the first man to win the same individual event in three consecutive Olympics with a strong performance in the men's 200-meter individual medley. Phelps led from the first leg of butterfly, his specialty, until he touched the wall more than half-second ahead of teammate Ryan Lochte, who just a half-hour earlier had taken a bronze medal in the 200-meter backstroke. ""Even though Ryan had that 200 back before, I knew he was going to be tough. I kind of wanted to push the first 100 as much as I could just to kind of see what would happen,"" Phelps said. Phelps extends record breaking spree with first individual gold in London . Phelps, who will retire after the Olympics, made history this week when he became the Olympian with the most medals, surpassing Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina's record of 18. The Baltimore native now has 20 medals: 16 golds, two silvers and two bronzes. Lochte had won the first head-to-head contest with Phelps in these Games, taking gold in the 400-meter individual Saturday while Phelps could only manage fourth. ""I said to him in the meet room this is our last 200 of the meet and our last 200 together. We were just joking around, laughing about it. Ryan has probably been one of the toughest competitors ever to swim against,"" Phelps said. Earlier, Phelps described the moment he received a phone call from President Barack Obama on Wednesday. ""He just got on and was saying how everyone is supporting me and is behind me at home and how proud everyone is of me. That was pretty cool,"" Phelps said. ""And he finished by saying, 'Make sure you tell your mom I said hi.' It was a good call."" Earlier Thursday, American Rebecca Soni set a world record in winning gold in the women's 200-meter breaststroke. She swam 2:19.59 to beat Satomi Suzuki of Japan, who clocked an Asian record 2:20.72, for silver. ""I'm so happy, I didn't try to focus on medals or records,"" she said. ""I just wanted to swim one more race the way I knew I could."" In the men's 200-meter backstroke, Tyler Clary of the United States beat Ryosuke Irie of Japan and Lochte for the gold. Clary was stunned to have beaten the favorite, Lochte. ""It's not how I planned the race turning out at all,"" he told a BBC TV interviewer. Then still in disbelief, he said, ""You can wake me up now."" Phelps cements legacy as most decorated Olympian . Team USA had a easy night on the basketball court against Nigeria. Very easy. The Americans scored an Olympic record 156 points in 40 minutes, winning by 83 points -- which actually isn't a record. Carmelo Anthony led the U.S. with 37 points. ""We shot the ball better than any team in a game I have ever coached,"" Mike Krzyzewski said. ""Our guys just couldn't miss tonight. When you hit 29 threes it's very difficult to lose."" The American led by ""only"" 33 points at halftime. But they shot an amazing 71% for the game and beat Brazil's 1988 mark of 138 points. ""It could have been anyone out there against us tonight, when we shoot that well"" we'll beat anyone, Anthony said. It was reminiscent of the 1992 Dream Team dismantling Angola by 68 points. The two teams have been compared and Thursday's result will add to the debate as to which team of NBA all-stars is better. In its next game Saturday against Lithuania, the U.S. should get a more difficult opponent. But Lithuania only beat Nigeria by 19 in game earlier this week. Besides Obama, another president made Olympic news: Russia's Vladimir Putin attended the judo competition Thursday with British Prime Minister David Cameron. Putin, who is himself a black belt in the martial art, was treated to the sight of a gold for Russian judo contestant Tagir Khaibulaev. ""I look forward to taking the president to the judo at the Olympic park, but I note that we will be spectators and not participants,"" Cameron joked after their meeting at Downing Street. Tiny Gabby Douglas, nicknamed the Flying Squirrel, claimed gold for Team USA in the women's individual all-around gymnastics after a stunning final floor routine, leaving Russia's Viktoria Komova to pick up the silver. ""I wasn't really watching the scores, I was just going out there trying to do my rountines the best I could and I did,"" Douglas said. ""I came out on top and I'm just so excited."" It was heartbreak for Douglas' countrywoman Aly Raisman, though, as she tied for third with Aliya Mustafina of Russia but lost out on the bronze medal because of technical deductions. World champion Jordyn Wieber was excluded from the women's individual all-around final because she finished fourth, but third among Americans, in a qualifying system that allows only two people per nation. SI: Phelps flips script on Lochte with victory in the 200-meter IM . Cycling moved Thursday from the streets of London to the velodrome, a building praised for its sweeping curves and a track made of sustainably sourced Siberian pine, with qualifying rounds and finals in the men's and women's team sprint events. It was a day of drama, with Team GB's Victoria Pendleton and Jess Varnish -- who had major gold medal hopes -- relegated from the women's team sprint for an illegal changeover. More upset followed in the medal final, when the Chinese in turn were relegated from the top spot, giving gold to Germany. There were also scorchingly fast times, with China's women setting a world record in the team sprint and the British men doing likewise in the team pursuit and the team sprint. And then Team GB blew away the French to claim gold in the men's team sprint final and keep the title they won in Beijing -- setting another world record in the process and earning Chris Hoy his fifth gold. Forget Twitter; in China, it's the Weibo Olympics . The host nation's victory, which raised the roof in the velodrome, echoed the success of Team GB's road cyclists Wednesday, when Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome took gold and bronze in the time trial. The victory made Wiggins, a former track cyclist, the most decorated British Olympian, with seven medals. New postage stamps were released in the United Kingdom on Thursday, celebrating Wiggins alongside rowers Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, who brought Team GB its first gold medal of the 2012 Games on Wednesday. Team USA struck gold in the rowing Thursday as the women's eight retained their title, showing their dominance once again. South Africa took gold in the lightweight men's four after a superb late rally, relegating Team GB to silver, to the disappointment of many in the crowd. Also on the rowing lake, New Zealand won the men's doubles sculls final, the country's first gold in London. At the equestrian arena, Ann Romney, wife of the soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee, was on hand to see her horse Rafalca compete in dressage, ridden by Jan Ebeling. Mitt Romney wasn't there, though, as he was traveling from Boston to Colorado for campaign events. The oldest competitor taking part in the London Games, 71-year-old Hiroshi Hoketsu of Japan, rode in the same event on his horse, Whisper. In southwest London, tennis fans are enjoying quarterfinals at Wimbledon in both the men's and women's singles competition. Team GB claimed gold and silver in the men's canoe slalom, with Tim Baillie and Etienne Stott taking the top spot ahead of David Florence and Richard Hounslow, and a gold in the men's double trap shooting for Peter Wilson. But American Kayla Harrison beat Great Britain's Gemma Gibbons to gold in the 78-kilogram judo. Victory in the women's individual archery competition went to South Korea's Ki Bo Bae, while China's Zhang Jike won the men's table tennis singles title and France's Emilie Fer won a kayaking gold. Meanwhile, the fallout from the badminton scandal continued. One of the Chinese badminton players disqualified from the Games on Wednesday for trying to lose a match has indicated that she is quitting the sport, accusing the badminton governing body of ruining her dreams. ""This is my last match,"" Yu Yang wrote on her microblog account late Wednesday. ""Farewell Badminton World Federation, farewell my beloved badminton."" However, her official team apology, issued after her microblog comments, was less unequivocal. ""I apologize to all our fans because we failed to abide by the Olympic spirit and failed to present a game as it should have been. ... I am ready to do my best in every game of my professional career in the future, to show all of my fans that I've changed,"" it reads. Yu, her women's doubles partner, Wang Xiaoli, and six other players were kicked out of the competition Wednesday by the Badminton World Federation in one of the most controversial episodes of the London Games. The athletes were accused of playing to lose in order to face easier opponents in future matches, drawing boos from spectators and warnings from match officials Tuesday night. The other doubles pairs booted out were from South Korea and Indonesia. They lost an appeal for reinstatement. On Day 6 of the Games, the United States topped the medals table with 37 total to China's 34. Each nation has 18 golds. After a slow start, two strong days have sent Team GB shooting up the medal table, though it's still in seventh place. Complete coverage: London Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Iran has ""successfully"" test fired its newest version of the Fateh-110 missile, state media reported Saturday, touting the accomplishment despite international concerns about Tehran's growing military capabilities. Footage from state-run Press TV showed a missile on a rocket launcher in a desert area being fired into the air, before seemingly falling somewhere over the horizon. Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said that the test launch of the missile -- a ""fourth generation"" of the Fateh-110 -- was a success, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. ""Iran is among few ... countries capable of producing such missiles,"" the minister said in the IRNA report. The latest Fateh-110 version -- which was tested two years after Iran successfully tested the previous model -- is capable of traveling 300 kilometers (185 miles) and ""can target spots without any diversion,"" IRNA reported. The defense ministry plans to have all home-made missiles with ""this new capability,"" said Vahidi. Iran's developing missile program has been a hot topic in Washington and elsewhere in recent months, with a new Pentagon report last month finding that Tehran may test a missile that could reach the U.S. mainland within three years. ""Iran has boosted the lethality and effectiveness of existing systems with accuracy improvements and new submunition payloads,"" which allow missiles to drop explosives over a wider area thus causing more destruction, according to the Pentagon report. The report, which was signed by U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and sent to senators and U.S. representatives on defense committees, said Iran is continuing to develop other missiles that can hit Israel and Eastern Europe, including an extended-range Shabab-3 and a medium-range ballistic missile called the Ashura that can fly more than 1,200 miles. Iran is still capable of testing a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile by 2015 ""without sufficient foreign assistance,"" the report added. The United States and NATO have begun to field an anti-ballistic missile shield in the southern and eastern parts of Europe to protect from such a threat. But John Pike, a weapons analyst with the GlobalSecurity.org research group, said the missile shield is not yet fully operational. Washington has led international efforts aimed at stymieing Tehran's nuclear program, as well as its ballistic missile proliferation activities. But despite widespread sanctions, Iranian officials have been publicly defiant and regularly highlight developments in both arenas.","Iran's defense minister says the latest Fateh-110 missile launch is a success .

"(CNN) -- In the end, Gabby Douglas' massive gamble paid off. Like many young girls, she sat glued to the TV during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, mesmerized by the dazzling gymnasts flipping their way to glory. But instead of living vicariously through Shawn Johnson and Nastia Liukin as they won their gold medals, 12-year-old Douglas hatched a drastic plan to ensure that fairy tale became her reality: . She must train with Johnson's coach, even if that meant leaving her family in Virginia. ""She started saying, 'I need that coach. I need Coach Chow,'"" her mother, Natalie Hawkins, recalled to HLN. Liang Chow soared to international fame as a Chinese gymnast before settling down in the middle of Iowa to teach American gymnasts. It was there where Johnson morphed from a 6-year-old novice to a world-class athlete. Gabby Douglas takes gold . But Chow's gym was 1,200 miles away from Douglas, her siblings and her mother, who didn't think the idea would work. ""I said, well, I can't move the family to Iowa. I'm a single parent; I didn't have the resources to do something like that,"" Hawkins said. But Douglas wasn't just headstrong; she was a rare talent who vaulted up the ranks of gymnastics at an early age. She won a Virginia state championship at age 8, just two years after starting formal training. ""She just never wanted to come out of the gym,"" Hawkins said. ""She loved it. She would just practice all the time. So I saw then the hard work."" But in order to reach her full potential, Douglas insisted she needed an elite coach -- specifically, the one she had admired on TV. At age 14, Douglas received her mother's blessing to go train with Chow. The tiny athlete headed west and moved in with a host family with four younger girls, including another one of Chow's students. 'Fab Five' brings home gold for gymnastics . Both Hawkins and her daughter would have to learn how to be a family five states apart. ""That was very painful. It was scary. How would I still be Mom back in Virginia when she's living in Iowa? How does that work?"" Hawkins said. It wasn't just the physical distance that strained the family. Douglas' gymnastics took a heavy financial toll, too. ""Sometimes it felt crushing. I didn't think I could keep her in this sport,"" Hawkins said. ""But then I'd think about it and say, you've got to fight."" Douglas fought, too, battling through nerves and falls during her early days with Chow to bounce back in time for the 2012 Olympic trials -- where she topped the field and nabbed the only guaranteed spot on the Olympic team. Along the way, she was nicknamed ""the Flying Squirrel"" for her remarkably high release moves on the uneven bars. In her two years with Chow, Douglas won a team gold medal at the 2011 world championships in Tokyo, another team gold medal at the London Olympics and finally the sweetest prize of them all -- the Olympic individual all-around championship. At 4 feet, 11 inches tall, Douglas now stands on top of the gymnastics world.

"(CNN) -- In a presidential primary season distinguished so far by the absence of substantive debates, the controversy over whether Mitt Romney and his partners at Bain Capital should be considered job creators or job destroyers raises a profoundly important issue. Beyond the concerns about the loss of American jobs to off-shoring or automation and the food-fight tactics of Romney's rivals is a legitimate question about what kind of capitalism 21st century Americans should want. The choice is between ""stakeholder capitalism"" and ""shareholder capitalism."" According to the theory of stakeholder capitalism, corporations are and should be quasi-public entities with responsibilities to the nation-state and to the communities in which they are embedded. The corporation should make a profit and provide a fair return to investors. At the same time, workers who contribute their labor to the company have a legitimate interest in it as well as investors who provide capital. Managers serve the company and the country, not merely the investors. In the theory of ""shareholder capitalism,"" the corporation exists solely for the purpose of the investors, whom the managers serve as agents. In shareholder capitalism, short-term profits are the only goal, and if that means laying off workers instead of retraining them or reassigning them, breaking up the company and selling the assets to enrich private equity partners and shareholders, so be it. The stakeholder conception of the firm is still the norm in Europe and East Asia, as it was in mid-20th century America. But beginning in the 1970s, the shareholder conception of capitalism prevailed in the United States. From the perspective of shareholder theory, private equity firms like Romney's are promoting efficiency, even as they make short-term profits by dismantling or destroying companies and laying off their workers. From the different perspective of stakeholder capitalism, the emphasis on short-term profits for investors at the expense of all other considerations, including the well-being of employees and local communities, has been a tragic mistake. What are the implications? If America continues to favor shareholder capitalism, there is no guarantee that policies to favor American business will preserve or create jobs or help anyone other than investors. On the other hand, if the United States were to move away from shareholder capitalism toward stakeholder capitalism, the law might limit hostile takeovers of companies or require workers and even local governments to have a say in corporate decisions. In some cases this might preserve jobs and factories at the expense of innovation and efficiency. As a practitioner of the shareholder capitalism of the last generation, Mitt Romney as president would probably support policies that assume that the short-term interests of investors like Bain are identical to the long-term interests of the economy. By the same token, he would probably resist policies that increased the influence of managers, workers and local communities over companies at the expense of shareholders and financiers. Nominated as secretary of Defense by President Eisenhower in 1953, former General Motors CEO Charles ""Engine Charlie"" Wilson, a symbol of old-fashioned stakeholder capitalism, told the Senate that ""I thought what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa."" Does Mitt Romney, today's symbol of shareholder capitalism, believe that what is good for Bain is good for America? If he wins his party's nomination and this year's presidential election, Americans will find out.

"(CNN) -- Michael Phelps rounded off his record breaking career with his 18th Olympic gold medal as part of the winning U.S. 4x100m medley relay squad Saturday. It was his fourth gold in London -- two individual, two team -- and extended his all-time Games record to 22 medals. Phelps swam the third butterfly leg and helped overhaul surprise leaders Japan to give Nathan Adrian a small lead for the freestyle finish. He had started his final Games with a disappointing fourth in the men's 400m individual medley behind teammate Ryan Lochte and was pipped in his trademark 200m butterfly by South African Chad le Clos. But ever resourceful, Phelps, who won eight gold medals in Beijing in 2008, ended the meet as the leading swimmer with four golds and two silvers. Fellow American 17-year-old Missy Franklin ended as the top female swimmer in terms of medal tally in London as she joined Allison Schmitt, Rebecca Soni and Dana Vollmer to win their medley relay in a world record time of three minutes 52.05 seconds. Franklin also broke the world record in winning the 200m backstroke, one of her four gold medals, backed up by a bronze. The most emphatic victory on the final night of swimming finals came courtesy of China's Sun Yang in the men's 1500m, the longest race in the pool. A shout from a spectator distracted Sun and he false started, but was quickly reinstated in the race. Once underway, it was a procession as he added to gold in the 400m freestyle by smashing his own world record with a time of 14 minutes 31.02 seconds. ""I thought I was going to be disqualified,"" Sun told gathered reporters. ""I didn't expect the false start and I was very worried about being disqualified."" Sun ended with two golds -- the first man from China to win an Olympic swimming title -- and a silver from the 200 free. Canadian Ryan Cochrane was more than eight seconds back with Beijing champion Oussama Mellouli in third. The other gold of the night went to Ranomi Kromowidjojo, who took the women's 50m free from Aliaksandra Herasimenia of Belarus and Dutch teammate Marleen Veldhuis. It completed the 50-100 double for Kromowidjojo.","Michael Phelps wins gold in final race of his swimming career .

"(CNN) -- On July 23, 1969, as Apollo 11 hurtled back towards Earth, there was a problem -- a problem only a kid could solve. At age 10, Greg Force reaches his arm into a tiny hole to fix an antenna crucial to Apollo 11. It sounds like something out of a movie, but that's what it came down to as Apollo 11 sped back towards Earth after landing on the moon in 1969. It was around 10:00 at night on July 23, and 10-year-old Greg Force was at home with his mom and three brothers. His father, Charles Force, was at work. Charles Force was the director of the NASA tracking station in Guam, where the family was living. The Guam tracking station was to play a critical role in the return of Apollo 11 to Earth. A powerful antenna there connected NASA communications with Apollo 11, and the antenna was the only way for NASA to make its last communications with the astronauts before splashdown. But at the last minute on that night, a bearing in the antenna failed, rendering it nearly useless. To properly replace the bearing would have required dismantling the entire antenna, and there was simply no time. So Charles Force thought of a creative solution: If he could get more grease around the failed bearing, it would probably be fine. The only problem was, nobody at the station had an arm small enough to actually reach in through the two-and-a-half inch opening and pack grease around the bearing. And that's when Greg was called in to save the day. Charles Force sent someone out to his home to pick up Greg. Once at the tracking station, Greg reached into the tiny hole and packed grease around the failed bearing. It worked, and the station was able to successfully complete its communications role in the mission. Apollo 11 splashed down safely the next day. At the time, Greg didn't think what he was doing was a big deal, and 40 years later, he's still modest about his role in the mission. ""That's all I did, was put my hand in and put grease on it,"" he says. If he hadn't been there, NASA would not have been able to make its last communications with the mission before splashdown, but Greg says ""it wasn't life or death, [from] my understanding."" ""My dad explained to me why it was important,"" he says, ""but it kind of caught me by surprise afterwards, all the attention."" iReport.com: Read Greg's firsthand account . That attention came from the media and even the astronauts themselves. Greg's small but important part in Apollo 11 was a story told by news outlets around the world. He even got a nice thank-you note from Neil Armstrong, whom he met when Armstrong went on a tour of NASA stations with the other astronauts to thank the staff after the mission. ""To Greg,"" reads the note, which Armstrong wrote on a newspaper clipping of Greg's story, ""with thanks for your help on Apollo 11. Neil Armstrong."" Perhaps not surprisingly, like many other kids who grew up during the Apollo era, Greg dreamed of becoming an astronaut. He says he remembers visiting his dad's office to listen to astronauts communicating with NASA officials on the ground. ""We could sit and listen to the actual communication with the astronauts as it was happening, and it was hard to understand, but I loved to do that,"" he says. ""On Guam we didn't have good television coverage, so I think I listened to the [moon] landing on the radio. To me it was a huge thing."" Greg pursued his dreams of space exploration all the way through college, where he majored in physics. Unfortunately, he was unable to pass the vision test for the space program because of his colorblindness, but even that couldn't squelch his interest. Greg went on to get his pilot's license, and even though his career now as a gymnastics school owner isn't exactly space-related, he says that ""ever since then, I've followed the space program."" And as a lover of space exploration, Greg hopes to see more missions to the moon. ""I think it would be an important step as far as going further, like to Mars,"" he says. ""I would love to see us go back to the moon."" But for now, on the 40th anniversary of the moon landing, he can remember the small but crucial role he played in bringing Apollo 11 home safely. ""It kind of caught me by surprise,"" he says, ""but I'm real proud to have been even a little tiny part of it."" iReport.com: See more photos of Greg with his father and Armstrong .","Greg Force, then age 10, fixed an antenna important to the mission .

"(CNN) -- The rapid expansion of social media means people can share pretty much everything online shortly after it happens, even video of a real dismemberment. This is the strange and frightening digital world we have descended into after a horrific video clip of a dismemberment found its way on to the Internet last week and was rapidly shared via social media, attracting more than 300,000 hits in four hours. Such offensive material is normally hidden in the deep Web, a dark place no search engine can access, where users trade everything from conspiracy theories to bootlegged software. Other shock videos of disgusting acts and workplace fatalities are often shared there, too. But what this video has done is expose this underbelly of the Internet and pushed it into wide circulation, finding an audience among the morbidly curious who have spread mass interest in graphic torture franchises like the movies ""The Human Centipede"" and ""Saw."" Our fascination with the macabre has always been there, but are we becoming desensitized to such violence when it transforms from fiction into the real thing? With every click of this video, it's as if we've gone from wanting to be a fly on the wall of a crime scene to being a fly on the corpse. Responsible journalists, who aim to find balance and sensitivity when reporting on serious crimes by adding context, holding back or blurring the most offensive parts, have been pushed aside by this crowd of gross-out seekers. The 10-minute online video shows the stabbing and dismemberment of a Chinese student who had been studying in Montreal. The video has been copied and shared so many times that authorities will never be able to delete what is essentially the key evidence in a criminal prosecution. One website that copied the original footage has attracted more than 445,000 views and crashed. ""If I wasn't completely ruined by the Internet I would be more shocked, but I've seen some stuff kinda like that,"" said one young person in response to watching the snuff video. ""If you've seen the 'Saw' movies you should be fine. You could probably stomach that better than most people."" The problem is that those who are watching don't realize how they have moved from being passive viewers in a true crime story to becoming participants. The video was obviously put out there to be seen by the widest possible audience, and the video's maker must be thrilled to know his handiwork has been promoted globally and seen by more than a million people. But almost nothing can be done to fix this. Even if laws were changed or strengthened to charge webmasters for hosting obscene material, it could never be properly policed. And as the music industry learned, the only way to significantly reduce piracy is to provide the content itself at a cost. Clearly law enforcement agencies aren't about to start accepting cash from the public to download graphic videos they have obtained during their investigations. In essence, it's too late to go back and we're stuck with this awful content being a part of our culture. The man police suspect made the video, Montreal resident Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, was captured in Berlin on Monday after an extensive international manhunt. He is believed to have fled to France on May 26, and then headed for Berlin. During the manhunt, Magnotta is believed to have even been commenting online on the police case against him, and reading articles about himself moments before the dragnet closed in. All the while his social media presence increased -- tripling his Twitter profile following and boosting the number of ""fans"" on Facebook. It's clear in this case how social media has been changing all aspects of crime: how it is conducted, how it is reported and how the public becomes involved. The often disturbing places where only killers, hardened detectives and well-prepared jurors had been given unfiltered access are now becoming available to everyone, anyone, instantly. All you need is Google and the desire to seek it out. We are all interconnected, from killers to children, grandmothers to corporate executives. This case is even a big progression from the first generation of social media killers who only a few years ago were more teasing about their exploits than being this overt. In 2008, filmmaker Mark Twitchell amassed a large online following when Edmonton, Canada, police discovered his murder movie script had been re-enacted in real-life. The young father had been obsessed with ""Dexter,"" his favorite television series, and modeled his goal of becoming a serial killer on the fictional character. Twitchell used social media in the planning, execution and covering up of his brutal crimes. Friends of his victim received many Facebook messages from him saying he was on a Caribbean holiday with a new girlfriend, explaining away his sudden disappearance. It wasn't until later when police realized who was actually behind those suspicious messages. The cover of the Internet only worked for so long. Some who have viewed the recent video in this new disturbing twist in social media crime may regret it. You can't unsee a video of a dismemberment, and I fear they could end up like some homicide detectives, haunted in retirement by what they have seen. But maybe that is the hope and comfort in this terrible story -- that many people are not so desensitized by violence that they laugh or shrug a shoulder upon watching a real man's horrific end put online. Maybe they can be a new wave online that warns others not to buy into it -- to deprive the killer of his audience might send this kind of material back into the sick underbelly from where it came. One teenage girl who saw it posted a video of herself shaking and in tears, begging people not to watch it. Another man, who watched the video, also clearly regrets it. He recorded his reaction on YouTube and is nearly cowering in fear by the end of it, at times even screaming in near hysteria, panting and covering his face with his hands. ""This is the most gruesome, disgusting video I've ever watched,"" he wrote under the posting as a warning to others. ""Please don't watch the video."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Lillebuen.","Steve Lillebuen: People share anything online, even video of a dismemberment .

"(CNN) -- Bolstered by a new poll that shows him leading in Ohio and two other battleground states, President Barack Obama on Wednesday made his ninth campaign trip this year to the Buckeye State to attack Republican rival Mitt Romney's tax plan as unfair to middle-class Americans. In Ohio, swing state politics have real-life impact . Obama cited a report issued Wednesday by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that concluded Romney's proposals for tax reform would end up providing large tax cuts to the very wealthy while increasing the tax burden on the lower and middle classes. ""He's asking you to pay more so people like him can get a big tax cut,"" Obama told more than 2,000 supporters in Mansfield, the first of two Ohio stops Wednesday. ""We do not need more tax cuts for folks who are already doing really well."" Romney's campaign challenged the veracity of the study and blamed the president's economic policies for a still-lagging economy. ""President Obama continues to tout liberal studies calling for more tax hikes and more government spending,"" Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said in a statement. ""We've been down that road before -- and it's led us to 41 straight months of unemployment above 8%."" Earlier, the Romney campaign launched a potentially risky ad challenging the Obama administration's auto industry bailout, which is credited with saving General Motors and Chrysler. Romney Ohio ad hits Obama over auto bailout . With just over three months until the November election, the race has become a contentious struggle to convince voters that the other guy will take the country in the wrong direction. The Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll released Wednesday showed Obama leading Romney in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania, all of which are among the eight or so battleground states vital to either candidate's chances for winning. Poll: Obama over 50% in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania . According to the survey, Obama holds a 50%-44% lead in Ohio and a 51%-45% lead in Florida, which are considered toss-ups in November. The president is ahead 53%-42% in Pennsylvania, which is rated ""leans Obama"" on the CNN Electoral Map. ""If today were November 6, President Barack Obama would sweep the key swing states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania and -- if history is any guide -- into a second term in the Oval Office,"" wrote Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, in a statement accompanying the survey's release. In a key finding that signaled possible trouble for Romney, the candidates were statistically even in all three states on the question of who would better handle the economy. Romney's main campaign theme is that he is more experienced and better able to bring economic growth than Obama, and his attacks on the president's economic policies have been relentless. Despite those attacks and unemployment above 8%, Obama is neck-and-neck with the former Massachusetts governor on the issue cited by voters as the most important to them. Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University, said before Wednesday's poll came out that the Romney campaign is ""betting on economic dissatisfaction"" to defeat Obama. ""If that were true, Obama's negatives would be much worse,"" Schiller said. ""There's obviously something else driving people's support other than the economy."" Obama's visit to Ohio showed the importance his campaign places on the state he won in 2008 over Republican candidate Sen. John McCain. At events in Mansfield and Akron, Obama delivered a modified version of his usual stump speech emphasizing the need to restore the American dream of equal opportunity for all willing to work for it, adding a section on the report by the Tax Policy Center set up by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. Study: Romney tax plan would shift burden toward poor . Romney calls for 20% cuts to today's rates as well as eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax and limiting current deductions, exemptions and credits available to top-level income earners. However, Romney has yet to say which specific tax breaks he plans to eliminate, and the Tax Policy Center report indicated the result of his plan would force the tax burden to shift toward lower- and middle-class Americans. Tax policy has become a central economic issue, with Congress deadlocked over proposals to extend most or all of the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year. Obama calls for extending the current rates under the tax cuts for income below $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals, while letting the rates on income above those figures rise to 1990s levels. ""If you're fortunate enough to be in the other 2% of Americans, all we're asking you to do is contribute a little more,"" Obama said Wednesday. ""This includes me, by the way."" Romney and Republicans want to extend all the Bush tax cuts for now to prevent any increase, with both sides calling for comprehensive tax reform after the election as part of necessary deficit reduction steps. The issue touches on the foundations of the nation's political divide, with Republicans driven by their conservative base seeking to shrink government to reduce deficits while Democrats want a blend of spending cuts and more tax revenue in order to maintain what they consider essential services and entitlement programs. In its study, the Tax Policy Center did not score Romney's plan directly, saying it lacked sufficient details. Instead, the center said Romney's plan represented a number of Republican proposals. ""They found that if Gov. Romney wants to keep his word and pay for his plan, then he'd have to cut tax breaks that middle-class families depend on,"" Obama said, listing mortgage deductions and health care deductions as examples. ""That means the average middle-class family with children would be hit with a tax increase of more than $2,000."" The president made clear that he was relying on the study for the analysis and details, saying, ""this wasn't my staff; this wasn't something we did."" ""Folks making more than $3 million, the top one-tenth of one percent, would get a tax cut of a quarter of a million a year. Think about that,"" Obama said. The Romney campaign argued that the analysis was flawed because it did not account for additional revenue that would result from a reduction in the corporate tax rate -- another part of Romney's plan. ""Ignoring the growth effects of corporate tax reform discredits the Tax Policy Center immediately,"" a Romney campaign representative said, adding, ""By not including the substantial growth effects of the corporate side (of) reforms, the entire study is based on flawed assumptions."" Also on Wednesday, the Romney campaign released a television ad that criticized Obama for the auto bailout. Titled ""Dream,"" the spot features Al Zarzour, a car dealership owner from Lyndhurst, Ohio, saying that under the bailout measure, ""the dream ... that we worked so hard for was gone."" ""I received a letter from General Motors. They were suspending my credit line. We had 30-some employees that were out of work,"" Zarzour says in the spot. Romney has argued the bailout was not the best solution to right the then-struggling auto industry, instead advocating a ""managed bankruptcy"" process that he said is what ultimately happened. Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, said the Romney ad was surprising, adding that the president's actions on the auto industry saved 2,200 dealership jobs in Ohio alone. Obama's campaign has also aired advertisements focused on the auto industry bailout, including one in which an autoworker explains how the bailout helped him. Romney and the Republican National Committee have paid $8.2 million for a week of ad time in eight battleground states, which a Republican source who tracks ad buys called the largest amount spent on behalf of Romney so far in the general election media campaign. Romney, RNC make largest weekly ad buy . Last week, the RNC started spending some of the funds it is allowed to use to coordinate with the Romney campaign. This allows Romney's campaign to avoid spending some of its money but stay on the air as the candidate faces millions of dollars of ads from the Obama re-election campaign. Romney campaign officials have routinely refused to discuss the specifics of its ad spending or where its commercials are running. According to CNN's ad consultant Campaign Media Analysis Group/Kantar Media, the Romney ad talking about layoffs in the car industry is running in Ohio while a new biography spot with Romney touting his business background is up in Iowa. The Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee, which started coordinating ad spending last week as well, bought $5.3 million of ad time in the same eight states between July 21 and August 3, and a separate $3.5 million for commercials running for a week ending August 2. Another new Romney ad Wednesday hammered Obama over unemployment and other economic problems, saying: ""Americans need a change. We need a new president."" Obama's campaign responded to the ad by citing Romney's opposition to the auto industry bailout. ""Let's get this straight -- the very person who argued for the U.S. auto industry to go bankrupt, something that would have caused more than a million jobs lost and utter economic devastation in the Midwest, is now trying to attack the president on how it was handled?"" campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith said in a written statement. CNNMoney's Charles Riley and CNN's Kevin Bohn, Ashley Killough and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.","Mitt Romney's campaign challenges a report on the candidate's tax plan .

"(CNN) -- South African runner Caster Semenya will be allowed to keep the gold medal she won in the women's 800-meters at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin, Germany, in August, the country's sports ministry announced Thursday. In a statement on their official Web site the ministry added that Semenya had been found innocent of any wrongdoing but the widely anticipated results of gender tests conducted would not be made public. ""We have agreed with the IAAF that whatever scientific tests were conducted legally within the IAAF regulations will be treated as a confidential matter between patient and doctor,"" the statement read. ""As such there will be no public announcement of what the panel of scientists has found. We urge all South Africans and other people to respect this professional ethical and moral way of doing things."" The world governing body for athletics, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), have refused to comment on the announcement, only reiterating a statement published on their official Web site on Wednesday that the release of their gender-test findings would be delayed until ""further notice."" The IAAF had been expected to release its findings on February 20, but confirmed it had been in discussions with the South African Ministry of Sport and Recreation with a view to ""resolving the issues surrounding Caster Semenya's participation in athletics."" The IAAF went on to say that the medical tests on Semenya had still to be completed. ""There will be no discussion of Semenya's case at the forthcoming IAAF Council Meeting to be held in Monaco on 20-21 November 2009. No further comment will be made on this subject until further notice,"" their statement read. Reports in two newspapers in September said the results of the tests showed Semenya has both male and female characteristics. The IAAF has declined to confirm those reports. The South African ministry added they had been unhappy with way the testing had been handled: ""We have asked the IAAF to apologize at the way the whole Caster Semenya saga was dealt with. ""Their response is: 'It is deeply regrettable that information of a confidential nature entered the public domain.' The IAAF is adamant that the public discourse did not originate with them. ""We also cannot prove the contrary. It is our considered view that this chapter of blame apportioning must now be closed. The sport bodies must be allowed to deal with the rest of the investigations in terms of their own regulations,"" the statement added. The controversy over Semenya erupted after she crushed her rivals in the 800 meters and secured victory in one minute, 55.45 seconds -- the best women's time in the world this year. Semenya's masculine build and dominant performance fueled existing questions about her gender, and the IAAF -- which oversees the sport worldwide -- ordered tests to be carried out.","South African Olympic runner Caster Semenya will keep her gold medal, the country's sports ministry announced Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Andy Murray gained revenge for his Wimbledon singles defeat to Roger Federer by demolishing the world No. 1 to claim Olympic gold for Team GB. The Scot brushed aside the 16-time Grand Slam winner from Switzerland in straight sets, winning 6-2 6-1 6-4, in front of a rapturous crowd on Centre Court. It was the first time ever the 25-year-old had beaten Federer in a best of five set match and marked his first major tennis title, albeit outside the four major championships. Murray has a chance to claim another gold medal in the mixed doubles final when he and Laura Robson take on Belarusians Victoria Azarenka and Max Mirnyi barely 45 minutes after his victory in the singles. Follow all the action at the Olympics with our London 2012 live blog . But he seized his opportunity to avenge his painful defeat at the same venue less than a month ago with some blistering ground stokes to take Britain's first Olympic singles gold since Josiah Ritchie in 1908. Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro took the silver medal, beating Novak Djokovic 7-5 6-4, after he was defeated by Federer in the semifinal. An emotional Murray clambered into the stands to celebrate with his family and coaching team after his emphatic victory, and later told the host broadcaster it was one of the biggest wins of his life. ""I have had a lot of tough losses in my career and this is the best way to come back from the Wimbledon final,"" he said. ""This week has been incredible for me, the support has been amazing at all of the Olympic events. ""I watched the athletics last night and the way Mo Farah won gave me a boost coming into today. ""I didn't expect that [being crowned Olympic champion] at the start of the week. I thought I'd go deep into the tournament but I felt so fresh today. It's amazing."" After an even start Murray took complete control of the match in the first set and never looked back. Federer, who admitted to being drained after his marathon semifinal victory over Del Potro, couldn't keep pace with his opponent. Murray broke twice in the opening set to take it 6-2 and stepped up a gear in the second as he surrendered just one game. The final set was a more even affair, but Murray secured a decisive break in the fifth game and held his nerve to close out the match with an ace. Federer said: ""He was better, much better than I was today but I'm happy with silver. I had a very emotional tournament. ""Maybe I was emotionally drained but, nevertheless, I didn't think I played too badly, but things didn't go my way. It's unfortunate, but still a great day for me. ""Andy looked like he was never doubting himself and he was able to come through this time around.

"Washington (CNN) -- Twelve U.S. service members brought prostitutes to their hotel rooms in Colombia prior to an April visit by President Barack Obama, according to a U.S. Southern Command report detailing parts of the investigation into alleged misconduct by military members of the security team for the trip. Partial details of the report were released Friday by the command, which took the lead in the investigation. The report shows, for the first time, what the service members did while in Cartagena, Colombia. One service member brought an overnight guest to his room during the first week of April, while the 11 others brought female guests to their rooms on April 11 and the morning of April 12, according to the report. Read more: Is the Secret Service scandal a systemic problem or aberration? While some of the service members had been together prior to returning to the hotel on April 11, they made ""individual decisions"" to bring the women back to the el Caribe Hotel and pay for sex, the report said. The investigation of military personnel came after nine U.S. Secret Service agents were dismissed for spending time with prostitutes in Cartagena, where they had been sent to prepare for the president's trip. CNN reported last month that seven U.S. Army soldiers and two Marines have been notified they will receive what the military calls ""non-judicial punishment"" for the misconduct. One member of the Air Force received a lesser letter of reprimand. The military is still investigating the role of two U.S. Navy personnel involved in the scandal. The nine service members were charged with violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The U.S. Southern Command decided the charges warranted a non-judicial punishment rather than court-martial. Read more: Escort in scandal says life is ruined . The report said that the activity by the military members did not create a security risk.

Investigators concluded that the women had been fully vetted by Colombian officials and U.S. investigators, who confirmed they were not part of a human trafficking network or affiliated with Colombian guerillas or other terrorist or drug-trafficking groups, according to the report.

"London (CNN) -- Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt defended his title as the world's fastest man Sunday, grabbing gold in the men's 100-meter race by setting an Olympic record with a time of 9.63. Bolt, who became a household name with his gold medal win in the 2008 Beijing Games, is the first sprinter since U.S. Olympic legend Carl Lewis to defend an Olympic 100-meter title. He overcame an unimpressive start to blow past the competition. ""My start wasn't too good but my coach always said to me I'm not a good starter, it's not worth worrying about,"" Bolt said after the race. Yohan Blake, also of Jamaica, took the silver medal while Justin Gatlin of the United States won bronze. Both set new personal bests with 9.75 and 9.79 seconds, respectively. Despite his impressive win, Bolt was looking ahead to his next race. Blog: Day 9 action as it happened . ""It means one step towards being a legend, so I'm happy with myself, but it's only one step, I have the 200 meters to go,"" he said. On the woman's side, Sanya Richards-Ross of the United States won the gold medal in the 400-meter dash. Christine Ohuruogu of Great Britain took the silver and DeeDee Trotter of the United States won bronze. Also on the track, double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius, who runs on special carbon fiber blades and is nicknamed The Blade Runner, failed to make the final in the men's individual 400-meter race. He came in nearly two seconds behind the leader in his semifinal heat. Pistorius is the first person to compete in the able-bodied Olympics using prosthetic legs, and he will also compete in the Paralympics later this summer. Earlier Sunday, Andy Murray cruised to a gold medal in the men's singles tennis final, beating Roger Federer in straight sets. Murray conquers Federer for tennis gold . Three times prior, Murray had played Federer in an important final, and three times he had failed. In front of an enthusiastic home crowd, Murray flipped the script on the world's top-ranked player. ""I've had a lot of tough losses in my career, this is the best way to come back from the Wimbledon final,"" he told a BBC interviewer. ""I was a little tired after Wimbledon, but I felt fresh on the court today."" Murray said he had expected a tough match from Federer, who just four weeks ago beat Murray for his seventh Wimbledon title on Centre Court, also the site of the Olympic final. But after winning the first set 6-2, he broke Federer to take a 2-0 lead. He grew in confidence at that point, he said, and the rout was on. He lost only five more games in the three-set match against the man who has won three of his 17 Grand Slam titles by beating Murray. Just hours after his win, the Brit added to his medal count by taking silver in mixed doubles alongside Laura Robson. The pair narrowly lost to Belarus' Max Mirnyi and Victoria Azarenka, 2-6, 6-3 , 10-8. iReport: What's your Olympic story? Also on Sunday, at the North Greenwich Arena where the gymnastics competition is being held, there was a stunning result in the women's vault. After her first attempt, world champion McKayla Maroney looked like a sure gold medal winner. But her second vault turned into heartbreak as she did something she rarely does. She came up short on her landing and fell. ""I'm really disappointed with myself,"" she said. ""I fell on the second vault, and I don't think I've ever even fallen in warmup here at all. It's a big shock, and it's really sad."" Maroney, who had nailed her first effort and scored 15.866, received only a 14.300 on her second. ""I was praying there was still a chance, but I didn't make my vault,' she said, ""and a gold medal vaulter doesn't deserve to fall."" She tried to look on the bright side. ""All I can look forward to is the next competition coming up, and I just have to accept that I have a silver medal and that's not too bad,"" she said. Romania's Sandra Izbasa won the gold with a two-vault average of 15.191. In the women's marathon, Tiki Gelana of Ethiopia won the gold in 2:23.07. Priscah Jeptoo of Kenya was the silver medalist, and Tatyana Petrova Arkhipova of Russia was third. The race kicked off under a heavy downpour as the runners snaked around wet London streets. ""It was a great race. I really loved it. The rain makes it very interesting,"" Gelana said. ""I love running in the rain, I have been doing that since I was a small child. I slipped in the middle of the race, and my elbow is still injured. But I didn't feel any pain during the race."" More: Get latest Olympics results on CNN's live blog . Women's boxing made its Olympic debut Sunday with a round of 16 matches in each of the three weight divisions. Overall, China leads the gold medal count with 30 and the total medal count with 61. The United States trails with 28 gold and 60 total. One of China's golds came Sunday in the men's badminton singles final when Lin Dan beat Malaysia's Lee Chong Wei. Lin won the same event in Beijing in 2008, also over Lee. ""This gold again confirmed my hard work over the years, because I knew to get this again I'd have to work even harder,"" Lin said. ""I had to sacrifice quite a lot after (Beijing) 2008 because I want to retain the title. A lot of good athletes want to have this medal.

"New York (CNN) -- Lawyers for former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn said they are not worried about a pending civil suit from his accuser after a New York judge dropped criminal charges against him. ""She doesn't have much, if any, chance in a civil case,"" William Taylor told CNN's Piers Morgan Tuesday night, the same day that a New York judge dismissed sexual assault charges against Strauss-Kahn. ""The same difficulties, the same lies will come back to haunt her in a civil case."" A grand jury indicted Strauss-Kahn in May over allegations he sexually assaulted housekeeper Nafissatou Diallo in his suite at the swanky Sofitel hotel in New York. Prosecutors requested that the charges be dropped after they began to question Diallo's credibility. They said the Guinean woman had lied on an asylum application. She said she had been gang-raped by soldiers in her native country, but later admitted it never happened, prosecutors said. Diallo's lawyer, Kenneth Thompson, said his client was crushed by the judge's decision. ""Devastated,"" Thompson told guest host Don Lemon on HLN's ""Joy Behar Show."" ""She has told the truth about what happened in that hotel room. She can't understand why Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance would abandon her. She and her daughter have been crying through the night."" Thompson said Diallo was raped like she said in her asylum application. Thompson wondered if prosecutors pushed to drop the charges because Strauss-Kahn is rich and powerful. ""Clearly, the D.A. looked at Dominique Strauss-Kahn, his status, his power,"" said Thompson. ""If Dominique Strauss-Kahn was a bus driver from the South Bronx or a construction worker from Harlem or a plumber... Do you think that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance would care what was in Miss Diallo's asylum application?"" Thompson said he is glad that he filed a civil suit because he did not ""trust the process."" Vance, in a news release Tuesday, said prosecutors had no choice but to move to drop the charges because they were ""not persuaded -- beyond a reasonable doubt -- that a crime has been committed, based on the evidence we have."" He said Diallo's testimony ""was fatally damaged, for several key reasons."" Along with the asylum application, Diallo lied about the specifics of her whereabouts after the rape incident and information on tax forms, prosecutors said. A crowd of protesters gathered near the courtroom in New York Tuesday in support of Diallo, carrying handwritten signs reading ""No impunity 4 rapists in power"" and ""Nafissatou we believe you."" Strauss-Kahn's lawyers had maintained his innocence throughout the process. ""I think what we said from the beginning, there was an act in that room that was consensual, not forcible and I think we're going to leave it at that,"" said Benjamin Brafman, an attorney for Strauss-Kahn. ""Unless you yourself have been accused falsely of a serious crime that you did not commit, I think it's impossible to really understand the full measure of relief that Dominique Strauss-Kahn felt today.""

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will not lose his re-election bid because of Eric Holder. As sensational as the headlines surrounding the Fast and Furious controversy might be, recent history tells us Holder is only the topic of conversation right now. Come July, we'll forget all about it much in the way the Keystone Pipeline is hardly mentioned. Remember, it was just last week that all of the talk was about immigration and the Latino vote. The week before that, it was same-sex marriages. So Holder -- and the rest of those those sexy subplots -- are really just there to keep us entertained until the main event, the only event that matters leading to the election: the first debate. Everything before that will will likely fade away by November, especially for independents. It's what happens when Obama and Mitt Romney finally square off on Wednesday, October 3, that will have the greatest influence on those who are undecided. The candidates will debate at the University of Denver, in the first of three planned presidential debates. But you know the old saying: the first impression is the last impression. So if Obama stumbles in the first, he might as well spend the rest of the fall packing. Team Romney knows this, which is why what we saw in the Republican primary debates is not what we're going to see in October. Back then, Romney came across flat and on the defensive in the first debate, but this time expect him to come out swinging, questioning nearly every decision the president has ever made -- from cash for clunkers and bailouts to health care reform and the stimulus package. The presumptive Republican nominee won't have to knock Obama out, but if the night ends with the president appearing to be on the back of his of his heels, the game is over. After all, what could he possibly say in the next two debates or on the campaign trail that would erase an image of him struggling to defend his own record? Especially against a guy who continues to struggle to be liked, much in the same way a rigid Richard Nixon struggled against the charismatic John F. Kennedy, the wooden Al Gore paled next to the friendly demeanor of George W. Bush and listless John McCain couldn't come close to igniting the crowd like Obama in 2008. But to complicate things, Obama is defending his record against a man who is not afraid to distort the facts (i.e. lie) to win brownie points. That's not my opinion, that's what the people who currently endorse Romney said. After a debate in Florida, Newt Gingrich said Romney gave ""the most blatantly dishonest performance by a presidential candidate I've ever seen."" Earlier, Rick Santorum said he was ""stunned that Mitt Romney does not have the ability to discern something that is blatantly false."" On top of that, Obama has to find a way to remind the country where it was before he took office without appearing to be blaming former President Bush because, fair or not, people don't want to hear it. And unlike the backdrop of 2008, Obama doesn't have the luxury of speaking in generic hypotheticals because the country will have specific examples in 2012 to look at. Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. And not a teleprompter in sight. Just Romney, the list of promises Obama made in 2008 and his list of accomplishments heading into the stretch run of 2012. If he's re-elected, it won't be based on how he handles gaffes or controversies such as Fast and Furious. It will be because he took the GOP's best shot and came out on top on the one night doing so mattered most. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","The Fast and Furious scandal won't determine if Obama is re-elected .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari's Fernando Alonso has vowed to keep fighting for the Formula One world championship ahead of the Italian marque's home grand prix at Monza this weekend. Two-time drivers' champion Alonso is currently third in the 2011 standings, 102 points behind Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel in first position with seven rounds of the season remaining. Alonso, 30, will also be under pressure to deliver a positive result for the thousands of Ferrari fans who will be in attendance for Sunday's race. ""The championship situation is even more difficult after Spa, in that there is one race less to go and the gap to the leaders has grown a bit more,"" the Spaniard told Ferrari's official web site. ""We have to be realistic but we will never give up. We did not give up in the past and we will not do it now. It is easy to maintain a high level of motivation, because we tackle every grand prix wanting and trying to win."" As well as chasing the drivers' title, former McLaren driver Alonso is eager to try and help Ferrari overhaul a 195-point deficit to Red Bull in the constructors' championship. ""There is further motivation in the constructors' championship,"" Alonso said. ""There are more possibilities and we will try and do well right up to the last moment."" Alonso, who claimed the drivers' crown in 2005 and 2006 while at Renault, experience his first Italian Grand Prix as a member of the Ferrari team in 2010. ""Pole, fastest lap and race win, but this time with Ferrari,"" Alonso said of his victory last year. ""I especially enjoyed being on the podium seeing about 20 thousand people in front of me on the track with Ferrari flags: a difficult image to forget."" Sunday's race will represent the last European grand prix of 2011, with the Formula One world tour moving onto Singapore later this month.","Fernando Alonso has said he will keep fighting for the F1 world title .

"Washington (CNN) -- The District of Columbia's same-sex marriage law will go into effect as scheduled this week, after the Supreme Court refused to stop its enforcement. Chief Justice John Roberts issued a three-page order Tuesday, a day before the law becomes official. He concluded the high court should defer to local matters in the federal district of Washington. And he said a separate ballot initiative to overturn the law would give voters a chance to weigh in on the question. A group of Washington residents had objected to the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality Amendment Act, which expands the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples. Those opponents had argued city residents should have been given a chance to vote on the high-profile issue before the city council passed the measure. They still seek to force a ballot initiative after the law takes effect. Local courts had turned down various lawsuits to block it. The district's marriage bureau says same-sex couples can begin applying for marriage licenses Wednesday. However, by law, ""three full days must pass between the day of application to the day that the license can be issued,"" the bureau, part of the district's superior court system, says on its Web site, so no marriages would be held this week. A $35 application fee is waived for couples who are registered domestic partners, although a $10 fee for the license is not, the bureau said. District of Columbia Mayor Adrian Fenty signed a measure recognizing same-sex marriages as legal in December, after the city council overwhelming passed it. It then had to go through a review period during which Congress had an opportunity to intervene. The district joins Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts and Iowa in allowing same-sex couples to marry.","NEW: U.S. Supreme Court refuses to stop enforcement of same-sex marriage law .

"Washington (CNN) -- Retired Air Force Col. William Koch Jr. is a Vietnam veteran. His wife, Jean, died in 2005, but he didn't know where she was buried in Arlington National Cemetery until last year. Koch blames the U.S. Army, which runs Arlington, and he told Congress on Thursday to ""keep after 'em."" Koch is among dozens of survivors whose loved ones were buried in wrong or mismarked graves. It's an ongoing scandal at the nation's most hallowed burial ground for its fallen service members. Problems began in the early 1990s, according to a Washington Post investigation, and continue to this day with more revealed this week. Koch's wife, as the spouse of an eligible veteran, was supposed to be buried the grave site where Koch would eventually be buried. Her headstone was on the grave. He placed flowers on that grave. ""I even took her mother up there so she could see her daughter's grave site, and all she saw was a headstone and an empty grave,"" Koch said. It was empty because her remains, for some reason, were buried in a grave with the urn of a fallen staff sergeant. The staff sergeant was reburied elsewhere, Jean Koch's coffin was left in that grave site and a new headstone was put on her real resting place. It's stories such as the one Koch told Thursday at a House Armed Services Committee hearing that had some lawmakers wondering if the cemetery's control should be turned over to the Department of Veterans Affairs, which runs most of the nation's military cemeteries. ""We need to honor the sacred ground at Arlington, and I can tell you that we need leadership that respects that,"" Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colorado, told Army officials, who took over control of Arlington 10 months ago. ""You really, fundamentally, at the end of the day don't care. ... You are bureaucrats."" Kathryn Condon, executive director of the Army's cemeteries program, and Patrick K. Hallinan, the cemetery superintendent who runs Arlington's day-to-day operations, both insist they are doing their utmost to undo years of mismanagement. They took over after the previous managers retired in disgrace. The Army reprimanded John Metzler, the longtime Arlington superintendent, after the discovery of a number of problems with mismarked graves. Metzler and his second-in-command, Thurman Higginbotham, were allowed to retire last summer after the secretary of the Army told Congress that Arlington may have more than 200 mismarked graves. SInce then a criminal investigation has begun into cases of remains found improperly buried at Arlington, and an inspector general's probe is looking at the overall problems at the cemetery. Neither investigation is complete yet. Coffman said he believes the problems are bigger than the management. ""This is an organization that is rotten to its core. This is an organization that has conducted itself -- really, I think the best way to describe it is a culture of incompetence, if not a culture of corruption."" Condon testified that she and Hallinan are trying to make sure each grave is properly marked. ""When we check all the records with the actual grave site, that should identify where we may have potential discrepancies in the cemetery,"" Condon said. ""If we find a discrepancy, we will contact the families that are involved."" But there are 330,000 graves, and she admits that resolving each problem grave may be impossible. Even contacting the families is not easy because the Army doesn't always have the latest contact information on survivors -- if there are any. Hallinan told committee members that having the VA take over control of Arlington would be a mistake. ""Arlington provides graveside service which VA cemeteries do not. In addition, Washington, D.C., and Arlington National Cemetery (are among) the most visited tourist spots in the country,"" Hallinan said. ""We average over 4 million visitors, who come to learn of the history and pay their respects. There is no other VA cemetery like that."" Referring to families who lost members in combat, Hallinan said, ""The Gold Star parents that we've met with ... felt quite passionately and adamantly that Arlington should stay under the Army and not become a VA national cemetery."" On Friday, for the first time since the Army discovered where his wife is really buried and where her new headstone stands, Koch will go to visit the site. He said he wants the moment to be private, just between him and his ""beautiful wife."" But when asked if the VA should take over the cemetery where he will one day join his wife, Koch said, ""They couldn't do any worse.""","A House hearing focuses on problems at Army-run Arlington National Cemetery .
