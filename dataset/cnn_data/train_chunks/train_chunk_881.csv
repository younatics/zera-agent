"By . John Stevens . Alex Salmond yesterday admitted that the nationalists are now the ‘underdogs’ in next month’s Scottish referendum – after he suffered a comprehensive defeat at the hands of Alistair Darling in the first TV debate. Mr Salmond’s independence campaign, which is 16 points behind in the polls, suffered a massive setback when the First Minister faltered as he was asked to explain how his dream would work in practice. Mr Salmond was booed and heckled by the audience after he refused to answer a question five times – failing to say what his ‘plan B’ would be if Westminster refused to let an independent Scotland use the pound in a currency union. Handshake: Alex Salmond with Alistair Darling before Tuesday's televised debate . A recent opinion poll, which was released to coincide with the two-hour debate on Tuesday night, showed that out of those who have made up their mind, 58 per cent plan to vote No compared to 42 per cent who will choose Yes. And a snap poll carried out by ICM for The Guardian immediately after the clash indicated that Mr Darling had scored a victory over the SNP leader, winning the debate by 56 per cent to 44 per cent. Mr Salmond now faces an uphill battle to reverse the polls, and appears to be on the back foot. Yesterday he arrived more than an hour late at a conference for businessmen who support separation, amid rumours that he had been busy holding crisis meetings. However he insisted that he was still in with a chance of winning the referendum on September 18. Mr Salmond said: ‘There is six weeks of this campaign. I think everybody knows now that we are in a real position of possible victory.’ He went on to admit that the nationalists are ‘now the underdogs’, but added: ‘I relish that position.’ Mr Salmond was booed and heckled by the audience after he five times refused to explain what his ‘plan B’ would be if Westminster refused to let an independent Scotland use the pound in a currency union . The first television showdown between the two figureheads of the Yes and No campaigns saw several heated exchanges take place. Mr Salmond accused his rival of resorting to being a ‘shouty man’ in the often ill-tempered debate, which attracted 1.7million viewers. He said: ‘I am absolutely certain that the way to not just win this campaign, but to win the hearts and minds of the people, is to have a discussion. Not to shout at them, not to point your finger at them, not to wave your hands about, but to actually have a conversation about what matters to people and their families.’ The First Minister yesterday claimed that snap polls which were conducted over the course of the televised debate had shown an increase in support for independence from some of the viewers. He said: ‘The Yes support, people watching the debate, started at 45 per cent which is high and went up to 47 per cent, which is in touching distance of victory. ‘Particularly significant is the surge in support from women, and the fact that I think 74 per cent of undecided voters thought the Yes side won the debate. These are great findings for us, they show we are pursuing the right strategy.’ However Mr Darling pointed out that the First Minister has failed to come up with the answers needed on issues such as the pound. The Better Together leader said: ‘I think it was a good debate, but the important thing is Scotland wants to know the answer on what currency we will use. You can’t rely on guesswork, fingers crossed, we need to know what his plan B is and he won’t tell us.’ He went on to say: ‘In a debate you’re supposed to come up with answers. Now he had the odd good line, but he had no answer.’ It was the debate Alex Salmond hoped would revive his campaign for independence. But the Scottish Press yesterday declared the First Minister had suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of ex-chancellor Alistair Darling. The Daily Record proclaimed: ‘Alex takes a pounding’ and ‘Salmond is slugged’, as it claimed he was ‘left with a bloody nose’. The Glasgow Herald yesterday: The paper said Mr Darling had 'upset the odds after coming out on top' ‘Few gave him a chance, but it’s underdog Darling’s night as he tears into his rival over the future of the pound,’ said the paper as it referred to Mr Salmond’s repeated refusal to state what Scotland would do if Westminster refused a currency union. ‘Darling draws first blood’, ran the front-page headline of the Herald. The Glasgow-based newspaper said Mr Darling had ‘upset the odds after coming out on top’. Political editor Magnus Gardham wrote: ‘For the Yes campaign, trailing in the polls, the debate was a huge opportunity to press their case. Mr Salmond and his colleagues might feel privately that the encounter was a missed opportunity to march into the crucial final phase of the campaign on the front foot.’ The Scottish Daily Mail ran the headline ‘A bloody nose for Salmond’ on its front page. ‘Alex Salmond was licking his wounds last night following a live TV showdown with Alistair Darling which dealt a crippling blow to his bid to break up Britain,’ it said. ‘The First Minister, a skilled debater, had been expected to comfortably see off his rival but was left badly bruised after the angry clash.’ The Daily Record and the Scottish Daily Mail: Mr Salmond was expected to comfortably see off Mr Darling . The Dundee Courier described the debate as a ‘bruising battle’, adding that ‘Mr Darling will definitely be more satisfied’ with his performance. Commentator Alan Cochrane wrote in the Scottish Daily Telegraph: ‘The incredible vacuum at the heart of Alex Salmond’s economic policy was laid bare in the most humiliating fashion … a hammering pure and simple.’ The Scottish Sun was more sympathetic to the First Minister, saying in its leader column: ‘The first battle has ended in a draw – the contest is far from over.’ Fury over TV blackout in England . Viewers criticised broadcasters after the debate on whether Scotland should break up its 300-year-old union with the rest of the United Kingdom was only shown north of the border. Figures yesterday revealed that 1.2million people in Scotland watched the show on television, but people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were only able to access an unreliable online feed. Although both the BBC and Sky News asked to televise the debate, broadcaster STV, which organised the event, refused. Instead they offered ITV the opportunity to show the programme outside Scotland, but the channel chose to show Alan Titchmarsh’s Love Your Garden and Kids Behind Bars, a documentary about American young offenders. Around 500,000 people watched the debate online. The surge in demand crashed the STV website, leaving viewers in the rest of the UK unable to see the first part of the showdown. Yesterday STV apologised for their website’s breakdown, saying the failure had been caused by ‘unprecedented demand’. Unavailable in England, Wales or Northern Ireland: The debate's online broadcast by STV broke down . STV spokesman Bobby Hain said: ‘This landmark television debate delivered ratings that make it the best-watched political debate in Scotland for more than ten years. The online stream achieved over half a million viewers.’ But he added: ‘We are aware that due to extremely high demand some viewers had difficulties accessing the programme. ‘We apologise to anyone who was not able to watch the debate in full. The programme is available on our catch-up service, STV Player.’ A number of viewers expressed their frustration at not being able to watch the debate outside Scotland on Twitter. Labour MP Tom Watson wrote: ‘It may not be of interest to many, but you would have thought a debate on the future of the Union would be broadcast UK wide.’ And broadcaster Andrew Neil wrote: ‘Trying to watch Salmond v Darling on STV iPlayer. But feed from STV making a great debate impossible to watch. Really angry. Useless beyond words.’ An ITV spokesman said: ‘ITV screened the debate live in the area where our viewers have a vote in the question under discussion, Border Scotland. ‘The debate was of course covered as a news story in our news programmes broadcast to the whole of the UK.’ The Yes and No campaigns are now in negotiations with the BBC about staging a second live debate later this month.","Opinion poll shows Yes campaign is 16 points behind among decided voters .

How fitting that on the football pitch amid this luscious landscape trains the only squad in the top four divisions made up entirely of Englishmen. The hills belong to County Durham, the river is the Wear, the village Sherburn and the football team Hartlepool United. Sir Bobby Robson was born five miles away, how proud he would have been.

These are austere times. They would be forgiven for reverting to a traditional tactic. ‘Yeah, we just bash it up to a big man, is that what you think?’ manager Colin Cooper asks Sportsmail. A few minutes into training and it’s clear they do not. Amid all of this debate about our national footballing identity and FA commissions and reports, here is a team full of Englishmen who actually pass the ball. Cooper, capped once by England despite the best attempts of former Ireland boss Mick McCarthy to ‘resurrect my great-grandfather’, would not have it any other way. The training session includes former West Ham striker Marlon Harewood, now 34, and grizzly centre-back Sam Collins, a veteran of 600 matches. Also on show is Brad Walker, an 18-year-old midfielder who already has more than 40 senior appearances to his name and was in March named Football League Apprentice of the Year. He inherited that prize from team-mate Luke James, a 19-year-old who has 22 professional goals. Defender Matthew Bates, the former Middlesbrough skipper, has seen some star names graduate from their academy but believes Walker and James are lucky to be at Hartlepool. ‘I have spoken to both and I think they should stay here,’ said the 27-year-old. ‘I look at Brad, I’ve played with some brilliant 18-year-olds but he is one of the best I’ve ever seen. Local lad: Former Middlesbrough skipper Matthew Bates has dropped down the divisions . ‘He has got all of the ability and will go on to play in the Premier League. But he’s playing regularly here with a great manager behind him.’ Cooper believes Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana – who played for Southampton at Hartlepool’s Victoria Park three years ago – are an inspiration to young English players. ‘It’s brilliant, I really think what they have done is great,’ he said. ‘If I’m a lad who is in my early 20s and it hasn’t quite happened for me, then Rickie Lambert is an inspiration. ‘I think that’s an absolutely brilliant story. Those things can happen but you’ve got to graft for it.’ So has the English model come about by chance or design? No frills: Hartlepool United's Victoria Park holds less than 8,000 people . Legend, after all, says this is the town which hung a monkey when they believed it to be a French spy having washed up on their shores from a shipwreck during the Napoleonic War. But Cooper says: ‘I must be honest, it’s no effort on my part that I only sign English players. I have played with world-class foreign players and you can only learn from them. ‘Our boys here are English, yes, but the most important thing for us is that they’re young lads from the North-East. ‘They might not have been able to make it at one of the big three clubs in the region and they find themselves here having to work very hard to forge a football career. All smiles: Sportsmail's Craig Hope (third left) speaks to Cooper during Hartlepool's press day . ‘But we have some tremendous talent and we are giving them a chance to show that.’ Bates, having just broken from a group photograph with his compatriots, remarks: ‘None of us realised we’re all English to be honest. But I think it’s great. ‘Let’s hope we can represent the country well because it might filter through the leagues and others might realise it is the way to go. ‘The domestic market has gone crazy – look at Ross McCormack for £12million – and you don’t blame clubs for looking abroad for value. But lower down there are a lot of good English lads out there.’ Journeyman: Former Premier League star Harewood has made Hartlepool his 10th club . Hartlepool kick off their League Two campaign at Stevenage on Saturday where they’ll come up against a Frenchmen and a Zairian. But Bates believes the northern boys are flying the flag for their country. ‘Let’s hope England can be champions of League Two and that English core, with that charisma and togetherness, can get us through,’ he says. ‘But come and watch us, we pass it as well and we’ve got some cracking young players.’ There you have it then, Hartlepool United - an English team worth watching.","Manager Colin Cooper boasts squad made up entirely of Englishmen .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The blue t-shirt, the slicked-back hair, the inane pointing at shellfish: It can only mean David Cameron's holiday. The Prime Minister's return to Portugal for a summer break was marked with the now-traditional photo opportunity, and his PR advisers are clearly taking no chances by doing anything radical or new. In fact readers might have struggled to tell the difference between this year's pointedly relaxed shopping trip to a seafood market in Cascais in Portugal and last year's relaxed pointing visit to a market in Aljezur, some 200 miles away. It is just the latest addition to the Prime Minister's growing album of photographs in which he has been seen admiring the fish counters of Cornwall, Plymouth and Grimsby. Scroll down for video . Mussel man: David and Samantha Cameron today visited a seafood market in Cascais in Portugal . With a blue t-shirt, dark dress, slicked-back hair and piles of fish, today's snap was an eerie echo of last year's visit to a market in Aljezur in the Algarve . Ed Miliband recently accused Mr Cameron of being ' a very sophisticated and successful exponent of a politics based purely on image'. It seems that image is based largely on joining his wife Samantha in public admiration of prawns and mussels. Not only was today's image a repeat of last year's, Mr Cameron has previously been seen buying shellfish in Port Isaac, admiring the day's catch in Grimsby and stopping off in Morrisons to get fish for tea in Number 10. The Prime Minister returned to Portugal early this morning, after attending World War One commemorations in Belgium last night. The Camerons and their children Nancy, Elwen and Florence jetted off for their summer holiday on Saturday. But the PM left his family to fly to Glasgow the following day to attend the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. He then travelled to France and Belgium yesterday to take part in ceremonies to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. Shortly after arriving in the resort 30 miles west of Lisbon, Mr Cameron was told his faith minister Baroness Warsi had quit. Video courtesy of Municipality of Cascais . Mr Cameron flew back to Portugal this morning after attending World War One commemorations in Belgium last night . The PM was all smiles, shaking hands with the locals, despite being told this morning that Foreign Office minister Baroness Warsi was quitting in protest at his policy on Gaza . Mr Cameron only spoke to Baroness Warsi on the phone from Portugal after she tweeted news of her resignation . The senior Foreign Office minister dramatically resigned in protest at the government's 'morally indefensible' policy on Gaza. Baroness Warsi made the announcement on Twitter, before the Prime Minister had even had chance to speak to her. But the drama was not going to stop the Camerons rushing out to cast a critical eye over Cascais's crustaceans. After a quick call to London, Mr Cameron pulled on a dark blue t-shirt, Mrs Cameron donned a dark dress and they set off to land themselves some lunch – and a photo opportunity. Clutching sunglasses, the couple pointed purposefully at the produce, shook hands with the locals and joined the queue to pay for their purchases. It all seemed horribly familiar. Last year Mr Cameron pulled on a blue shirt anbd Mrs Cameron wore a dark dress as they headed out to admire the fish market in Alejezur in the Algarve. Maybe Tory media gurus know something the rest of us don't. They obviously think voters like to see a Prime Minister who knows his way around a fish counter. In 2012 Mr Cameron made an impromptu stop at a Morrisons supermarket in Plymouth, where he bought fish and vegetables for a family dinner . In 2011 Mr Cameron bought monkfish, scallops and mackerel from Fresh From The Sea in Port Isaac, Cornwall . During the 2010 election campaign Mr Cameron campaigned through the night, including a stop at Grimsby fish market . In 2012, Mr Cameron interrupted a visit to the West Country to stop off at Morrisons in Plymouth, where he bought sea bass from the fish counter, new potatoes, lemons and other fruit. A year earlier during a holiday to Cornwall – his fifth in 2011 – Mr Cameron bought monkfish, scallops and mackerel from Fresh From The Sea in Port Isaac. In the run-up to the general election in 2010, Mr Cameron shunned the obvious politician's photograph kissing babies to grapple with a large fish during a visit to Grimsby. During the election campaign Mr Cameron boasted of having a 'good fishing heritage', telling the Angling Times how his grandfather was a 'brilliant fly fisherman'. The Tory leader added: 'I still do a bit of fishing, but not as much as I'd like to. I went mackerel fishing with the children this summer and we ate everything we caught, I'm pleased to say. I do a very good smoked mackerel paté.' David Cameron has been accused of wasting taxpayers’ money after he used an RAF jet to fly back from his summer holiday after just one day abroad. The Prime Minister flew to Portugal with his wife and three children on Saturday where they are enjoying a 10-day break staying in a villa. But after just a few hours in the sun, on Sunday he was yesterday flown home by the Royal Squadron so he could attend the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. He then used the RAF plane to fly to France and Belgium for the First World War commemorations before flying back to Portugal on a commercial flight at his own expense this morning. The Prime Minister has been criticised for not postponing his holiday for just a few days, which would have saved taxpayers thousands of pounds. Mr Cameron’s extraordinary travel plan saw him rack up around 3,700 air miles in just three days. Labour MP Thomas Docherty said: ‘Why couldn’t he just have booked his holiday for after these events, rather than blowing thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money jetting backwards and forwards? Fellow colleague Steve Pound added: ‘It’s not like he didn’t know these events were happening - we’ve known the date of the First World War anniversary for 100 years.’ Mr Cameron, who has previously been accused of being too good at ‘chillaxing’, had an Easter break with his family in Lanzarote. He and his wife will also take their traditional break to Cornwall later this summer with their children Nancy, eight, Arthur, six, and Florence, 23 months.","Prime Minister and his wife visit a market in Cascais, 30 miles west of Lisbon .

But an alcoholic drink made from Birmingham's most famous dessert, Bird's Custard, has scooped a top award - and is guaranteed to get you pie-eyed. Concocted by bartender Robert Wood of Birmingham's The Edgbaston Hotel, the Local Legend is filled with local ingredients. Award winner: Bartender Robert Wood with his cocktail, the Local Legend . The 31-year-old came out tops from 10 hopefuls at the contest to find Birmingham's best cocktail, staged at the Lost and Found pub in Bennett's Hill. Robert's drink included honey sourced in Birmingham and Bird's Custard, once made in what is now the Custard Factory. There's also a hint of toffee and cream and the kick is provided by Langley's gin. It took Robert, originally from Manchester, three weeks to create. He said: 'I wanted to create something unique to Birmingham and unique to us. The base is gin, lemon and honey.

"By . Brendan Carlin, Mail on Sunday Political Reporter . Ed Miliband last night sparked a furious political row over the conflict in Gaza by accusing David Cameron of ‘silence’ regarding the death of Palestinian civilians. In an outspoken statement, Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron’s ‘silence on the killing of hundreds of innocent Palestinian civilians caused by Israel’s military action will be inexplicable to people across Britain and internationally’. The remarks sparked an angry response from Downing Street, with aides accusing the Labour leader of misrepresenting Mr Cameron’s views. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, pictured, was accused by Ed Miliband of 'silence' regarding the death of Palestinian civilians . The No 10 spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has been clear that both sides in the conflict need to observe a ceasefire. 'We are shocked that Ed Miliband would seek to misrepresent that position and play politics with such a serious issue.’ Mr Miliband stressed that he was ‘a supporter of Israel’ but branded its military actions in the past two weeks as ‘wrong and unjustifiable’. He called on the UK Government ‘as a whole’ to condemn the escalating violence on both sides. Yesterday, in the 26th day of the conflict, Israel carried out fresh attacks on Gaza while militants launched more rockets into Israel as a hunt continues for missing Israeli soldier Hadar Goldin. The remarks by Ed Miliband, pictured, sparked an angry response from Downing Street, with aides accusing the Labour leader of misrepresenting Mr Cameron’s views . Palestinian officials said 55 people had died in Israeli strikes on Saturday, most in Rafah. Some 1,655 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and 66 Israelis, all but three soldiers, have so far died. Last night Israeli officials said they would not attend truce talks in Cairo, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation in Gaza would continue ‘if required’ after the demolition of Hamas’s tunnels. So far some 31 tunnels have been destroyed under the border with Israel.","Ed Miliband accused Cameron of 'silence' regarding death of Palestians .

"By . Martha Kelner . Follow @@marthakelner . Tom Daley is ‘hungry for gold’ and a slice of revenge on Saturday after relinquishing his 10m synchronised title to Matthew Mitcham but he will have to overcome his own ‘demon dive’ as well as his great Australian rival if he is to top the podium in the 10m individual event. Daley and James Denny were delighted to take silver last night on Friday night - missing gold by the equivalent of a misplaced baby toe - having only formed a partnership last week and completed just three training sessions together. But if he is to upgrade to gold Daley needs to conquer the dreaded ‘twister’ dive, which has been his nemesis since London 2012. He traced his problems back to the Olympic final, when his focus was disrupted by a flash from a camera in the crowd. Daley messed up and was allowed to repeat the dive, going on to win a bronze. But it has had him spooked ever since, with one prominent sport psychologist suggesting he might be suffering from ‘Lost Move’ syndrome - diving’s equivalent of the yips. VIDEO Scroll down for Tom Daley and James Denny pipped to gold by Australian duo . Silver: Tom Daley (left) and James Denny (right) just missed out on gold in the men's synchronised 10m . Silver lining: Daley (right) and Denny (left) smile on the podium as they receive their medals . Agonising: Tom Daley looks on as he realises England will be pipped to gold by the Australian duo . The dive, which carries a difficulty rating of 3.8 and involves two-and-a-half somersaults with two-and-a-half twists in the piked position, is not the trickiest in Daley’s repertoire - but it is the one that has struck fear into him. After faltering again when performing the dive at a World Series event in London in April, causing him to miss out on a medal, Daley admitted it was a ‘massive problem’. He said: ‘When you look down, your knees go weak, your legs go to jelly and it’s terrifying. ‘The twister is my nemesis dive and it always will be, I think. It’s one of those things that I really struggle with. The more scared you are in that dive, the more detrimental it is. I have to go out there and feel as confident as I can. It’s the dive that’s the weakest on my list at the moment.’ Daley has reason to be fearful. If you said you weren’t scared by somersaulting backwards while twisting your body around with your head spinning just inches from the board, ‘you’re either lying or stupid,’ he quipped. Daley has enlisted a sport psychologist and had what he termed ‘trauma therapy’ in an attempt to conquer his fears. Dr Mike Rotherham, a sport psychologist, suggested ‘Lost Move’ syndrome. ‘It tends to affect more of the artistic type of sports such as diving, gymnastics and trampolining where, for some unknown reason, it’s not uncommon for athletes to be unable to complete their routine which they could normally do with ease,’ he told the Telegraph. ‘It tends to manifest itself in freezing. It’s similar to the yips.’ Falling through the air: Daley (right) and Denny  (left) produced a near-perfect final dive to secure silver . Daley was first encouraged to add the dive to his repertoire by former mentor Leon Taylor, who said he did not regret encouraging him to attempt the ‘twister’. ‘It’s mind games and not about your physical ability to do the specific dive,’ said Taylor, ‘All divers go through it. What you have is an increased level of anxiety, and the more nervous you get the worse the problem becomes.’ Daley, 20, was still the No 1 attraction at Edinburgh’s Royal Commonwealth Pool despite the success of the rest of England’s diving team, namely Jack Laugher who won two golds and won silver this week. There were ‘I love Tom’ T-shirts and posters and several young girls screaming for ‘selfies’ with their sporting hero. The most enthusiastic support came from the front row, behind a St George’s Cross flag with ‘Tom Daley’ emblazoned on it in gold lettering. Daley’s mother Debbie, brother Ben and boyfriend Dustin Lance Black exploded into cheers as he and Denny aced their treacherous sixth dive. Watching on: Daley (left) and Denny (right) improved their dives as the competition progressed . Success: The pair are an inexperienced diving duo but managed to rise to the occasion to finish second . They were last of the four pairs going into the final round, after ragged dives in the third and fourth rounds. The tannoy system reiterated that - according to Commonwealth Games federation rules - only a gold and silver medal would be awarded. ‘We knew it before but it made it a bit more dramatic hearing it halfway through,’ said Daley. Against the grain, they nailed the forward four-and-a-half somersault, the hardest dive any pair attempted and dramatically increase their score to 399.54, just 0.18 behind Mitcham (left) and his partner Dominic Bedggood. ‘He’s won six silvers but that’s the first Commonwealth gold Matt has won,’ said Daley. ‘He’ll be hungry for another but I’m hungry, too.’ Gold: Australians Matthew Mitcham (front and Domonic Bedggwood (back) won the Commonwealth title .","Daley and Denny came agonisingly close to Commonwealth gold .

"By . Candace Sutton . and Frank Coletta . A schoolboy from top Sydney eastern suburbs school, Rose Bay Secondary College, is one of the six teenagers who made the racist threats to Jewish children on a school bus this week, Daily Mail Australia can reveal. Two teenage boys from a second nearby boys' high school are also in the 'hate attack' group, but both the schools, the NSW Minister for Education Adrian Piccoli and the NSW Department of Education have all gone to ground, refusing to comment on the attack. Rose Bay Secondary College principal, Richard Skinner, refused to speak to Daily Mail Australia and both the department and minister Piccoli's office refused to respond. Instead, the NSW Government has decided to deal with the racial attack as a 'transport matter', referring inquiries to the authority which looks after buses and bus drivers, the State Transit Authority. The point where the boys, who are aged between 14 and 17, boarded the bus and began terrorising children as young as five years old is almost half way between the two schools. Racist attack: a student from Rose Bay Secondary College is one of the five youths aged between 14 and 17 years old who are accused of making a vile racist attack on a busful of terrified Jewish children on the way home from their schools in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs on Wednesday. Principal Richard Skinner refused to speak about his student and the Department of Education and the minister, Adrian Piccolli have also gone to ground . One member of the gang of six youths who unleashed an anti-Semetic tirade on a school bus on Wednesday have been identified as a student of Rose Bay Secondary College . Shut down: the Department of Education has refused to comment, as has the NSW Education minister and two schools about the racist attack by anti-Semitic youths on a bus full of schoolchildren ob Wednesday . It is alleged the six males were drunk when they boarded the school bus near the corner of Darley and Allison roads near to Sydney's Centennial Park at around 3.50pm on Wednesday afternoon. Blue school bus 660 was headed for Bondi Junction from Maroubra. It was carrying 25 primary school students aged between five and 12 years old, all of them pupils from three Sydney Jewish schools, Moriah, Emmanuel and Mt Sinai colleges. They youths, some of whom wore parts of their school uniform, began chanting anti-Semitic threats including 'kill the Jews and 'Heil Hitler' to the frightened children. One of the . teenagers also said to them the group would 'slit their throats'. Five of the youths, believed to be aged between 15 and 17, were arrested at 3.30am on Thursday as they roamed the streets of Dover Heights in Sydney's east. Several hours later, a sixth teenager, believed to be aged 14, was interviewed by police. Inspector Box said he believed the incident was opportunistic, 'isolated and random'. They were released into the care of their parents after interviews at Waverley Police Station and reinterviewed the following day in their parents' company. The Department of Education has refused to comment on whether the youths have been suspended pending the police investigation, or make any comment at all about the schools, the alleged offending pupils, or the incident. Media inquiries were directed to the NSW State Transit authority. Detective Superintendent Jason Box said 'it's believed the six juveniles were intoxicated'. The youths have been interviewed and released, their schools refusing to confirm if the students have been disciplined . Police were set to interview a key witness on Friday, who says she saw the attack begin. The woman, who said she was 'a prominent member' of the local Jewish community requested she not be identified. 'I saw the whole thing happen and how it all started,' she said. 'It was terribly distressing.' The STA say the driver had 'followed all the necessary protocols'. 'This was not a private charter bus, it was a school bus and the bus driver has followed correct procedure in allowing students on,' a spokesman said. Jacqui Blackburn's three daughters, aged 8, 10 and 12, were on board the bus at the time of the incident. 'I’m very angry. If these guys get away with this there will be hell to pay,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's not good enough that they will all walk away with a slap on the wrist. How does it happen?' Prominent Sydney Jewish commentator Jeremy Jones said the schoolboys involved might need to undergo an anti-racism education programme and learn about Jewish people and their history. 'But in my experience people who show anti-Semitism or racism of any kind are nearly always bullied,' said Mr Jones, who is the co-chair of the Global Forum for Combating anti-Semitism. 'This does not happen because of circumstances or events overseas or in Australia. They may feel empowered by that, but they are racists and bullies.'","A student from Rose Bay Secondary College is one of the six teenage boys accused of a racist attack on a Jewish shool children's bus .

"By . Leesa Smith . Drunks, customers refusing to pay and offensive language have forced a pizza shop to ban an entire street in northern Queensland from receiving home deliveries. The decision was made by a Pizza Power outlet in the town of Andergove after residents from Sunita Drive had been consistently abusive towards the young delivery staff. Once the black ban was put in place, shop manager Lillian Riley said she was verbally abused and hit by an angry customer from the street demanding to know why he had been refused delivery service over the phone. That case went before Mackay Magistrates Court and the offender was fined. Pizza Power takeaway shop has refused delivering pizza to residents who live on Sunita drive in Andergove in northern Queensland . Shop manager Lillian Riley said she was verbally abused and hit by an angry customer from the street demanding to know why he had been refused delivery service over the phone . Ms Riley, whose son owns the store, told the Daily Mercury that the man, who was ‘yelling and screaming’, pushed the heavy shop counter and attempted to punch her in the head but struck her arm instead. However, Sunita Drive was not the first street to be struck off the home delivery list with others in the area also banned due to the danger staff had been subjected to in the past. Staff also dealt with aggressive customers inside the store dubbing Tuesday evenings as ‘fight night’. Ms Riley’s son was subjected to a particularly vicious attack where two women verbally abused and attacked him for not taking a pizza to them outside. One woman got him down on the ground then kicked him in the groin more than once and also stomped on him, according to his mother. ‘We have to stand our ground,’ Ms Riley said. ‘We only ask for people to be polite but there are many loyal customers who are terrific, who make it worthwhile.’ She said business had dropped off at the shop because customers were intimidated by the anti -social behaviour of youths wandering around at night. Sunita Drive was not the first street to be struck off the home delivery list with other streets in the area also banned due to the danger staff had been subjected to in the past .","Pizza Power has banned deliveries to all homes in a Queensland street .

"By . Daniel Mills . Five New Zealand rugby union players are at the centre of a social media storm after images of them posing with dead animals in South Africa emerged on Facebook. Three All-Black stars feature among a gang of five Canterbury Crusaders players, outed by an African environmentalist group which posted four pictures of the players posing alongside a dead zebra, blesbok, a gemsbok and an eland. They feature Crusaders teammates Tyler Bleyendaal and Ben Funnell as well as All Blacks Tom Taylor, and Sam and George Whitelock. All five are pictured looking particularly proud of their animal conquests, smiling before the cameras and holding the horns of their prey. Sam Whitelock, centre front, poses with brother George (far left) Tyler Bleyendaal (second from left), Tom Taylor (third from right) and Ben Funnell (far right) during a wild game expedition in South Africa . Though not illegal, their activities have sparked widespread condemnation from the environmentalist group which posted them, and hundreds of other social media users. First published on the Landmark Organisation's Facebook page on Thursday, the images were believed to be taken during a mid-season hunting trip in April when the team was in South Africa, playing in Johannesburg and Bloemfontein. Crusaders chief executive Hamish Riach said the players had been 'performing a perfectly legal activity in their own time.' The images where uploaded by the Landmark Organisation, a group dedicated to animal conservation efforts in Africa, alongside a caption reading: 'When New Zealand rugby players have free time in South Africa, see what they get up to. Here are the Crusaders rugby players killing wildlife for laughs on a recent visit to South Africa,' the post said. The players have come under intense criticism for the images despite the fact they were hunting legally . The photos were reportedly taken in March and April when the team was playing in Johannesburg and Bloemfontein . Tom Taylor pictured alongside an eland, one of the non-endangered animals killed during a Crusaders hunting expedition in South Africa . All black lock Sam Whitelock went on the front foot to defend himself saying the dead animals were used as meat, with some of the players eating their own kill. He also defended brother and New Zealand teammate George, five eighths Tom Taylor and Tyler Bleyendaal and Hooker Ben Funnell. '[We] made sure we didn't shoot something for fun because that's not what we are about - it's something I feel very strongly about,' he told New Zealand's 3News. Asked if the South African photos were a bad look, he said it was the players' personal choice to partake in the activity, legally. The Crusader said he didn't eat the zebra meat, but others on the trip had. The club's chief executive Hamish Riach said the players took part in the 'perfectly legal activity' with  licensed guides - also pictured in the images. A New Zealand Rugby spokesman said the issue was a matter for the Crusaders and the national team would not provide comment in relation to the images. The public outcry comes following similar condemnation which was levelled at teenage Texan, Kendall Jones. The 19-year-old was photographed in front of dead hippos, elephants, lions and other beasts . She featured on Facebook with her hunting skills on full show, but drew the ire of game animal lovers who criticised the images. They were appalled by the teen's beaming social media and condemned Kendall's sick and depraved actions. Kendall Jones was recently blastered on social media for posting images of her alongside dead game animals .","The Canterbury Crusaders players were game hunting in South Africa .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Anthony Stallard, 24, of Portsmouth, admitted flapping his arms about and making ghost noises within earshot of mourners visiting graves . A man who flapped his arms about in a cemetery, making ghost noises within earshot of mourners visiting graves was fined and given a suspended prison sentence. Anthony Stallard, 24, was reported to police after he was seen throwing himself backwards and saying 'wooooooh' at Kingston Cemetery in his home town of Portsmouth, the city's magistrates heard. Shortly before that, Stallard, who is unemployed, was seen kicking a football at graves with a friend. Tim Concannon, prosecuting, told Portsmouth Magistrates' Court: 'While the football was going on, this defendant was effectively singing loudly and being disrespectful in among the graves. 'He was throwing himself backwards, waving his arms about and going 'woooooooh'. 'I'm assuming he was pretending to be a ghost.' Police arrested him and charged him with using threatening or abusive words or behaviour likely to cause distress. Stallard admitted the charge, and accepted that his behaviour could cause distress to grieving relatives. Denise Saunders, defending, said: 'He has accepted that his behaviour, if it had been outside of a cemetery, would not have been inappropriate. 'But inside a cemetery, while people are grieving for their loved ones, it might be.' Stallard committed the offence while subject to a 12-month conditional discharge which he'd received for a charge of harassment in January. He was also in breach of a suspended sentence for an offence of assault, which he had committed in August last year. He was fined £35, and made to pay a £20 victim surcharge and £20 court costs. An extra three months was added to his suspended sentence, which will now run for 15 months instead of the previous 12.  And if he commits a further offence that breaches this suspended sentence, he will face 12 weeks' imprisonment.

"By . Jennifer Smith . The sweltering British summer has led to an early apple harvest with fruit growers heralding one of the 'juiciest' crops on record. As well as apples, strawberries, plums and wheat are all being harvested weeks earlier than in 2013, after basking in glorious sunshine for the past two months. But with predicted showers and the tail end of a hurricane on the way, farm hands are getting to work before the scorching summer becomes a distant memory. Heavy rain is expected across much of the country today, with downpours and thundery storms predicted in central and northern regions as the tail end of Hurricane Bertha hurls towards the south coast. Scroll down for video . Farm hands pick Braeburn apples from  trees at Stocks Farm near Malvern in Worcestershire during one of the earliest fruit and crop harvests in living memory . Hot temperatures over long periods of time improves the taste and crunchiness of the fruit say farm hands at Stocks Farm who promise a 'juicy and delicious' produce . The soaring temperatures have brought the apple harvest forward by three weeks from last year with some varieties of the fruit already appearing on shop shelves . Strawberries (Three weeks early) Apples (three weeks early) Plums and cherries( two weeks early) Rapeseed oil (four weeks early) Wheat (two weeks early) While shoppers will have to wait until September to see some popular varieties of the fruit on shelves, others are ripe for the picking and have already popped up in local shops across the country. The mild spring and warmer sunny weather has meant good news for all types of growers, with stone fruit like plums and cherries, and pears all doing well. This summer was also the earliest oilseed rape harvest since the crop was first grown in the UK 30 years ago. Specialist grains such as Maris Otter Barley, used for real ale brewers, have also flourished. Adrian Barlow of English Apples and Pears said conditions had been kinder to apples than the last couple of years, which had been beset with poor weather, but it was too early to make comparison’s with 2011’s peak. 'Last year we had a very late crop, and we lost three to four weeks of varieties not being on the shelf at the supermarket so we lost that shelf space, and that made life difficult. 'But this year, all told, things are looking very promising for the coming season. 'Quality is extremely good, we’ve had a lot of sunny weather, meaning taste will be very good, and the texture and colour will be extremely good. English Apples and Pears said the high temperatures had been kinder to apples than in recent years but that it was too early to tell if this summer was better than the fruit's peak in 2011 . Braeburn apples at Stocks Farm in Suckley are being pulled from the trees in what is known as a 'late thinning' carried out to give other fruit a healthier chance of long-term growth . “As far as the shopper is concerned they’ll be very happy with the eating quality. 'The apples will have great crunchiness, lots of taste, and a good size.' Early varieties set to appear on shop shelves include Galmac, Delbar Estival, followed by Worcester Pearmain. Mr Barlow said chefs’ favourite the Bramley apple was also 'looking good', adding 'people will enjoy cooking with that variety this autumn'. At Stocks Farm in Suckley near Malvern in Worcestershire, the Capper family grow 100 acres of apples some of which go to supply HP Bulmer and are also used in the manufacture of Magners cider. Alison Capper who runs the farm with husband Richard just a few miles from the rolling Malvern Hills, said: 'On the whole it’s looking like a really nice crop and it’s all down to the weather. The sun rises over  Quantock Hills in Bridgewater, Somerset, this morning after a humid night.  Temperatures are expected to drop next week across the country . Most of the country will see  showers today after a long stint of warm, dry weather with thundery storms expected later in the weekend as Hurricane Bertha approaches . 'We've had lovely weather, we've had rain when we’ve wanted it,although some parts of the country have been drier than we’d have wanted. 'We've had some disease pressures which we always get with our climate, which might mean the skins aren't absolutely perfect in some cases. 'But generally-speaking, the crunch is going to be juicy and delicious.' While the good weather has brought about a record-breaking produce, sunny summer days will soon be a thing of the past with thrashing rain and thundery storms expected in some parts of the country this weekend. 'Today there are yellow warnings for the southeast, the midlands, the north west and northern Ireland  for rain. We're looking at maybe 20-33ml within those areas with chances of heavy, sharp downpour and thunder and lightning because of the humidity,' said Nicky Maxey, a spokesman for the Met Office. 'Tomorrow for most is better with areas of prolonged sunshine.' Temperatures in London will reach the mid 20s while northern regions will remain in the high teens. 'It'll be a nice pleasant day but people need to keep an eye on the forecast for Sunday which is when the weather really moves in,' she added. The storm could spread further north than previously expected with 50ml of rain predicted in some parts if it hits. 'It's still volatile at the moment, we're still watching and it may modify and change. It may miss us but it's very difficult to tell exactly where the storm might hit.' Craig . Woolhouse, Environment Agency Flood Risk Manager, said: 'Heavy rain on . Sunday may lead to localised surface water flooding in some parts of . England and Wales. 'On . Sunday and Monday a combination of high spring tides and strong . westerly winds bring a risk of large waves and spray and possible . flooding to the south west coast of England and along the Severn . Estuary. 'However, the forecast remains uncertain so we advise people to regularly check the flood risk situation over the next few days. 'If you're travelling to or from holiday then check your flood risk before setting off and don't drive through flood waters.' Temperatures will lower next week with cooler nights and less humidity on the way. 'There's certainly a cooler feel next week, we're not returning to the high 20s that we've enjoyed so far.'","Scorching summer temperatures have brought fruit and crop harvests forward by as much as three weeks .

"By . Candace Sutton . James Costello became one of the iconic figures of last year's Boston bombing tragedy when he was photographed staggering from the blast peppered with shrapnel, his clothes shredded and his legs burned. AP photographer Kenshin Okubo captured the April 15, 2013 image of what Costello later described as 'one of the worst days of my life, suffering not only physical injuries of my own but the emotional difficulties when I learned about my friends' - three of whom each lost a leg in the tragedy. Now Mr Costello's horrific experience has been used by The Daily Telegraph to mock Mike Carlton, sacked columnist of the rival Sydney Morning Herald in a tit-for-tat media feud. It comes after weeks of News Corporation papers The Daily Telegraph and The Australian accusing the Herald of publishing insensitive anti-Semitic cartooons and columns on the Gaza conflict. First edition blunder: This is the Daily Telegraph's first edition printed on Thursday, August 7, featuring the photoshopped image of Boston bombing victim, James Costello - who became one of the iconic figures of the terrorist attack tragedy -  on the right hand side of Page 11. The image shows the stricken body of Mr Costello as he staggered around dazed in shredded clothing with severe burns to his legs and shrapnel wounds. The paper replaced his face with that of Sydney Morning Herald columnist Mike Carlton's, complete with an Arab headdress . The original: This is the real photograph taken of 30-year-old James Costello as he staggered from the blast of the Boston bombing on April 15, 2013, his body peppered with shrapnel, his right leg severely burned and his mind dazed and fearful that he was going to die. The Daily Telegraph used this image of the terrorist attack victim in its pages on Thursday to attack a rival publication . Social media users condemned the Telegraph for using the agonising photograph of Mr Costello in his darkest hour, topping it with an image of Carlton wearing Middle Eastern headdress. On Twitter, one reader said '@NewsCorp's Sydney @DailyTelegraph depicted a Boston bombing victim as a 'terrorist'. They think this is funny'. The Telegraph published the offending image in its first edition on Thursday, August 7. By its second edition, the newspaper had replaced the image of Mr Costello's body with the torso of a man wearing a buttoned brown suit coat and shirt. The photoshop blunder comes after an attack by another News Corp newspaper on its Fairfax Media rival over a Sydney Morning Herald cartoon on the Gaza conflict, which had deeply offended the Australian Jewish community. On Monday, Fairfax editor Darren Goodsir apologised for a cartoon by Glen Le Lievre, which had depicted a Jewish man in an armchair pointing a remote control towards a building erupting in a bombing attack. Whoops, take two: The Daily Telegraph removed the photograph of Boston bombing victim James Costello from the photoshopped image, replacing his injured torso with that of a man buttoned up in a brown suit, but keeping Mike Carlton's head and the Yasser Arafat style headdress . Unreserved apology: Telegraph editor Paul Whittaker . The cartoon had accompanied a column written by Sydney media commentator Mike Carlton, who likened Israeli attacks on Palestinians in Gaza to 'genocide'. Carlton was criticised for being anti-Semitic and resigned on Wednesday from the Sydney Morning Herald. The Daily Telegraph covered the resignation in its first edition the following day with the photoshopped image of James Costello, which featured on a page with a mock masthead of its rival entitled 'The Sydney Warring Herald'. On Twitter, @Show Patience responded to the image, saying 'Talk about a tabloid news organization with mistruths and false depictions. shame'. Also on Twitter, @Brendan_E said, 'this is disgusting' and @glenpen60 described it as 'Absolutely disgraceful'. Mr Carlton told Daily Mail Australia that the photoshopped image of the Boston bombing victim was 'a new low in bad taste'. 'It's a third rate photoshop anyway and the Telegraph is no longer a newspaper, it's a comic,' he said .'But to use the victim of a terrorist attack, it stinks. It is vile and scummy, but [from] the Daily Telegraph, not surprising.' Following the Boston bombing, the victim James Costello revealed that moments before the iconic photograph of him staggering down the street was taken, he had just removed two rusty nails from his stomach and had thought, momentarily, that he might be dying. Not impressed: Twiiter has erupted with protests from readers about the use of the iconic photograph a Boston Marathon terrorist bombing victim James Costello (right side of the Twitter image) in a photoshopped image (left) with media commentator Mike Carlton's face an an Arab headdress . Twitter user @glenpen60 thought the use of Mr Costello's photograph in a Daily Telegraph attack on its rival 'disgraceful' Social media users are unhappy about the Daily Telegraph's use of the Boston bombing victim's image in its attack on the Sydney Morning's Herald's coverage of the Gaza conflict in a cartoon and column which were critical of Israeli attacks on Palestinians . Happily, during his recovery Mr Costello met a nurse, Krista D’Agostino, nine months after the tragedy the pair became engaged. The Daily Telegraph's editor Paul Whittaker responded to questions from Daily Mail Australia about the issue with an emailed statement, saying he was not aware of the image being published in his newspaper. 'The photoshopped image was an amalgam of different images put together during the art production process,' Mr Whittaker said. 'I was unaware that that particular image had been partially used. It is an inadvertent but regrettable mistake for which The Daily Telegraph apologises unreservedly.' The ongoing conflict in Gaza city (pictured, above) is at the centre of the issue which the Daily Telegraph sought to photoshop an image of Boston marathon terrorist attack victim James Costello, causing a storm of protest from readers on Twitter .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A Ferrari-driving killer who thought he had 'got away with murder' before plundering the bank accounts of his victim's dead parents was today jailed for 32 years - after being caught out by a bank clerk who spotted his fraudulent signature. Donald Graham, 60, murdered his heiress lover Janet Brown in 2005 before stealing from her parents' accounts to fund his lavish taste in cars and to buy his second mistress a home. He also spun a cruel web of lies to make . her elderly parents Eric and Olive Brown believe their daughter - whose . body has never been found - was still alive. Donald Graham, 60, has been jailed for 32 years for murdering Janet . Brown, 45 and hiding her body, before plundering her elderly parents' bank accounts to fund a 'flashy' lifestyle . But he was caught four . years later when a bank clerk at Skipton Building Society grew . suspicious of the signature used on Mr Brown's bank account. Ms Brown went missing before she was due to go on holiday to France in 2005 . During his sentencing today, Mr . Justice Openshaw said Graham had been posing as Mr Brown in a bid to transfer money out of the account when the employee became suspicious. The police began investigating when the . bank branch tried to write to Mr Brown about the fraudulent signature . and realised he was dead. That realisation led to a fraud investigation - which soon turned into a murder inquiry. Jailing him at Newcastle Crown Court for 32 years, the judge said Graham must 'pay the price' for the terrible crime. He said: 'All these offences . were made possible only by the murder and he used the money to fund his . extravagant and flashy lifestyle. 'The defendant has been convicted of a terrible offence, and must now pay the price.' The murder took place after Graham and Mr Brown, who had been lovers for about eight years, arranged to go on holiday together to France in 2005. But at the last minute, Graham pulled out of the holiday, pretending his wife was ill and Miss Brown decided to go alone. It was around the time of her planned departure on June 17 that she was murdered. Today, . the judge said Graham must have been 'astonished' when her parents fell . for his claims that their daughter was still alive. The judge said: 'As the months and years passed he must have come to believe he had indeed got away with murder.' Graham went on to befriend Ms Brown's parents. When they died, he plundered their bank accounts, despite their wish that their estates should go to Guide Dogs for the Blind if their daughter died before them. They died in 2007 and 2008 respectively, believing their only daughter was working in a bank in Switzerland. Just before she disappeared, Miss Brown transferred £300,000 into her married lover’s account. He went on to strip another £285,000 from the Brown family, the judge heard, and tried but failed to get hold of their £300,000 farm. Graham, who lived on a 40-acre property in Sparty Lea, south west Northumberland, hid her body so well it has never been found. Graham was caught out after a clerk at a Skipton Building Society branch grew suspicious of the signature given by Graham on Miss Brown's father's bank account. Her suspicion led to the murder investigation . Graham gained the trust of Ms Brown's parents and plundered their bank . accounts after their deaths so he could buy 'flash' cars, including this Ferrari . The judge said: 'He was once a JCB digger driver, he could have disposed of her in some deeply-dug pit or put her down one of the many mine shafts in the area, or buried her in some wild and remote place. 'That he disposed of her body is obviously an aggravating factor.' The murder was driven by financial gain, the judge said, which was another aggravating feature. Graham was sentenced concurrently for his 'audacious' frauds on his victim’s parents, which he committed after gaining their confidence. Despite repeated searches by police, Ms Brown's body has never been . found. Her parents Eric and Olive Brown died believing that their only daughter was working for a Swedish bank . He began to do Mr Brown’s shopping and slowly gained his trust and confidence, making regular visits to their home at Plane Trees Farm, Lowgate, Hexham, Northumberland. This meant he was able to gain access to all Miss Brown’s bank documents and personal affairs, as well as Mr Brown’s cheque book and details of his pension. Even after both parents died Mr Graham went on to arrange their funerals without telling relatives. But he did obtain a death certificate which, with all the other information he had gained, meant he went on to strip their estate of all their assets through false telephone calls and false withdrawal slips. He was badly in debt and was struggling to fund the finance agreements on the sports cars, including a Ferrari, which he loved.","Donald Graham, 60, was found guilty of murdering lover Janet Brown, 45 .

The canopy got into difficulty over Bridgeyate in South Gloucestershire after an eight-mile flight from Bristol’s Ashton Court on Thursday evening. It was one of more than 100 taking part in the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta this weekend - where more than 500,000 people are expected over the weekend. Motorists screeched to a halt as the balloon rapidly descended - prompting Aaron Hanks to start filming. Scroll down for video .

Deflated descent: The pilot seems to be trying to land the canopy, but gets into trouble and ends up getting stuck, before setting down in a field . His film shows the balloon hit the lamppost, then a tree, before sinking beside the pole and coming to a stop near the road. Throughout this weekend, balloons will be ascending from Ashton Court Estate at dawn and dusk, . taking in glorious views of the city including Isambard Kingdom . Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge.

Speaking at the mass ascent this morning, organiser Ben Hardy described the sight as 'fantastic'. 'It has been a brilliant morning, we had almost 130 balloons up and the weather conditions were perfect.

"By . Sarah Harris . Cheating technique: 'Roget-ing' involves students swapping synonyms from the Roget's Thesaurus to cover up plagiarism . ‘Sinister buttocks’, ‘Herculean liturgies’ and ‘bequest mazes’ may not be the phrases Peter Mark Roget expected to be created when he launched his world-famous thesaurus. But a university lecturer has identified a new trend of ‘Roget-ing’ among students – the creation of absurd terms through ill-considered use of Roget’s Thesaurus. They are using the technique, involving extensive synonym swapping, in a bid to hide plagiarism - but are producing baffling sentences as a result. Chris Sadler, principal lecturer in business information systems at Middlesex University, suggested the new word after spotting several ‘Rogetisms’ in a students’ work. After reading that ‘common mature musicians (and) recent liturgy providers are looking to satisfy…Herculean personalised liturgies’, he attempted to discover the source of the sentence’s origin. He said: ‘Even if the sentence had made sense, it seemed out of place in (a paper on) business information systems and I was motivated to seek out the source.’ Mr Sadler eventually located the original text, which read: ‘the current big players and new service providers are looking to supply more powerful personalised services’. He told the Times Higher Education magazine he had ‘seen quite a bit’ of ‘Roget- ing’, which he defined as ‘disguising plagiarism by substituting synonyms, one word at a time with no attempt to understand either the source or target text’. As a result, the phrase ‘left behind’ was converted into ‘sinister buttocks’ by one student. To ‘stay ahead of the competition’ became ‘to tarry fore of the conflict’, while ‘new market leaders’ was turned into ‘modern store guides’. Other new phrases coined by students via ‘Roget-ing’ include ‘bequest mazes’ – a rough translation of ‘legacy networks’ which describe web networks using outdated computer formats. Mr Sadler entered the blunders into the Times Higher Education exam howlers competition. He said: ‘This was a sad business for me and especially (for) my student, but I do think ‘sinister buttocks’ deserves a prize.’ The winner of the annual contest was John Milliken, lecturer in education at the University of Ulster for his student’s claim that ‘the [hole in the] ozone layer was caused by a*******s. Dr Milliken said: ‘He probably meant aerosols, but then…maybe not.’ His second student blooper from this season’s marking season was a student’s declaration in a paper on vehicle emissions that ‘in future all cars (will) be fitted with Catholic converters’. Confusion: Chris Slater, a lecturer at Middlesex University, coined the term after a number of his students handed in work with baffling sentences . Verity Brack, information technology programme director at the University of Sheffield, entered the statement that Google was ‘one of the two main suppositories of data in the world’. Meanwhile, Josephine Kelly, a lecturer in business and government at Aston University, was intrigued to read that the Coalition government had a ‘toff stance on tax avoidance’. She noted that the student actually meant ‘tuff’ (tough). Peter Mark Roget, a British physician and lexicographer, published the Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases (Roget’s Thesaurus) in 1852. He was obsessed with list-making from an early age and his work on the thesaurus arose partly from his attempt to battle depression.","Chris Sadler from Middlesex University says students are 'Roget-ing'

"By . Lucy Crossley . Victim: Police have warned members of the public to carry personal alarms after cyclist Aulton Thomas Rogers was stabbed to death in a 'frenzied' attack . Police have warned members of the public to carry personal alarms after a cyclist was stabbed to death in a frenzied attack as he rode home from work. Aulton Thomas Rogers - known to friends and colleagues as Tom - was found lying alongside a cycle path, having been stabbed repeatedly. Detectives hunting the 60-year-old's killer admitted they had no idea why Mr Rogers, who lived alone in Swindon, Wiltshire, was murdered. Officers believe he was ambushed by a stranger in the unprovoked attack. After his body was discovered on Thursday and with the knifeman still at large, police have drafted in extra . officers to patrol the streets and advised people to carry a personal attack alarm. 'My message to the . public is to make sure people know where you are going and what time you . are due back home,' said local policing commander Superintendent Andrew Carr. 'Make sure you have got a mobile phone and it has . credit on it. Make sure you are aware of your surroundings and carry a personal alarm if you can.' Supt. Carr said people who felt . concerned for their safety should call 999 immediately and not worry . about the possibly wasting police time. Mr Rogers had left the Woodlands Edge Public House where he worked just before 10.30pm on Thursday. Police were called by a shocked passer-by who stumbled across the scene shortly before midnight. Mr Rogers was found lying to the right-hand side of the cycle path and his bicycle was on the ground nearby. Detective Chief Inspector Sean Memory, who is leading the hunt for Mr Rogers's killer, said it was a 'horrendous scene' and that the victim has stood 'no chance.' A post mortem examination confirmed that he died as a result of multiple stab wounds. DCI Memory said: 'Mr Rogers was not known to police and there is no apparent motive for the attack. 'We continue to work tirelessly on the case to identify those responsible and would ask anyone who knew Mr Rogers to contact us. This will help us to build a bigger picture of his lifestyle,' added the senior detective. 'He worked at the Woodlands Edge Public house in Midwinter Close, Swindon and we know that he left the pub shortly before 10.30pm on Thursday, June 26, 2014. 'I would particularly like to hear from anyone who saw Mr Rogers on Thursday night, any information will be dealt with in the strictest confidence.' Work: Mr Rogers had left the Woodlands Edge Public House where he worked just before 10.30pm on Thursday. His body was found less than an hour and a half later . Mr Rogers, who lived alone in Swindon, was described as white, approximately 5ft 9ins tall and of very slim build with grey hair. He was wearing black trousers, a black polo shirt and a khaki hoodie. He had black trainers and was carrying a dark blue bag. It was revealed that the spot where he was found is known locally as 'muggers alley' because a number of recent violent offences had taken place there. Last month a 24-year-old woman suffered serious injuries in the underpass after she was approached from behind by an unknown male who landed a single blow to the back of her head. Forensic officers wearing white boiler suits were yesterday continuing to examine the scene and had closed a large section of the cycle path off. Fingertip searches were being made of the cycle route as the killer was believed to have walked his victim's blood along the path. The attacker was also believed to have been injured in the attack. CCTV footage from the surrounding area was being meticulously reviewed by specialist officers as they probed more than 60 leads about the murder.","Aulton Thomas Rogers, 60, was found dead alongside a cycle track .

"By . Steve Doughty . It has become an integral part of everyday life for so many Britons. But six million adults never use the internet or go online only rarely, official figures revealed yesterday. It may come as a shock to those who regularly buy goods online and email friends and family around the globe, but one in eight adults have little interest in discovering the online world and believe it holds little that can benefit them. Scroll down for video . Internet use among the elderly: Around half of people over 65 do not even send or receive emails . According to the estimates, there are four million UK homes which have no internet connection and where no one uses a mobile phone connected to the web. More than half of such families described the internet as ‘not useful’ and ‘not interesting’. The level of resistance to the latest communications technology was revealed in a study by the Office for National Statistics. It said only one in 100 homes not connected to the internet are off-line because broadband is not available in their area. The report, based on the state-run Opinions and Lifestyles survey of 1,000 Britons every month, found that 38million people use the internet every day. Rising daily internet use: Nearly three-quarters of the population buy goods or services over the internet . Nearly seven out of ten of those do so using their mobile phone. 'Of the four million households without internet access, the majority said they did not have a connection because they did not need it' Office for National Statistics . A broadband internet connection has increasingly been seen as a basic utility, and nearly three-quarters of the population buy goods or services over the internet. The most popular online purchases are clothes, with almost half of all adults buying them from internet retailers. The report said: ‘The internet has changed the way people go about their daily lives. Over three-quarters of adults used the internet every day.’ It found that nine out of ten people aged 16 to 24 use social media, and the same proportion of 25 to 34-year-olds use the internet for buying goods and services, while seven out of ten of that group use online banking. Internet activities: The report is based on the state-run Opinions and Lifestyles monthly survey of 1,000 Britons . In contrast, around half of people over 65 do not even send or receive emails. The study found that 6.5million people had not used the internet in the three months before they were interviewed, or had never used it. ‘Of the four million households without internet access, the majority said they did not have a connection because they did not need it,’ the report said. But the ONS also suggested that some people who do not have an internet connection may be worried about whether they can use a computer. Increasing figure: Almost all homes with children - 96 per cent - have an internet connection, the report said . The report added: ‘While this may suggest many households without the internet are actively choosing not to subscribe, there is still a large and important minority  who state that barriers prevent them  from connecting.’ Nearly a third of those who did not have a home internet connection said that this was because of ‘lack of skills’. Almost all homes with children – 96 per cent – have an internet connection, the report said. Among those who had never used the internet – 8 per cent of the population – were 28 per cent of retired people, and 8 per cent of those aged over 55.","Six million adults never use the internet or go online only rarely .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Two officers are to be questioned by detectives after an anti-BNP protestor claimed police broke her leg during a Unite Against Facism rally in London. Amy Jowett, an English language teacher from east London, alleges that an officer kicked her three times with such force that it broke her leg during the rally in Parliament Square. Now the Metropolitan Police has confirmed two officers are to be interviewed as part of the investigation into the alleged assault during the Unite Against Facism demonstration on June 1, last year. Probe: Two officers are to be questioned by detectives after Amy Jowett, pictured being treated by police medics, claimed an officer broke her leg during a Unite Against Facism rally in London . Ms Jowett, 35, claims she received life changing injuries during the rally, having had to endure seven operations and warned by doctors that by the time she is 45 she will need to have a knee replacement. She had been one of around 1,000 anti-fascists who blocked a road outside Parliament to stop BNP supporters marching to the Cenotaph in Whitehall. Officers are alleged to have started pushing the anti-fascist demonstrators back in the direction of Whitehall, telling the protestors they were in breach of the Public Order Act. Ms Jowett claims that as police approached to arrest a man she had linked arms with, another officer kicked her left leg - forcing her knee in the opposite direction. Injury: Ms Jowett claims that as police approached to arrest a man she had linked arms with, another officer kicked her left leg - forcing her knee in the opposite direction . She suffered a compound fracture and was taken to St Thomas’ Hospital after being treated by police medics at the scene. A Met spokesman said the police investigation was being overseen by watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and that a file would be prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service. 'As part of the ongoing investigation into the incident involving Amy Jowett two MPS officers will be interviewed,' she said. 'The investigation, which is being supervised by the IPCC, has involved extensive work to try to ascertain what happened. This has included specialist work on video footage to seize images frame-by-frame.' The spokesman, who said police are still appealing for witnesses to the alleged incident to come forward added: 'Once the interviews are complete a report will be compiled for the CPS.' On June 28 last year, Ms Jowett made a complaint that a police officer had injured her. 'Officers from the Directorate of Professional Standards are investigating and as part of enquiries have been appealing for people who were at the demonstration at around 4pm that day and saw what happened to contact them,' said the spokesman. 'To remind people at the time the injury was received efforts were being made to move demonstrators away from Parliament Square. Warnings were being issued and the crowd was surging. 'A number of officers have been interviewed who were in the vicinity at the time. 'The IPCC has been informed of the complaint and are supervising the investigation. 'The MPS is taking the allegation extremely seriously and is appealing to anyone who has any information that could aid the investigation to come forward.' Ms Jowett has only recently gone back to work teaching immigrants in Hackney. 'I can only hope these concluding stages . will be conducted as quickly as possible and that the man who assaulted . me will be brought to justice,' she told the Evening Standard. She added: 'The last year of my life has been . completely consumed with recovery from the assault, now my priority is . doing everything I can to prolong the need for the inevitable knee . replacement surgery.' Felix Couchman of legal firm TV Edwards, who is representing Ms Jowett, said: 'It remains of vital importance that the . perpetrator of the assault on Amy, who was taking part as a peaceful . demonstrator and who sustained life-changing injuries as a result, is . fully held to account.'

"By . Daniel Mills . A collection of brightly coloured lights streaking across Australia's southern skies have been impressing sky watchers in Tasmania in recent months. The 'Southern Lights' can also be seen from Southern Victoria, New Zealand and Antarctica usually between March and September. It is the southern Hemisphere's equivalent to the Northern Lights. The mesmerising display of light-filled patterns, known as the Aurora Australis, is the result of a combination of natural forces occurring some 100km above the earth's surface. The streaks of greens, purples, reds and yellows are formed inside the Aurora Oval. This is where electrons emanating from the sun and gases in the upper atmosphere collide. The collisions produce electrical discharges which energise atoms of oxygen and nitrogen, causing the release of the multicoloured light seen in these pictures. Each colour is representative of a particular distance from the earth's surface, and the reason why Tasmanians are so best placed to view the spectacular light show is because of the state's location to the Earth's South Magnetic Pole. The best place to see an aurora is away from major urban light sources, on a clear, moonless night, when the Milky Way is clearly visible. There is no particular time frame of when Auroras occur, however the phenomenon could be as frequent as  once a month over the next two to three years as the sun cycle reaches its 12 year peak . Auroras usually last several hours, and are best viewed on clear and cold nights and can bee seen most prominently from polar latitudes . The average Height of an Aurora Australis event is between 50 to 100km above the earth and the most common colours are Pale green and pink. The Most common shapes are . spiral curtains, arcs, or streamers . The best place to see an Aurora Australis is in southern Victoria, Tasmania, Antarctica and New Zealand . During periods of high activity, a single auroral storm can produce one trillion watts of electricity with a current of one million amps . The global distribution of auroral activity is an oval around the magnetic poles in both hemispheres. The other major light phenomenon is the Aurora Borealis which occurs in the Northern Hemisphere . To see the lights at their best you need to get clear of city lights and have a good view to the south. The best time to see them is an hour or two either side of midnight. The light displays begin as a red glow on the horizon and can rise up to 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon, taking on a more familiar green colour . Like Tasmania in the south, the best places to watch the Northern Lights (in North America) are in the northwestern parts of Canada, particularly the Yukon, Nunavut, Northwest Territories and Alaska. Hobart is the best place to view the lights because of its position in relation to magnetic south . The Aurora Australis is caused by plasma particles from the sun (part of the solar wind), which enter the atmosphere and collide with electrically charged particles .","The Aurora Australis or 'Southern Lights' is best seen in parts of Tasmania on a clear and cold night's sky .

"By . Dan Ripley . Follow @@Ripley_77 . Nottingham Forest are on the brink of losing more first team stars with Jamie Mackie and Simon Cox holding discussions with Reading on Tuesday over a double move. Manager Stuart Pearce reacted angrily on Monday following the decision to sell Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow to Newcastle, claiming the moves away from the City Ground were against his wishes. Mackie was a crucial component of the Championship side last term after joining for £1million from QPR, playing 49 times in total. Royal approval: Simon Cox (left) and Jamie Mackie have held talks over a move to Reading . Cox arrived from West Brom for £2million in 2012 and along with Mackie had become a crucial part of the Forest attack in the last year. A move to Reading would see Cox play in a second spell at the Madejski Stadium having begun his career with the Royals in 2005, making just a handful of substitute appearances before leaving for Swindon three years later. For Pearce, the loss of two forwards will be a major blow ahead of the new Championship campaign, and will only add fuel to the fire in his rift with club owner Fawaz Al Hasawi. Although the departure of Lascelles and Darlow will see the duo loaned back to the club for the 2014/15 campaign, the former Under 21 boss was unhappy at the sales worth around £7million. Dispute: Fawaz Al Hasawi has hit back at Stuart Pearce's claims he was left in the dark at Nottingham Forest . Stars: But Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow were sold on the cheap to Premier League side Newcastle United . 'The players were sold without my sanction', Pearce said. 'I can't defend the decision to sell them because it wasn't my decision. I could sit here and lie and dress it up a little bit and cover the tracks of one or two individuals, but I'm not prepared to do that.' However, Hasawi responded claiming: 'I would love nothing more than to hold on to our best young players. I gave both Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles lengthy new contracts in August 2013 and March 2014 respectively. 'The manager and I openly discussed the proposed sale of Karl and Jamaal and he was aware of the negotiations throughout.'","Reading set for double swoop after  talks with Simon Cox and Jamie Mackie .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Fierce floods have forced almost 13,000 from their homes in the World Cup host state of Parana as it prepares to host its first game on Monday. Officials from the southern Brazilian state's civil defence department said flooding had struck 132 cities, including the state capital of Curitiba - a host city for the football tournament. It is currently unclear if flooding has affected the Arena da Baixada stadium, which will host the first of its four games on Monday when Iran take on Nigeria. Scroll down for video . Fast flowing: Heavy rain has led to people being evacuated from their homes in World Cup host state Parana, while the Iguazu Falls (pictured) is flowing faster than ever . Record breaking: People gather to see the Iguazu Falls, where a record breaking water flow of 45.7 million litres per second has been recorded . Host ground: It is unclear if flooding has affected the Arena da Baixada stadium, which will host the first of its four games on Monday when Iran take on Nigeria . The World Cup Organising Committee has not yet commented on whether the stadium, which has a retractable roof, will be ready for its opening game. It is also due to host matches between Honduras and Ecuador, Australia and the defending champions Spain, and Algeria versus Russia. Cup holders Spain have been using Curitiba as their base throughout the month-long tournament, but appeared to be training as normal - unlike the English team who seemed surprised to be accompanied by armed guards as they made their way to their training camp in Rio De Janeiro. At least nine people have been killed by the floods so far and a further 30 are reported to have been injured, according to Parana's civil defense department.

Fierce: The water at Iguazu is flowing times above its normal rate and has surpassed the previous record of 35 million litres per second, set in 1983 . Danger: At least nine people have been killed by the floods so far and a further 30 are reported to have been injured, according to Parana's civil defense department . Union members voted last night to temporarily suspend the strike they began last week, but also decided they would take a new vote tomorrow to determine whether to resume the stoppage. Meanwhile, a union representing subway workers in Rio de Janeiro said members would vote later today on whether they would strike. The actions are a severe threat for World Cup fans because the subways in both cities are being counted on as the main way for spectators to get to the stadiums. Union officials in Sao Paulo met the state government yesterday afternoon but failed to reach agreement. Subway workers went on strike last Thursday and threw already congested traffic into chaos in the city of 11 million. Unrest: Striking subway workers and members of the MTST (Homeless Workers' Movement), demonstrate in Sao Paulo . Risk: Striking subway workers in Sao Paulo have gone back to work today, but the union involved has warned they could walk out again on Thursday - the day the city's Arena Corinthians hosts the opening match between Brazil and Croatia . Talks: Union members voted last night to temporarily suspend the strike they began last week, but also decided they would take a new vote tomorrow to determine whether to resume the stoppage . The union's general secretary Alex Fernandes said it is giving the government two days to give jobs back to 42 workers who were fired over the strike. Sao Paulo union members clashed with police yesterday when they tried to hold a rally in a central station. Officers used tear gas and muscle to push the strikers out of the station. Altino Prazeres, president of the union leading the strike, said almost all of the 8,000 subway employees had been off the job. Marching with workers on a central street, he said they were not interested in disrupting the World Cup. 'I love soccer. I support our national team. The point is not to stop the cup,' he said.

Under protection: England manager Roy Hodgson heads to training, complete with the team's military escort . Teachers remain on strike in Rio and routinely block streets with rallies. Police in several cities have gone on strike, but are back at work now. There has also been a steady drumbeat of anti-government protests across Brazil blasting spending on the World Cup and demanding improvements in woeful public services. The protests that began last year have diminished in size but not in frequency, and they have sometimes disrupted traffic. However, one of the movements behind recent demonstrations against the World Cup said it would not stage protests during the month-long event. Guilherme Boulos, head of the Homeless Workers Movement, said the government had agreed to its demands for low-cost housing, and had promised to build 2,000 houses on land invaded last month by 5,000 people two miles from the Sao Paulo stadium. The movement had threatened to stage massive demonstrations during the World Cup if its demands were not met.","State capital Curitiba due to host match between Iran and Nigeria .

Sean Finnegan, 23, was with three friends in a nightclub when he witnessed a brawl on the dance floor and went in to calm things. But he was attacked himself, and now has no vision in his left eye and doctors have told him it may have to be removed altogether. Sean Finnegan is now blind in one eye after the horrific glass attack at a Bristol nightclub put him in hospital . Mr Finnegan pictured left and right in hospital in the days following the glass attack, which left him with a huge wound across his cheek and blinded him in his left eye - all because he tried to break up a fight at a nightclub . Antix nightclub in Bristol, where Mr Finnegan tried to break up a fight but was knocked unconscious himself . The incident occurred when Mr Finnegan was at Antix nightclub in Bristol. He said: 'I had been to a few bars in Park Street before heading to Antix. 'Me and my friend were at the bar getting some drinks when I saw some pushing happening on the dance floor. 'I went over to try and get my friend away and break up the fight when I was hit over the back of the head and knocked unconscious. 'The next thing I remember was being sat on a chair in the corner of the club with security staff performing first aid on me.' Police were called to the scene and Mr Finnegan, from Hanham, was rushed to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. This gruesome image shows the deep cut caused by the vicious attack . Speaking from his hospital bed today, Mr Finnegan added: 'I have no vision in my left eye and doctors say there is no pressure in it. 'If they can’t work out why they might have to remove my eye all together. 'I feel OK about it - obviously I am in quite a lot of pain but there are much worse things that can happen to people. 'I currently work as a builder so obviously losing my sight will probably affect my job, but I will have to take each day as it comes.' The gruesome picture has since been shared on social media, with friends and family calling for anyone with any information to come forward and give a statement. Avon and Somerset Police, who have been working closely with him since the attack, arrested a 24-year-old man on suspicion of assault. A police spokesperson said: 'We were called to reports of an assault at around 2.30am on Sunday July 27 in Park Street.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . UKIP could take as many as five seats from Labour at the next election, a new study reveals in a devastating blow for Ed Miliband. Some senior Labour figures had counted on UKIP eating into Tory support, making it easier for Mr Miliband to take power in May next year. But frontbenchers including Gloria de Piero and Alison Seabeck are among those at risk of being ousted by Nigel Farage's party, according to Matthew Goodwin of the University of Nottingham. Scroll down for video . UKIP leader Nigel Farage could eat into Labour support in key areas, a new study has warned Ed Miliband (right) The 2015 general election is expected to be close, with a high chance of another hung parliament, so every seat counts. Polls put Labour narrowly ahead, putting Mr Miliband on course to lead the biggest parliament if not form an overall majority. Dr Goodwin identified the Labour seats most at risk from the rise of UKIP by looking at census data as well as results in elections dating from 2010 to this year's European Parliament and local polls. He took into account the 'Ukip plus vote' of people who backed other Eurosceptic parties in the Euro-elections. Labour seats which are vulnerable include shadow women's minister Gloria de Piero's Ashfield, constituency in Nottinghamshire. Ms de Piero said: 'We are a former mining community and we remember what Thatcher did to our pits, so I will be campaigning against Ukip because we don't want a party led by a man who wants to 'keep the flame of Thatcherism alive' in Ashfield.' Labour's shadow women's minister Gloria de Piero is the most high profile frontbencher who is said to be at risk in her Ashfield constituency in Nottinghamshire . Labour MP Austin Mitchell in standing down in Great Grimsby, where UKIP has selected former Tory candidate Victoria Ayling to fight the seat . Shadow defence minister Alison Seabeck, in Plymouth Moor View and former minister Ian Austin in Dudley North are both at risk. Great Grimsby is a key target for UKIP, which has selected controversial former Tory candidate Victoria Ayling to contest the seat. And Rotherham, where UKIP came second in a by-election in 2012, could also be lost by Labour, Dr Goodwin suggested. He told The Independent: 'Labour is divided about how seriously it should take Ukip. Those in Ed Miliband's team who cling to the misguided view that Nigel Farage's party is not a threat should look at the Labour seats that are most vulnerable to this insurgency. 'The Labour seats that emerge as top prospects for UKIP share several features; they are typically over 95 per cent white British; have large numbers of pensioners and voters with only GCSE or no qualifications; and in 2014 saw Ukip win the popular vote. But it is the local political context that will be crucial at next year's first-past-the-post election.' While many Labour seats have 'ideal conditions' for a Ukip challenge, they have healthy majorities which will be difficult to overturn, particularly where there are well-embedded incumbent MPs with experience of fighting off the British National Party, like Stoke's Joan Walley, said Dr Goodwin. He added: 'Ukip need seats that not only have lots of receptive voters but also favourable political conditions where the vote is split across the main parties, making a third party insurgency possible.' At the weekend Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls admitted the party cannot win next year's election unless it becomes tougher on immigration. In an interview with the Telegraph, the Shadow Chancellor said: 'Polls in previous elections have always suggested that parties like Ukip rise and then fall back on election day. 'I think it would be very foolish of people to [assume] that's going to happen this time round. 'If we're going to win the election, which I think we can, on jobs and the NHS and standing up for people on low and middle incomes against an out-of-touch government, then we cannot look out of touch on an issue that people really care about.' David Cameron and Nick Clegg have both been forced to react to the rise of UKIP, with the Lib Dem leader (right) giving a speech on immigration this week . The rise of UKIP has also unnerved the Lib Dems, who lost all but one of their MEPs in May's European elections. Nick Clegg will tomorrow us a speech to speak out in favour of the free movement of European citizens but seek reforms to ensure that fewer Eastern Europeans move here if more countries are admitted to the EU in future. He will say: 'I want to be unequivocal: freedom of movement between EU member states is a good thing. 'It's a cornerstone of European integration; a right enjoyed by around one and a half million British citizens who live on the other side of the Channel. 'It is necessary in order to be part of the world's biggest single market where goods and people can flow between nations. 'Those who wish to undo it should be careful what they wish for: the blow to UK prosperity would be immense.' But he said freedom of movement needed reform to make it clear it was a freedom to work, not a freedom to claim benefits.","Study finds Labour is also vulnerable to the surge in support for UKIP .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Grant Shapps accused Nick Clegg of hypocrisy yesterday as he insisted the government still intended to reduce migration to ‘tens of thousands’ a year. The Tory party chairman denied the Liberal Democrat leader’s claim that his party had secretly dropped their pledge to reduce net migration less than 100,000. In an interview, he said the target ‘remained party policy’. Last year net migration was 212,000. Scroll down for video . Hit back: Grant Shapps has hit back at Nick Clegg's claims the party's migration figures are based on a 'fallacy' Mr Clegg used a speech in London yesterday to accuse the Conservatives of being ‘completely fixated with the net migration target’ which he said was based on a ‘fallacy’. He accused the Conservatives of failing to carry out basic border checks to make sure illegal immigrants and those overstaying on their visas were caught. And in a significant change of tone called for much tighter controls on immigration from new EU states, saying people had lost faith in the government’s assurances following the arrival of 60,000 Bulgarians and Romanians. He suggested giving EU member states the right to impose controls ‘if people begin arriving in numbers too big for our society to absorb successfully’. But Mr Shapps told LBC radio that it was Mr Clegg who had been standing in the way of the Coalition taking action to rein in immigration. On the immigration target he said: ‘It remains the policy, it has not changed. We do want to see immigration reduced to tens of thousands’. Accusations: The Tory chairman reacted by saying Nick Clegg gas blocked calls to rein in EU migration . He accused the Lib Dem leader of performing a ‘u turn’ similar to the party’s stance on tuition fees – which they pledged to abolish in opposition, but have now risen to £9,000 a year. The Conservative party chairman said: ‘The surprising thing about it is that he has never raised any of these concerns that I am aware of privately over the last few years. ‘What’s more, he has actively blocked several of the common sense straightforward assessments... he’s stood in the way of those things happening - for example blocked our calls to rein in EU migration. ‘It’s very strange.

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Kenny Jackett sits in a sunlit meeting room at Wolverhampton Wanderers’ training ground explaining how his genial manner hides a clinical disposition. He may be nice, but he can wield a knife. This summer, as he plots a path for the club’s return to the Barclays Premier League, he has once again sliced eight players (earning a total of around £7million a year) from his squad, telling them their services will not be needed. That group, who are training separately from the first team and will not feature in pre-season games, includes Kevin Doyle, Jamie O’Hara and Roger Johnson — players with top-flight experience on seven-figure wages. It is a hardline stance but Jackett, entering his 11th consecutive year in football management, knows there can be no softening of a policy that rid the club of the toxic atmosphere caused by successive relegations and gives his team a better chance of success on the field too. VIDEO Scroll down to watch angry Wolves fans invade the pitch after losing to Burnley . They're back! Kenny Jackett guided Wolves to promotion from League One to the Championship in May . Some of the clubs who have enjoyed double success: . Watford: Div 4 to Div 2 (promoted in 77-78 & 78-79) Wimbledon FC: Div 4 to Div 2 (82-83 & 83-84) Man City: Div 2 to Premier League (1998-99 & 99-00) Hull: Div 3 to Championship (03-04 & 04-05) Norwich: League One to Premier League (09-10 & 10-11) Crawley: Conference National to League One (10-11 & 11-12) Southampton: League One to Premier League (10-11 & 11-12) Having begun the interview by offering a cup of tea, he offers his thoughts. ‘It was our ambition to only spend one year in League One. Some big clubs have stayed down for two, three, four years — both Sheffield clubs, Leeds United, Nottingham Forest. ‘I’ve seen when it’s two-and-a-half years before all those big contracts run out and you get a group of hungry young lads that nobody’s ever heard of coming through. They see the fantastic potential, the big crowds, and want to make a name for themselves. ‘What I tried to do was accelerate that process. We couldn’t drift along. We needed to have that type of turnover in one summer. I had the benefit of being a rival manager coming to Molineux. I felt the relationship between the crowd and players had broken down. Those players needed to be removed. It’s not a patient industry I’m in.’ As if to remind, a painting of a pack of wolves hangs on the wall. Harsh words can be delivered humanely, however. ‘I just tried to be as clear as I could that they weren’t in my plans,’ Jackett, 52, continues. ‘Also, I felt they would benefit from a move. There were a lot of people who’d spent a few years in the Premier League and it’s quite hard to then come down.’ He adds: ‘As manager your successful times are when you are being proactive. In many cases you have to make the calls before the mistakes happen. After that, on a human level, the one thing you need to be is straight with people, to be open and honest.’ Top of the league: Leigh Griffiths celebrates scoring as Wanderers went to the summit of the third tier . So it came to pass that only two members of the side who featured in the defeat at Brighton on the final day of the 2012-13 season — a result that underlined relegation for Wolves and saw angry exchanges between fans and players — appeared in the 6-4 win over Rotherham in April that celebrated immediate promotion back. The crowd was raucous that day, too. Homegrown players such as Danny Batth, 23, and Jack Price, 21, blossomed, while signings Michael Jacobs, 22, and James Henry, 25, proved instant hits. Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko are the duo providing continuity. Wolves clinched the League One title with a record 103 points as Jackett implemented an attractive passing game. Win or lose, players recognised fans with applause. It wasn’t just a bloated squad Jackett trimmed for gains. The training ground canteen menu had swollen from players pushing their individual tastes. Too many cooks. Choices now are fewer and healthier but there is no Paolo Di Canio-style ban on tomato ketchup. Fading fast: Jamie O'Hara and Kevin Doyle have been training on their own during this pre-season . Confidence in youth: Jackett wants to build his side around the likes of Danny Batth . Pedigree: James Henry blossomed at Molineux after Jackett landed the former Millwall man . ‘I felt the menu was catering to too many different opinions that weren’t the experts,’ says Jackett. ‘We employ a full-time sports scientist. His job is to dictate the menu, what is eaten, when and why.’ If last season’s goals were clear — right wrongs, lift the mood, gain promotion — this season presents a more complex landscape. But Jackett has one vision. ‘It again is to try and go up,’ he says without hesitation. ‘Three lucky teams will get into the Premier League by the end of this Championship season. We want to be one of them. Wolves are big enough to be competing.’ Jackett is wise in the ways of promotion. As a member of Graham Taylor’s Watford side of the 1980s he reached the FA Cup final and was capped 31 times by Wales before retiring aged 28 after knee injuries, going into coaching early. Confrontation: Wolves supporters were upset with Doyle and Roger Johnson after relegation in 2013 . In the late 1990s, as assistant to Taylor, he saw Watford into the Premier League after successive promotions then, as No 2 to Ian Holloway, helped Queens Park Rangers go up from what is now League One. As manager, he took Swansea from the bottom rung as they began their ascent up the leagues, while Millwall reached the Championship under his guidance. Wolves, though, is a chance to show his teeth. ‘Do I hope there are many more opportunities for me in the future? Yes. I suppose that will be dictated by how well I do at Wolves. I’m fully aware of the insecurities of football management. ‘I’d love to manage in the Premier League, I’d love to perhaps manage at international level. It is my ambition to go as high as I can.’ Do not discount the steel behind the smile.","Manager has opted for youngsters instead of Jamie O'Hara and Kevin Doyle .

Moody's used United Nations definitions to examine which countries would be classed as 'super-aged' by 2030. A society is considered to be ‘ageing’ if over-65s make up at least 7 per cent of the population, ‘aged’ when the figure is at least 14 per cent, and when it tops 20 per cent it is considered to be a ‘super-aged’ society . The report warns that countries around the world will see their economies suffer because of a rapidly ageing population . And they will create a ‘demographic tax’ as fewer people of working-age affect levels of production, while the need to support more retired and elderly people will slash the amount of savings available for investment, analysts warned. They also suggest that immigration – often cited by experts as a way to counter the effects of an ageing population – has only a small or temporary effect. An influx of foreign workers, although bringing in younger employees and encouraging investment from abroad, could only ‘partially mitigate’ the effects of ageing, said the report. The author of the report, Elena Duggar, warned: ‘Demographic transition, frequently considered a long-term problem, is upon us now and will significantly lower economic growth.’ Just 23 countries will be classes as 'not-ageing' by 2030, piling pressure on public services and holding economies back . Middle-class are warned over their pensions . 'It's amazing, really, the spread of grey-haired people in Britain' By 2025, . Britain will be among 11 nations expected to be ‘super-aged’. More than one in five people are 65 and have retired or are approaching . retirement. Germany, . Italy and Japan have already reached that stage, while a further ten – . including France, the Netherlands and Sweden – will be there by 2020. There are predicted to be 34 super-aged countries by 2030. The report said: ‘Sharp declines in fertility rates and infant mortality and increased life expectancy during the 20th century led to sustained population growth, with the world population increasing four-fold over this period. ‘The same factors are changing the age structure of populations across both developed and developing countries in the 21st century.’ Around six in ten of the countries rated by Moody’s are ageing, with seven per cent of their population aged 65 or more. However, the problem is not exclusive to developed countries. Some rapidly growing markets such as Russia and China are also facing the issue. The report added: ‘Ageing is not just a developed-world problem as is generally believed. ‘Many emerging markets are already classified as ageing. 'Countries like Russia, Thailand, Chile and China have rapidly deteriorating demographics. 'Even relatively young countries such as Brazil and Turkey are ageing.’ Moody’s, which regularly prepares reports for investors and finance firms, said the worst-hit countries will be those with high unemployment and low incomes, such as Greece and Portugal. It also warned that Asian countries where the population is ageing faster than in well-established industrial countries like Britain will face ‘complex and challenging’ difficulties unknown in the West. The first countries set to join Germany, Italy and Japan with super-age status will be Finland and Greece – who will be added to the list next year. The group will grow to 13 in 2020 when they are joined by France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Portugal, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Malta. When the UK is added to the super-aged set in 2025, it will be accompanied by Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Estonia and Canada. In 2030, the US, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore, Latvia, Serbia, Bosnia Hercegovina and Georgia will complete the group of 34.","Moody's ratings agency warns of 'extremely negative' impact on growth .

The video was shot by Ronnie Shalvis, from Utah in America and has already had more than 800,000 views online. The 22-year-old free-runner turned to filmmaking after a back injury stopped him from doing the sport, a mixture of acrobatics and athletics. Scroll down for video . Aerodynamic acrobatics: A video of free-runners performing parkour in the desert dressed in Star Wars costumes has become an internet sensation . Parkour uses urban and natural settings and obstacles such as balconies and high buildings. It has become a huge hit after appearing in action films such as James Bond movie Casino Royale and The Bourne movies. The James Bond parkour chase sequence in Casino Royale is billed as one of the most ambitious in the history of the action series.

"By . Richard Spillett . David Cameron will attend the Girl Summit in London today and announce measures to tackle FGM . Parents who fail to prevent their daughter being subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) will face prosecution under new legislation to be unveiled by the Government at a summit in London today. Prime Minister David Cameron is to announce a raft of measures to combat the issue at the Girl Summit, including a £1.4 million FGM Prevention Programme for survivors and those at risk of the practice and lifelong anonymity for victims. Mr Cameron said of the issue: 'All girls have the right to live free from violence and coercion, without being forced into marriage or the lifelong physical and psychological effects of female genital mutilation. 'Abhorrent practices like these, no matter how deeply rooted in societies, violate the rights of girls and women across the world, including here in the UK. 'I want to build a better future for all our girls and I am hosting the Girl Summit today so that we say with one voice - let's end these practices once and for all.' The measures to combat FGM and forced marriage in the UK and abroad come as Unicef warns advances made in tackling them in the developing world could be reversed if the pace of action is not increased. Earlier this month MPs warned that the failure to tackle the growing practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) in the UK is a 'national scandal' that has resulted in the preventable abuse of thousands of girls, a committee of MPs has said. In a hard-hitting report, the Commons Home Affairs Committee said FGM may be one of the most prevalent forms of 'severe physical child abuse' taking place in Britain, with an estimated 65,000 girls under the age of 13 at risk. There are an estimated 170,000 women and girls in the UK who have undergone FGM, the report said, while in two London boroughs almost one in 10 girls are born to mothers who have suffered the procedure and are therefore themselves at risk. Mr Cameron will attend the summit in London along with International Development Secretary Justine Greening, Home Secretary Theresa May and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. African country Somalia, whose capital Mogadishu is pictured, has one of the highest levels of FGM among girls . To see the full film Female Genital Mutilation: A Change Has Begun on Vimeo click here . Mr Clegg revealed yesterday that the Government will unveil plans to give teachers, doctors and social workers extra training to identify and help girls who might be at risk of becoming victims of FGM. Further measures to be unveiled today include: . :: New police guidance from the College of Policing and an inspection programme by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) that will look at how police handle FGM cases . :: A consultation on proposed civil court orders to protect girls at risk of FGM; . :: New legislation to grant victims of FGM lifelong anonymity from the time they make an allegation . :: A specialist 'FGM service' that will include social workers to 'proactively' identify instances of FGM . :: New programmes to prevent child and forced marriage in 12 developing nations: . :: An 'International Charter' calling for the eradication of these practices within a generation. Unicef warned ahead of the summit that while the rate of FGM and child marriage has fallen over the past three decades, population increase in developing nations alone could reverse this trend if 'intensive action' is not introduced. Unicef director Anthony Lake says action must be taken if the problem is not to get worse . It said its research showed that more than 130 million girls and women have experienced some form of FGM in the 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East where it is most common. In addition some 700 million women alive today worldwide were married as children, including more than a third - 250 million - who were married before the age of 15. Unicef executive director Anthony Lake said: 'The numbers tell us we must accelerate our efforts. 'And let's not forget that these numbers represent real lives. 'While these are problems of a global scale, the solutions must be local, driven by communities, families and girls themselves to change mindsets and break the cycles that perpetuate FGM/C and child marriage. 'We can't let the staggering numbers numb us - they must compel us to act.'","London conference aimed at tackling FGM, forced marriage and other issues .

"By . Andy Newport . Rangers manager Ally McCoist admits he is keeping his fingers crossed that Rangers' off-field woes will become a thing of the past. The Ibrox club have endured a turbulent two-year spell since rising from the ashes of liquidation. The club burned through almost £70million in the first 18 months of that period and infuriated supporters have even gone as far as to organise a boycott of season-tickets while calling for assurances over the future of the stadium and the Murray Park training ground. Fingers crossed: McCoist is hoping Rangers have now turned the corner . Silence:  McCoist is refusing to answer any questions on Rangers' current demise . But on the eve of his side's first match of the new season, McCoist claims once stormy seas have calmed he is hopeful he will finally be allowed to concentrate on football matters. He said: 'It would be great [if all I had to concentrate on was football matters]. That would be ideal. 'I have to say that I think things have absolutely calmed down. There are obviously one or two things that happen in all clubs that are for board members to deal with. 'That's not my gig, I'm manager of the football club and hopefully I can concentrate on the football issues. 'Certainly I think we can all agree that there are still issues. That's fine, all clubs have issues. But we are in a far calmer and far better place.' The Light Blues boss - whose side open their campaign with a Petrofac Training Cup first round tie at home to relegated Hibernian on Tuesday night - has opted to take a backward step from the numerous rows that have dominated Rangers' dealings over the past six months. And he hinted he would stick by that no-comment policy ahead of the new season. He added: 'I'm very, very hopeful that the team can put the club on the back pages for the right reasons. Success: McCoist celebrates winning the League One title at Ibrox last season . 'Off the field issues I can't have any bearing on. We have got enough problems picking sides to win games of football before we can start worrying about anything else.' McCoist is still waiting to learn if defender Bilel Mohsni will be allowed to face Hibs and even Hearts on Sunday when his side kick-off the Championship season with a home clash against the Jambos. Mohsni was dismissed near the end of Saturday's 2-0 friendly defeat Derby for aiming a flying head-butt at Country striker Chris Martin. Now the manager has warned the Tunisian his wild temper is stopping him from fulfilling his potential. 'He has apologised because he knows he let himself down and let his team-mates down,' said McCoist. 'We can't afford needless red cards. Safe hands: McCoist puts an arm round Lewis MacLeod during a Rangers training session . Partnership: McCoist worked under former Rangers manager Walter Smith at Ibrox . 'There is a package that comes with someone like Bilel but we want to cut out the silly stuff. If he can do that, then it would be to the benefit of everyone at the club. 'I have had a very good chat with him and what I can say publicly is that he 100-per-cent knows he was wrong. We can't accept that that type of behaviour at the football club. 'That hot-headed streak certainly does not help him as a player. If he could cut that out of his make-up it would make him a better all-round player.' McCoist has added four new signings to his squad this summer after luring strikers Kris Boyd and Kenny Miller back to Govan, as well as capturing defenders Darren McGregor and Marius Zaliukas. But he has not given up hope of landing further new faces. He said: 'I'm happy with where we are. Like every other manager, you would always want a wee tweak with your squad. 'You never know, if I get the opportunity to add to my squad I will certainly do that. There is still a long time to go in the window.'","The Ibrox side have endured a frustrating two years since liquidation .

"By . Harry Mount . Tracking down the name of Captain Francis Mount on the Loos Memorial takes some time. It isn’t surprising. There are more than 20,000 names on the Portland stone memorial, kept in immaculate condition by gardeners from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Today, the Commission’s stonemasons are replacing a worn panel with a newly-inscribed, pristine one. And there are thousands more gravestones in other cemeteries in this mining area, just outside Lens in north-eastern France. Scroll down for video . Bond: Prime Minster David Cameron and Harry Mount, second cousins, look at a memorial to their great-uncle, Francis Mount . More than 59,000 Allied soldiers - and 20,000 Germans - were killed in the Battle of Loos in the autumn of 1915. Poor Francis Mount was one of the last of them, killed on the final day of the Battle of Loos - a military tragedy, with all those lives lost in exchange for a mere two miles of blood-soaked earth gained. Francis Mount was my great-great uncle. I share him with my second cousin, David Cameron. The battle he fought in at Loos marks the first time the Allies used poison gas. It was a disaster. Once released, it was blown back by the winds over friendly lines and killed many Allied soldiers. Hero in the family: Francis Mount was one of the 59,000 Allied dead at the Battle of Loos in 1915 . The supposed ‘Big Push’ failed at Loos and it led to Sir John French, Commander of the British Expeditionary Force, being replaced by Field Marshal Douglas Haig. Even with the sun blazing down on the memorial, your mind is drawn back to the freezing gloom and bloody slaughter of World War I. ‘Seeing the memorial to a relation helps to bring it all home and make the connections,’ says the Prime Minister, who is on his third trip to the Western Front in a year. In December, he visited the memorial to another great-great uncle, John Geddes, who died at Ypres in April 1915. Five members of Cameron’s family were killed in the war. ‘It helps to put you in their shoes at their age at their time,’ he explains. ‘I find it very moving. It has such pathos. ‘The commemorations have brought it even closer. But there’s something about the First World War. 'There’s some extra factor which makes it incredibly powerful. There was the scale of the slaughter of course. It’s the inexplicable nature - that the slaughter just went on and on. You can’t get away from it.’ Early yesterday, Cameron attended the World War I Centenary service at Glasgow Cathedral with the Prince of Wales. He was given a poppy which he laid, alongside a cross, in the earth beneath his great-great uncle’s name at the Loos Memorial later in the day. I placed another cross next to it. Francis Mount’s body was never recovered - so there is no tombstone to him. 'Just war': Mr Cameron insisted that the soldiers who died in the First World War were fighting for good reason . ‘Men like Francis Mount went to fight because they believed they were going to fight a just war,’ says Cameron, ‘They were right to think that.’ Although Cameron was born more than half a century after the death of Francis Mount, he has strong links to him. Francis Mount, the son of the Conservative MP for Newbury, was brought up at Wasing Place, Berkshire, where Cameron’s mother, Mary Mount, was later brought up. As a boy, Cameron went to services in Wasing Church, where his parents married and his grandfather, Sir William Mount, a D-Day veteran, is buried. ‘My grandfather never talked about the First World War or the Second,’ says the Prime Minister, ‘But I remember at his funeral [in 1993], when people came in uniform from miles away. This year, going to the Normandy beaches made me think a lot about my grandfather. Walking the graves: Mr Cameron has more relatives who fought in the Wars, including a great-great uncle who fell at Ypres and his D-Day veteran grandfather . ‘He taught me how to fish and all sorts of things about the countryside. But he never talked about the war. My mother said he never would. He was wounded on Normandy and he never talked about it again. It was classic British reserve. ‘That’s one of the reasons I’ve wanted to rediscover these connections with Francis Mount - because my grandfather never talked about it.’ Francis Mount was one of the older soldiers at the Front. He was 43 with a wife and two young sons. He was commissioned in the 5th Battalion of the Royal Berkshire Regiment, an infantry regiment, and arrived with his battalion at the end of May 1915 at Boulogne. Once at Loos, Mount survived the first days of the battle. He survived the tragic moment when the Allies gassed themselves. He survived the day the British advanced in open country into the raking fire of German machine-guns: a single German machine-gun fired 12,500 rounds that day. But he did not survive that fatal last day of the Battle of Loos - October 13, 1915. In that final, desperate, Allied attempt to topple the Germans, Francis Mount was killed. ‘Despite the horror of his death, and millions more, I do not believe the First World War was just pointless slaughter,’ says David Cameron. ‘There was a purpose. ‘There were ways the war could have been shortened, or should have been pursued differently. 'But the fundamental reason why Britain went to war in 1914 was that there was a just cause. We had promised to guarantee Belgian neutrality. ‘It’s right to celebrate the bravery.’ Cameron still sees echoes of the war running through modern politics. ‘There is a right for a small country not to be bullied when it’s overrun by its neighbours,’ says Cameron, ‘In the case of the war, it was Belgium; but, in our own times, you can make that argument about Kuwait, Ukraine. It still has a relevance - the territorial inviolability of states.’ ‘The seminal event of our lifetime was the fall of the Berlin Wall or the collapse of the Soviet Union. But you need to go back to World War I to see how the break-up of these empires started to affect the world in which we now live.’ Poignant: Yesterday Mr Cameron joined members of the Royal family including Princes Charles and William and the Duchess of Cambridge, seen above, at a memorial service in Belgium . Cameron sees nothing jingoistic in commemorating the heroism of Mount and millions more like him. ‘We’re a very patriotic, proud nation. We want these things to be properly commemorated. We have to mark the key moments in the war, too - the Somme, Passchendaele, Gallipoli, Jutland.’ Just before he spoke these words, Cameron passed the memorial to another captain killed at Loos on the same day as Captain Mount - Charles Hamilton Sorley, a 20-year-old war poet, shot in the head by a sniper. After his death, his final poem was unearthed in his kit bag: . ‘When you see millions of the mouthless dead / Across your dreams in pale battalions go / Say not soft things as other men have said / That you’ll remember. For you need not so.’ With all due respect to the noble poet captain, we need to remember. And we do.","Francis Mount was 43 when he was killed at the Battle of Loos in France .

"By . John Mcgarry . They lost the tie but they won the right to believe they can hold their own at this level once again. On a pulsating night at Pittodrie, a stirring Aberdeen display briefly threatened to bring the impossible into view. Three goals down in the tie before the half-hour mark had been reached, Derek McInnes’ side could easily have gone searching for the nearest black hole in which to crawl into. Plenty of Scottish sides have done so in such circumstances down the years. This Dons’ side is made of far sterner stuff, however. And when Peter Pawlett and Mark Reynolds scored either side of the break, Willie Miller’s assessment that turning the tie around would be the club’s greatest European triumph came to mind. Dejected: Aberdeen trudge off at Pittodrie after losing 5-2 on aggregate to Real Sociedad . Consoling hand: Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes puts an arm round midfielder Willo Flood after the game . Aberdeen: Langfield, Logan, Anderson, Reynolds, Considine (Low 72), Jack, Flood, Hayes, Pawlett (Rooney 65), McGinn, Goodwillie. Subs not used: Brown, Taylor, Robson, Low, Smith, Rooney, Monakana. Goals: Pawlett, Reynolds. Real Sociedad: Zubikarai, Martinez, Zaldua, De La Bella, Elustondo, Bergara, Xabi Prieto, Pardo, Zurutuza (Granero 43), Finnbogason (Agirretxe 58), Castro. Subs not used: Rulli, Martinez, Gonzalez, Ansotegi, Canales. Goal: Xabi Prieto (2), Bergara. They gave it their all and then some more against a side that wheel and deal at levels Scottish teams can only dream of. But the goal that would have presented the grandstand finish to beat them all just never materialised. Two late, late Sociedad goals to defeat the Scots on the night were wounding and frankly undeserved on the balance of play. The Dons go out but the ovation they received at the game’s conclusion said it all. From SPL driftwood two years ago to bloodying Real Sociedad’s noses. There is much to buoy the men from the Granite City as the domestic season begins. Aberdeen had spent a week stewing over a failure to do themselves justice in San Sebastian and within four minutes, they’d subjected the Basques to a more stringent examination. Pawlett, a peripheral figure in Spain, outpaced Ruben Pardo to win a free-kick on the left. Niall McGinn’s disguised set play picked out Jonny Hayes lurking just inside the box only for the Irishman to fluff his lines horribly with a fresh-air strike. It at least succeeded in bringing the red hordes to their feet. A promising start was almost undone by Willo Flood’s misjudgement inside his own box on 10 minutes. Perhaps blinded by the sun, he rolled his pass-back directly to Alfred Finnbogason. Only Reynolds’ positioning on the six-yard line to block the Icelander’s shot kept the tie alive. Double trouble: Xabi Prieto scored twice for the Spanish side as they won 3-2 in Scotland . The movement of the Dons’ attacking quartet – which contained David Goodwillie rather than Adam Rooney – troubled the men from La Liga all night. When McGinn beautifully brought down a long diagonal while playing on the shoulder of his opponent, his delicate chip was just inches over Enaut Zubikarai’s bar. The Dons had the ball in the net soon after when Ryan Jack slammed home from Andy Considine’s header but the linesman’s offside flag correctly cut the celebrations short. Vigilance at the back was imperative to keep the tie alive, though, and McInnes was thankful for Shay Logan’s bravery to rob Finnbogason whilst defending a counter attack one-on-one on the edge of his own box. Real skipper Pardo saw yellow for abruptly halting Flood’s burst through the centre. Yet from Real’s perspective, it was a price worth paying as they effectively put the tie beyond the Dons on 28 minutes. Thumping header: Reynolds rises highest to give Aberdeen fans hope shortly before the hour mark . Dons roar: The defender celebrates in front of the Aberdeen fans after putting them 2-1 up on the night . After such a heroic start to the game, it was a brutally simple goal to lose. Pardo simply guided an out-swinging corner on to the six-yard box where Prieto was lurking at the near post. One flex of the neck muscles sent his header flashing beyond the helpless Langfield. Three up in the tie, the job was as good as done. Commendably, there was no question of the Scots folding. Russell Anderson seemed to jump half his height to claim McGinn’s corner but, alas, Reynolds was a yard shy of converting as the ball arrowed back across goal. Still they believed. Logan rattled a 25-yarder down Zubikarai’s throat then, one minute from the break, came the goal their efforts so richly deserved. Gathering the ball on the penalty spot, Goodwillie juggled it from left foot to right then left again. Finally, he pulled the trigger only for the out-stretched leg of Inigo Martinez to block. Pawlett reacted faster than anyone in blue and white and smashed the ball low into the net. On the stroke of half-time, Langfield’s block with his legs to deny Finnbogason ensured the Dons were still in it as they made it to the sanctuary dressing room. They were in the Basques’ faces from the re-start although Hayes lunge on Alberto de la Bella came at the cost of a booking. Breaking hearts: Markel Bergara scores Sociedad's third goal at Pittodrie to make it 5-2 on aggregate . Still the Red tide surged forward. And with fully 33 minutes still on the watch came the goal that rocked Pittodrie. Hayes’ corner was claimed by the towering Anderson. McGinn gathered and made for the bye-line, pitching a gem of a ball to the back post where Reynolds applied a sumptuous headed finish. Rooney and Nicky Low were called from the bench as Mcinnes sought a more direct approach but neither the break of the ball or the moment of magic they craved to put themselves within a goal of victory arrived. Substitute Sergio Canales arced a curling effort inches wide of Langfield’s goal then missed a pinch from eight yards to ensure the Dons kept believing. Ash Taylor was pitched in an emergency centre forward with seven minutes left but the Dons couldn’t hold back time. They were robbed of a deserved win on the night when Logan caught De la Bella inside the box with five minutes remaining and Prieto calmly chipped home from the spot. To add insult to injury, Markel Bergera rose to thump home a header from six yards in stoppage time. It was as brave an effort as you could wish to see from a Scottish side but unfortunately not quite enough. CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW!

"By . Richard Spillett . A gang of thieves on scooters stole designer handbags from a luxury boutique in central London this morning in the latest of a spate of similar raids in the capital. Three mopeds - two with pillion passengers - pulled up outside the expensive Valentino shop in Sloane Street shortly after midnight last night and used one of the bikes to force open the door. The gang - all wearing dark clothing and helmets - then made off with designer items thought to be worth thousands of pounds. Scroll down for video . Smash and grab: A member of the gang of thieves breaks into the Valentino store and then grabs valuable handbags . The Valentino store in Sloane Street, central London was the latest target in a spate of smash and grab raids by gangs on mopeds . Aftermath: The shelves at the store lie almost empty after the robbers stole expensive bags . One man has since been arrested in Ladbroke Grove, west London, where police recovered a scooter but no stolen property. He remains in custody. The raid comes just days after a similar incident at the Larizia store in St John's Wood High Street, north west London, on July 28 when handbags valued at around £100,000 were taken. Seven people were arrested in relation to that robbery and have been bailed to appear in August. The Metropolitan Police said it is too early to say if the latest raid, after which two scooters made off towards Marylebone and the third towards Kilburn, is linked to any others. The Dorchester Hotel was raided twice in one month earlier this summer, with a gang of four arriving on mopeds before smashing open display cabinets and making off with jewellery and designer goods. Two men have been charged in relation to the incident. Two weeks ago, a Scotland Yard detective warned that moped smash and grab raids were 'in fashion' amongst criminals, who see shops as easier targets than security vans. Larizia in St John's Wood was raided in similar fashion last week. Seven people have been arrested and bailed . It comes after the Dorchester Hotel was targeted in a similar way last month, when thieves (pictured) arrived on mopeds, smashed display cabinets and stole jewellery and handbags. Two men have been charged . DCI Paul Johnson said: 'These raids are in fashion and we are going to take them out of fashion, we are going to show people that they are going to get put before the court and suitably punished if they carry out these crimes. 'Cash in transit robberies have fallen 30 per cent year on year over the past four years and are continuing downwards. 'We have worked with the cash in transit industry to improve security and safety and as a result it is now harder for criminals to get away with them. 'As a result they are turning to the expensive shops in the West End.' He spoke after four teenagers were arrested near the scene of a moped raid on a luxury watch shop in London's West End.","Gang of five on three mopeds attacked designer shop in Knightsbridge .

The Norwegian suffered humiliation in his first major European test after Legia Warsaw followed their 4-1 first leg mauling with a 2-0 win in Edinburgh.

Deila admitted his team are not good enough but must now negotiate a do or die Europa League play-off in a fortnight to salvage any hope of European football this season. Speaking after supporters vented their anger in the direction of club directors at Murrayfield, Deila appealed for time and support to rebuild his squad saying: 'I will need to built up a new team. 'That’s two years in the Champions League for Celtic - but this year we’re not good enough. Not by far. 'That’s our goals as a club and we have to do everything we can to make it a different situation next year when we try and qualify for the Champions League.' Chasing a miracle after a thumping defeat in Warsaw, the game was up for the Scottish champions after the opening goal from Michal Zyro after 35 minutes. A second for Michal Kucharczyk after an hour prompted anger from some Celtic fans in a 30,000 crowd. Doubling up: Michal Kucharczyk scores Legia's second goal past Celtic keeper Fraser Forster .

'We have to say that over two matches, Legia were better than us. 'I think the players were fighting all they could but we didn’t have the quality to break them down. 'The second goal was poor defending also so we have a lot to work on. 'But also I have to accept that it is our level right now and we have to work from here. I have a big job to do to improve us as a team. 'We can still win the league and get into the Europa League as well this season which would be a very good achievement. 'Then I hope we can stand here next year and talk about happier things than this.'

Goalkeeper Fraser Forster is likely to be the latest departure after handing his jersey to a supporter after Wednesday night’s game. Southampton are now set to submit a fresh £7million bid for the England World Cup star after Celtic lost £15m in Champions League revenues last night. 'I came here to do a job and work with the club,' added Deila. 'I have only been here for six weeks but right now it’s not good enough. That’s what I can see. 'We need to make the squad better by getting new players, which we are working on. 'But also we need to get more from the players here – and there are a lot of skills and a lot of quality.' Asked if Forster has played his final game, Deila was non committal. 'I don’t think so, we will see. 'But things have happened so quickly this last month you never know what’s happening.

"By . Guy Aspin And Simon Peach, Press Association . Isobel Pooley rose to the occasion on the penultimate night of athletics at Hampden Park, winning Commonwealth high jump silver with a personal best of 1.92 metres. The 21-year-old entered Friday evening's final as an outsider, having been outjumped this year by heptathletes Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Morgan Lake. However, Pooley shone as she cleared her first five jumps at the first attempt, including a personal best of 1.92m. Unexpected: England's Isobel Pooley claimed Commonwealth silver in the high jump at Hampden Park . Leap: The 21-year-old claimed a silver medal with a personal best jump of 1.92 metres n Glasgow . Australian teenager Eleanor Patterson eventually snuck ahead with a jump of 1.94m to take gold, with Pooley taking silver ahead of St Lucia's Levern Spencer on countback. 'I went for it, I lost control and it turned out okay,' Pooley told BBC Sport. 'The leap took a lot of confidence. I dreamt about being consistent, but my second attempt I am very proud of.' There was more English medal joy in the women's discus as Jade Lally's season best of 60.48m secured bronze, while the 4 x 400m relay teams progressed with ease. Emily Diamond, Shana Cox, Margaret Adeoye and Christine Ohuruogu qualified for the women's final on Saturday in three minutes 27.88 seconds - the fastest time of the night. 'It was nice to finally get out there,' Ohuruogu said. 'I've been stuck inside for the last week. Disbelief: Pooley was shocked as she realised she had claimed a medal at Hampden Park on Friday . 'The roar [when handed the baton] was so cool. I didn't miss the individual 400m to be honest, I really didn't. 'It's the first championship I've ever done in 10 years where I've just sat and watched. I'm glad I passed it up.' While world champion Ohuruogu led England home, the home crowd at Hampden Park were left frustrated. Scotland's decision to rest Glasgow 2014 poster girl Eilidh Child after her 400m silver on Thursday cost them as they finished ninth in the rankings, just 0.24secs slower than India, who qualified as a fastest loser. The hosts fared better in the men's event, though, with the team of Kris Robertson, Jamie Bowie, Greg Louden and Grant Plenderleith qualifying as a fastest loser. They join England in the final after the quartet of Daniel Awde, Matthew Hudson-Smith, Nigel Levine and Conrad Williams qualified in three mins 3.01s - the quickest time of the night.

Both players were brought in as part of Spurs' recruitment drive to replace Gareth Bale last summer but struggled to justify their price tags. However, each found the target again as Tottenham thrashed Celtic 6-1 in Helsinki on Saturday - taking their pre-season goal tallies to three apiece.

Scroll down for video... Thumbs up! Tottenham forwards Erik Lamela (L) and Roberto Soldado (R) cool down after training . King Erik? The 22-year-old Argentine has caught the eye of Mauricio Pochettino during pre-season . Making up for lost time: Roberto Soldado has raised his game by scoring three goals during pre-season . The 22-year-old was signed for  £25.7m from Roma but made only three league starts under Andre Villas-Boas due to a series of injuries and difficulties adapting to life in London. Soldado also had an uninspiring first season in north London, scoring only six league goals following his £26million move from Valencia. But, both have caught the eye of new manager Mauricio Pochettino who is determined to restore their reputations as some of the most exciting talents in Europe.. Speaking of Lamela, he said: ‘We know the Erik Lamela from Argentina and Italy. But he is still young and the Premier League is the most difficult league to play; the style, the language. Season to forget: Erik Lamela's statistics from last season make for unimpressive reading . Flop: The former Valencia striker only managed six league goals following his £26m move last season . ‘But after one year we believe that Erik is ready to show his quality. ‘Will he play as a No 10 or out wide? It depends on the situation. My philosophy is to give a freer style with good organisation but not only with Erik; with other players as well.’ Soldado is desperate to prove himself in the Premier League, despite Spanish newspaper Marca reporting that Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone is interested in taking him back to La Liga.

"By . Mark Wilson . Legia Warsaw midfielder Ondrej Duda has delivered a withering put-down to Celtic by insisting Irish minnows St Patrick’s Athletic gave his team a tougher test. Ronny Deila’s side require an extraordinary fightback at Murrayfield this evening after losing 4-1 in last week’s first leg in the Polish capital. That was in stark contrast to Legia’s previous home game in the Champions League qualifiers, when St Pat’s emerged with a goalless draw before being hammered 5-0 in Dublin. Slammed: Ondrej Duda says Irish side St Patrick's Athletic gave Legia Warsaw a tougher test than Celtic . Slovakian youngster Duda claims he is not complacent about the return game with Celtic, but admitted he has already selected an ideal opponent for the play-off round. ‘St Patrick’s player a lot tougher against us than Celtic,’ he said. ‘They gave us a very tough game in Warsaw. ‘With Celtic, we didn’t know what to expect, but we were expected to easily beat the Irish side, which we did, but only after a big fright and a good performance away. Fortunately, we regained our composure and we are now on the right track. ‘Of course, we haven’t qualified past Celtic yet, but we have talked about the opponents in the next round. ‘Personally, I would like to get BATE Borisov - I think we would have a really good chance against them.’ The impact of holding the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony means Parkhead remains out of commission. That could be viewed as an advantage for Legia but Duda is cautious about the visit to Edinburgh. Cocky? The midfielder admits he is already thinking of their next round opponents . ‘We respect our opponents,’ he insisted. ‘Celtic are a great club. They will have good support from their fans. But we have a big advantage from the first leg, so I am very confident. ‘We won’t approach the game thinking we have already won it - that kind of attitude would see us lose it. But we have united as a team after last Wednesday and we want to look forward. I did not think it was my best game personally but the whole team rose to the challenge. ‘The Champions League is the most important competition to us now and it would be fantastic to get to the group stage.’ The brutal truth for Celtic is that they could be facing an even greater deficit. Legia’s Ivica Vrdoljak failed to convert two penalties in the first leg. ‘I went to Ivica for the second one and I said that I could take it,’ recalled Duda. ‘I felt strong and I wanted to try. ‘He decided to take it again and, frankly, I do not blame him. He is very strong mentally and sometimes these situations happen. Ivica played a great match and that’s what counts. ‘If we win a penalty in the second match, I think it will be taken again by Ivica.’ Disappointing: Celtic were embarrassed in the first leg, losing 4-1 away from home . Meanwhile, Legia manager Henning Berg has defended the celebrations of his players at the end of the first leg. Injured Celtic captain Scott Brown has insisted his colleagues will draw motivation from the goading way the Polish side greeted their 4-1 victory. Berg, though, believes there was no intention by his charges to go over-the-top and create an impression of job done. ‘It was just happiness,’ he insisted. ‘I think our players were just so happy to play a good game and score good goals. I think that’s what they were celebrating. ‘It was a big win for us against a big team and that brought joy. But it wasn’t celebrating because they think the tie is over. We still have another big game to come. We know we have to play well and do our job 100 per cent. We also expect Celtic to do better. ‘Nothing is decided yet. As I said, I think players were just happy with what they did last week. ‘Before this tie started, Celtic were big, big favourites. It is difficult to say who the favourites are now.’ Sloppy: Efe Ambrose was sent off in the match . The former Rangers centre-back also played down the impact of Celtic being displaced from their home. ‘Of course, the atmosphere at Celtic Park is huge,’ added Berg. ‘It is the same at Ibrox. ‘But if the Celtic fans fill this stadium then there will be a huge atmosphere here, as well. ‘It’s still in Scotland in front of their supporters. I’m sure Celtic will treat it as a home game, as they did in the last round against KR Reykjavik. ‘This is a good test for us. We don’t have the Champions League experience that Celtic have. We want to get to their level so this a good chance to test ourselves against a team that has played in Europe for many years.’","Duda says St Pat's gave them tougher test than Celtic in Warsaw .

But UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino is now on the stage and he is now briefly giving us a speech about how the Champions League pitches the best teams in Europe against each other...thanks for that, Gianni. The draw should be underway shortly (or at least the presentation) as final touches are being applied in Nyon. UEFA do tend to drag these things out so expect the UEFA General Secretary to give a short speech after he arrives at 11am. Well, if we are counting the play-off round that is.

But it's the Portuguese boss who will be looking ahead to compete with Europe's elite this term as manager of Zenit.

Many Arsenal fans would favour a clash with Athletic Bilbao, but Arteta has already warned supporters it would be a far from easy clash. Arsenal will be huge favourites regardless of who they get in today's draw, but Arteta is not getting complacent. 'I wouldn't be very pleased if we had to face them (Bilbao) but you don't know.

The Premier League club announced on Wednesday that the Glazer family is selling eight million shares with reduced voting rights, which equates to around 5 percent of the business.

"By . Nick Harris . Claudia Fragapane made English sporting history with a fourth gold medal of these Games here at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday and then dissolved in a fit a giggles when asked what it meant. ‘I’m speechless, I cannot believe it,’ said the 16-year-old gymnast from Bristol, who is 4ft 6in tall but has gone from being largely unknown to a giant of achievement within just a few days. Her gold on the floor on Friday followed others in the individual all-round and team all-round finals, and the vault. Quadruple: England's Claudia Fragapane won her fourth gold medal of the Commonwealth Games on Friday . Glory: The 16-year-old (centre) added the women's individual floor event to her other three titles . To put these medals in context, no other English woman, in any sport, has ever won four golds at a single Commonwealth Games before. Only one other English woman, in any sport, has ever won more than four Games golds in an entire sporting career, and that person’s career ended with every conceivable gong in global sport, from European and world titles to Olympic gold. The woman in question was hurdler Sally Gunnell and it took her three Commonwealth Games to win her five Games golds between 1986 and 1994. Fragapane was born in 1997 and says she fell in love with gymnastics in 2003. ‘I was six years old,’ she said. ‘I was so bubbly, jumping all over the house and my mum wanted to get me doing something. Straightaway I just loved it, I liked the determination you needed and I wanted to progress. ‘Gymnastics is about needing to love it and going for it 100 per cent… the fact is I can just express myself and go wild, because I’m so bouncy and everything, it’s just great.’ Jumping high: Fragapane's score of 14.541 was enough for her to claim her fourth gold medal of the Games . Fragapane had a grin from ear to ear and a spring in her step during a floor routine that scored 14.541, well clear of Australia’s Lauren Mitchell and Elsabeth Black of Canada in the silver and bronze positions. ‘The floor does let you show your personality,’ said the teenager. ‘My floor routine is very bubbly and hip-hoppy.’ Before deeming any British gymnastic success a barometer of global potential, it should be stressed China remain dominant in this sport. But Fragapane now has a world top-three finish in her sights at October’s world championships in Nanning, China. ‘I’m expecting to get to the floor final at the worlds and then hopefully get in the top three,’ she said. She added it was ‘really good’ to be part of a revolution in British gymnastics that has shown every sign here of making solid progress from the advances made at the London Games. England’s final medals tally in the gymnastics was nine golds, five silvers and five bronzes to leave them top of the table ahead of Canada in second place (8-3-4) with Scotland in third (2-2-1). In the artistic events, England won five of the six women’s disciplines, with English men (four golds) and Scottish men (two) taking six of the eight men’s titles. England’s Max Whitlock (below)had been hoping for a fourth gold of these Games yesterday but had to settle for a bronze in the parallel bars. The gold was won to rapturous applause by Scotland’s Merseyside-born Dan Purvis, with Nile Wilson of Leeds taking silver. Routine: Fragapane has already won gold in the individual all-around, vault and the team events in Glasgow . Wilson, 18, at his first major senior competition following a glittering junior career, then went one better on the parallel bars to take gold, scoring the same world-class points total as England team-mate Kristian Thomas (14.966) but pipping him with a better technical mark. Thomas had earlier won a vault silver behind Scott Morgan of Canada. There is an exuberance and camaraderie now between all the British gymnasts that suggests they can make an impact at Olympic level in Rio. Whitlock insisted that these Games are a significant point in the gymnastics calendar en route to that goal. ‘It’s a massive competition for us,’ he said. ‘It’s a big stepping stone and our main job is to go out and get big scores. The judging is still the same, whatever the competition.’ On the promise of Wilson, he added: ‘It’s his first Commonwealth Games and he’s come out here and performed like a true senior and fitted into the group really well. Three Brits on the podium (in the parallel bars) is massive for us. P-bars aren’t our strongest piece in British gymnastics and yet we’ve just got three scores of 15 and over. ‘That’s a massive statement to the rest of the world and hopefully we can go and do that on the world stage. ‘Nile is a very confident young lad and that’s a good thing, he loves the crowd and that all helps him, he handles the pressure.’ Purvis, whose mother is from Dundee and whose father is from Sheffield, said: ‘I didn’t really expect to get the gold. Just to get a medal would have been fantastic. I’m just absolutely over the moon.’","Fragapane won fourth gold medal of Games in individual floor event .

The 22-year-old, who becomes the Bluebirds' sixth summer signing, trained with his new team-mates on Thursday morning and is eligible to face Blackburn in the Championship season opener on Friday evening. Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer moved quickly to replace Jordon Mutch, who joined newly-promoted QPR in a £6million deal earlier this week. New boy: Cardiff boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer shakes hands with Tom Adeyemi after he completed his move . The former Manchester United striker said: 'I’ve been keeping an eye on Tom’s progress for a very long time. 'A few years ago, my Manchester United reserve side played against Norwich’s first team and Tom was their standout player. He scored a great goal that day and stood out as a fine talent, even at that young age. 'Tom has a physical presence, drive and energy – up and down the pitch. He can dictate games and is great at winning and anticipating second balls. We’ve been interested all summer and I’m thrilled we’ve got our man ahead of the season kick-off.' Adeyemi, who declined an offer to attend Cambridge University to pursue his football career, handed in a transfer request at St Andrew's to force through a move to south Wales. He said: 'I took no persuading from the manager to come here. It was a fantastic opportunity for me to work with somebody like him and to play for a club like Cardiff City. 'I’m very pleased that everything has been completed ahead of the season and now I can focus on fighting for a place in the side and helping us get the season off to a great start.'

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Nottingham Forest descended into chaos  as manager Stuart Pearce and owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi argued about the £7million sale of Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow to Newcastle United. A furious Pearce claimed that the deal involving two of Forest’s best players was agreed behind his back, but Al-Hasawi responded by insisting that the new boss was consulted and that the transfers were necessary for the club to meet financial fair play rules. In a twist likely to cause further disharmony between the pair, last night Reading moved in for forwards Simon Cox and Jamie Mackie. Forest, in turn, have approached Sheffield Wednesday for their 24-year-old winger Michail Antonio. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jamaal Lascelles' video of Nathan Chalobah dancing . Dispute: Fawaz Al Hasawi has hit back at Stuart Pearce's claims he was left in the dark at Nottingham Forest . Stars: But Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow were sold on the cheap to Premier League side Newcastle United . Pearce said he would not walk away from the City Ground, where he was a legend during 12 years as a player. Centre back Lascelles, 20, and goalkeeper Darlow, 23, will be loaned back to Forest this season with their wages being picked up by Newcastle — and while Pearce is grateful for that, he believes their value in the market would have been substantially higher next season. Lascelles, who was the subject of a £5m bid from Arsenal in 2011, signed a four-and-a-half-year contract in March, while highly-rated Darlow had three years left on his deal. Pearce takes charge of his first competitive match since returning to Forest when Blackpool visit Nottingham on Saturday but before then will seek talks with Al-Hawasi, who was forced to deny accusations that he would meddle in team affairs when Pearce was unveiled back in April. The pair were at loggerheads yesterday as each made public his own version of events. Pearce said: ‘I am not prepared to fluff things when it comes to what was said and done behind the scenes. Two players were sold against my will. It disappointed me. ‘If it was my money, the boys would not have been sold. When it is out of my hands, there is not a lot I can do about it. All I can do is make a recommendation to people. I thought I could push their value up and that they would be worth more in the long run. ‘The first I heard about things was when Jamaal told me that he had a medical at Newcastle. New boss: Stuart Pearce said he was extremely disappointed with the decision . ‘I would like to think that, somewhere down the line, they would back my knowledge, with respect of the amount of time I have been in the game. ‘The chairman Fawaz has been in Kuwait the whole of this summer so I’ve not had a conversation with him regarding the players. But I did with other financial people at the club. ‘They asked my opinion about what I thought of the offer and I said don’t do the deal — but the deal was done. ‘I don’t know the financial constraints the club are working under. I plan to find that out, very soon. Then perhaps I can understand this decision.’ Making his mark: Al Hasawi purchased the Championship club back in 2012 . In a statement released on the club website, Al-Hawasi countered: ‘The manager and I openly discussed the proposed sale of Karl and Jamaal and he was aware of the negotiations throughout. The business side of football is changing and the requirement to increase revenue means, unfortunately, difficult decisions have to be made. ‘Should the pair’s proposed move to Newcastle be completed as expected, the transfer fees will significantly help us meet the stringent Financial Fair Play criteria, all the while allowing us to retain two high-quality players for the 2014-15 season, paying nothing towards their wages. ‘Sadly for me, there is no room for sentimentality in the running of a football club and it is up to me to start making some tough decisions to preserve the long-term sustainability of Nottingham Forest. ‘But while balancing the books is a hugely significant part of my role, it remains my job to ensure the manager has the best possible squad to work with as we pursue a place in the Premier League.He added on Twitter shortly afterwards: ‘Stuart and I work together as a team, and not work behind each other’s backs to bring the best out of this club.’","Al Hasawi says Pearce was involved in negotiations throughout .

"By . Ryan Lipman . and Sarah Michael . Taking two bites of his McChicken burger, Adelaide man James Parsons knew there was something seriously 'gross'. Mr Parsons, 26, runs a pool maintenance business and was between jobs on Monday when he ordered the burger for lunch from Reynella McDonalds drive-thru, south of Adelaide CBD at about 1pm. 'He got the burger, took the first bite and thought ""this isn't warm"",' his wife Philippa told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was starving and on the run - he took the second bite and looked down and the whole patty was raw.' 'Gross': Adelaide man James Parsons was shocked when he discovered his cold McChicken burger contained what he believes was a raw patty in it . The couple live in Hallett Cove, south of Adelaide CBD and Mrs Parsons, 26, said her husband was 'grossed' by what he believes was raw chicken. 'It's put us both off... I doubt he'll eat McDonalds again,' she said. 'I can't say I'll never eat it again, but I definitely won't for a while,' she said. Mr Parson's immediate reaction to his shocking find, was to pull over his car and call the McDonalds restaurant to advise them about his discovery. 'They told him to bring the burger back and they would replace it and he said: 'That's not good enough"",' she said. After contacting the store Mr Parsons was told he could get a replacement if he took the burger back . At this point Mr Parsons called his wife, who was not with him at the time, to tell her what had happened. 'I said we need to do something about this - we need to make people be careful. I'm 30 weeks pregnant and if that happened to me it could have killed the baby,' she said. Mrs Parsons then called the South Australia McDonalds head office to alert them about the incident. After explaining that the store offered to replace the burger when contacted, Mrs Parsons reiterated that this was not good enough. She was then asked if the couple still had the burger, and if so to take photos to send to the company. Once Mr Parsons came home and gave the burger to his wife, Mrs Parsons took some images and sent them in an email and was told the incident would be investigated and someone would get back to her. Despite eating some of the meat in the burger, Mr Parsons has not been sick as a result of consuming what he believes was raw chicken. Pictured is not the actual McDonalds drive through . Mrs Parsons said she was surprised her husband had not been seriously ill from eating what he believes was raw chicken. 'He hasn't at all been sick, which is lucky - he's grown up in the country and has quite a cast iron stomach,' she said. 'I actually nearly rang the hospital to see whether there was something he could take to prevent food poisoning - we weren't sure way to do about eating raw chicken.' On Wednesday, a spokesman for McDonalds told Daily Mail Australia: 'We are disappointed that this has happened. 'We take food safety very seriously and have strict processes and systems in place. We are currently investigating this with the restaurant and liaising with the customer directly.' As of Tuesday night, Mrs Parsons had yet to hear anything more from McDonalds, despite sending a followup email earlier in the day. 'I sent an email to the same guy asking what was going on and if there was any report and I haven't received an email back,' she said. Mr Parson's wife Philippa took photos of the burger and sent them to the McDonalds South Australia head office . Mrs Parsons said she was outraged at how what she believes was raw patty, could have made it into the burger. 'I think we should be getting some kind of compensation - I don't know what but it's so dangerous, there's no excuse,' she said. 'It's such a big franchise, I would think it would be so well monitored.' After Mrs Parsons took the photos of the burger, she posted the images of the patty on her personal Facebook page. 'People were disgusted and they shared the photo,' she said. Mrs Parsons said the burger is currently in her freezer.","An Adelaide man claims his McChicken burger patty was raw on Monday .

The court heard Din lost the plot when Miss Williamson refused to leave the shop after being told she was banned. Din, 64, of Dundee, pleaded guilty to assault. Ian Flynn, defending, said Miss Williamson had previously been a ‘nuisance’ in the shop and had been asked not to return.

"By . Bianca London . A third of brides regret their choice of wedding dress and would change it if they could turn back time, according to new research. And that's not all - more than half (52 per cent) would edit the best man's speech if they had the chance to replay it and a third (31 per cent) would choose a different honeymoon destination. A staggering 82 per cent of brides would alter at least one aspect of their big day if they could - meaning just 18 per cent have the ‘perfect day’ of their dreams. Do YOU regret yours? A third of brides regret their choice of wedding dress and would change it if they could turn back time, reveals a new survey . The findings come from a new survey of 1,000 women who were asked to list their wedding day regrets. Some 32 per cent said they ‘cringe’ when they look at their wedding dress and they would definitely choose another dress if they had a chance. A further 38 per cent would alter the way they did their hair and make-up on their big day. A third (30 per cent) would swap their wedding photographer, with many brides moaning that ‘their friends’ wedding pictures are better than ours.’ And one in six (17 per cent) would even switch their bouquet for a different floral arrangement. A quarter of brides (24 per cent) would change their wedding ring - and one in eight would swap their wedding band (13 per cent). Put the wrong ring on it? A quarter of brides (24 per cent) would change their wedding ring - and one in eight would swap their wedding band (13 per cent) One in five (21 per cent) would dump at least one of her bridesmaids, whilst 33 per cent would switch the weather on the wedding day if they could. Four out of ten brides (39 per cent) regret allowing their husband to choose their engagement ring. Even if they are happy with the final ring, brides still wish they’d had more input in the decision. And just under a third (32 per cent) wish they had spent more on the ring because they have to wear it for the rest of their lives. The biggest source of marital regret was the best man’s speech. ’Inappropriate jokes’ were the main source of disdain about the best man’s speech - chosen by 34 per cent of brides. Some brides (12 per cent) even took issue with their own father’s wedding speech - the main objection here being that he forgot some thank-yous. Other bridal regrets include the overall cost, with 34 per cent of brides wishing they had spent more because ‘it probably won’t happen again’. And one in six (16 per cent) regret their choice of music, with a poor choice of band being the biggest gripe. One in ten brides even rues the choice of the song for their ‘first dance’ - ‘too cheesy’ being the main regret. Style icon Sarah Jessica Parker claims her biggest regret is choosing a black gown for her wedding in 1997. She wed fellow actor Matthew Broderick, opting for black to avoid unwanted media attention. Yet she told Harper’s Bazaar that she would do it differently now, saying: 'White it up. I’d wear a beautiful, proper wedding dress, like I should have worn that day. Yes, I still regret it.' Oh no! The biggest source of marital regret was the best man's speech with 'inappropriate jokes' being cited as the main source of disdain . Cate Blanchett has been happily married to playwright Andrew Upton since 1997 but there’s one enduring regret about their big day. She says: 'The only moment of my life I would possibly recapture is getting remarried again, because we didn’t take any photographs. We didn’t have any money at the time, and we couldn’t afford a photographer.' Cate was 28 when the fellow Australians wed, her husband was 31. Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries are now divorced but she had immediate regrets after their wedding ceremony in 2011. 'My one regret at the wedding - and I’m so mad I didn’t think of this - I should’ve had a little box or a stool I stood on. There should have been a little stair, it should have been a little extra stair so I could be a little taller that day.' The couple’s marriage - when she was 33 and he was 26 - lasted just 72 days, although height difference between the bride and groom wasn’t to blame. Hopefully lessons were learnt before her wedding to Kanye West. Jeweller Vashi Dominguez, who carried out the survey, said the long list of regrets shows how many brides get it wrong on their big day. 'Most of us only marry once in our lives - why cut corners and skimp on costs? 'What seems to be really expensive today will be like a drop in the ocean in 10 years’ time. We see women every day buying very expensive diamond rings because they don’t like their engagement rings. 'Either . their circumstances have changed and they can afford a better ring now . or fashions have changed and they have previously lumbered themselves . with a ring which looks completely inappropriate a few years after the . wedding. 'My advice . to all women preparing for their wedding is to think very carefully . about the ring because the chances are you won’t get an opportunity to . change it.

"By . Ryan Kisiel . and Emine Sinmaz . The missing seven-year-old whose mother ran away with him to stop him having cancer treatment has been temporarily put in foster care. Neon Roberts, who disappeared from Tiverton in Devon on Monday, is now being given emergency treatment, after a frantic nationwide search for him was mounted over the past four days. His mother Sally, 37, had taken her son to Sussex, more than 160 miles away, because she only wanted him to be given ‘natural remedies’ as he recovers from . surgery on a brain tumour. Needs treatment: Sally Roberts (left) and son Neon Luca Roberts, 7, (right) had not been seen since Sunday but he needed life-saving radiotherapy for a brain tumour . A judge yesterday revealed Neon's identity following concerns that he might not survive if he was not given treatment immediately. A statement released by Devon and . Cornwall Police at 2.30am said: 'Following extensive Press coverage on 5th and 6th December 2012, the high risk missing person, . seven-year-old Neon Roberts, has been located by police officers in . Sussex. 'He is currently in foster care and Neon’s welfare will be considered in the High Court tomorrow. 'Devon and Cornwall Police would like . to thank the public, the media and police colleagues in Sussex for . their assistance in securing Neon’s safe recovery.' The ‘very sick’ boy’s doctors had said his chances of surviving would be ‘dramatically reduced’ if he did  not . begin radiotherapy soon, and his father was desperate to make sure his . son had ‘everything available’ to help him fight the disease. Life or death: High Court judge Mrs Justice Hogg was so concerned for the boy's welfare she relaxed reporting restrictions to reveal his identity . Mrs Roberts and her estranged husband . Ben, Neon’s father, are currently at the centre of a court battle over . the boy’s treatment for his brain cancer. In an extremely rare move, a judge . sitting at the High Court yesterday ruling that reporting . restrictions on the case should be relaxed so that Neon could be . identified, to improve the chances of finding him. The judge said she was ‘deeply . concerned’ about the child’s welfare. Mrs Roberts, originally from New . Zealand and a keen believer in homeopathic medicine, had been staying in . the West Country with family after Neon underwent brain surgery there. Mr Roberts, 34, raised the alarm this week after not hearing from his son since the weekend. Lawyers for the NHS and Devon County . Council, who are tasked with looking after the boy’s interests, . yesterday agreed his disappearance should be made public and went to the . High Court to lift reporting restrictions. Mr Roberts, an IT consultant from . Knightsbridge, west London, said outside court that his wife  was . opposed to the radiation  treatment, fearing that it might damage their . son’s ‘intelligence, growth and hormones’. Disappeared: The pair were last seen in Tiverton, Devon (pictured) He said: ‘She wants to do everything . she can and rely on natural remedies and things that are not too . invasive, rather than radiotherapy and chemotherapy. ‘She is worried about the damage that can be done. She wants him to be able to live a normal life. ‘Personally, I want everything for . him. I want to make sure  he has everything available to him. I . understand there are lots of things that can be done to minimise the . after effects of radiotherapy, with various other pre- and . post-treatments. ‘All the evidence I have been . presented with has told me he needs to have that therapy, but I am also . aware there are side effects. It concerns me as well.’ Making the ruling, Mrs Justice Hogg . said: ‘I have made an order permitting the identification of the child, . Neon Luca Roberts, who is aged seven. It’s thought that he is need of . urgent life-saving hospital treatment. ‘He suffers from a brain tumour and . has recently had surgery and the doctors responsible for his treatment . believe he urgently needs radiotherapy. ‘His mother, Mrs Sally Roberts, who is . also known as Sally Lees, is opposed to the treatment and has . disappeared with Neon. She was last seen in Devon on Sunday. ‘Her family have had no contact with her for several days and are very concerned for her and Neon. ‘The doctors say that, unless . treatment is started next week, the prospects of Neon surviving are . dramatically reduced. I have asked for the assistance of the public in . looking for this very sick little boy. ‘I have also made urgent arrangements . for a hearing to consider the case and future treatment on Friday of . this week by a judge of the Family Division of the High Court. ‘I hope very much that Mrs Roberts will make contact with  her solicitors and the court as soon as possible. ‘As I say, there is an urgent hearing . fixed for Friday this week, where she will be able to put her case . before any decision about treatment is given. ‘I can only urge her to come forward. I am deeply concerned for the welfare and wellbeing of this little boy.’ The NHS and local authorities have the . right to take legal action when parents are opposed to treatment that . doctors deem necessary to save their child’s life. To protect the . child’s privacy, the identities of the families involved in such cases . are rarely revealed. Mrs Roberts is well-known in music . circles, and has performed as DJ Sally at events and venues ranging from . Glastonbury Festival to Boujis Nightclub in London. Permanent side effects from radiotherapy are more common in children, as their nervous systems are still developing and more likely to be harmed by radiation. Physical problems following treatment for a brain tumour may include limb weakness, poor balance and uncontrollable shaking. According to a National Cancer Institute survey, a quarter of children have fits or blackouts after the type of radiotherapy that Neon would undergo, and a third have headaches or migraines. A small number will also be left with hearing difficulties, while some may lose their sight. There is also a risk of mental side effects. Some children may have difficulties with learning and problem solving, and suffer from poor short-term memory. Others may find that their brain tumour symptoms even get worse after beginning radiotherapy treatment. This is because it causes a temporary swelling in the area that is being treated, which can lead to headaches, nausea and fits. In the short-term, the treatment can also cause tiredness and  hair loss on the area of the head being treated. Delayed side effects, which might not appear for some months, include a loss of appetite, a lack of energy and worsening of old symptoms. This is because the radiation kills tumour cells but also damages some healthy cells, according to Cancer Research UK. Some patients may not experience adverse effects until years after their treatment. These problems, which can be permanent, include difficulty thinking clearly, poor memory, confusion and personality changes.","Sally Roberts, 37, and Neon Luca Roberts were last seen on Sunday .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A toddler died after getting caught in the cord of a window blind, which strangled her, as she played a game of hide and seek with her older brother. Two-year-old Sophie Allen died in hospital on Saturday, five days after her mother Danielle Hudson, found her lifeless daughter in her bedroom. The 28-year-old today warned other parents of the dangers posed by window blind cords. Sophie and her brother Jayden, four, were playing a game of hide and seek at the family's Sunderland home on Easter Monday. Tragic: Two-year-old Sophie Allen died in hospital on Saturday, after becoming entangled in a window blind cord while playing hide and seek with her older brother . Mother-of-three Miss Hudson said she was oblivious to what had happened, until her son told her that Sophie was stuck. When he came back a second time saying the same thing, Miss Hudson went to investigate. She found her daughter lying lifeless with the beaded loop cord tangled around her neck. Her partner, Sophie's father, performed CPR while Miss Hudson dialled 999. Paramedics took her to Sunderland Royal Hospital where she was put in an induced coma, but but she died in the early hours of Saturday morning. Speaking for the first time about the ordeal Danielle recalled the awful moment she realised something was wrong. She said: 'My son came in and said ""Sophie's stuck"" and pointed at the cupboard. I didn't understand what he meant and just thought she was hiding. 'Then he came back and said it again. I walked over to the window and saw a shadow behind the curtain. Accident: The two-year-old was playing hide and seek with her brother Jayden when the accident happened . Scene of tragedy: Sophie was found in this bedroom at the family's home in Sunderland . Siblings: Sophie pictured with her older brother Jayden and their baby sister Amelia . 'I pulled it open and she was hanging with the cord around her neck. 'I lifted her up and carried her downstairs and her dad Peter tried to do CPR, while I called for an ambulance.' Sophie was taken to Sunderland Royal Hospital, where staff worked for more than an hour to resuscitate her. 'She was loving and happy, always smiling' - Danielle Hudson pays tribute to her daughter Sophie Allen . She was then transferred to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary where she was placed in an induced coma. Miss . Hudson added: 'They brought her out of the coma after 48 hours and she . started to breathe on her own, but there was no response to touch or . sound. 'The next day she . had an MRI scan which showed brain damage from the lack of oxygen. They . said that even if she pulled through she would be severely . brain-damaged. 'On Friday she had an EEG and it showed no brain activity at all. 'They said that once they took her off the ventilator she would struggle to breathe eventually, and she died on Saturday morning at about 3.20am.' Desperate: Sophie's mother Danielle Hudson discovered her daughter's lifeless body behind a curtain in the bedroom. She called 999 while her partner Peter, Sophie's father, performed CPR . Sophie's mother has now warned other parents about the dangers of such a common household feature. She said: 'Blinds are something that practically every household has. 'Just . tie them out of the way, keep them out of reach of children, cut them . or take them down altogether. Just make sure children have no access to . them.' Sophie's siblings have been staying with relatives since the accident and only returned home at the weekend. Danielle described her daughter, who would have been three in December, as a happy but mischievous little girl. She said: 'Sophie was always dirty, you couldn't keep her clean. She was loving and happy, always smiling. 'I want to thank the paramedic team and staff in the hospital. If it wasn't for them, we would never have got the chance to say goodbye.' The family say they would also like to thank Sunderland Royal hospital emergency department, all the doctors who tried to help and the paramedics who got her to hospital. Miss Hudson said: 'Without all of that we would never have got the chance to say goodbye.'","Sophie Allen died at Newcastle Royal Victoria hospital on Saturday .

"By . Patrick Collins . Shortly after being appointed chairman of the Football Association last summer, Greg Dyke declared that one of his main targets was to see England win the World Cup in the desert heat of Qatar in 2022. He said he was aware that such a target could create pressure on players but he was undeterred. ‘Top players must be able to  handle pressure if they want to be winners. We want to be winners,’ he boomed. The ensuing derision was deafening. A few months on, at the draw for the World Cup finals, the cameras caught Dyke making a flamboyant cut-throat gesture as England’s opening match in Manaus was announced. There was an eruption of derision for his public display of despair. Big idea: FA Chairman Greg Dyke reveals the idea for Premier League B Teams . On Thursday, as the centrepiece of his grandiose FA Commission, Dyke announced a plan to introduce Premier League B teams into the Football League by the year 2016-17. The details of this dismantling of a 100-year-old ‘pyramid’ are still evolving but the clamorous derision it provoked was encapsulated in one sublime tweet from Accrington Stanley: ‘In 2016-17 we can achieve our dream… We’ll finally be able to play Stoke City Reserves in the Football League.’ Alan Pardew has a meeting this week with Mike Ashley. With his job on the line, the Newcastle manager will attempt to persuade the club owner that 50,000 Geordies can be wrong. At such times, Pardew likes to quote a piece of cod philosophy. ‘Life is a rocky road,’ he says. ‘And when it gets rocky, you have to stay strong and focused.’ The voice of the great David Brent floats back down the years: ‘If you want the rainbow, you’ve got to put up with the rain. Do you know which “philosopher” said that? Dolly Parton. And people say she’s just a big pair of tits.’ I sense a pattern emerging here, and its thread is the personality of chairman Dyke. As his brilliant career in media and commerce would suggest, this is a man of enormous ability, with  bubbling self-confidence and a tumbling stream of ideas. But, as his experience at the FA vividly demonstrates, those virtues are occasionally accompanied by a curiously naive desire to make an extravagant impact, to pose at the centre of events. The World Cup ‘target’ was the kind of thing which might have been spouted by a third-rate politician, while the ‘cut-throat’ affair smacked of simple showing-off. But the latest episode is more complicated and a good deal more troubling. For the fact is that Dyke’s Commission have illuminated some long-standing problems and have come up with some thoughtful solutions. The fact that only 32 per cent of players who started Premier League matches in the 2012-13 season were qualified to play for England is a disturbing statistic. In Spain, the starting figure for Spanish players was 59 per cent, while in Germany and Italy almost 50 per cent were qualified for the national teams. To cite such statistics is not to promote some crass, Ukipian fear of Johnny Foreigner; rather, it is to illustrate the scope of the problem which faces the England manager, Roy Hodgson. Bad move: Dyke mimics cutting his throat after England's group for the World Cup is announced . Raise your game: Danny Mills claims lower league players will raise their game against reserve sides . Dyke’s Commission propose that the number of home-grown players required in a Premier League squad of 25 should be increased from eight to 13 and, in a smaller Football League squad, from six to 12. They also demand drastic reform of  the flawed process by which clubs can sign players who do not hold a European Union passport and believe there should be a cap of two non-EU players in any Premier League squad. Both of which address the way in which a stream of low-priced mediocrities infiltrate the English game. Come the autumn, there will be potentially valuable reports on our gross under-investment in coaching and the embarrassing neglect of grassroots facilities. But such measures do not make a headline or lead a television news bulletin. They are not what Dyke sees as a Big Idea. And so we were treated to the B teams notion, a palpable nonsense which distorts a decent competition, demeans a host of small, proud clubs and offers little but worthless confusion to ambitious players parachuted in from the Premier League. Danny Mills, once an agricultural full-back and now a member of Dyke’s Commission, attempted to sell the dubious fantasy to a still more dubious public. ‘I guarantee that every single player that plays against them (the cossetted tyros of the Premier League) will raise their game,’ he said. ‘There will be a pride, there will be an ego and it’ll be, “We do not want these  little upstarts with loads of money to come and beat us”.’ What a pretty picture that paints and . what an appealing prospect it opens up! Fear and loathing in League . Three; who could resist it? It was the same Mills, incidentally, who . reflected: ‘If England were to win the World Cup, it would be the . exception rather than the rule.’ Small wonder that Dyke was so anxious . to have the sage on board. Man with a plan: Dyke and his report has attracted plenty of publicity . Opposition to the proposal is growing by the day, beginning with the Premier and Football Leagues and continuing through the Conference and the unconsulted masses of football fans. There must be a real chance that the entire project will be swept away in the storm of protest and derision. Given the work which has gone into the saner parts of the scheme, that would be a great shame. Yet if it should happen, then Dyke will have only himself to blame. As a reforming chairman of the FA, he has much to offer the national game. But as a frustrated song and dance man, courting the spotlight and remorselessly seeking the next Big Idea, he is betraying a rare and valuable talent. Hodgson can only go with what he’s got . After his remarkable playing career, the late Alan Ball found football management rather more difficult. He toiled at the trade but the bad days outnumbered the good. On one such day, as he sat cursing in the dugout, he decided to make a substitution. ‘Who would you like to bring on, boss?’, asked his assistant. Ball smiled. ‘Well, Bobby Charlton, Geoff Hurst and Bobby Moore for starters,’ he said. ‘But I reckon I’ll have to make do with what I’ve got’. Decision time: Roy Hodgson names his squad for the World Cup this week . Roy Hodgson will recognise the feeling. When he announces his World Cup squad on Monday, Hodgson will strike an optimistic tone. Yet he will surely experience pangs of apprehension. Essentially, his chosen 23 selects itself because there are few alternatives to whom he can  turn. For what it’s worth, my own version would be: . Goalkeepers: Hart (Man City), Foster (WBA), Forster (Celtic). Defenders: Johnson (Liverpool), Cahill (Chelsea), Jagielka (Everton), Caulker (Cardiff),  Jones (Man Utd), Baines (Everton), Cole (Chelsea), Shaw (Southampton). Midfielders: Gerrard (Liverpool), Lallana (Southampton), Sterling (Liverpool), Wilshere (Arsenal), Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Milner (Man City), Henderson (Liverpool), Barkley (Everton). Strikers: Rooney (Man Utd), Welbeck (Man Utd), Sturridge (Liverpool), Lambert (Southampton). No go: Andy Carroll looks unlikely to be included in the World Cup squad . Young star: Southampton's Luke Shaw is a possible contender for the England squad . Astonishingly, there has been some support for Andy Carroll, the primitive striker who has scored twice in 14 appearances for West Ham this season. Equally bizarre is the campaign to include the 35-year-old Frank Lampard, on the grounds that he is an affable fellow who will spread good cheer. If England really need to accommodate an amiable midfielder whose best days are far behind him, then Sir Trevor Brooking must be in with a shout. Far better, I suggest, to risk overloading the quota of full-backs and offer the experience to Luke Shaw, whose professional future seems thrillingly predictable. So there it is; scarcely a collection to terrify Argentina, Germany, Spain or Belgium, far less Brazil. But, in the absence of a Charlton, Hurst or Moore, then Roy Hodgson must make do with  what he’s got.","FA chairman Dyke keen to introduce Premier League B Teams .

"By . Alex Greig . The secretary of defense has denied a fallen Marine a Medal of Honor and will not reconsider the San Diego man for the honor. Sergeant Rafael Peralta was killed in Iraq in 2004 after he smothered a grenade with his own body to protect other soldiers, according to witness Marines. However, secretary Chuck Hagel sided with his two predecessors who each deemed that Peralta does not meet the the 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt' standard required for the country's highest award for bravery. Died in action: U.S. Marine Sergeant Rafael Peralta was killed during a house-to-house search in Fallujah . According to the Los Angeles Times, Peralta was an immigrant from Mexico who enlisted the same day he received his green card. He was leading Marines in clearing houses of insurgents in Fallujah when he pulled a grenade under his body after being injured, smothering the blast and saving the lives of his comrades. However, a panel reviewing Peralta's nomination agreed with medical evidence that found he was already dead from a head wound and that any action in smothering the grenade was involuntary. Peralta was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously, the military's second-highest honor. Part of the citation accompanying the award reads: . 'Without hesitation and with complete disregard for his own personal safety, Sergeant Peralta reached out and pulled the grenade to his body, absorbing the brunt of the blast and shielding fellow Marines only feet away. 'Sergeant Peralta succumbed to his wounds. By his undaunted courage, intrepid fighting spirit, and unwavering devotion to duty, Sergeant Peralta reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.' Bravery: Reports from fellow Marines indicate Peralta pulled a grenade beneath him as he lay wounded on the floor of a house in Fallujah and absorbed the deadly blast to protect the others . The decision was heartbreaking for Peralta’s family, who refused to accept the Navy Cross, insisting that he had earned the higher award. Many Marines who bore witness to the event are indignant at the rejection of the man who they believe saved their lives. Robert Reynolds told the Washington Post that what he witnessed the day Peralta died was the type of heroism 'you only hear about in boot camp... He gave me a chance to a second life.' Adam Morrison, a staff sergeant who is stil la Marine said, 'I am honored to have been trained and fought alongside Sgt. Peralta. I believe Sgt. Peralta saved my life.' Write caption here . U.S. representative Duncan Hunter had been campaigning since 2012 for the Department of Defense to reconsider Peralta for a third time. The Los Angeles Times reports that Hunter felt that new evidence in the form of pictures detailing the damage done to Peralta's body armor and rifle proved that the grenade exploded under Peralta's body justified a reopening of the case. 'I fully respect Secretary Hagel's decision, and I'm grateful for the extraordinary amount of time and attention he's dedicated to reviewing this case,' said Hunter in a statement to NBC 7 Saturday. Peralta was initially nominated for the honor by seven Marines who fought with him that day. Heartbreak: The Marine's family rejcted the Navy Cross because they believe Peralta deserves the higher honor . Douglas Sterner, an Army veteran of the Vietnam War and curator of the Military Times Hall of Valor, told U-T San Diego that Peralta is being held to an unfair standard. 'The Medal of Honor is recommended by the comrades in arms that witness the action. It has to go through a vetting process, but the individuals who witness the action should be the basis on which that medal is awarded. 'I have never heard ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ used in the same sentence as Medal of Honor before. It’s a legal term, not a military term,' he said. Peralta's brother enlisted in the Marines in 2010 to keep a promise he made at his fallen brother's funeral. 'Peralta has a Navy Cross. That can never be taken away and his legacy will endure, and that's something that no one can take away from him, his family or the Marine Corps,' said Hunter’s statement.","Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has rejected a bid for Sergeant Rafael Peralta to be awarded the Medal of Honor .

"By . Lorraine Candy . The Tiger Mother has sent me over the edge this week. I've spent hours fantasising about repeatedly clumping her over the head with one of my two-year-old’s mangled Barbies in an act of maternal revenge. Amy Chua, who put us all on the naughty step because our toddlers couldn't play the harp or speak five languages, has given interviews across the world claiming that her controversial parenting book, Battle Hymn Of The Tiger Mother was meant to be ironic, that her hardline guide to bringing up successful children was a bit of a laugh. She may not have actually used those words, but may as well have done. She now claims that the book, which caused a parental firestorm, was only ‘a tenth’ true, and that even though she told thousands of anxious parents that TV should be banned and encouraging free will is the path to C not A-grades - she didn't mean it. Now she tells us: Amy Chua caused controversy with her parenting book, right, but said recently it's meant to be ironic . Sure she once called one daughter 'garbage' for some minor misdemeanour and threw away the other's DIY birthday card because it wasn't artistic enough, but in reality she wasn't anywhere near as rigorous in her boot-camp parenting as she had claimed. Most irritating of all, she said that if she were to write the book again - or have another go at bringing up her two daughters, now aged 18 and 21 - she would be even more permissive than she secretly was. She would be more like us, the mothers she made feel like failures as we didn't demand more from our offspring. What a cruel trick to play. Out of her international bestseller, a term - Tiger Mother - was born and debated endlessly. It is now part of the parenting conversation. The 2011 book also prompted a round of unhelpful questions over what exactly is the right regime to bring up 'better' children. Born to it . Tiger Mother author Amy Chua was born in 1962, Chinese year of the tiger . Even though I had no intention of taking any notice of what she recommended, I still felt the cold wind of disapproval at my own parenting style. Should I be doing more, pushing them harder at school? Maybe they should be practising something worthy as opposed to repeatedly videoing themselves pretending to trip over the sleeping dog in order to make a fake You’ve Been Framed film. Perhaps I shouldn't have laughed so hard at the flyer for Kumon maths and instead signed them up for Saturday morning classes? This is why I am so furious at Amy Chua's revelation that she duped us into believing her extreme parenting methods were real. Every day new clues on the best way to be a mum are flung at us because we’re such a fragile, eager audience, desperate to devour any useful fact. After all, none of us has done this before, and it’s terrifying. We pounce on knowledge like sugar addicts on a Walnut Whip. Will our way turn out to be the right way? Will the latest received wisdom help make sense of the mothering conundrums? We don't expect a Wizard-of-Oz-like deception. It makes us feel bad, Amy. I can cope with medics now blaming that glass of wine I had when I was nine months' pregnant for my 10-year-old's inability to do vulgar fractions, but a whole furore created (and then endlessly debated) by a book that wasn't even true is infuriating. It's disrespectful. It turns out that the Tiger Mother has no more insight than any of  the other parenting tomes like S*** My Dad Says by Justin Halpern, which is at least funny, or French Children Don't Throw Food by Pamela Druckerman, which is accidentally funny. Amy Chua's new book, written with husband Jed Rubenfeld, which prompted her to give these 'clear the air' interviews, sounds dull: an academic foray into the common characteristics which make people from different cultures and religions successful. The Triple Package: What Determines Success is a complicated read that makes me want to retire to a dark room and watch YouTube videos of kittens while I work out just why I’m so unreasonably cross about Tiger Mother’s reckless confession. I feel like writing my own fake Battle Hymn parenting book but other matters are more pressing - getting the theme tune to The Lego Movie, Everything Is Awesome, out of my mind, for one. Actually, maybe that is the title of my new parenting bible. But would you believe anything in a book with that title?

"By . Rachel Quigley . and Lydia Warren . A graphic new image shows the grisly scene just moments after the Miami cannibal was shot dead by police as he chewed off a homeless man's face. It shows Rudy Eugene lying naked in a pool of blood next to his victim Ronald Poppo, who was attacked as he slept by a busy highway. Poppo, whose head is drenched in blood, is naked below the waist after Eugene stripped off his trousers before pummeling him and climbing on top of him. Grisly scene: An image shows Miami Cannibal Rudy Eugene (right) moments after he was shot dead for eating the face of Ronald Poppo (left) The horrific image was taken moments after a Miami-Dade police officer shot Eugene dead after he refused to stop attacking Poppo on May 26. It comes as doctors at Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center revealed that Poppo is now 'awake and alert'. A photograph shown to reporters on Tuesday portrayed Poppo walking down a hospital hallway, supported by hospital staff on either side of him. The man had his left eye removed but doctors are hoping to restore vision in his right eye, which was also severely damaged in the attack. Recovery: Ronald Poppo, the Miami Cannibal victim, is pictured for the first time in hospital after the horrific May 26 attack which left most of his face eaten off . 'He's pleased to report to all of you . that he's feeling well, he's eating, he's walking around with physical . therapy, he's talking with us,' said Nicholas Namias, a University of . Miami trauma surgeon. A photo released by the hospital shows the upper two-thirds of Poppo's face covered in scabs. He's missing his nose and both eye sockets were covered, one with gauze and one with what appeared to be a skin graft. His grey beard was trimmed, leaving a moustache over his upper lip. Doctors at the hospital said the homeless man also has holes in his chest that may be from bullets fired by the police officer who killed his attacker. Nicholas Namias, head of trauma, and Popp's physician, told the Miami Herald that Poppo had two 'mysterious' punctures in his chest. In youth: Ronald Poppo as a student . Then: Ronald Poppo before the brutal attack . Now: Poppo is recovering in hospital . Doctors added that the victim lost his left eye but are trying to save his right eye, which was severely damaged. Poppo also suffered a brain injury during the attack, like that suffered by a car crash victim, the Herald reported. Despite these problems, the medical team said Poppo, who has been in the hospital since the attack on May 26, is doing much better. He has talked about swimming, which he used to enjoy, and he has asked for pizza, orange juice and Italian food. He's asked for the television to be switched off in his room, except when the Miami Heat basketball games are on, Namias said. The doctor said Poppo has not once complained about his pain. Attacker: Rudy Eugene, 31, the naked cannibal, pounced on Poppo as he slept on elevated train tracks in Miami and was shot dead by police officers . 'He's really just sort of living in the moment and just wants to talk about routine things,' he said. Mr Poppo will have to undergo a number of skin grafts to rebuild his face. Doctors have revealed that Ronald Poppo is doing 'well' but has sustained a number of injuries: . Social workers will try to help him find a place to live as he has been homeless for nearly 30 years. A fund set up by the Jackson Memorial . Foundation to assist Poppo has raised $15,000. Poppo also qualifies for . Medicaid and Medicare. 'If he doesn't get his vision back . then it becomes, is he concerned about how he looks or is it more about . how the world sees him? Those are things to think about,' plastic . surgeon Wrood Kassira said. 'I've talked to him about reconstruction and he's said we'll take it one day at a time. He's very logical.' Poppo has been at Jackson Memorial Hospital since he was attacked on May 26 by Rudy Eugene. Emergency callers reported seeing a . naked man swinging from a light pole on Miami's MacArthur Causeway a few . minutes before the attack. Surveillance video from a nearby building shows Eugene stripping Poppo and pummeling him before appearing to lie on top of him. Naked bodies: Rudy Eugene, left, and Poppo, right, after Eugene was shot dead by the Miami-Dade Police when he refused to stop eating the homeless man's face . Horrific: The attack went on for almost 20 minutes as people walked by .

In . the extended video footage of the attack - which lasted almost 20 minutes - a . number of people can be seen cycling and driving past and doing nothing to stop it. After arriving on the scene, officer Jose Rivera shouted at Eugene to stop but he simply got up and growled and continued eating at the man's face. Eugene was then shot and killed . by the Miami police officer. Initial tests revealed that Eugene had a number of undigested pills in his stomach, according to the Miami Herald. Marijuana was also in Eugene's system at the time of the attack. It is believed that Eugene may have . been on ‘bath salts’, a potent hallucinogenic drug, when he carried out . the gruesome assault. Speaking out: Despite the attack, Eugene's girlfriend Yovonka Bryant, pictured with attorney Gloria Allred, described him as a harmless devout Christian . Users of the drug report to feeling no pain. Its effects include paranoia, hallucinations, convulsions and psychotic episodes. A more in-depth toxicology screen for any other possible drugs will take another couple of months to complete.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Murderer: Jason Mitchell, 25, became the second man convicted in the 2007 slaying of Redskins star Sean Taylor when he was sentenced to life in prison by a Miami-Dade judge on Tuesday . A Florida jury convicted a second man on Tuesday in connection with the 2007 murder of Washington Redskins football star Sean Taylor during a botched burglary at his Miami-area home. A 12-person jury deliberated nearly four hours before finding Jason Mitchell, 25, guilty of first-degree felony murder and armed burglary. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Dennis Murphy swiftly imposed the mandatory life sentence for murder, plus 40 more years for the burglary conviction with no chance of parole. Although . trial testimony showed Mitchell did not fire the fatal shot, prosecutors . say he is equally responsible for the slaying under the law. Assistant . State Attorney Reid Rubin said Mitchell hatched the plot that . eventually involved five Fort Myers-area men after spending time at . Taylor's home near Miami, where he saw the player giving friends and . relatives thousands of dollars in cash. Rubin . said Mitchell initially tried and failed to burglarize the home alone . in mid-November 2007, returning with the group on Thanksgiving weekend . to finish the job. 'It . doesn't matter whether they planned to kill him (Taylor) or intended to . kill him, he died as a result of that burglary and they are all . responsible for it,' Rubin told the 12-person jury in closing arguments. 'At the center of it all was Jason Mitchell.' Mitchell . did not testify in his own defense but he did confess to police in a . sworn, videotaped statement. The man blamed for shooting Taylor, Eric . Rivera Jr., was convicted last year of second-degree murder and . sentenced to 57 years behind bars. Mitchell's lawyer, Robert Barrar, . said Mitchell should be held responsible only for burglary, not for . Rivera's actions. American success story gone wrong: Taylor was innocently sleeping with his girlfriend and their baby when he was killed in the bungled robbery attempt . Emotional: Sean Taylor's girlfriend, Jackie Garcia Haley, reacts during testimony at the murder trial of Eric Rivera in Miami-Dade Circuit Court in Miami late last year. She and her baby were in the room when Taylor was murdered . 'Sure . Jason Mitchell was there. But Eric Rivera did it on his own, on a . whim,' Barrar said. 'Jason Mitchell was not a part of any plan to kill . anybody.' Mitchell showed no emotion when the verdict was read. More to come: Two men, Charles Wardlow (pictured) and Timmy Brown, have yet to be tried . Taylor, . 24, was shot in the upper thigh after confronting the group of burglars . with a machete outside his bedroom door. The bullet severed Taylor's . femoral artery, causing him to quickly bleed to death. In the bedroom . when the shooting happened were Taylor's girlfriend and their infant . daughter. Police say the burglars thought Taylor would be out of town at a Redskins game, but he was home nursing a knee injury. Aside from . the confession, investigators found shoe prints at Taylor's house that . matched Mitchell's sneakers and had cell phone evidence showing that . Mitchell phoned another member of the group in the vicinity of the . slaying that night. Three . other men were charged in the case and two are awaiting trial. Venjah . Hunte, 25, previously pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and . burglary charges in a deal that calls for a 29-year prison sentence. Taylor . was a Pro Bowl safety who had starred at the University of Miami. A . first-round Redskins draft pick in 2004, Taylor signed an $18 million . contract with the team and was becoming one of the NFL's top defensive . players when he was slain. 'He had everything to live for,' Rubin said. 'Sean Taylor was on top of the world.'

"By . Naomi Greenaway . Katie Price wearing the £9,000 engagement ring bought by soon-to-be-ex-husband, Keiran Hayler . She may be going through a public split after husband Kieran Hayner cheated with her best friend, but we know at least six huge sparkly reasons Katie Price need not mope. A top jeweller has estimated that her engagement bling collection has doubled in value and is now worth almost £1 million. Over the past past sixteen years, the 35-year-old has had a total of five broken marriages and engagements and the value of her collection of wedding and engagement rings has increased by £325,250. The two rings bought by her first husband Peter Andre, who was her second fiance, have increased in value the most. Andre's diamond-encrusted silver wedding ring has shot up from £350,000 when it was bought in 2005, to £600,000 today. Andre's engagement ring takes up the . entire first half of her finger and contains a . multitude of diamonds. Since splitting from Andre, she has . had it crafted into a beautiful bangle which she plans to pass on to . daughter Princess. The bangle, with all the ring's . original diamonds, has been valued at £250,000. Celebrity . jeweller Vashi Dominguez, who compiled Katie's bling list, said: 'Katie . has been very astute in her choice of rings - the price is definitely . right for Pricey. 'She has shown . surprisingly good taste in all her choices. If only she had similarly . good judgement when it comes to men!' Katie’s . first engagement ring was a world away from her more recent extravagant . tastes - a classic £3,500 diamond ring, bought for her in 1997 by body . builder Waren Furman - better known as gladiator Ace. Scroll down for video . Katie Price brandishing her enormous square wedding ring and her engagement ring from then-husband Peter Andre at the launch of her perfume in 2007 . They split shortly after the engagement, she had better luck with the ring which has increased in value and is now worth £6,000. By . the time her Peter Andre proposed six years later in 2004, (after . the pair met on TV show I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here) Katie was the most famous woman . in UK showbiz, and her £180,000 sparkler fitted in perfectly. Katie, who has had the diamonds fashioned into a bangle, said: 'When I'm older Princess will get the bracelet with the diamonds I married her dad with. It has not gone to waste.' Katie's heart-shaped pink sapphire from Leandro Penna (left) which she returned to Harrod's after hearing it hadn't been fully paid for and her over-sized wedding ring from Peter Andre (right) now worth £600,000 . After four years, the fairy-tale romance with Andre was over. Vashi, who often appears on ITV's This Morning as a jewellery expert, said: 'The marriage may have . ended in tears but Katie has done very well out of the rings. 'Tastes . change very quickly but there is huge demand for this kind of bling . jewellery, particularly with the economy in Britain doing so well and so . much foreign money being invested here, especially in London. If . Katie was ever to sell the rings, she would make a huge profit.' The . millionaire model then found love in 2009 with martial arts fighter . Alex Reid, who was smitten within two weeks and popped the question in a . matter of months. Katie's ring from Alex Reid has shot up in value from £25,00 to £42,00 . He . presented his fiancée with a huge peach rock on a vast diamond-encrusted . mount, valued then at £25,000 and now worth £42,000. The couple went on to marry but by 2012 the love was gone. She . then moved on to toyboy Leandro Penna who gave her a pink heart-shaped ring . in 2012, costing £15,000 from Harrods - it is now worth £25,000. But shortly after the engagagement she discovered that the ring had not been paid for and returned it to the store. In January last year, Katie got engaged to stripper Kieran Hayner, nine years her junior. The 26-year-old presented her with a more modest silver band worth of £9,000. The couple married later in the year and had son Jett Riviera . together. It was a more . classic, less extravagant number, reflecting a slightly toned-down . overall image for the mum-of-five. The ring is now worth £9,750. Katie, . now six months pregnant with Kieran’s second child, revealed last week . that her husband has been cheating with her best friend Jane Pountney . for the past seven months – and now plans to divorce him. But we can't see Katie being left on the shelf, so no doubt the sixth engagement ring is still to come. Originally Princess Diana's, Kate's ring consists of 14 solitaire diamonds surrounding a 12-carat oval blue Ceylon blue sapphire and set in white gold . Vashi, founder of online diamond and jewellery retailer Vashi.com, reckons Katie's next ring could be the biggest yet. Vashi . said: 'Katie Price is the poster girl for larger than life allure and . she abhors subtlety - instead preferring over-the-top sexiness and . sparkle. Bling should be her middle name. I can’t see her ever being . content with a tiny traditional engagement ring!' Katie's not the only famous face whose finger candy has shot up in value. Undoubtedly the most famous engagement ring in the world, Kate Middleton's sapphire sparkler has increased more than ten-fold. The piece of jewellery consists of 14 solitaire diamonds surrounding a 12-carat oval blue Ceylon sapphire set in 18-karat white gold. It was originally the engagement ring of the late Princess Diana and was worth £28,000 when it was bought in 1981, but is now valued at £300,000. The stunning sparkler sits at the top of a list of the 20 famous rings, placed in order of how much each has appreciated in value since they were first given. Kate's engagement ring, seen here as she cradled Prince George during the royal tour of of Australia, has increased in value 10 times since it was given to Princess Diana more than 30 years ago . Kate’s ring is now worth three times more than the Queen's engagement ring. The Queen's modest engagement token, presented by Prince Phillip in 1947, has increased in value from £10,000 to £100,000 today and comes second on the list. A 3-carat diamond solitaire is flanked on each side by five smaller diamonds, all set in platinum. The diamonds were taken from a tiara owned by Prince Phillip’s mother, adding a sweet heritage touch. The Duchess of Cornwall's band - a beautiful 1930s Art Deco design - was the most expensive of the royal betrothal rings at its purchase, up from £100,000 at the time of her wedding to Prince Charles in 2004 to £250,000 now.

Prime Minister's wife Samantha Cameron's engagement ring is estimated to have been worth £25,000 when it was given to her ahead of their 1994 wedding. It is now worth £45,000 and comes seventh on the list. Vashi . said: 'Samantha Cameron rarely shows off her engagement ring, so it's a . treat when we see pictures of it.

"By . Sean Poulter . A TV commercial for a burger has been banned because it encouraged unhealthy eating habits in move that could force food giants to radically change marketing tactics. The decision was made because the burger was given to a child who was seen removing the salad before tucking in. Parents complained that it is difficult enough already to get youngsters to eat healthy salad and greens without a prime time TV commercial suggesting it is okay to push them to the side of the plate. Ban: An image from the Morrisons advert which has sparked outrage as the child is seen removing salad . The commercial for the Morrisons supermarket chain was in breach of a rarely used section of an industry code which states advertisers ‘must not disparage good dietary practice’. Campaigners welcomed the ruling announced today by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and called on it take a much tougher stand on the advertising of foods, particularly those loved by children. The complaints centred on a TV commercial for Britain’s fourth largest supermarket and featured the chain’s 100per cent British beef burgers which were being given to a little girl as a reward. The ASA said: ‘A TV ad showed a mother preparing a burger for her daughter, who was talking about her day at school. ‘The mother stacked lettuce, tomato and onion on top of the burger and sealed it with the top of the bun. She then passed it to her daughter, who had just said ‘My teacher said I was the best in the whole class’.’ Struggle: Parents have berated the advert claiming it is already difficult trying to get their children to eat healthily without adverts telling them not to . However, it said the girl removed the lettuce, tomato and onion from the bun, putting it on the side of her plate, before smiling broadly as she prepared to take a bite. A voice over then stated ‘Love quarter-pounders. Love them cheaper’ over an image of burgers being cooked. Before being screened the commercial was vetted and approved by the industry body Clearcast, which thought the images and message were entirely harmless. It argued that while the girl did take the salad items out of the bun, she ‘did not look disdainfully at the salad items or make a face that implied she did not like them or would not eat them in the future’. Clearcast said the salad was not thrown away and the girl made no attempt to hide it. It suggested the girl had simply taken it out to make eating the burger easier and might, possibly, have eaten it later. However, this failed to convince the watchdog. It argued that the message given was that the daughter was so eager to eat the burger on its own that she immediately removed the salad, so ‘choosing the option with less nutritional value’. The ASA said: ‘We noted the girl grabbed all the salad in her hand and dropped it on the side in a careless manner, before placing her hands around the bun, ready to eat and smiling, which we considered suggested she was not going to eat the salad later. ‘Because we considered the ad placed an emphasis on the burger being the preferable option to the salad, we concluded it condoned poor nutritional habits or an unhealthy lifestyle, especially in children, and that it disparaged good dietary practice.’ This rule is very rarely used. The last time the ASA acted against an advertiser promoting unhealthy foods was in 2012 and involved the Swizzles Matlow sweet company. At that time it banned a ‘Cola Capers’ online game for irresponsibly encouraging poor nutritional habits and unhealthy lifestyles in children. The use of popular cartoon character, Scooby Doo, on another section of the website, was also banned. The Children’s Food Campaign has been putting pressure on the ASA to take a much firmer line on the advertising of foods high in sugar, fat and salt to children. Campaign co-ordinator, Malcolm Clark welcomed the ruling, saying: ‘It is one of the first occasions we have seen the ASA willing to uphold a complaint for an advert condoning or encouraging poor nutritional habits or an unhealthy lifestyle in children. Claims: Morrisons insists it has made huge efforts to encourage healthy eating with its own-label food . ‘We hope this is the shape of things to come, with the ASA taking a more pro-active approach to protecting children from the mass of high fat, salt, sugar foods marketed at them and encourage healthier eating. ‘However, one swallow – in this case an upheld complaint – does not make a summer. The wording of the advertising codes is vague and inconsistent; the rules for non-broadcast advertising are weaker than for TV and contain many loopholes for companies to exploit; and the complaints process can be hard to navigate and is still too often stacked in favour of the food industry. ‘The ASA, the government, retailers and manufacturers still have a long way to go properly tackle the obesogenic environment that is helping to make our children ill.’ Morrisons insisted it has made huge efforts to encourage healthy eating in children, by, for example, improving the recipes of its own-label food. It said the commercial was simply a fun representation of the problems that parents have in getting youngsters to eat well. A spokesman said: ‘Trying to convince children to eat their fruit and vegetables is something that most parents will identify with. Our aim with the ad was to reflect this in a humorous and engaging way. We’re disappointed with the ASA’s adjudication.’","New advert for Morrisons shows child removing salad from her burger .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez is to face trial for a double drive-by shooting in 2015, a judge ruled on Tuesday. The former tight end, who is accused of shooting dead two men in 2012, smiled and looked relaxed in court as he chatted to his attorney before the hearing. His lawyers have asked Judge Jeffrey Locke to issue a gag order to prevent anyone involved in the case from commenting outside court. Scroll down for video . Relaxed: NFL star Aaron Hernandez smiles in court on Tuesday. A trial date of May 2015 has been set for the murder trial the former New England Patriots football player is facing . Victims: Safiro Furtado, left, and Daniel de Abreu, right, were shot dead in a drive-by shooting in 2012 . Attorney James Sultan said the defense was concerned that Hernandez would be unable to get a fair trial because of extensive coverage of his indictment in the double shooting of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado after a random encounter in a nightclub. Hernandez is also facing charges over the murder of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, who was shot dead in June last year. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges in both cases. 'I think it's incumbent upon all of us ... to do whatever we can to safeguard Mr Hernandez's constitutional right to a fair trial and a jury that has not been poisoned by unfairly prejudicial pretrial publicity,' Sultan said. He argued that a judge in Bristol County, where Hernandez is charged with killing Lloyd, had issued a gag order in that case. Smiling: Hernandez gestures with his hands, while they are still in handcuffs, as he waits for his hearing . The football player laughs and looks relaxed before the hearing to set his trial date for double murder . Prosecutors opposed the request. Assistant District Attorney Patrick Haggan called a gag order 'unreasonable' and 'unwarranted' and said it not the usual practice in Suffolk County. Haggan said Hernandez's lawyers were suggesting that 'because of his celebrity and his public figure status that Mr Hernandez should not be held to the rules of this court'. Haggan said prosecutors involved in the Hernandez case had not made any improper statements outside court. Sultan disagreed, saying that District Attorney Dan Conley had 'held a press conference' after the indictments against Hernandez were issued and again after he was arraigned. The judge took the request under advisement and did not indicate when he would rule. Locke made it clear that the May 28 trial date is only tentative. He acknowledged that the date could change because Hernandez's trial in Lloyd's killing is scheduled for October. Charges: Hernandez, pictured arriving at Suffolk Superior Court on Tuesday, is accused of being involved in three murders .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Dead from a snake bite: Timothy Levins died about half an hour after being bitten by a copperhead snake . A Missouri father died Tuesday in front of his young son after being bitten by a copperhead snake. Timothy Levins, 52, was bitten by the poisonous snake while camping with family at Sam A. baker State Park, about 100 miles south of St Louis. Liam Levins, 11, told police his father walked out of their rented cabin, saw the snake, picked it up and it bit him, KFVS reported. He then went back inside the cabin to wash his hands and soon started shaking before passing out on a couch, the boy said, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The incident occurred around 9.00 p.m., and Levins was unresponsive when first responders arrived, sources told the station. Levins had three bites on his hand from the 18-20 inch snake, and he was rushed to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead. An autopsy soon revealed that Levins died from anaphylactic shock due to the bite, the coroner said.His death is only the third in state history from a snake bite, KSDK reported. ‘That’s just a horrible thing,’ camper Bonnie Roberts told KFVS. The other snake bite deaths were in 2012 and 1965, a park ranger added. Deadly: A copperhead snake similar to this one bit Levins . Where it happened: Levins picked the snake up off the grass outside this cabin, his son told police . ‘Most of the time when people die from a copperhead bite, which is usually what they say, it’s usually not from the actual bite, it’s because they had a previous medical condition,’ Sara Turner, from the Missouri Department of Conservation, told KFVS. The majority of people bit by the venomous snakes only experience discomfort, and about a quarter of those bites are ‘dry’ – they have no venom, according to the Missouri Department of Conservation. ‘The snake is trying to scare away an intruder, not kill you,’ says the agency’s website. Campers and park officials stressed that the best thing to do if one comes across a copperhead, or any other snake, is to scare it away by making a loud noise – or just run away. Levins is survived by his wife and three children.","Timothy Levins, 52, died about half an hour after the snake bit him .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Residents of a California community are furious after a violent sexual predator was released from a California mental hospital only to have his rent, around-the-clock security detail and even his food paid for by the state. Christopher Hubbart, 63, and known as the ‘Pillowcase Rapist,’ was released into the town of Lake Los Angeles following decades behind bars after admitting to the rapes and attempted rapes of more than 100 women, officials said. Death threats and protests began hours before he arrived in the desert community, and even his security guards are fearing for their life, KNBC reported. Then and now: Christopher Hubbart, known as the 'Pillowcase Rapist' shown in an undated mug shot from decades ago at left and just before his release at right - he is now a free man . Freed: Hubbard is shown walking into his new home only hours after being released from prison . Hubbart was called the ‘Pillowcase Rapist’ because he used pillowcases to muffle the screams of his victims, and locals protested his arrival by hanging them on a fence ringing his property. Plans to release Hubbart have long been met with opposition, and it took authorities months to find a landlord willing to rent him a home. The state convinced another ex-con, who spent eight years in prison for hiring a hit man to kill his wife, to rent the home for about $2,800 a month, KTLA reported. Similar homes in the area are listed on Craigslist for less than half what the state is paying. ‘We don’t want you here,’ several people shouted as his two car security detail rolled down the dusty road towards the 800-square-foot, two-bedroom ranch set back from the road and wrapped in a wire fence. ‘Be afraid! Be very afraid! Because we won't let you scare us! We want you out! Get out!’ The ranch-style home has no television and has been referred to by his security details as ‘spartan,’ KABC reported. Free ride: Hubbart, shown leaving prison, will have his rent, food, security and other expenses covered by the state . Home sweet home: Hubbard was released to this Lake Los Angeles home . Not welcome: Locals hung pillowcases on the fence ringing Hubbart's home before he arrived . ‘I will stay until he wants to leave. I will stay here until he asks the judge that he wants to leave,’ resident Norma Valenti told KNBC. ‘We don't want him here. ‘We don't want him in this community. We don't want him wandering around our town, our children, our mothers, our grandmothers, our wives. We don't want him around.’ A spokesperson with Sunset Protective Services, the firm hired to protect Hubbart, told reporters gathered outside the house that the convicted rapist is ‘optimistic and hopes he can reintegrate back into society and live a normal life.’ Those security guards began Hubbart’s reintegration by shoving around a freelance cameraman trying to snap photos of the sex offender as he arrived at his new home. ‘I’m very angry,’ Valenti seethed to KTLA. ‘Everybody’s afraid. They’re literally scared and fearing for their lives because this man is here.’ Sources told KNBC they may face misdemeanour assault charges for the dustup. The guards will be by Hubbart’s side 24 hours a day and seven days a week. They will even do his food shopping, according to reports. 'We don't want you here!': Protestors have vowed to shout and chant outside the rapist's home until he is gone for good . Fracas: Hubbart's security guards shoved a cameraman around as he shouted 'you can't touch me!' They may face misdemeanor assault charges for the dustup . Not welcome: Even cars and trucks show messages of resentment towards the convicted rapist . Despite them, and a GPS ankle bracelet, residents are still worried. ‘I know for me it's a litte personal, being a rape victim myself, mother of four Misty Vivirito told KABC. ‘My kids, I'm gonna put them in independent study,’ she continued. ‘I'm not going to send them to school or a bus stop, have them sitting there waiting for the bus and him come and try anything.’ Local officials also vented their outrage at the serial rapist’s release into their community. Words cannot express my frustration at Christopher Evans Hubbart’s release to Lake Los Angeles. In the last year I’ve heard a great deal about Mr. Hubbart’s Constitutional rights,’ state assemblyman Steve Fox said in a statement. ‘This fight is not over. Serial rapists and pedophiles belong in prison, not next door.’ Hubbart was originally released from prison in 1979 only the continue raping women until he was tossed behind bars for 16 years. He then raped more women and was thrown back in jail in 1996. ‘Once again, the State's criminal justice system failed to uphold its responsibility to protect the public's safety,’ L.A. County Supervisor Michael Antonovich said in a statement. ‘The Santa Clara County Judge's decision to dump a convicted serial rapist in our community is dangerous and reckless.’","Christopher Hubbart, 63, has been released from prison a THIRD time after admitting to the rape and attempted rape of over 100 women .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Three star athletes at a rural Georgia high school have turned themselves in over allegations they took part in the brutal sexual assault of a fellow female student at their senior prom. Fields Chapman, Andrew Haynes and Avery Johnson also all 18-years-old, are accused of sexually assaulting the teen girl May 10 at a raging alcohol-fueled party held at a rented log cabin just outside Calhoun, where all four reside. Gilmer County authorities said the trio inserted a foreign object ‘causing tearing and severe trauma’ into their victim while other students watched but did nothing to stop the attack. It has also been revealed that no parents were present for the party. Scroll down for video . The quarterback: Fields Chapman faces multiple counts related to the sexual assault, 28 counts of sexual exploitation of a minor and was revealed to have been on probation the night of the alleged attack . The unidentified victim claimed to police the next day that she passed out in an upstairs bathroom and claimed she had been raped after blacking out, sources told WSB. She reported the sexual assault from a hospital bed where she was being treated for her injuries, but admitted she could not remember her attackers names or faces. About two dozen high schools and other young adults were at the party, according to the station. Many of them brought beer and liquor to the cabin. Chapman, Haynes and Johnson each faces counts of aggravated sexual battery, sexual assault and sodomy for the attack, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Chapman also faces 28 separate counts of sexual exploitation of a minor after police found more than two-dozen sexually explicit photos of an underage girl performing various sex acts at the party, sources told the paper. All three were indicted Monday by a grand jury. The tight end: Andrew Haynes faces counts of sexual battery, aggravated sexual assault and sodomy . The baseball player: Avery Johnson faces the same charges as Haynes, all three were barred from their graduation ceremony . The girl in the pictures is not believed to be the one sexually assaulted that night, District Attorney Alison Sosebee told the AJC. The teens, who graduated last month, do not face charges of rape because investigators have been unable to prove they actually had sexual intercourse with their victim, according to WRCB. Haynes and Chapman had each been arrested several months prior to the May incident for underage drinking, and Chapman was on probation at the time of the alleged assault, the AJC reported. More than 50 witnesses have been interviewed during the investigation, authorities said, and the local sheriff plans to charge anyone found to have been consuming alcohol despite being under the age of 21, he previously announced. Calhoun High School: Were all the students involved graduated from earlier this year . ‘Alcohol and teenagers just do not go together,’ an official said at a previous press conference.The allegations led to all three of the accused to be barred from attending their graduation ceremony despite having graduated, according to reports. Chapman played quarterback for the Calhoun High School football team. Haynes was a tight end and Johnson was a pitcher and third baseman for the baseball team. The students were well known athletes and appear to have popular among their peers. Reactions to the allegations ranged from shock to disappointment. ‘A party is a party, but that’s just ridiculous what happened after it,’ student Jessie Kincaid told WSB. ‘That’s taking it too far,’ said another. ‘One thing about having fun, but there’s another about breaking the law,’ said a third student. A parent called the situation ‘a shame,’ in comments to the station.

His mother and brother were among those in court, as were family members of Odin Lloyd, the 27-year-old Boston semi-professional football player Hernandez is accused of killing in June 2013. Hernandez is also charged in Boston in the 2012 killings of two men. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases. Prosecutors did not object to moving Hernandez from the Bristol County House of Correction in Dartmouth, which is about an hour and 20 minutes' drive south of Boston, but they shot down defense lawyers' claims that the former tight end's privacy and due process rights were violated by the jail administrator. Judge Susan Garsh ordered the move without addressing his privacy concerns. It is not clear when Hernandez will be moved or where he will be going. Garsh did not specify a jail when she approved the request, other than saying it should be closer to Boston, such as in Suffolk County. Hernandez would be moved back to Bristol County if the Lloyd case goes to trial, she added. Garsh also said she was concerned that a tentative trial date of Oct. 6 was not realistic given the amount of evidence and additional motions she anticipates will be filed. One of Hernandez's lawyers, James Sultan, told her he anticipated that it was possible they would file for a change of venue. 'We're not prepared to do that now,' he said. 'That may well be coming.' When asked outside court for his thoughts on a possible venue change, District Attorney Sam Sutter would say only that it would be debated, and it did not sound as if that was something the judge was considering. Garsh asked both sides to get back to her with their thoughts on whether Oct. 6 is a realistic trial date.

The body of a 2-year-old girl was pulled from a lake in a popular Brooklyn park after her parents reported her missing. Ruhshona Kurbonova was found dead Saturday just before 6.00 p.m. by divers after a frantic five-hour search of Prospect Park that involved divers and helicopters, police said. The girl and her four-year-old brother were playing near the lake when they both fell in, witnesses told the New York Post. The boy was pulled to safety before disappearing into the pond's murky depths, which police said offer zero visibility. Another police source told the paper the bottom of the lake is like quicksand. Officers combed the 585-acre park handing out missing person's fliers while divers searched the murky lake and a police helicopter hovered above. Kurbonova's brother was eventually reunited with her mother, who held out hope the young girl would be found alive but then collapsed in grief when told of her daughter's fate, according to the Post. Another source told the New York Daily News the woman had to be taken away on a stretcher. Uncle Dekzod Isokov told the Post the two siblings disappeared while the family was grilling shish kabobs on the radiant afternoon. They just left,' he said. 'They walked off and we didn’t know.'

Another witness, Angela Peterson, told the paper she saw who she believed to be the pair's older brother running though the park shouting in another language as the mother frantically trailed after him. 'I heard the mother say, ‘Oh my god! Oh my god!’ She was so distraught,' Peterson recalled. A group in the park for a church picnic said a few good samaritans who pulled Kurbonova's brother out of the lake brought the algae-covered boy to them asking if he was theirs. 'They kept asking people, ‘Is this your son?’ until the family said, ‘That’s my son,’ and then asked if they found a little girl with him,' one of the picnic-goers said. A person called 911 saying a woman approached her shouting 'my babies! 'She didn’t speak much English,' the caller said.

The family asked for privacy while they mourn his death. The Harris County Sheriff’s Office told the Chronicle Frazier was awoken just before 1.00 a.m. by a noise in his garage. He then . grabbed his gun and went to investigate. A brief struggle ended with the . thief shooting the minister dead, authorities said. Deputies . found Durham only blocks away with blood on his shirt, shorts and legs. He accepted blame for the killing during a ride to the station. Where it happened: Frazier was shot dead in the garage of his suburban Houston home, pictured here . Talented: Frazier made a career out of playing piano and keyboard in Christian bands . ‘Durham was transported to the Sheriff’s Office Homicide Unit, where he provided investigators with a statement admitting to the shooting,’ a police source said. The firearm was found in a nearby trash can, cops said. It was also revealed by the paper that a neighborhood watch person stopped Durham earlier in the night as he lurked through the subdivision, but he claimed to be visiting his mother and was only going for a walk. Frazier was ordained in 1974 at only 18-years-old, according to his website. He does not appear to have had his own church, but traveled often while playing in Christian bands and counselling others. Durham appears to have had more than a few run-ins with the law, criminal records showed. He has multiple DWI convictions and has spent time behind bars in the past, as well as on probation. The admitted killer faces a single count of murder, it is not known when he will first appear in court.","Donald Frazier, 69 was shot with his own gun by a suspected robber .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Joshua Gardner . The man . mauled by a great white shark this weekend at a popular southern . California beach has finally opened up about the terrifying attack. Steven . Robles, 40, was bitten by the seven-foot beast around 9.30 . a.m. Saturday morning at Manhattan Beach while it was snagged on a . fishing line, it panicked and bit the swimmer out of fear while trying . to wriggle free. 'It . came from the bottom of the water. It came up to the surface, it looked . at me and attacked me right on the side of my chest,' Robles told KABC. 'That all happened within two seconds.' Scroll down for video... In good spirits: Steven Robles pictured with his wife during an interview on local television in which he described the horrifying ordeal . 'I saw the . eyes of the shark as I was seeing it swim towards me,' he continued. 'It lunged at my chest, and it locked into my chest.' Lucky to be alive: The shark mauled Robles' hand and side, but did little other damage . Robles has been released from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. 'I’m still pretty shaken up. I’m still rattled, my nerves are still shaky,' he told KCAL. 'For a second, I thought this might be it, I was absolutely terrified.' 'I never thought I would die in the ocean.' Fishermen on the Manhattan Beach pier, . one of whom snagged the shark, laughed at the victim just after the . attack, footage has revealed. The . fishermen didn't realize Steven Robles, 40, had been bitten and laughed . at his screams, but they quickly clammed up when it the severity of . situation hit them. 'There he is, look at him,' yells one of the fishermen as they reel in the ocean beast. 'Look at him! Look at him!' Grainy footage shows group of swimmers. Among them, the whipping snout and tail of a shark can briefly be made out. In the moments that follow, the group of men and woman watching from the pier all break out into laughter at the man's expense. 'He's right at him,' says one man, as there is a renewed burst of laughter. Saved: Two men carry a swimmer,  after he was bitten by a great white shark, to safety on Manhattan Beach . Steven Robles, 40, says he thanks God for saving his life from a horrific shark attack . In agony: The unidentified man is loaded into the ambulance following the attack . 'Out of the water!': Lifeguard Natalia Vecerek, 22, patrols the beach, telling people to leave the water after the early morning shark attack . The group appears unaware Robles has been seriously hurt, but they know he's terrified and still laugh. 'You hear him screaming?' asks a man. 'He was right on top of him.' But . that's when things take a turn. Robles' blood-curdling screams turns the laughter to . stunned silence. But the fisherman told the Los . Angeles Times they were unaware they had a shark on the line at the time . they were laughing. 'My buddy's pole takes off. He fights for 10 or 15 minutes and passes it to me,' said the man identified only as Jason. 'We spent 20 to 30 minutes not knowing what it is yet. When we catch bat rays in excess of 150 pounds, their pull and tug is similar to a great white. They're called mud marlins because of the way they fight.' It was not until the snagged creature was 150 feet away, about 30 yards offshore and only 10 feet from Robles did they realize it was a shark, Jason claimed. That's when the fisherman tried to pull the shark out to sea before cutting the line, likely causing it to panic and attack Robles. 'We are deeply concerned about the swimmer,' said Jason. 'No one intended this to happen.' Police have no plans to arrest any of the fisherman, sources told the Times. The ailing man was quickly pulled from the ocean as the fishermen yelled to other swimmers to get out of the water as quickly as possible. He was conscious and talking to paramedics while being taken to UCLA Harbor Medical Center, reported CBS Los Angeles. The experienced swimmer was . reportedly with a group of 15 frequent swimmers who dive into the water . every Saturday in popular spots from Hermosa to Manhattan Beach Pier, . and who were training for an International Swim Meet. Robles told reporters he punched the shark in the nose, which is a frequently recommended strategy when faced with an attack. Robles credits the quick thinking, along with God's intervention, for his survival.

A surfer in the water near the victim told the New York Daily News of the terrifying attack. 'There was blood everywhere and I realized that something had gotten him,' said Casey Fenwick. 'He was screaming the whole time and I understand why. 'I was just worried about getting this guy in and on the board so somebody could help.'

Where it happened: People who fled the waters on Manhattan Beach gathered on the pier . Urgent: The man was still conscious while being rushed from the water to the ambulance . Two-miles of the beach were closed while authorities worked to move the shark into deeper water, said cops. ‘The deputies directed a lifeguard boat and a Redondo Beach Harbor Patrol boat to the shark,’ said a police statement. ‘A paddle boarder was directed away from the shark by the boat crews. ‘After approximately 30 minutes, the boats were able to coax the shark out to deeper water and away from the pier.’ A witness told the Los Angeles Times people began screaming ‘white! white!’ for a great white shark. ‘It was a scary scream,’ said Aram Ozen. ‘It was kind of freaky. There was a lot people screaming back to shore.’ Another witness detailed the horror to Patch. ‘The shark was 6-7 feet. A fisherman who regularly tries to catch sharks had it on the line for 45 minutes,’ said Scot Valor. ‘The shark was panicking. The swimmer just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.’ The beach has since been reopened. The man’s is in stable condition at a local hospital.","Steven Robles, 40, was bitten by the seven-foot juvenile shark just before 9:30 a.m. at Manhattan Beach .

"By . Ryan Gorman . New Orleans police are searching for two people wanted in the kidnapping of a toddler girl in the back seat of a car stolen last week from a downtown gas station. The assailants, both black males, were in another stolen car Wednesday night when they pulled into the Shell station just before 10.30 p.m. and one jumped out and stole the car with the baby inside, surveillance video showed. The tot was dumped on a nearby sidewalk and scooped up by a good Samaritan, according to police, but neither the stolen cars nor the suspects have been found. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mad dash: The man circled can be seen running from the stolen PT Cruiser (far right) to the Infinity (far left) Police called the theft a ‘crime of opportunity’ in comments to WVUE, and said the toddler’s father leaving the windshield wipers and headlights on led the thief to make off with his black Infiniti G35. ‘Who would get out and run into a gas station and leave your car running? More so, who would leave their child inside of a car? So, this is something that may have and could have been prevented if somebody had just taken a little more precaution,’ said NOPD Commander Robert Bardy. ‘Never leave your child alone in a car that's running. First and foremost, that's one thing you don't want to do,’ added Retired NOPD Sgt. Michael LeVasseur. Video shows the father walking inside the gas station as the thieves roll into another pump in a stolen Chrysler PT Cruiser. The theft: He is seen here opening the door to the Inifiniti, the car's headlights and windshield wipers are noticeably on when the occupant is inside the store . The switch: The man circled was the passenger in the stolen PT Cruiser, he walks around to the front of the car while the other thief drives the Infiniti from the station (bottom left corner) His turn at the wheel: The PT Cruiser passenger jumps behind the wheel of the stolen car . The driver of Chrysler then gets out and runs over to the Infiniti while his passenger casually exits the car and hops behind the wheel. The black male quickly drives the Infiniti away and the Chrysler follows close behind.The whole theft took less than 10 seconds. ‘This is a crime of opportunity, and it's something that we as citizens should be more aware of, Bardy explained. Police sources said the Chrysler was similarly stolen from a Valero gas station only one block away. ‘It's reported to us that a gentleman had exited his car at Wagner's Market right down on Claiborne and Martin Luther King, and then he went to the back to check his tire, and somebody got in his car. The car was left running,’ Bardy recalled. The car thief soon dumped the young child on a bleak street corner marked by a concrete wall and crooked fencing around a home abandoned after being damaged in Hurricane Katrina, said police. Over and out: The PT Cruiser then follows the Inifiniti out of the gas station - neither car has been seen since . Where it happened: The Shell gas station where the brazen theft occurred . Desolate: The nearly-abandoned block where the baby was found by a good samaritan before being brought to a local police station .

"By . Tania Steere . Milly Dowler’s killer has won £4,500 compensation after being attacked in prison. Levi Bellfield, 45, received the payout despite suffering only minor cuts. The triple-killer has told friends that he will give the cash to his mother for rent on a holiday caravan in Kent. Bellfield won the compensation after being attacked by an inmate with a makeshift weapon at Wakefield prison in Yorkshire in 2009. Payout: Levi Bellfield (left), who was jailed in 2011 for the murder of schoolgirl Milly Dowler (right) has won £4,500 compensation after being attacked in prison . The burly former nightclub bouncer suffered minor injuries but took prison bosses to court, claiming they should have protected him. Ministry of Justice lawyers fought for three years to stop Bellfield, jailed in 2011 for 13-year-old Milly’s murder, from receiving a penny off taxpayers. But on Wednesday he was awarded the cash at Durham County Court after the Ministry of Justice was forced to admit full liability. A ministry spokesman said: ‘We are hugely disappointed that Levi Bellfield was awarded £4,500 by a judge following an assault by a  prisoner in 2009 at HMP Wakefield.’ A source close to Bellfield’s family told The Mirror: ‘Levi will transfer the funds to relatives. He wants them to use it on the caravan. Attack: Bellfield won the compensation after being attacked by an inmate with a makeshift weapon at Wakefield prison in Yorkshire (pictured) in 2009 . ‘He’s angry that prison guards let him in that part of the prison. He says by putting him in that wing, it was just asking for an attack to happen.  Another inmate waited for him outside one of the bathrooms. The inmate went for his eye with a weapon but missed. It was pretty tame.’ Labour MP Ian Austin last night pledged to raise the compensation payout with Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, saying it was ‘disgusting’. He said: ‘This is a complete and utter disgrace. I will be asking Mr Grayling how this evil child  murderer could possibly be awarded such a huge sum of money. Every right-thinking person will agree this is distasteful and wrong.’ National Victims’ Association founder David Hines added: ‘It really gets us that murderers claim for being attacked and get rewards. It’s a sin.’ Victims: Bellfield got a whole life term in 2008 for the murders of Amelie Delagrange (left), 22, and 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell (right) Bellfield got a whole life term in 2008 for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell. He kidnapped Milly in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in 2002. He lured her back to his flat as she walked home from school, killed her and dumped her body in a remote wood where he used to walk his dog. The body was only found six months later. Police mistakes allowed Bellfield to avoid capture and he went on to stalk and murder two young women and tried to kill a third before he was arrested. The news of the payout is likely to add to the distress of the Dowler family. Speaking after Bellfield’s conviction, Milly’s mother Sally said: ‘The length the system goes to protect his human rights seems so unfair compared to what we as a family have had to endure.’ Mrs Dowler said she hoped Bellfield would be dealt with in jail with the ‘same brutality’ he used against his victims.","Levi Bellfield wins compensation after he was attacked by fellow inmate .

"By . Tania Steere . Savers locked into rip-off pensions and investments could be moved to better deals or allowed a free-exit, the City watchdog is due to say next week. An inquiry will be launched this summer into 30 million policies sold by insurance companies between the 70s and the Millennium. The review, by the Financial Conduct Authority, will include pensions, endowments, investment bonds and life insurance sold by doorstep salesmen. An inquiry is to be launched this summer by the Financial Conduct Authority following concerns insurers are ¿exploiting¿ loyal policyholders who are ¿not given the same priority as new customers¿ . The regulator is concerned that insurers are ‘exploiting’ loyal policyholders who are ‘not given the same priority as new customers’. Clive Adamson, the director of supervision at the FCA, told The Daily Telegraph: ‘We want to find out how closed-book products are being serviced by insurance companies, as we are concerned insurers are allocating an unfair amount of overheads to historic funds. ‘As firms cut prices and create new products, there is a danger that customers with older contracts are forgotten. We want to ensure they get a fair deal. As part of the review we will collect information to establish whether we need to intervene on exit charges.’ Savers locked into rip-off pensions and investments could be moved to better deals or allowed a free-exit (file picture) Many customers signed up to financial products at the prompting of doorstep salesman working on commission only to face steep exit penalties - sometimes more than 50 per cent of the total pension pot - if they later want to leave or switch to a better deal. The regulator is considering whether these obstructive ‘lock-in’ fees on policies – which can last until the customer reaches the policy’s retirement age - should be banned. The inquiry will be revealed in the annual FCA business plan for the next financial year, which will be published on Monday. Banning unfair exit fees on old pension policies would be one the strongest actions the FCA could take, Mr Adamson said. Alternatives include asking firms to move customers to a better product, providing clearer information, investing more in the management of old funds, offering a greater variety of investment options within the policy or cutting fees. The FCA estimates that the policies under review are worth £150 billion. Many of the companies behind the products have since been subsumed into rival organisations through takeovers. Mr Adamson added: ‘Consolidation and outsourcing within the insurance industry means that policies taken out 10, 15 or 20 years ago are unlikely to be managed by the same brand, and by people in the same building as they were at their outset. ‘We want to make sure that customers who have been ‘sold on’ are treated fairly. Some terms and conditions that were common 20 years ago are not what we would want to see now.’","Savers locked into rip-off pensions could be moved to better deals or leave .

"By . Tania Steere . and Tamara Cohen . and Jenny Hope . A revolutionary vaccine that can stop meningitis B from devastating the lives of children has been approved for use on the NHS. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was expected to announce today that the Government is going to fund the Bexsero vaccine. Last October the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended that the vaccine should not be made available for free because it was not cost-effective. Meningitis jab: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was expected to announce today that the Government is going to fund the Bexsero vaccine . But Mr Hunt has been under mounting pressure to ensure the vaccine is fast-tracked into routine use and the Mail understands that the JCVI is moving towards approving NHS use of the £75-a-shot  vaccine as part of the UK’s routine immunisation programme. Steve Dayman, founder of Meningitis Now, lost his son to meningitis 31 years ago. He said last night: ‘We’ve been campaigning for this vaccine for the last year. If approved, this vaccine will save thousands of lives.’ In January, 118 leading doctors wrote a letter urging Mr Hunt to give the jab the green light. Simon Nadel, a paediatric consultant at St Mary’s Hospital, London, who co-ordinated the letter, said: ‘The [jab] has been made available to those who can afford it, but it is a cause for concern that after years of research, a life-saving vaccine which could significantly increase protection offered to all our children, could be shelved.’ Support: In January, 118 leading doctors wrote a letter urging Mr Hunt to give the jab the green light . The vaccine, which took 17 years of research by Swiss company Novartis, was approved by the European Medicines Agency in November 2012 and licensed by the European Commission in January last year. Meningitis is a disease that terrifies parents and health professionals alike. With symptoms that can appear flu-like, it can turn overnight into a life-threatening condition. If meningitis-related blood infection takes hold, often the only way to save a child’s life is to amputate a limb. Hundreds of children are left disabled every year. Some forms of the disease have been wiped out by vaccination, but meningitis B, the most common form, has remained a killer. The new vaccine is estimated to cover 88 per cent of cases in the UK. Over the past decade there have been more than 10,000 cases recorded in England and Wales, with 500 deaths. Meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia remain the leading infectious cause of death for children under the age of five. Children who survive face neurological damage, limb amputation and severe skin damage. Almost 200 scientists and researchers signed a public petition and letter last month, which described meningitis and meningococcal disease as ‘a parent’s greatest fear’, and pointed to the JCVI calculation as ‘underestimating’ the realities of the disease for both children and their families. They urged Mr Hunt to ask for a re-evaluation by JCVI ‘as swift as possible’. A petition of 20,000 signatures was also organised by the Meningitis Now foundation. A counter on the charity’s website estimates that 673 cases could have been prevented with the Bexsero vaccine since it was licensed last year. Although the vaccine costs £75 a dose and children can need up to four to be protected, some private practices have been charging upwards of £600 for the immunisation. Despite the cost, thousands of parents have paid privately for their children to be vaccinated. About 85 per cent of private sales have been in affluent areas of the country such as London and the South East, leaving the NHS open to criticism that it was leaving vulnerable children in deprived areas at risk by not providing the vaccine for free. Although vaccines for other strains of the disease have been successful, the meningitis B vaccine remains a major health fear. The Department of Health refused to comment ahead of today’s announcement. Christopher Head, Chief Executive of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: ‘We submitted evidence to show that the impact of the disease on people affected was underestimated, and provided further data on the cost of this illness. ‘This has been taken into account by the committee. We are delighted the voice of people affected has been heard.’","Jeremy Hunt expected to reveal Government will fund Bexsero vaccine .

It also reveals websites that aren't affected . If a password is in any dictionary in any language then it will take just three minutes to crack, warned computer expert Tony McDowell. The worst passwords are the likes of ‘password’, ‘123456’, ‘qwerty’, or your child’s name. Using the same password for every site can leave you even more vulnerable to hackers, he added. His advice is to use a phrase rather than a word. For example, use ‘nameisabella’ rather than just ‘Isabella’ – and use a mixture of letters and numbers. A password of ‘name!saBe1la’ would take a year to crack, said Mr McDowell, managing director of Encription Ltd. ‘Most hackers give up after 24 hours unless it is something they really want to gain access to,’ he added. As a result, personal information such as passwords and credit card details has been accessible. Heartbleed, so called because it creates a ‘bleeding’ leak of security, is a flaw in OpenSSL, the software used by the majority of websites to keep data secure. The programme works by encrypting data – such as emails, instant messages, bank details or passwords – making it look like nonsense to hackers. When a line of communication is secure and information encrypted, the user sees a padlock on the page. When software is active, one computer may send a ‘heartbeat’ – a small packet of data – to check there is still another computer at the other end. However, a flaw in the programming meant it was possible to trick the computer at the other end by sending it a packet of data that looked like one of these heartbeats. This made it possible for hackers to impersonate the website and steal the encryption keys, revealing the data being sent. The bug was found simultaneously by a Google security researcher and a small Finnish security firm named Codenomicon and disclosed on Monday night. Many companies have installed a ‘patch’ to fix the flaw, but there are still many that are vulnerable as service providers must install the update. Furthermore, it is not known whether hackers had used it before the bug came to light – it went undiscovered for two years – as doing so would not leave a trail. One of the worst affected sites was Yahoo!, who posted a warning on their blogging site Tumblr to say: ‘The little lock icon we all trusted to keep our passwords, personal emails, and credit cards safe, was actually making all that private information accessible.’ A spokesman for Codenomicon said: ‘If people have logged into a service during the window of vulnerability then there is a chance that the password is already harvested. ‘In that sense it’s a good idea to change the passwords on all the updated web portals.’ However, researcher Mark Schloesser said changing a password on websites that have not fixed the bug could reveal ‘both the old and new passwords’ to an attacker. When contacted by the Mail last night, Britain’s major banks would not comment on whether passwords should be changed. HSBC said they were ‘monitoring’ the situation and a Lloyds spokesman said they would not comment on security issues. The Heartbleed bug lets anyone on the web read the memory of the systems protected by vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. It compromises secret keys used to identify the service providers and to encrypt web traffic. This includes the names and passwords of the users and the actual content, such as credit card numbers. Attackers can 'eavesdrop' on communications between servers, steal data directly from the them, and use the information to impersonate services and users on other sites or platforms. James Lyne, global head of research at security firm Sophos told MailOnline: 'This fault undermines the fundamental trust on the internet for anyone running the vulnerable software and it is widely integrated into the technology we all use every day. 'While the fault has now been fixed, providers must apply it manually, so many still are vulnerable. 'Worse still, the defect was in the code for over two years before being discovered by security researchers - attackers could have discovered this at any time during that period and retrieved large volumes of data without anyone knowing. 'At this point the best thing for consumers to do is to assume their passwords and alike have been leaked. They may not have been, but since it's very hard to actually tell retrospectively, it is better to be safe than sorry. 'As providers rush to patch [the flaw], consumers should apply typical IT security best practice: ensure you change passwords - once you know the issue has been fixed by your provider; update your computers; and don't use the same password across multiple sites or services. 'This is not the first defect of its kind and it certainly won't be the last, but it is one of the more serious faults we've seen in recent Internet history.'","Online security breach is described as 'catastrophic'

"By . Associated Press . Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox is abandoning its attempt to take over Time Warner in a proposed deal that would have combined two of the world's biggest media companies. The about-face announced on Tuesday comes three weeks after Time Warner Inc. revealed that it had rejected 21st Century Fox's unsolicited $76 billion buyout offer. There had been hopes that 21st Century Fox, which owns the 20th Century Fox movie studio, Fox broadcast network, and TV channels Fox News and FX, might raise its original cash-and-stock offer bid of roughly $86 per share to as much as $100 per share to win over Time Warner. Even with 21st Century Fox now out of the picture, Time Warner's shares still remain above where they were before the news of buyout offer came out. Scroll down for video . Time Warner Inc headquarters in New York City (stock image). The company revealed three weeks ago that it had rejected 21st Century Fox's unsolicited billion-dollar buyout bid . Time Warner Inc's share price plummeted late on Tuesday on the news that 21st Century Fox had withdrawn its takeover bid . New York-based Time Warner, which owns the Warner Bros. movie studio and TV channels such as TNT, TBS and HBO, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment about 21st Century Fox's decision. Many analysts had expected Murdoch to continue stalking Time Warner after the initial cold shoulder, reasoning the billionaire viewed a takeover as a prime opportunity to create a movie and television powerhouse that would be in a better bargaining position to sell its video content at a time when video distributors are muscling up too. Comcast Corp., the largest cable and high-speed Internet provider, is trying to win approval to buy rival Time Warner Cable while AT&T Corp. is trying to gobble up satellite TV service DirecTV. As in the case with those proposed deals, 21st Century Fox would have had to navigate potentially daunting antitrust hurdles to buy Time Warner. Cultural clashes also loomed had the two companies combined, a factor that turned Time Warner's merger with AOL Inc. in 2001 into a monumental flop. Time Warner and AOL eventually split, but not before costing their shareholders tens of billions of dollars. With the proposed Time Warner deal off the table, 21st Century Fox's board approved a plan to spend an additional $6 billion on buying back stock. Murdoch cited a decline in the New York company's stock price since the takeover bid was announced as one of the reasons for the change of heart. Fox's shares have dropped 11 percent. They rose about 8 percent in after-hours trading Tuesday. Meanwhile, investors betting that Murdoch was going to sweeten his offer bailed out of Time Warner. Its stock fell $9.29, or nearly 11 percent, to $75.90 in extended trading. This isn't the first time that Murdoch has walked away from a deal that he once seemed to prize. In 2008, he gave up on buying DirecTV in 2008 through another company, News Corp., after Liberty Media Corp. chairman John Malone outmaneuvered him. He also withdrew a bid to boost News Corp.'s stake in British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC in 2011 amid outrage over a phone hacking scandal at News Corp.'s British newspapers. Murdoch's News Corp. split into two companies last year: The newspaper and publishing portion, still called News Corp., and the film-and-TV unit, 21st Century Fox Inc. In a statement today, Mr Murdoch said: 'Time Warner management and its board refused to engage with us to explore an offer which was highly compelling.' The CEO and chairman continued: 'We viewed a combination with Time Warner as a unique opportunity to bring together two great companies, each with celebrated content and brands. Our proposal had significant strategic merit and compelling financial rationale and our approach had always been friendly.' Mr Murdoch added that 21st Century Fox's future 'has never been brighter'.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Family man: Charles Davis, 41, who had served 15 years in prison for a murder, shot dead his estranged wife and her 20-year-old son before turning the gun on himself . A Florida woman and her 20-year-old son have been gunned down by the mother's third husband, who then turned the gun on himself after sparing the life of his teenage stepdaughter. Police in northwest Miami-Dade believe that 41-year-old Charles Davis opened fire on 44-year-old Valerie Davis and her son, Jeffrey Eskridge Jr, at around 3am Tuesday inside their home on 55th Court Street. When officers arrived on the scene, they forced their way inside the residence and discovered the bodies of the parents and the son. Jeffrey Eskridge Sr, the biological father of the 20-year-old victim, told the station WSVN that just before 3.30am he got a frantic call from his 16-year-old daughter, Tyria Poole, telling him that her stepfather had shot dead her family before ending his own life in front of her.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Dexter Richardson, 47, a former police officer in Riviera Beach, Florida, was charged Tuesday with having uninformed HIV infected sexual intercourse with his girlfriend . A former police officer from Florida has been arrested for allegedly failing to disclose to his long-term girlfriend that he was HIV positive. Dexter Richardson, 47, of Riviera Beach, was charged Tuesday with having uninformed HIV infected sexual intercourse. Police first became aware of the allegations back in May when Richardson’s girlfriend contacted the department accusing the former cop of infecting her with the virus. The woman said when she confronted the 47-year-old man, he initially denied being HIV positive but then admitted that he has been living with the illness for about a decade. It has been determined by detectives that Richardson has been aware for several years that he had tested positive for HIV, Palm Beach Post reported. The former Riviera Beach cop, however, kept that information about his health status from his girlfriend, according to investigators. Richardson had a troubled past in law enforcement; he was fired from the Riviera Beach Police Department in 1998 after allegedly sharing information with another officer who was under investigation at the time. In the late 1980s, Richardson served on the force in Pompano Beach but was terminated for being involved in up to eight 'unjustified accidents' in his patrol car. After being hired by the Riviera Beach police, the cop got into six more crashes between 1993 and 1996. That year, Richardson was also arrested for getting into a confrontation with a gas station clerk in Delray Beach who refused to let him use the bathroom. Dexter Richardson was taken into custody in the HIV case on Sunday. He has since been released on bond. Police suspect that he may have had other sexual partners who were unaware that he was HIV positive. Richardson’s arrest marks the second time this year that an officer from Palm Beach County has been accused of knowingly spreading HIV. In January, Greenacres cop Ervans Saintclair has been charged with two counts of criminal transmission of the potentially deadly virus. Saintclair entered a not guilty plea in March and is due back in court later this month.","Dexter Richardson, 47, charged with having uninformed HIV infected sexual intercourse with his long-time girlfriend .

Yoel Munoz, from Cape Coral, was taken into custody Sunday in connection to the murder of 51-year-old Thomas Bergstrom, who was discovered stabbed to death in his shelter in the woods a mile away from the teen's home. Thomas Bergstrom was found just before noon Saturday behind the Cape Coral Christian Center suffering from multiple knife wounds. Scroll down for video . In cold blood: Police say 13-year-old Yoel Munoz (left) brutally stabbed 51-year-old homeless man Thomas Bergstrom inside his makeshift shelter in the woods of Cape Coral, Florida . Cluttered crime scene: The victim was found lying face down covered in blood in his camp Saturday morning . Gory details: Bergstrom's blood-stained recliner is seen inside his shelter in the woods . Anthony Cashdollar, 18, told the Fort Myers News Press that he was the one who came upon the grisly crime scene when he stopped by Bergstrom's improvised lodging to show him his new dirt bike. The teen said he saw the 51-year-old vagrant lying face down with blood on his arm and mouth. Cashdollar called out for help, alerting Bergstrom's friend and roommate Danny Brauer. ‘I saw Tommy laying there, flies everywhere.’ Brauer told Naples News. ‘I said, “Call 911 now.""’ Police officers who were called to the scene found clues linking Yoel Munoz to the stabbing. According to Cape Coral investigators, the 13-year-old armed with a bagel knife went to the nearby homeless camp Saturday night, stabbed Bergstrom as he was watching TV and then returned home. Officers also discovered strange messages written in blood on a white hockey mask left at the scene of the slaying. The presumed murder weapon turned up in a nearby pond.

Stone-faced: The 13-year-old murder suspect, pictured in court, was arrested after police found material evidence in his home linking him to the crime . During an interview with police, Munoz's mother confirmed that she had bought her son a similar hockey mask. Munoz went to a local hospital at around 4am to be treated for a stab wound to his thigh. He reportedly offered conflicting stories to explain the origin of his injury. A hospital report obtained by WINK News stated that Munoz told officers he had been attacked by 10 men because he no longer wanted to be a part of their gang. According to detectives, the boy also had blood on his face, which matched the pattern of the hockey mask found in the woods next to Bergstrom's body. A search of Munoz's home turned up smears of blood on a wall and a bed, and a pair of blood-soaked shoes inside plastic bags stashed in the garage. Detectives believe the suspected teenage killer and his victim had no contact with one another prior to the deadly stabbing. Munoz's brother, Lazaro Ordonez, has come to the 13-year's defense, telling NBC 2 that his sibling got mixed up with the wrong crowd, but that he was 'innocent.' The suspect's mother sounded a similar note when interviewed by WZVN. 'He's not a violent child, he a homebody, he's not a child who's on the streets, he's well educated, and has a good heart,' said Mayling Suarez. Thomas Bergstrom apparently became homeless after losing his job as a carpenter and handyman as a result of a workplace accident. Supporters: Yoel's family have insisted that the 13-year-old was a good boy, and that he was innocent . His roommate Bauer said the 51-year-old had told him that he was successful and even had a lobster boat in Massachusetts. After he became disabled, Bergstrom moved to Florida and settled in a makeshift camp in the woods, where he spent much of his time collecting empty soda cans to supplement his Social Security payments. According to Mr Bauer, Bergstrom used his meager income to buy alcohol and cigarettes. On Monday, an impassive Yoel Munoz was led into juvenile court where a judge ordered the 13-year-old held in secure detention for three weeks pending his next court appearance August 21.","Yoel Munoz, 13, of Cape Coral, Florida, charged with killing 51-year-old vagrant Thomas Bergstrom .

Gregg Hastings said 44-year-old Daniel Martinson, a suspect in the November 2013 murder of 39-year-old Aaron Clouser, was taken into custody at a Cave Junction park without incident. Police said last week that Martinson gave law enforcement officers the slip on a motorcycle during a manhunt in the forests near the California state line.

Martinson is accused of stabbing to death his acquaintance Aaron Clouser, whose lifeless body was discovered in the middle of a street in Cave Junction November 5, 2013, according to the station KPTV. Police have not released a possible motive behind the killing. Once Martinson was named a suspect, state police detectives went to work handing out pictures of the wanted man and asking local residents to keep an eye out for the 44-year-old. He was described as 5-foot-6 and weighing 155lbs, with a shaved head, a missing front tooth and a distinctive pit bull tattoo on his back above the word 'outlaw.' The efforts of the investigators finally paid off Wednesday when a Good Samaritan called 911 just after 9am to report that he spotted Martinson in Cave Junction and recognized him.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A Pennsylvania man is facing animal abuse and drug charges after police say he tormented his pet kitten and injected him with heroin, prompting a quick-thinking veterinarian to use a human overdose medication on the cat. The 8-week-old, 2-pound black cat was rushed on Sunday to Hope Veterinary Specialists clinic in Malvern Sunday bleeding from his face, missing several teeth and with a rope tightly tied around his neck. A doctor at the center determined that the animal had been exposed to heroin and decided to administer an unusual remedy, giving the kitty the drug Narcan commonly used to treat human victims of drug overdose. Scroll down for video . Nine lives: Hope the kitten is lucky to be alive after allegedly being beat up, choked and injected with heroin by his owner over the weekend . 'Drug fiend': James Paul Myers, 24, faces charges including animal cruelty and drug possession . Police in West Whiteland Township say at around 4.40am Sunday, an officer spotted James Myers' car parked in the middle of Dunwoody Drive with the driver's door ajar, according to a press release put out Tuesday by the Chester County District Attorney's Office. The officer says under the door he saw an injured black kitten with a rope around its neck and several teeth knocked out. Myers allegedly tried to choke his pet, slammed his face into the ground and then painted the message 'SLAM IT YOU PU$$Y' on the pavement. 'This is a two pound kitten that would fit in the palm of my hand. He would take a kitten, a defenseless kitten, and torture it this way,' District Attorney Tom Hogan told the station 6ABC. Police say they also seized nearly two dozen bundles of heroin, hundreds of used baggies and 46 of needles in the 24-year-old's car. Authorities say at the veterinary clinic, Dr. Jennifer Magilto was able to revive the injured cat with an antidote for opium-based drug overdoses. Savagery: The kitty had some of his teeth knocked out in the beating,  and the 8-week-old pet also suffered head trauma . Obscene: Myers allegedly painted the words 'SLAM IT YOU PU$$Y' on the pavement . Initially, there was talk of euthanizing the animal because of his injuries, but when the veterinarian learned the facts of the case, she concluded that the kitten must have been injected with heroin and decided to try and save him. Within 24 hours, the kitty, appropriately named Hope after the veterinary clinic, was purring, eating with appetite and playing. The tough little guy is expected to make a full recovery, according to the doctors. He will then be transferred to the Chester County SPCA, which will help find Hope a foster home before putting him up for adoption. Quick-thinking vet: The doctor treating little Hope determined that he must have been injected with heroin and used the overdose reversal antidote nalaxone, trademarked as Narcan, to revive the pet . Getting better: The kitty is expected to make a full recovery, after which he will be put up for adoption . James Myers has been charged with animal cruelty and drug possession. He is being held in jail on $25,000 bail. ‘The abuse of this kitten was a singularly depraved act,’ stated District Attorney Hogan. ‘Heroin addicts abuse themselves, animals, and children without remorse or regret. What punishment is severe enough for this type of evil?’","A black 8-week-old kitten dubbed Hope was saved by a doctor at Hope Veterinary Specialists clinic in Malvern, Pennsylvania .

Shocking confession: Stacie Parsons (left), 25, has walked into the Athens, Texas, police headquarters to report she had killed her 4-year-old daughter, Victoria Wyatt (right) Resting place: The toddler's lifeless body was found wrapped in a garbage bag inside the trunk of her mother's car . Crime scene: Police say Mrs Parsons killed her daughter on this small wooden bridge on Henderson County Road 1500 . According to the sheriff's office, Mrs Parsons, a married mother of one, walked into the Athens Police Department headquarters at around 8.45am Monday to report she had committed a murder, NBC Washington reported. Investigators were dispatched to the family’s home in the 400 block of Martin Luther King Jr where they discovered Victoria’s lifeless body wrapped in a garbage bag. According to sheriff's deputies, the little girl was killed on a bridge along Henderson County Road 1500 and then transported home about 5 miles away. There is no official word yet on a motive, but according to Parsons' common-law husband of six years, Gary Wyatt, his wife has long been jealous of their 4-year-old daughter. The heartbroken father told the station KLTV that on Monday, he and Stacie were supposed to enroll Victoria in a pre-kindergarten program together. Unnatural envy: Gary Wyatt (pictured left), Parsons' common-law husband of six years, said his wife has been jealous of their daughter from the day she was born (right) Foreshadowing: A family friend said Stacie threatened to kill Victoria just days before the tragedy . But the night before, Mr Wyatt informed his wife that he wanted a divorce, which may have sent her over the edge. When Gary Wyatt woke up Monday morning, Stacie and Victoria already have left. At the time, he assumed they had gone to the pre-school without him. A short time later, the 25-year-old mother returned home, parked her car in the driveway and walked away. Gary and family friend Randy Dyess chased her down and tried to talk to her, asking the woman about Victoria, but the 25-year-old only said: 'I wouldn't be in that car if I were you.' When Mr Wyatt opened the trunk of his wife's white sedan, he discovered Victoria wrapped in plastic and not breathing.

Life cut short: Victoria, pictured left not long before her death and right as an infant, was supposed to start pre-K on the day she was killed . Cause of death: The toddler, seen here as a baby, suffered head trauma and injuries to her chest . ‘Oh, God it was awful,’ Mr Wyatt tearfully recalled. ‘Foaming out of her mouth, her head was bashed in. My baby's dead, she killed my baby.’ The father attempted to perform CPR on the toddler, but it was too late. Gary Wyatt told the Texas news station while it appeared his wife has been envious of their daughter since the day she was born, she has never been violent towards her. However, Randy Dyess, the couple's friend, revealed that Stacie  allegedly made a threat against Victoria just a few days before the murder. Justice for Victoria: The 25-year-old mother has been charged with capital murder . ‘She said, “I'd rather kill Victoria and spend the rest of my life in prison than to put up with you,”’ Dyess said referring to Mr Wyatt. Stacie Parsons is being held without bond at the Henderson County Jail. The family's loved ones have launched an online fundraiser to help Gary Wyatt with his daughter's final expenses.","Stacie Parsons, 25, charged with capital murder in the killing of 4-year-old Victoria Wyatt in Henderson County, Texas .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A disgraced Florida pharmacist sentenced to 30 months of house arrest for his role in a large-scale pill mill operation has requested to have his sentence cut short saying that at 551lbs, he is already confined to his home. U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra on Monday rejected the plea submitted by 70-year-old Steven Goodman, writing in his opinion that the painkiller-pushing pharmacist had been spared prison time only because it would have proven too difficult to care for him in a correctional facility. Goodman, of Treasure Island, was sentenced in August 2012 for distributing more than a million prescription pain medications like oxycodone to clinics operated by the twins Jeffrey and Christopher George. Heavy burden: Former Florida pharmacist Steven Goodman, 70, pictured in August 2012 around the time he pleaded guilty in a mill pill case, has asked a judge to reduce his 30-month house arrest sentence saying he is too big to go outside . The siblings are currently serving prison terms of more than a dozen years each for flooding several cities in South Florida with illegal pain drugs. Judge Marra said during Goodman's sentencing two years ago that the Florida prison system cannot accommodate someone so large, SunSentinel.com reported. Weighing more than a quarter of a ton, Mr Goodman gets around in a wheelchair, cannot dress himself or bathe without assistance, and there are no beds in penitentiaries that could support his bulk. Goodman's lawyer, Edward Page, described his client's house arrest as 'both unnecessary and futile' because his weight problem and poor health already confine him to his bedroom. In his request for a reduced sentence, the attorney argued that the 70-year-old man has a wide array of grave medical issues, including heart disease, an incurable lymph condition and sleep apnea, which would likely end his life in the next six to 12 months. 'Each day may be one of his last,' Page wrote in his 10-page plea. The lawyer also pointed out that Goodman cannot fit in a car and suffers from an acute fear of falling that effectively confines him to his home. Since his sentencing, the ailing 550-pound man has remained largely indoors. He did, however, venture outside to attend his own wedding ceremony when he married Judith Bartell. Edward Page asked Judge Marra to shave the last seven months off his client's sentence so that he could visit friends and family in Ohio to say goodbye. Double trouble: Twins Christopher (left) and Jeffrey (right) George are currently serving 14 years and more than 15 years in prison, respectively, for operating illegal pain management clinics . But the judge seized upon the lawyer's argument, questioning how the largely immobile, morbidly obese man who has a fear of falling and cannot fit into a car would be able to journey from Florida to Cincinnati for a family reunion. Steven Goodman was one of about 32 people indicted in 2012 as part of 'Operation Oxy Alley.' According to prosecutors, the George brothers operated and managed four pain management clinics, which distributed about 20million oxycodone pills over the course of two years to the tune of $40million in profits. The indictment stated that the twins hired doctors who agreed to write prescriptions for controlled substances without any regard for medical necessity. In January 2012, Jeffrey George, then 31 years old, was sentenced to 15-and-a-half years in federal prison after pleading guilty to racketeering conspiracy. His brother, Christopher, also pleaded guilty to racketeering and is now serving a 14-year sentence.","Steven Goodman, 70, has been sentenced to 30-month house arrest for distributing more than a million oxycodone pills .

Daryl Rasmussen, 58, pleaded guilty Friday to counts of second-degree murder. Rasmussen was sentenced to 30 years in prison, and 13 other charges against him – including first-degree murder - were dismissed. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Daryl Rasmussen, 58, known as Ms Puppy, was sentenced to 30 years in prison as part of a plea deal in the double murder of a gay couple . According to prosecutors, Rasmussen bludgeoned to death Ronald Ford, 63, and his long-time boyfriend, 56-year-old Ramiro 'Rome' Sanchez, in their Denver home in late January 2011. The cross-dresser also stole the slain couple's 1997 Dodge Caravan and used their credit cards and identifies. The victims’ bodies were discovered a week apart in mid-February. Both are survived by a number of grown children. Rasmussen, aka Ms Puppy, had been homeless when the Denver couple hired him in 2010 to be a housekeeper and caregiver to Sanchez, who was disabled. Sanchez and Ford were killed in their home in the 120 block of Stuart Street in Denver with blows to the head, according to court documents. Ingrate: Rasmussen (left), who had been homeless, was hired by the couple in 2010 as a housekeeper and a caregiver to Ramiro Sanchez, 56 (right), who was disabled .

Ford's body was found inside the house February 11. Sanchez was discovered a week later hidden in the basement under a pile of bags. Before Sanchez was found dead, it had been suggested that he and Rasmussen may have run away together. Speaking to The Denver Channel in February 2011, Heidi Coleman, one of Ford's four children, said that it was a relief to know that her father's partner of 18 years did not play a part in his murder. Denver Post reported that Daryl Rasmussen fled after the murders but was arrested six months later in Palm Springs, California, after a patron in a local bar overheard him introduce himself as Ms Puppy. In court Friday, Daryl Rasmussen spoke very little, only saying he was sorry for what happened, CBS Denver reported.","Daryl Rasmussen, 58, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder counts in the 2011 killings of Ronald Ford and Ramiro Sanchez in Denver .

"By . Snejana Farberov . As Noel Shannon lay trapped under her truck after a horrific crash in the mountains of Oregon, the 23-year-old weighed her options, one of which was to use her car keys to amputate her own leg. The Washington state resident was eventually rescued, but doctors were unable to save her mangled limb. Last Saturday, Shannon's left leg was cut off from the knee down at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. Survivor: Noel Shannon, 23, seen in the hospital several days after doctors amputated her badly damaged left leg above the knee . Fearless: Noel, 23, considered severing her own leg with her car keys after she became trapped under her truck . Taste for adventure: On July 5, Noel (far left) traveled to the Walla Walla River country in Oregon to take pictures in a forest . Beauty: The athletic young woman, pictured with her boyfriend, got into an accident after swerving to avoid a deer on a country road . Noel's mother, Christa Shannon, said her daughter's main concern now is to get a prosthetic running leg. On July 5, Noel was returning from taking pictures in the Umatilla National Forest near Walla Walla River country in Oregon at around 8pm when she saw a deer in front of her 1996 Toyota car. The 23-year-old made a sharp turn to avoid hitting the animal, which caused her vehicle to roll over several times. The truck came to rest on the driver's side, with Noel's left leg sticking out the window. She was not buckled in that night. Her foot was lodged under the door frame, and try as she might, Shannon was unable to pull it out. That is when she first thought of her keys. The quick-thinking photographer used the keys at first to try and dig a furrow under the door frame in an attempt to free her foot. But after 10 hours of work, she was able to make only a small dent in the rock-hard ground. Keeping calm: The quick-thinking Noel tried to use her keys to dig a trench under the car door frame to free her foot, but after 10 hours of work, she only made a small dent in the ground . Hero: Dax McReynolds, a U.S. Army combat veteran, was driving through the Walla Walla area when he spotted Noel bleeding to death on the ground surrounded by flies . As she lay bleeding heavily from her split-open leg, Noel recalled hearing wolves howling, and the thought that sooner or later the animals will make their way to the site of the crash terrified her. ‘She knew she would have to cut off her leg with her keys, a lot of those were little keys and she knew they were not sharp enough to do so,’ Mrs Shannon told Walla Walla Union-Bulletin. ‘So she just had to buckle down and just jerk her leg out.’ Her leg was now in an even worse shape, but at least Miss Shannon was free. In the nick of time: Doctors were able to repair Noel's artery, but her left leg was beyond mending . The fit and healthy 23-year-old used her good leg to smash the windshield and crawled out of the wreckage. Noel Shannon used her sweatshirt to tie a tourniquet around her mangled left leg to stop the bleeding and set out to get help. But Noel was too weak from blood loss, and so she collapsed only about 15 feet from her overturned truck. ‘I couldn't believe it was happening to me and I really thought I was going to die,’ Noel later recalled to KVEW. At around 8.30am the next day, Dax McReynolds was returning with a friend from target practice in the Walla Walla area when he spotted a 'pile of debris' on the ground next to a flipped-over truck. McReynolds and his companion, both U.S. Army combat veterans who fought in Iraq, found Noel near death, with 'bees and flies warming around her.' ‘I see this older Toyota 4-Runner coming up the road,’ said Noel, referring to the moment she first saw the two Good Samaritans approach. ‘It was like they were angels from heaven.’ The men loaded Noel into their vehicle and hit the road, hoping to reach a spot where there is cell phone service so they could call 911. Staying positive: Despite the pain, Noel flashed a smile and two thumbs up for the camera before undergoing surgery last week . Tough decision: Doctors were forced to amputate the woman's leg below the knee because too much of the muscle tissue has died . One last time: Noel, her boyfriend (right) and her family are seen just before the surgery, with Shannon's leg still intact . 'But she wanted to go home,' McReynolds said. 'She said she couldn’t afford the ambulance ride.' When the group finally reached Providence St Mary Medical Center in Walla Walla, doctors were able to repair the artery in Noel's left leg, but they could not save the limb since too much muscle tissue has died. On Saturday, her family posted several pictures from the hospital showing Noel getting ready for surgery. In one photo, the young woman is seen casting a final glance at her leg wrapped in a bandage but still intact. Noel's loved ones have launched an online fundraiser to help her with medical expenses and the costs of a prosthetic leg. The goal is to collect $75,000 in donations. Christa Shannon, Noel’s mother, wrote on a Facebook support page dedicated to her daughter that prosthetics are very costly and have to be changed every 4-5 years. Unstoppable: Noel Shannon hopes to resume running one day, and she plans to open a gym for people with prosthetic limbs . After a tough week following the surgery, Noel is on a road to recovery. She will be released home in a few days and will spend the next six months getting around with the help of a wheelchair and crutches. Before the accident, the 23-year-old enjoyed running, training horses and riding her Harley Davidson. Now, Noel's dream is to get a prosthetic leg and open a gym for people like her. Miss Shannon’s message is: ‘Just don't take life for granted, you never know when your last day will be.’","Noel Shannon, 23, was taking pictures in Oregon mountains July 5 when she crashed after swerving to avoid a deer .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A male Las Vegas club promoter has landed in hot water for allegedly telling a woman trying to plan a friend’s bachelorette party not to bring 'whales' and 'hippos' to the sin city hotspot. The exchange between a host at Hakkasan nightclub at MGM Grand Casino named Peter and a Southern California resident named Zoe went viral this week when the Gawker blog Jezebel posted screenshots of the text messages online. Zoe explained that she contacted the club promoter asking to arrange a comp - or a complimentary table - at the club for the bride and her 14 friends. Vegas standards: A promoter at Hakkasan Las Vegas has been suspended for telling a woman organizing a bachelorette party that she cannot bring any patrons who look like 'hippos' or 'whales' 'In the past, clubs/promoters/hosts have tended to go out of their way to provide a great experience for the bride, and the group, and occasionally throw in a few extras to make the evening special. This is why I asked if it was possible to get a comped table.,’ Zoe told Jezebel. When the woman reached out to the club host asking to make her friends' upcoming party extra special, the man demanded pictures of all 15 invitees. When Zoe replied that she did not have the guests' photos, Peter wrote back to her saying that the club is not going to offer 'comped' tables 'to random girls.' 'Then the club will be filled with hippos,' the host allegedly texted. 'That's not what Hakkasan is about.' He later reiterated his point, saying, 'We don't comp anything ugly.' Zoe retorted by writing to Peter the promoter that she does not think the bachelorette party will have a problem booking a complimentary table in Las Vegas. 'Other clubs yes, but not at the #1 club in America!' Peter boasted. The two . continued firing off text messages arguing over the photos of the . would-be guests, with the promoter repeatedly pressing Zoe to give him . her and the other women's Twitter or Instagram accounts. Zoe . noted that it would be a waste of her time to gather 15 photos of  people . she did not even know, to which the opinionated Hakkasan promoter . replied: 'so if you don't know them, how do you know they’re not whales . or hippos?' The . self-appointed arbiter of female beauty opined that since the group is . coming from Massachusetts, where according to Peter 'girls don't go to . the gym,' it would be hard to find 15 women who are all ‘9-10s.' At . the conclusion of their back-and-forth, Peter invited Zoe to come to the . club with her bridal party pals anyway and then 'ditch the whales' once she was inside. Only for VIPs: Peter the club host boasted that the No 1 club in America is not for 'random girls' and said that women from Massachusetts likely do not go to the gym . The written exchange, which Zoe shared with Jezebel, was accompanied by screenshots of what Peter has described as Hakkasan's policy on complimentary tables. Male patrons who wish to book a table for a bachelor party are not required to submit their photos, but they must pay a minimum of $4,000, according to the alleged rules of the establishment. In the aftermath of the outage sparked by the offensive text messages, the management of Hakkasan released a statement distancing itself from the rogue promoter, Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. ‘Hakkasan Group prides ourselves on providing our guests with an unmatched level of customer service,’ said Nick McCabe, President of Hakkasan Group. ‘The statements made by this individual, who has since been terminated from the company, do not represent our corporate policy or our views. This type of attitude and communication is totally unacceptable, and while we cannot control every piece of communication between our thousands of staff and guests, we will not tolerate anything less than impeccable customer service.’ The nightclub later clarified that Peter the host has not been outright fired, but rather suspended pending an investigation into the incident.","Zoe, from Southern California, contacted a Hakkasan Las Vegas host named Peter asking to book a complimentary table for a bachelorette party .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A New Mexico mother is facing a hate crime charge after police say she physically and sexually abused her 17-year-old daughter because she is lesbian. The Dona Ana County Sheriff’s Office said 40-year-old Magdo Haro, of Las Cruces, was arrested Tuesday on charges of second-degree criminal sexual penetration and third-degree child abuse. According to a criminal complaint, the 17-year-old girl told investigators she and Haro had been arguing about the girl’s sexual orientation for around a week. Grave charges: Magdo Haro, 40, from New Mexico, is accused of forcing her daughter to undress and touch herself, threatening to violate her with a stick and hitting her with a shoe for being gay . The complaint obtained by Las Cruses Sun-News states Haro threatened to insert the stick of a plunger and a hanger inside her daughter ‘so she would know what it was like to have sex with a woman.’ The mother eventually coerced her daughter into performing lewd sexual acts on herself. Magdo Haro was later released from Dona Ana County Jail on a $25,000 secured bond. Police say the dispute between the mother and daughter started last Saturday. According to the girl, who is not being named due to the nature of the crime, her mother was displeased seeing her in a baseball cap and allegedly ordered her daughter 'not to wear boy clothes anymore, only girl clothes.' The suspect also told the teen she would have to start going to church with her grandmother, according to the court filing. The young victim told investigators that things took a turn for the worse after Miss Haro found notes from the teen’s girlfriend. The complaint states that before the discovery, Miss Haro had given her daughter three chances to prove she was not gay, KFOX14 reported. The mother-daughter dispute culminated, according to court documents, with Haro forcing her daughter to take off her clothes so she could see that the teen was a woman and not a man, and then making the 17-year-old touch her privates.

A murder investigation is underway after a married mother, who was initially thought to have been killed in a hit-and-run, was discovered to have a gunshot wound to the head. The body of Rebekah Bletsch, 36, was . found on Sunday along a quiet road in Dalton Township, Michigan where . she lived with her husband and 11-year-old daughter. Mrs Bletsch last spoke to a family member at 5pm before she was found by strangers on the deserted road less than an hour later. Attempts to resuscitate her failed and she was pronounced dead at the scene, less than a mile from her home. It is believed that the 36-year-old had gone for a jog as she was found with headphones and an armband to hold a cellphone. Initially her death was thought to be a hit-and-run but on closer inspection of the scene, investigators found shell casings. An examination of her body found that she had a bullet wound to the head. The results of a full autopsy are expected to be released later today. Muskegon County Sheriff's office are trying to work out a motive for the mother's brutal death and have set up a task force to investigate the homicide.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Sat-navs are not much use if you want to take a scenic walk around an unfamiliar city at the weekend. While they may be good for getting from A to B in a hurry, the technology is unhelpful at selecting the prettiest routes, which may be of interest if you are not in so much of a rush. But Yahoo is working on an aesthetically-focused solution and is creating an algorithm that can pick out the most beautiful and pleasurable routes, initially based upon the views of locals. Yahoo is creating an algorithm that can pick out the most beautiful and happy of routes, based upon the views of locals. The map on the left shows the most direct route from Euston Square to the Tate Modern, wheres the one on the right, generated by the new algorithm is longer, but more aesthetically pleasing . According to the crowd-sourced exercise, Londoners consider these eight places the most beautiful in the capital. Daniele Quercia, of Yahoo Labs, Barcelona, wrote in a paper: ‘The goal of this work is to automatically suggest routes that are not only short but also emotionally pleasant.’ In order to create the scenic route algorithm, the computer scientists collected images from Google Street View and Geograph to create a database for central London, Gizmodo reported. They then asked 3,300 Londoners how pleasant the places and neighbourhoods were relative to each other. Users saw two places side by side and chose which one was more attractive. ‘We arranged those locations into a graph upon which we learned pleasant routes,’ Ms Quercia wrote. The team used the results to make heat maps of beautiful parts of London and generated an algorithm to plot the most attractive routes for people to walk along. The algorithm does this by searching through suggested routes from one location to another, manipulating the path to choose the most attractive roads. The computer scientists used crow sourced results to make heat maps of beautiful parts of London - including Millennium Bridge (pictured left) and Covent Garden (right) from which they generated an algorithm to plot the most attractive routes for people to walk along . The researchers said that routes tend to be 12 per cent longer than the shortest paths. When 30 volunteers tested their ‘attractive’ routes, they confirmed that they were indeed more aesthetically pleasing. ‘Based on a quantitative validation, we find that, compared to the shortest routes, the recommended ones add just a few extra walking minutes and are indeed perceived to be more beautiful, quiet and happy,’ they wrote. To test and build on the idea, the computer scientists then examined almost four million images on Flickr taken in specific London locations that they had already mapped, to understand what is considered beautiful. Knocking out the crowd-sourcing element of the process, the repeated the Flickr process to made a new map of central Boston, pinpointing beauty hotspots and routes. Volunteers who tried them out confirmed that they were more scenic than the most direct routes offered by other software, such as on sat-navs. While one person’s idea of beauty may differ from another, the computer scientists hope to develop an app exploiting their algorithm soon.","Computer scientists in Barcelona aimed to create an algorithm suggesting routes in London that are 'not only short but also emotionally pleasant'

The son and daughter of Nicole Brown Simpson have been pictured for the first time in years after they attended their grandfather’s funeral in California on Saturday. Justin, 25, and Sydney Simpson, 28 - whose father O.J. was famously found not guilty in 1995 of killing their mother - were among a group of 20 mourners at the service at Ascension Cemetery in Lake Forest. Their grandfather Lou Brown died aged 91 on July 3 after a seven-year battle with Alzheimer's disease. Scroll down for video . The son and daughter of the late Nicole Brown Simpson - Justin, 25, and Sydney Simpson, 28 - have been pictured for the first time in years after they attended their grandfather's funeral in California on Saturday . Sydney wore a black top, white trousers and sunglasses during the ceremony, while her brother – three years her junior – filled out a gray suit, while his hair appeared to be starting to thin on top . The sombre service was carried out at the graveside of their late mother who was murdered 20 years ago last month. On . June 12, 1994, Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman were found killed at . her Los Angeles home and O.J. Simpson was accused of the crimes. Following her murder, Lou Brown had always insisted that he wanted to be buried alongside his daughter. Saturday’s . service was the first time that Sydney Simpson has been in the . spotlight in four years, while her brother Justin hasn’t been seen in . ten years. Justin Simpson, left, along with 20 other relatives attended the funeral on Saturday of his grandfather Lou Brown, who passed away aged 91 on July 3 after a seven-year battle with Alzheimer's disease . Now fully grown adults, the siblings look dramatically different from how they were pictured as very young children prior to their mother’s death. Sydney wore a black top, white trousers and sunglasses during Saturday's ceremony, while her brother – three years her junior – filled out a gray suit, while his hair appeared to be starting to thin on top. Their grandfather had been a pilot during the Second World War and received a military send-off with Taps played by members of the armed forces. ‘Before the service, family members placed their favourite mementos of Lou in the crematory box,’ a family source told the National Enquirer. Also present for the sad family occasion were Lou’s widow Judith, plus Nicole’s three sisters Denise, Dominique and Tanya. Justin, now 25, and his sister Sydney, 28, are both in the restaurant business in the Southeast, according to their aunt . The Enquirer also reports that Sydney, a Boston University graduate, is currently dating an old college friend of her brother – 25-year-old Robert Blackmon. Justin and Sydney were just five and eight respectively when their mother was found brutally murdered alongside Mr Goldman at her Los Angeles home on June 12, 1994. Days later, their father was charged with the murders then later acquitted following a televised, eight-month trial that gripped the world. Their aunt Tanya Brown, Nicole's youngest sister, spoke last month about the close bond she shares with her niece and nephew and how despite the tragedy they have endured, the pair have grown into happy, well-adjusted adults. The aunt said that Justin and Sydney are both in the restaurant business in the southeast.

Miss Brown, 44, told RadarOnline: 'They’re in their late 20s. They’re professional. They’ve gone to college. They’re in relationships. They’re happy. They’re just like us. Quote unquote.' The aunt said that following their father's 1995 murder trial it was difficult for the children to experience a normal life. However Miss Brown and the children's grandmother forced themselves to face Simpson, who they believe killed Nicole and Ron Goldman, for the sake of the children. Miss Brown said: 'They will always love their dad. I choose to respect that.' O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown married in 1985. In 1989, the former football player . pleaded no contest to a domestic violence charge against Simpson. The couple . divorced in 1992. Tanya Brown also revealed that she has never discussed their mother's murder or Simpson with her niece and nephew. Nicole Brown Simpson's sister Tanya - pictured at Saturday's funeral - said last month that her niece and nephew are 'happy, in relationships and just like us' 'They’ve probably talked about it on their own,' she said. 'But when they come to our house we have fun. We don’t need to rehash everything.' Miss Brown, a life coach and mental-health . advocate, recently wrote a memoir about the loss of her . older sister Nicole, entitled Finding Peace Amid The Chaos. In the emotional book, she revealed the moment she knew that the man she once called 'Uncle O.J.' was responsible for her sister's death. She also described how her family's lives were forever shattered on the morning of June 13, 1994, when they found out that Nicole, recently divorced from Simpson, had been stabbed to death outside her Los Angeles home along with her friend Ron Goldman. She said the grief-stricken family watched on TV as her sister's bloodied corpse was loaded into a van to be taken to the morgue.

Brown said that at first she did not suspect Simpson, the former . football player turned actor, whom she knew as a beloved brother-in-law. After her sister's death, Miss Brown said she was exposed to the . harrowing truth - that Simpson was a violent man who had mentally and physically abused her sister . for years. In the days following the murders, the net began to close on Simpson, considered the prime suspect. On June 17, the day that Simpson was supposed to turn himself over to police on murder charges, the . former football player led officers on an infamous low-speed pursuit . in a white Ford Bronco SUV in California.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Slaving over textbooks and spending hours in a classroom conjugating verbs could be a thing of the past if one scientist’s predictions come true. Nicholas Negroponte of MIT predicted the demise of the computer mouse back in the 1980s and now thinks that it could be just 30 years until we can ‘ingest’ languages. The founder of MIT’s Media Lab and One Laptop per Child Association, said in a TED talk that we will be able to swallow pills to learn languages and works of literature in the future. Scroll down for video . Nicholas Negroponte (pictured) of MIT predicted the demise of the computer mouse back in the 1980s and now thinks that it could be just 30 years until we can 'ingest' information by simply taking a pill . He said that humans are adept at consuming information through our eyes, but this method may be inefficient compared with other alternatives. Addressing the TED audience in Vancouver, Canada, Negroponte said: ‘My prediction is that we'll be able to ingest information. ‘You're going to swallow a pill and know English. You're going to swallow a pill and know Shakespeare.’ ‘And the way to do it is through the bloodstream. So once it's [the information in the pill] in your bloodstream, it basically goes through and gets into the brain…and the different pieces get deposited in the right places.’ Negroponte said that he is not the only scientist to think such a feat of learning may be possible in the next 30 years. The computer mouse has had a good run, but almost 70 years since the design was first patented, it is now under threat from a smart ‘thimble’. The wearable 3D Touch device is fitted with an accelerometer and gyroscope, and lets people control an onscreen mouse using just a wave of their finger. The device, created by engineers at the University of Wyoming, uses a 3D accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope to orientate where the pointer should be. The 'thimble' also uses optical flow sensors to track movement against a 2D surface. A button between the forefinger and thumb is used in place of the left-click button on a standard mouse. All of this location data is streamed to a laptop and is used to move the cursor, it can also be used with touchscreen-style gestures such as double tap and long press. By combining data from all of the sensors, the 3DTouch can more accurately determine the location on the screen, and the researchers claim it can be used to move a 3D object with a positioning error of only about 1 mm. Mr Negroponte predicts that humans will be able to take a pill (illustrated) to ingest different pieces of information, such as languages and specific works of literature, for example. He thinks the information will be carried through the blood stream before being deposited in the right part of the brain . Humans will be able to take specific pills to learn different pieces of information. We could take one pill to learn English and another to ingest works of literature. The . pills would work because their ingredients and information would be . absorbed into the bloodstream, travel to the brain and be deposited in . the right place. This might sound like science fiction, but Negroponte and other scientists think it may be possible in just 30 years. He claims that it is when people say he is 'dead wrong' that a prediction might come true. In the 1970s be adapted a truck with cameras to create a map, a set-up reminiscent of Google's Street View. In his first TED talk in 1984, he predicted that we would stop using the mouse to control computers and instead use our fingers - essentially predicting touch screens which are ubiquitous on today's smartphones and tablets. He said: 'We picked fingers because everybody thought it was ridiculous. They were low-resolution, there was concern that the hand would occlude what you want to see and that the finger would get the screen dirty.' 'One of the things about ageing is that I can tell you with great confidence that I’ve been to the future. 'I’ve been there actually many times. How many times in my life have I said, ""In 10 years this will happen"" … and then 10 years comes' and the prediction comes true. In 1995, he said that we would buy books and newspapers online and read them on screens, so his latest prediction might not be as far fetched as it sounds today.","Nicholas Negroponte foresaw the death of the computer mouse - and now the device could be replaced by a smart thimble .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . You may think that microwaves are only used to cook speedy readymeals or defrost food at the last minute. But one U.S. company has developed a version of the device that enables it to calculate the number of calories in a meal. A prototype device by General Electric Global Research uses microwaves, which travel through food, to measure the fat and water content of dinner and consequently, its calorific content. Scroll down for video . A prototype device by General Electric uses microwaves, which travel through food, to measure the fat and water content of dinner and consequently, it's calorific content. A conceptual image of the as yet unnamed gadget is pictured . With obesity rates rising, there is huge demand for kitchen gadgets that make counting calories easier. And while cutting-edge kitchen scales go some way to helping, U.S. firm General Electric believes there is an easier way. Its unnamed calorie counter, developed in a laboratory in Niskayuna, New York, can accurately . reveal the calorific content of a plate of food at the push of a button – . without ingredients or components of a meal having to be analysed . separately. The device emits microwaves and detects specific signatures of the food, based upon how the waves travel though it when they encounter fat and water molecules. A concept is pictured . The device emits microwaves and detects specific signatures of the food, based upon how the waves travel though it when they encounter fat and water molecules. It does not emit enough waves to cook the food, however. ‘You can do this because water and fat interact with microwaves very differently,’ Matt Webster, the device’s creator, told Digital Trends. The prototype can estimate the calories in a meal using a unique equation that the team has developed over three years. ‘The equation takes the fat, water content numbers and assumes values for the rest,’ he said. Mr Webster explained that the machine doesn’t need to know the combination of proteins, carbohydrates and sugars as the equation takes care of it, although did not reveal how. The machine is currently a prototype and looks like a piece of lab equipment. Having tested it between 40 and 50 times, the scientists said that it is consistently within five to 10 per cent of the calories count, as determined by chemists using traditional methods. The team hopes to transform the prototype into a dome-shaped consumer device, that will fit neatly over a plate of food. There is currently no indication of when it might be available or how much it will cost. If you can’t wait for GE's wonder device, there are a number of smart scales that are on sale that claim to be able to count calories in homemade meals. The Situ scales weighs food in calories and nutrients – as well as in grams and ounces – so you will be able to make a sandwich and know just how good it is for you instantly. The battery-powered weighing scales has a Bluetooth chip inside it that talks to an iPad. A piece of fruit, for example, can be placed on the Situ scales to show its nutritional information using the accompanying app. Together with an app, the scale shows a food's calories, sugars, vitamins and fat content. The app comprises four main screens one of which shows different categories of food that people can pick from when weighing an item. To tell the app what food is on the real scales, users can drag its icon onto the mini Situ on the iPad’s screen. The nutritional content and calories in a food is displayed on the screen and foods can be added to favourites so that it is easier to find next time. The 'current plate' screen is used to track a whole meal and will show people the total nutritional content of everything that is being cooked or added to a plate. To ‘build’ a meal, users will simply weigh each ingredient, zeroing the scales before adding another and choosing the relevant food on the app, so that they will get the big nutritional picture of what they are eating. The inventors have raised all the moment they need on Kickstarter to put the £70 ($126) scales into production, which will be shipped in November.","General Electric is working on making a consumer calorie counting device .

"By . Associated Press . They have traditionally attracted those planning on downsizing or looking to simplify their lives for financial or environmental reasons. But there is now another group of people benefiting from the growing small-dwelling movement - the homeless. Efforts to construct the compact buildings are growing across the U.S. because they are cheaper than a traditional large-scale shelter, help the recipients socially because they are built in communal settings and are environmentally friendly due to their size.

Most require residents to behave appropriately, avoid drugs and alcohol and help maintain the properties . Betty Ybarra, 48, stands outside a tiny house she and her boyfriend live in, in Madison, Wisconsin. It is the first house built by OM Build, which wants to build nine houses in Madison for the homeless . 'You're out of the elements, you've got your own bed, you've got your own place to call your own,' said Harold 'Hap' Morgan, who is without a permanent home in Madison. 'It gives you a little bit of self-pride: This is my own house.' Mr Morgan is in line for a 99-square-foot house built through the non-profit Occupy Madison Build, or OM Build, run by former organizers with the Occupy movement. The group, in Wisconsin, hopes to create a cluster of tiny houses like those in Olympia, Washington, and Eugene and Portland, Oregon. Many have been built with donated materials and volunteer labour, sometimes from the people who will live in them. Most require residents to behave appropriately, avoid drugs and alcohol and help maintain the properties. Still, sometimes neighbours have not been receptive. Linda Brown, who can see the proposed site for Madison's tiny houses from her living room window, said she worries about noise and what her neighbours would be like. 'There have been people who have always been associated with people who are homeless that are unsavoury types of people,' she said. Organizer Brenda Konkel hopes to allay neighbours' concerns by the time the City Council votes in May on the group's application to rezone the site of a former auto body shop to place the houses there. Plans include gardens, a chicken coup and possibly bee hives and showers and bathrooms in the main building.

The City Council will be voting in May on the group's application to rezone the site of a former auto body shop to place the houses there . Plans for the site include gardens, a chicken coup and possibly bee hives and showers and bathrooms in the main building . 'I think a lot of them we can work through. I think there is some ways we can be a real asset to the neighborhood,' she said. The group has already built one house that is occupied by a couple and parked on the street. A volunteer moves it every 24 or 48 hours as required by city ordinances. The house, which cost about $5,000, fits a double bed with overhead storage, a small table and a small room with a compostable toilet. There's no plumbing or electricity, but the home is insulated and has a propane heater to get the residents through the harsh Wisconsin winters. Eventually, organizers want to add solar panels.

The industrial park workshop where tiny houses for the homeless are being constructed in Madison, Wisconsin . Construction on the first two houses started last summer, and the first residents moved in on Christmas Eve, according to the Wisconsin State Journal . Mr Morgan, who has struggled with a spinal cord surgery, alcohol addiction and unemployment, lives in a trailer provided by OM Build. He hopes to work as a cook again. 'My goal is to go back to that and get my own place, but it's really nice to have this to fall back on,' he said. The tiny house effort in Eugene sprung up after the city shut down an Occupy encampment that turned into a tent city for the homeless. Andrew Heben and others worked with the city, which provided them land for the project. Opportunity Village Eugene opened in September with little resistance, said Heben, 26, who is on the board of directors. Most of the nine huts, which are 60 square feet, and 21 bungalows, which are 64 square feet and 80 square feet, are already built. The small structures have a roof, insulated walls, toilet and sink and are intended to provide basic shelter against the elements .

The current home has no plumbing or electricity, but is insulated and has a propane heater to get the residents through the harsh Wisconsin winters . Thirty people are living in them now, and he expects 40 to 45 to ultimately be there. The houses don't have electricity, water, bathrooms, showers or kitchens, but separate shared buildings do. They have done it all for less than $100,000, which is about half the median home price in Eugene, all from private donors with no taxpayer money. He said the story has changed from how tent cities were a problem in America to how the community is banding together. 'It's an American success story... Now we see in different cities people coming up with citizen driven solutions,' Heben said. Most of the sites require residents to behave appropriately, avoid drugs and alcohol and help maintain the properties . Ministries in Texas and New York also are developing communities with clusters of small houses. Mobile Loaves and Fishes plans 135 small homes and 100 recreational vehicles on 27 acres near Austin, Texas. The Christian ministry that started 15 years ago bringing food and clothing to the homeless hopes to raise $7 million to build the homes, streets, utilities, sewers, a farming operation, medical facility and sanctuary, President and CEO Alan Graham said. Residents would pay rent that ranges from $90 a month for a 150-square-foot home to $375 for 400 square feet. 'The goal is to reach everybody where they are economically,' Graham said. He expects a staff of 15 will run the village, with residents having the option to get paid to help with upkeep. Community Faith Partnership near Ithaca, New York, has built six of up to 18 planned 320-square-foot houses as transitional living for homeless men, said Jim Crawford, the group's executive director. The men will pay rent on a sliding scale that looks at their situation and whether they receive government aid. The heart of the operation will be a community centre where people who aren't social can learn to relate to others in a safe environment, Crawford said. 'We are bringing people into tangible housing but we are bringing them also into much less tangible human framework of social relations and that is the more difficult work,' he said. 'That is the more sophisticated work.'","Occupy Madison Build hoping to create cluster of tiny houses for homeless .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A giant robot in China may be able to 3D print 10 bungalows in a day, but the machine needed to pipe the concrete has to be bigger than the building it is creating - making skyscrapers an all but impossible dream. However, swarms of small robotic builders could soon overcome this problem to make structures much taller and wider than themselves. Engineers in Barcelona have created a range of Minibuilders that can work together, beavering away on different tasks, to construct large pieces of buildings. Handy: Swarms of small robotic builders - including this vacuum bot - could make structures much taller and wider than themselves . The Minibuilder robots are team players and together they could build a skyscraper with very little human intervention, once their paths are mapped out. Foundation robots build up the first 20 layers of mixture, similar to a large coiled pot. ‘Grip’ robots that clip onto the sides of the walls take over the work to add more layers of piped mixture as they move along, climbing higher. Vacuum robots use their suction power to creep up the side of a structure, adding extra piped mixture to reinforce it. In theory, if enough of these robots were used, they could built skyscrapers. Experts at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC) in Barcelona created the ‘family’ of small construction robots that are all capable of constructing objects far larger than themselves. They work together squirting out concrete-like material that hardens quickly to form the structure of a building. However, the shapes of the buildings are determined by architects using computer software. Foundation robots build up the first 20 layers of mixture by pumping out the quick-drying mixture, similar to a large coiled pot. Their work is then taken over by ‘grip’ robots that clip onto the sides of the walls to add more layers as they move along piping mixture, FastCo reported. A master of the trade: Scientists have created Minibuilders that can work together, beavering away on different tasks, to construct large pieces of buildings . Teamwork: The Minibuilders work together squirting out concrete-like material that hardens quickly to form the structure of a building, which they can then clip onto (pictured) and continue their work . Vacuum robots use their suction power to creep up the side of a structure, adding extra piped mixture to reinforce it. If many robots are used together, they could rapidly create structures much, much larger than themselves as the building they would create could act as a sort of climbing frame. ‘Each of the robots were developed was to perform a diverse task, linked to the different phases of construction, finally working together as a family towards the implementation of a single structural outcome,’ their creators explained. Frugal: The little robots could also cut construction waste produced in large quantities by traditional building techniques, as they only pump what they need (pictured) and there are no moulds or support structures . Laying the foundations: Here, a foundation robot begins the structure by building up the first layers of piped mixture. Other robots will take over the work when the structure becomes high enough for them to cling to . Suck it and see: Vacuum robots (pictured) use their suction power to creep up the side of a structure, adding extra piped mixture to reinforce it . Foundation robots (pictured) build up the first 20 layers of mixture, similar to a large coiled pot . ‘Hence, instead of one large machine, a number of much smaller robots working independently, but in coordination, towards a single goal.’ Researchers Petr Novikov and Sasa Jokic of the IAAC explained that while huge robots can print small buildings quickly, they have to fit around a structure, limiting the size of projects, and are expensive. ‘Making such machines isn’t economically reasonable, sustainable, and, in some cases, simply impossible due to their size,’ they said. In contrast, there is no limit on what the Minibuilders could create. ‘The robots can work simultaneously while performing different tasks, and having a fixed size, they can create objects of virtually any scale, as far as material properties permit,’ they said, noting that such machines would also be easy for builders to take to construction sites. The little robots could also cut construction waste produced in large quantities by traditional building techniques, as they only pump out what they need and there are no moulds or support structures required to make structures. It is hoped more swarm robots will be created so they could take on the roles of plasterers and decorators too.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Three premature babies have died and many others seriously injured after being wiped with an antiseptic solution, it has emerged. Now doctors have been urged to be cautious when using chlorhexidine antiseptic on tiny babies after health experts noted a number of cases of chemical burns and other serious side effects in premature infants. The solution has even been linked to the deaths of three babies in the UK, officials said. Doctors have been urged to be careful when using an antiseptic on tiny babies after health officials noted a number of cases of chemical burns in premature infants wiped with the solution. Stock image . Experts at the London-based Medicines . and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have asked doctors to . use the solution with care after noticing a pattern of burns . among premature babies. A . total of 28 newborns in the UK have suffered ‘serious side effects’ after being wiped down with the antiseptic before a catheter was . inserted. These side effects included chemical burns, which caused skin loss in some cases, or a skin condition called erythema. Chlorhexidine is frequently used to prevent catheter-related blood stream infections among premature babies. The MHRA received 13 reports of ‘serious . side effects’ among children who were treated with a chlorhexidine . solution between 2004 and 2013. Experts at the regulator have also identified a further 16 cases in medical records between 1992 and 2014. Of the 29 cases, four of the babies died including three in the UK and one in the United States. A total of 28 newborns in the UK have suffered ‘serious side effects’ after being wiped down with the antiseptic before a catheter was inserted. Side effects included chemical burns, which caused skin loss in some cases, or a skin condition called erythema. The chemical injuries occurred in premature babies who were born and treated with the solution before 32 weeks of pregnancy. A total of 12 reports of 'serious side effects' were reported among children who were treated with a chlorhexidine solution between 2004 and 2013 and 16 cases in medical literature between 1992 and 2014. Of the 29 cases, four of the babies died including three in the UK and one in the United States. Experts have said that the solution itself should be harmless if used correctly and new guidelines have been issued. One baby died in the UK in 2005 and while the cause of death given was kidney failure, chlorhexidine is thought to be a possible contributing factor in the case, an MHRA spokesman said. A further two children died in 2010. The cause of death recorded in the first case was chronic lung disease . and prematurity, and in the second case no cause of death was given. The . baby is thought to have died as a result of complications related to . extreme prematurity. But the spokesman said that in both cases . chlorhexidine is thought to be a possible contributing factor. The case in the U.S. was not linked to the use of the antiseptic. The . MHRA said that the chemical injuries occurred in premature babies who . were born and treated with the solution before 32 weeks of pregnancy. A . drug safety update issued by the regulator gave fresh advice for health . workers on the use of the chemical including, using the minimum amount . of the solution to treat small babies and monitoring them frequently if . they are treated with the antiseptic. Experts at the London-based Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have urged doctors to use the solution with care after experts noticed a pattern of burns among premature babies. A chemical diagram for Chlorohexidine is pictured . Any nappies or sheets soaked with the solution should be removed, it added. The MHRA said that European health officials will be reviewing the issue. ‘Hospital use of chlorhexidine has a crucial role in preventing infection in premature infants, which is a leading cause of death in neonatal units and is used safely many thousands of times every year in hospitals,’ said Dr June Raine, director of MHRA’s Vigilance and Risk Management of Medicines Division. ‘Our monthly bulletin, Drug Safety Update, includes information on a small number of historic reports of serious side-effects, including four suspected deaths, in premature infants associated with the use of this product. Two of these were thought to be due to severe complications of prematurity. ‘We have also given guidance to healthcare professionals to use the minimum solution required and to remove any excess bearing in mind the risk in very pre-term infants.’ Dr Martin Ward-Platt, a spokesman for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, added: ‘This stuff should be harmless, if harm is caused it is likely to be a training or knowledge issue. 'This is avoidable and a harm these babies should not be at risk of. Nobody’s baby should come to harm because of this.’","Babies have suffered burns and other serious side effects after being disinfected with the chlorhexidine antiseptic .

"By . James Gordon . A small chihuahua that was rescued off the California highway has been reunited with its owners. California Highway Patrol in Contra Costa tweeted a photo last Friday of an officer trying to get the dog off the I-680 highway median. Two little girls and their dad have now picked up their lost Chihuahua named Charm (aka 'Freeway') and taken her home. The dog had escaped from the family’s backyard and somehow survived crossing the nearby three-lane highway. Happy ending: The young lady who is very happy to have her dog, Charm, back alongside Animal Services Officer Andrew Tara . Our best friend: Two little girls are reunited with Charm (aka Freeway). They had searched for their lost pet for days and posted messages on Instagram . Scared: The pooch was reportedly frightened and taken to animal control . Come here! A CHP officer is seen trying to get the dog off of the median divider . Nobody knew at the time where the dog came from — whether she had been abandoned or escaped from her owners. Contra Costa Animal Services took the dog into their care at their Martinez shelter, saying that she would be put up for adoption if nobody claimed her . The reunion was very sweet affair for everyone involved. Charm appeared to be exceptionally happy to see her family once again. The pooch had escaped from her . backyard near Hwy 680 and amazingly survived a frightening dash dash across several . lanes of traffic before jumping onto the median where she was found. A . California Highway Patrol officer tweeted the now famous photo of his partner enticing Charm . with a protein bar. Animal Services Officer Andrew Tara carefully picked her up and transported her to a shelter . in Martinez. Our heroes: Charm is now safe with her family, and the two girls drew a picture to thank the agency and the police officer who helped rescue their pet. Split personality: In the drawing, the dog has two food bowls: one that says Charm and one that says Freeway . Never let go: It was an emotional and teary reunion as the girls  were reunited with Charm after a week apart . Hero: Animal Services Officer Andrew Tara holds Charm after delicately rescuing her from the 608 Highway last Friday night . Where she belongs: Since Charm had not been microchipped, it was believed she was either a stray or abandoned, but in fact, the dog¿s family was heartbroken when she disappeared. The two little girls had been posting photos of their dog on Instagram for days looking for help . Scared: Charm was said to be frightened when she was initially found but by Mothers Day she had calmed down somewhat . Dynamic duo: One officer lured the frightened dog using a piece of a protein bar. The other officer snapped a photo that soon began to tug at heartstrings across the Internet . The girls had been posting Instagram photos of their lost . dog for days and had been looking for her since she escaped from their backyard.Since Charm had not been microchipped, it was believed she was either a stray or abandoned, but in fact, the dog’s family was heartbroken when she disappeared.

'We are ALL very happy for the family, who . have learned a very valuable and expensive lesson in pet licensing, . microchipping, spaying, good fencing, and the power of social media!' said the Contra Costa Animal Shelter in a statement. The story began on Saturday after a tweet by the Contra Costa patrol division said that the dog had been found in the middle of the road. CHP officer Alex Edmond responded after police received two calls about the chihuahua. 'We attempted to coax it, we could tell it was very frightened, it was shaking - we were able to pet it a little bit, but other than that we could tell it was not happy,' Edmon said. The dog did not respond to his offer of trail mix and was eventually lured by a protein bar. If Charm the chihuahua had not been picked up, she would likely have been adopted by an eager new owner . Driving the message home: Now that the little Chihuahua's story has had a happy ending, the agency wants to raise awareness about the other homeless shelter dogs waiting for adoption . The chihuahua also seemed to enjoy herself on Mother's Day, according to a Sunday Facebook announcement. She 'is starting to relax and come out of her shell,' it said. 'Today on Mother's day [sic], two of our wonderful kennel technicians spent their lunch socializing her and helping her overcome her fear.' Now that the little Chihuahua's story has had a happy ending, the agency wants to raise awareness about the other homeless shelter dogs waiting for adoption.

"By . Pedro Oliveira Jr. A drunk man in New Mexico stabbed his girlfriend's 9-month-old puppy with a screwdriver, skinned the pooch and planned to serve it for dinner, police says. Prosecutors in Torrance County have charged Salvador Martinez, 46,with felony extreme cruelty to animals on accusations that he killed his girlfriend's black-and-white chiweenie Onyx, a mix of dachshund and Chihuahua. He's also charged with child abuse. “The [grandchildren] were present inside the residence and had full knowledge of what was taking place with their family pet,” Sheriff Heath White told KRQE. Scroll down for video . Salvador Martinez, 46, is behind bars after being charged in the killing of his girlfriend's 9-month-old puppy Onyx. Martinez, of Edgewood, told authorities that he took little Onyx into the backyard and pierced her heart with a screwdriver on July 18. He then skinned the pooch and stored the dog's carcass in the fridge while he looked up dog meat recipes — and whether eating it was illegal. 'He had her marinating in Italian dressing in the fridge,'  said the man's girlfriend, Mandy Malone, to KOAT. Malone — who lives with another eight dogs, five cats and a few chickens — said Martinez had been drunk the night before and became angry when the dogs started barking, according to KRQE. 'He said he was going to kill one and barbecue it,' she told the station. 'I didn’t believe him because he’d been saying it for a while and I knew he loved animals.' Lonely: Mandy Malone holds the twin of her murdered puppy, Onyx, who she says was killed by her boyfriend and almost served for dinner . When she confronted him about the meat in the fridge, Martinez told Malone that, if she didn't like it, he'd just take the pooch to barbecue at his mother's house. 'Nobody knows what to think, nobody's ever heard of this before,' Mandy Malone told KOAT. 'He'd said it before, but jokingly,' she added. 'Just out of the blue: I'm going to barbecue one of your dogs.' New Mexico is one of a handful of states where the law doesn't say much about the eating of dogs and cats. But prosecutors say no matter what the law says, it is certainly illegal to kill them in such a cruel manner. Disgusted: Mandy Malone had heard her boyfriend say he would one day barbecue her dogs before, but she never thought he'd follow through with the threats . “It is extremely disturbing to know that someone would be that brutal with a family animal,” White said. Martinez claimed to investigators that he killed Onyx to feed the family. Malone says there was plenty of food in the house. “It makes me sick to think about it – I haven’t been able to eat or sleep,” she told the Albuquerque Journal. Martinez is in federal custody for violating his probation on a 2003 conviction for trying to smuggle 13 kilos of cocaine through the US-Mexico border. He pleaded guilty to that crime and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.","Salvador Martinez, 46, is charged with felony extreme cruelty to animals and child abuse .

"By . Pedro Oliveira Jr. A Texas psychiatrist and three other men have been indicted for running an international human trafficking ring that brought female dancers from India and forced them to become strippers and prostitutes in New York City. Federal prosecutors say the alleged criminals would find female dancers in India and promise them cultural exchange jobs in the US. But . once the women arrived, they were forced to . dance in nightclubs for 12 to 14 hours a night, seven days a week, and were pressured to have sex with clients, court records show. Charged with labor conspiracy and visa fraud by a Manhattan grand jury are: Riyaz . Mazcuri, known as 'the Doctor,' Sabja Khimani, Rashmikant Patel and . Mehmood Hassanali Dhanani, known as 'Sam' and 'Mehboob.' Texas psychiatrist Riyaz Mazcuri is one of four men charged with labor conspiracy and visa fraud. Prosecutors say they lured women to work in cultural exchange programs but forced them to become strippers and prostitutes . Between 2008 and 2010, the criminal ring kept the women in their service by confiscating their passports and locking the victims in hotel rooms when they were not working. Assistant US Attorney Peter Skinner, who is handling the case, would not say where in New York City the women were performing or whether the nightclub management is suspected of any criminal activities. More people are expected to be charged with involvement in the trafficking ring, a source told MailOnline. Mazcuri, a graduate of the University of Karachi in Pakistan, has been a licensed psychiatrist in Texas since 1986. Riyaz has been licensed to practice psychiatry in Texas since the '80s. His Texas clinic, pictured here, remains open . He has no history of medical malpractice or other criminal activity, and his record reflects no disciplinary actions have ever been taken against him, according to the Texas Medical Board. The doctor appeared before a judge in Texas on Friday afternoon and was released on $300,000 bond, according to KLTV.

Police said a costumed Bishop 'put out his hand and told the woman 5s, 10s or 20s only.' Police said the officer told him he could only accept tips, not require payment.

Bishop yelled and cursed at the officer, police said, and told him: 'Mind your own [expletive] business.' Police said the officer asked for identification and, when Bishop failed to produce any, moved to arrest him. Busted: performer Titus Gandy, known as the Black Naked Cowboy, was also not nabbed from Times Square, but he was charged with alleged possession of cocaine when he stopped by a Midtown police precinct and cops checked his pockets due to an open warrant .

The officer, whose name has not released, was treated and released at New York University's Langone Medical Center. Other officers arrived and took Spider-Man away. On an unrelated incident, performer Titus Gandy, 22 — known as the Black Naked Cowboy — was charged with possession of cocaine when he showed up at a Midtown police precinct to pick up a friend's car, according to a police source. He was stopped on an open warrant and cops frisked him, finding an envelope and a straw, both allegedly containing cocaine residue, the source added. He was later released on a desk-appearance ticket. 'I . didn't even know there was a problem,' Gandy said of the police crackdown in Times Square. 'After I take pictures with fans and oncoming . traffic, they want to pay me.' Bishop's mother answered the phone at their Brooklyn home late Saturday and said he was not there. She said she was not aware of his work in Times Square or his arrest. Information on Bishop's lawyer was not available. Arrested: A street entertainer dressed as Spider-Man, similar to the actor pictured, has been charged with assaulting a police officer in Times Square . The arrest of Spider-Man, as police referred to Bishop throughout a matter-of-fact news release, came weeks after the New York City Council said it was considering legislation to regulate the costumed characters in Times Square. It was the latest in a series of incidents involving men behind the masks. In the last two years, a man dressed as Cookie Monster was charged with shoving a two-year-old, a person attired in Super Mario's overalls was accused of groping a woman, and an Elmo figure pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after unleashing an anti-Semitic tirade. Last month a different Spider-Man was convicted of harassment for a February 2013 episode in which he cursed and complained that a woman did not tip him after posing with her children. Phillip Williams later punched the woman in the face and knocked her to the ground - out of self-defense, he said - after she hurled snow at him. The bill under city council consideration would require licenses and background checks for costumed performers, but copyright issues have held up final approval because most of the costume wearers are not authorized by the characters' owners. Police Commissioner William Bratton last week endorsed the measure to combat what he called Times Square's 'Elmo issues.'","Hortencia Aliaga, 42, and Luis Salinas, 20, were picked up while blocking a sidewalk to solicit money .

"By . Associated Press . The unclaimed, cremated remains of nine victims of a 1978 mass cult suicide-murder in Jonestown, Guyana, have turned up in a closed funeral home in Delaware. Officials with the state Division of Forensic Science are working to identify all remains and to notify relatives after they were discovered last week. The remains were discovered at the abandoned Minus Funeral Home in Dover, Delaware by the building's new owner who called in authorities. Dead bodies littered the ground in Jonestown, Guyana on November 18, 1978 after a mass suicide of People's Temple cult followers, led by Jim Jones. More than 900 adults and children died after drinking cyanide-laced punch . Reverend Jim Jones raises his fist in a black power salute while preaching at an unknown location. This is one of the photographs from a photo album found in the Jonestown commune after the cult's mass suicide . The building is owned by a bank. The division last week responded to a request to check the former funeral home after 38 containers of remains were discovered inside. A Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security spokeswoman told MailOnline today that they had identified the remains as Jonestown cult members by cross-checking paperwork that was found with the remains with other official records. Dover police officers identified other areas of interest on the property, according to an official release. These were areas of loosely-compacted soil. The excavation was conducted to determine if additional remains were on the property. During the excavation, an arrowhead, two animal bones, oyster shells and charcoals were found. Several bronze gravesite markers for deceased veterans who served in World War I through the Vietnam War were also found in the former funeral home. These markers will be presented to family members if they can be located or returned to the Veterans Administration.

Thirty-three containers were marked and identified. They spanned a period from about 1970 to the 1990s and included the Jonestown remains. It is unclear how the Jonestown remains ended up being left behind at the Minus Funeral Home but a spokeswoman said today there was nothing improper about how the remains had been stored and they were simply unclaimed. Bodies of the 911 Jonestown massacre victims were brought to Dover Air Force Base, home to the U.S. military's largest mortuary. More than 900 adults and children died after drinking cyanide-laced punch on November 18, 1978 at Jonestown, Guyana. Among the dead were more than 270 children. Dead bodies of cult followers littered the ground outside the People's Temple, led by Jim Jones. It was the single largest loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act before September 11. Jones headed a religious movement called Peoples Temple Agricultural Project from the early Sixties in the U.S. before leading a mass migration to Guyana, a former British colony, in the mid-Seventies to establish a utopian community. However the paradise that Jones had promised quickly turned sour as hard labor and hours of lectures and classes on socialism were enforced. Jones' readings which viewed America as a capitalist monster were broadcast day and night from the commune's towers. Bodies being removed from Jonestown by military personnel in 1978. They were flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware home to the U.S. military's largest mortuary . The land agreed upon for Jonestown with the Guyanese government had poor soil leading to low food supplies and sickness. Members who acted out of line were kept in a 6ft x 4ft box and children were forced to spend the night at the bottom of a well. Those who tried to escape were drugged and armed guards patrolled the grounds. In 1977, Jonestown defectors and concerned relatives begin petitioning the U.S. government to investigation the goings-on in Guyana. They made public details of abuse and alleged crimes talking place in Jonestown. In 1978, Jim Jones physical health was deteriorating rapidly through sickness and years of drug abuse. In turn, he was becoming deranged and deeply paranoid over conspiracy theories and the number of people he believed were out to get him from the CIA to the U.S. Post Office. The same year, a delegation went to visit Jonestown, led by Congressman Leo Ryan. After visiting the compound with staff and journalists, he left with several a number of defectors. Ryan along with four others were killed after being shot by members of the Peoples Temple who ambushed them on Port Kaituma airstrip. Soon afterwards, gathered a meeting of all members while his assistants prepared a vat of Flavor-Aid laced with cyanide and other drugs. The Temple had stored pounds of cyanide for months after Jones got a jeweler's license which reportedly said he was using the deadly chemical to clean gold. As Temple members lined up to take the poison, it began to take effect within minutes. It is unclear whether many thought it was a dress-rehearsal as had happened in the past on so-called 'White Nights'. Jones died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Only five people who were intended to be poisoned survived either by hiding, pretending to be dead or escaping into the jungle.

"By . Richard Spillett . Elaine McKay admitted sending a pupil explicit pictures  but denied grooming the boy and having sex with him. She was cleared of those offences today . A married teaching assistant who admitted sending explicit pictures of herself to a pupil more than 40 years  her junior has been cleared of grooming and having sex with the boy. Elaine McKay, 58, admitted sending a string of photographs to the 15-year-old schoolboy, including provocative images of herself posing topless. But she denied claims that the relationship escalated to the pair having sex, saying that the boy told a lie which got out of control. Jurors at Chelmsford Crown Court found her not guilty of one charge of intentionally touching a boy aged 15 by having full sex with him and one charge of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Judge Patricia Lynch said she would sentence McKay for an offence of causing a child to look at sexually explicit images next month. McKay, who was wearing a black suit and white blouse, sighed with relief as the verdict was returned. She was supported in court by her third husband and other members of her family. The prosecution claimed that she began to seduce the schoolboy while working at the 1,700-pupil Clacton Coastal Academy in Essex. She accepted she spent around a year inundating the youngster with X-rated Facebook and WhatsApp messages and naked photographs of herself and pictures of her knickers. But McKay, of Clacton, Essex, broke down in tears in the witness stand as she vehemently denied having sex with the youngster. She insisted the boy had initiated the inappropriate behaviour by 'pestering' her for 'sexy pictures'. She told jurors: 'He kept pestering and asking me 'Please, just one picture, just one picture, even if it's just a pair of knickers'.' McKay was working at the 1,700-pupil Clacton Coastal Academy when she met the teenager . McKay said the first explicit picture she sent him was a 'silly' picture of her shower that inadvertently had her underwear hanging in the background, and things had escalated from there. But she agreed that there came a time when she 'effectively gave him what he was asking for'. Asked why she sent the photographs, McKay sobbed: 'I have no idea whatsoever. This is my regret. I don't know, I don't know the reason.' McKay had told the court she feared the boy would expose her if she stopped sending him pictures . But she added: 'I would never have had sex with him. Nothing ever physical. I would never have had sex with him, ever.' McKay - who has been suspended from her job - told the court she was terrified the schoolboy would expose her if she stopped sending him the pictures. She said: 'Each time I refused him, he would get angry with me and I thought this it. He is going to tell somebody.' She admitted she was probably subconsciously sexually attracted to the teen and said she began sending pictures to the schoolboy for 'a joke' and 'banter'. She said she had being foolish in having an 'inappropriate relationship' with the teen and told jurors: 'I hold my hands up to it. It's my biggest regret.' Pressed over why she continued to send the explicit pictures, she said: 'I hated every minute of it. I sort of switched off. 'I just saw it as something I was doing. Something I didn't know how to get myself out of. I don't know why I did it, I feel like I'm not talking about me when I say it.' But she said she was too scared to put a stop to the relationship.","Elaine McKay admitted sending the teenager naked and topless photos .

"By . Richard Spillett . Tanya Strangeway  has been dismissed by West Yorkshire Police after receiving gifts from ex-partner Nicholas McFadden, who sold drugs confiscated from criminals . The former fiancee of a corrupt policeman who made more than a million pounds selling drugs confiscated from criminals has now been fired from the same police force. Detective Constable Tanya Strangeway was showered with gifts by ex-partner Nicholas McFadden, including an Audi car and £10,000 gift-wrapped in bundles of £20 and £10 notes, a trial heard last year. McFadden, also a detective for West Yorkshire Police, made £1.1million from his crimes after he helped himself to heroin, cocaine and cannabis and sold it on the streets. In April last year, Leeds Crown Court heard how he used the cash to fund a lavish lifestyle including buying designer clothes, jewellery and an orangery. He was jailed for 23 years, and ordered to pay back over £250,000. West Yorkshire Police has now confirmed that Ms Strangeway has been dismissed at a misconduct hearing earlier this summer for 'discreditable conduct'. The allegations against her are believed to be linked to the supply of drugs, though she has never been convicted of any criminal offence. She had previously lived with and been engaged to McFadden until their relationship ended in 2006, but she told the court last year that they became close again in 2011. Disgraced former policeman McFadden worked for the specialist Organised Crime Group for West Yorkshire Police. During a five-week trial, Leeds Crown Court heard he and his brother Simon, 42, with whom he conspired to supply the drugs, made so much money they 'they did not know what to do with it'. His colleagues had noticed that he purchased a private number plate for his car, that he began to wear designer clothing and an expensive wristwatch, and that he spoke of gifts that he had bought his wife. But he explained away his excess money by telling his work his wife had received an insurance payout after being ill with cancer. After developing a relationship with Ms Strangeway, McFadden used the cash to buy her a host of expensive gifts while funding their luxury lifestyle. She told his trial last year: 'In June 2011, I received a text message off Nick saying we were going to be working together on a job. Then we became close again. He told me that he had something he wanted to give me and when we met up, that's when he surprised me.' McFadden was jailed for 23 years and ordered to pay back over £250,000 last year. A  bag of drugs and money (right) was seized from his garage after police launched an investigation . Strangeway was given £10,000 after McFadden made so much money 'he didn't know what to do with it' Ms Strangeway said DC McFadden had given her a parcel which contained bundles of ten and twenty pound notes. 'There was £10,000 in total,' she told the court. 'I made an assumption that the money came from the sale of his house. It was a life-changing amount of money from a house we shared together. I didn't feel like I had to ask questions about it. I had no reason to doubt him.' The court heard how McFadden bought an Audi A4 for his ex-lover in July 2011, costing £10,000, gave her £2,000 in cash for a shopping trip and posted parcels of money through her letterbox, amounting to around £1,000. The gifts came to light when Ms Strangeway was asked to declare them after the vetting procedure changed at her work. 'Nick was very concerned about his wife finding out that he'd given me the money and the car,' she said. Commenting on her dismissal, Detective Chief Superintendent Clive Wain, of West Yorkshire Police's Professional Standards Department, said: 'West Yorkshire Police expects the highest standards of professionalism from all officers and staff and will take appropriate disciplinary action against anyone who fails to meet those standards.'

James Burton (left) has been jailed for life for killing Matthew Dunn (right) by stabbing him 29 times . He was jailed for life and ordered to serve at least 30 years behind bars after a judge found he showed had no remorse and had no mitigation. Mr Justice Blake said: 'You showed callous indifference to the suffering of the victim, and were full of obsessive jealousy. 'When he was dead you went through his pockets to find his mobile phone so you could pursue your jealous obsession about their relationship. 'Matthew was a hard-working decent man and I've read with sorrow the statements of relatives and his mother is devastated by the loss. Aimee Radley found him a loving partner.' Burton, 32, who smokes cannabis and has a borderline personality disorder, harassed and stalked his former lover for months, Leicester Crown Court heard. He crouched outside her home in Hinckley, Leicestershire, for more than two hours on the morning of January 24, before bursting in and attacking Mr Dunn, 23. Burton was carrying a hunting lock knife and a rucksack containing four pieces of rope, two formed into nooses, lighter fluid and three sets of cable ties fashioned into makeshift handcuffs.

"By . Richard Spillett . A cemetery in Stafford has become the first in Britain to turn to so-called 'ready-made' plastic graves after it ran out of room to bury to dead. Eccleshall Road Cemetery was forced to turn away  funerals after it used up all of the suitable land allotted for burials. It is problem that has being felt around the country, with warnings earlier this year of a national shortage in grave space. But an experimental new scheme that could now be used in cemeteries all over Britain has seen pre-dug graves  constructed out of plastic. Workers install ready-made graves in Stafford after a cemetery ran out of room for more burials . The local council hopes the new system will stop graves subsiding in land previously thought too sandy . The move came after the cemetery ran out of the space to dig new graves and nearby land was considered too sandy to house long-lasting burial places. The local council has now installed large plastic walls to create plots where coffins can be placed without the risk of subsidence. New graves are made by digging a plot much larger than the standard burial with room for 12 bodies. A giant frame is then put in place with walls installed on the frame to create individual plots measuring 9ft by 4ft. The plot is then refilled, leaving one space unfilled ready for the next burial. If more plots can be added on to the frame if required at a later date without disturbing those already resting. The first plot was used for the burial of a man last Friday. The area dug up was later covered, leaving pre-made graves, one of which has already been used . It is thought the scheme, which uses plastic frames like those pictured, may now be used around the country . While the installation does increase the cost of digging the graves, the council insists it saves money in the long term and increases the amount of available space threefold. A spokesperson for Stafford Borough Council said they believed they were the first in the country to experiment with the new grave system. The burial system could be rolled out to help extend the life of the other cemeteries, the spokesperson said. Local councillor Frank Finlay said: 'This gives the chance for those who would like their loved ones to be buried in this cemetery - something they may not have thought possible.' In May this year, MPs warned that growing pressures on land for development and farming has left many local councils struggling to find space for burial sites. Like many cemeteries around Britain, Eccleshall Road Cemetery was running out of room to bury the dead . Other cemeteries have built concrete chambers but this is the first time cheaper plastic has been used .","Like many cemeteries,  resting place in Stafford was running out of room .

"By . Richard Spillett . The alleged bomb hoaxer arrested on a flight into Manchester Airport  said 'oh s***' when he saw an RAF Typhoon pull alongside the passenger plane in mid-air, fellow passengers have revealed. The 47-year-old suspect, from north-west England, allegedly passed a note to cabin crew saying there was a bomb on board the plane, sparking a full scale alert in which a fighter jet was scrambled from a nearby airbase. Passengers who sat near the man on the plane have now told how his mood quickly changed when he looked out of the window and saw the warplane flying just yards from the aircraft's wing. The man was led away from the Qatar Airways plane by armed police  after the flight landed yesterday and  he has now been sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Scroll down for video . The man who was arrested over an alleged bomb hoax on a Qatar Airways flight to Manchester yesterday has now been sectioned, police announced this morning . Worried passengers on the flight photographed the man being led away by police after the plane landed . A huge emergency operation was launched yesterday afternoon when the pilot of flight QR23 from Doha contacted authorities on the ground to tell them of fears a bomb had been smuggled on board the plane. It is claimed the suspect wrote a note to cabin crew as part of the alleged hoax, as fears of a terror attack spread among those on board. Fellow passengers told the Daily Mirror today that the man was initially quiet, but said 'oh s***' when the Typhoon appeared outside the window. The suspect, who was wearing a green t-shirt with silver lettering on it, was later pictured being hauled off the flight before being led, handcuffed, onto the tarmac. Police have now sectioned the man under the Mental Health Act so he can be assessed before they decide whether to charge him. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said: 'A man, 47, arrested following an incident at Manchester Airport has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act. 'Following his arrest he was assessed by medical staff and again by a mental health team. He was subsequently sectioned to allow for a fuller assessment and appropriate treatment.' After they were allowed to leave the aircraft yesterday, some of the 269 passengers who had been on board described the moment the fighter jet from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire pulled alongside their plane. An RAF Typhoon fighter jet was scrambled to intercept the flight after the passenger allegedly handed a note to cabin crew claiming there was a bomb on board . The full scale alert meant armed police surrounded the plane after it landed and a number of flights were diverted away from the airport . One of them was Josh Hartley, who said he spotted the RAF Typhoon outside the window of the passenger plane after they had circled several times. Mr Hartley told the BBC: 'We were coming in to land (and) about eight minutes, 10 minutes before we landed, a fighter jet came alongside. I looked out the window, then I just started shaking - (it was) a bit terrifying seeing a fighter jet outside the window.' He said passengers had not been given information about what was happening by the 13-strong crew of the Qatari plane, who even gave them the standard weather update before they touched down. Aurang Zeb, 60, who was returning from a holiday to his home in Bradford, said: 'I thought there was something wrong because there was a jet flying so near.' He said the plane landed and was taken to an area well away from the terminal and other planes, where they waited for 45 minutes, then moved again closer to the terminal. The Typhoon was dispatched from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire after the airline pilot radioed authorities on the ground to tell them of the perceived threat . The terrified passengers had to wait on the plane after the man was arrested and were later transferred to the terminal by bus . Passenger Aurang Zeb said those on the flight were left terrified by rumours there was a bomb on board . Mr Zeb added: 'Then I saw all the police with guns. Lots of police everywhere. Kids were crying, some people looked very worried because of rumours there's a bomb on the plane.' Mr Zeb told how two armed police then came on and removed the suspect passenger. He said: 'They sat him up and said 'Put your hands up'. He did not say anything. People were still worried something might be on board. 'There was a rumour of a bomb on the plane so people are scared. Thank God for that not happening.' Manju Geo, who was coming to the UK from India to visit family in Stoke, said: 'At least two police came on and took one man off called Mr Roy. We were told he was writing some notes on the flight and the air hostess found that.' Passengers on the plane and people on the ground photographed the Typhoon (above and below) as it roared alongside the airliner in the skies over Manchester . Manchester Airport said nine incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports, with five of these landing at Leeds Bradford Airport. One of the flights that landed on time at Manchester once the emergency was over was the plane carrying Manchester United back from Florida, where the team had played in a pre-season friendly tournament. Last night, GMP chief superintendent John O'Hare said: 'The incident arose when the pilot received information about a possible device on board the plane having been handed a note from a passenger. 'As a result a full emergency activation commenced that involved the aircraft being escorted in by the RAF before specialist officers boarded and subsequently made an arrest. 'A full search of the aircraft has now finished and nothing suspicious was found.'

"By . Richard Spillett . Rolf Harris's five-year, nine-month sentence, of which he will serve half, will remain unchanged after a decision by the Attorney General . Convicted paedophile Rolf Harris will not see his jail term increased after the Government's chief legal adviser decided not to mount an appeal. Despite a stream of complaints, Attorney General Jeremy Wright has decided not to refer the disgraced entertainer's sentence of five years and nine months to the Court of Appeal. Mr Wright's decision comes despite his office receiving 150 complaints about the leniency of Harris's sentence, of which the 84-year-old will serve half behind bars. Harris, a household name for decades, was finally unmasked as a prolific paedophile following his conviction for 12 indecent assaults at the end of last month. The court heard the Australian-born entertainer used his celebrity status to grope and abuse young women and girls over a 40-year period. Despite it only taking one complaint to trigger a review process, the Attorney General's Office (AGO) confirmed today that the prison term would not be challenged. An AGO spokesman said: 'The Attorney General understands that his decision not to refer the case may be a disappointment to some people; however, he did give extremely careful consideration to this sentence and he concluded that he could not refer it.' He added: 'After very careful consideration, the Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC MP, has decided not to refer the five-year and nine-month sentence given to Rolf Harris to the Court of Appeal, as he did not think they would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it. 'The sentencing judge was bound by the maximum sentence in force at the time of the offending. 'The judge made some of the sentences consecutive to reach the total sentence, but he could not simply add up sentences on individual counts; the overall sentence had to be just and proportionate to the overall offending. Scroll down for video . Despite receiving more than 150 complaints about Harris's sentence, new Attorney General Jeremy Wright (pictured, right) has decided the prison term is 'not unduly lenient' and will not go to the Court of Appeal . 'The judge was also required to take into account the age of the offender.' The decision came as theatre bosses in Plymouth, Devon decided to remove a self-portrait Harris painted on a dressing room wall. Harris created the mural, which shows him peeping over the branch of a tree, when he appeared in a family panto at the Theatre Royal in 1993. But the 21-year-old painting will now be covered over after Harris's conviction. A spokesman for the Theatre Royal said: 'The Rolf Harris mural in dressing room G4, which is currently protected by perspex, is now going to be covered in vinyl to obscure it.'

Good luck to all the Highgate 2014 leavers. And don't quit your day job.' Adam Pettitt, headmaster of £18,000-a-year Highgate, says the at-times violent film was made in a spirit of fun. He said: 'A leavers' film without controversy would be like fish and chips without the salt and vinegar, and the annual question is whether this joke or that joke is, in fact, in bad taste.' The £18,000-a-year school has defended itself against any accusations the video is in bad taste . Students scatter from the school's playground as the teacher emerges with a gun in the film . He denied claims that it referenced school massacres, added: 'I know that my leavers in 2014 would be genuinely upset if survivors of the tragic gun massacres in the US were affected by, or took offence at, this tongue-in-cheek scene. '[It is] modelled on an action film shoot-out where leavers, dressed as Men in Black, carry an injured and long-serving schoolmaster to the steps of the newly restored chapel where he mimes his last minutes. 'In vying with their peers in other schools for a fraction of a moment of notoriety, or in framing an affectionate portrait of their school, all leavers run a risk. 'On this occasion, I believe that the context makes it clear that this is not only tongue-in-cheek, and very British, but a reference to cinematic gun crime. 'The 2014 leavers have not, consciously or otherwise, overlooked the seminal importance to society - and young people - of getting to grips with violence of any kind, especially that violence which has led to the tragic loss of life in schools.' A spokesman for the school added: 'Highgate's Leavers would like to apologise to Simon Cowell. 'He was asked as a personal favour by a parent of one of the leavers for a video message for this and he kindly sent this in good faith. Simon hadn't seen the film as it was unfinished at the time.' The day-only school was established in the 16th century and past students include lawyer Michael Mansfield QC, commentator Murray Walker and cricketer Phil Tufnell .","Leavers at expensive London school produced hour-long epic film .

"By . Richard Spillett . A mother-of-four has told of her horror after she opened a jar of Doritos salsa dip and found a dead bug inside. Katrina Smith was just moments away from putting the insect in her mouth as she sat down to watch television on Sunday evening. The 33-year-old had dipped a crisp into the mild salsa dip and was about to take a bite when she spotted the creature. Mother of four Katrina Smith opened her Doritos dip and was shocked to find this large dead insect inside . Pictures taken by Ms Smith show the black bug - which is about 3cm long and looks like a cockroach - on its back in the middle of the jar next to a crisp. The mother-of-four originally bought the £1.14p dip in a Tesco store in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, on June 14 this year. She took the jar back to the shop on Monday and is now waiting for Doritos to receive the product so they can conduct a full investigation. Ms Smith says she was too disgusted to pick out the black bug - but believes it was either a cockroach or a beetle. Ms Smith, who is eight weeks pregnant, said: 'I realised it just before I put it in my mouth. I saw something black, it had legs, arms, little horns and a face - it was absolutely disgusting. 'I took it into the kitchen to have a look at it to see what it was and realised it was some kind of creature.' Ms Smith, who lives in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, said the incident had left her shaken made her wary of what she eats. She said: 'It used to be my absolute favourite flavour but I’m never buying it again. It was so disgusting, it’s made me think not just about the dip but every single piece of food I eat.' Ms Smith, who is struggling to eat during her pregnancy, says she will never buy the dip again . She added: 'It’s just the thought of having anything like that close to me again. The fact that I’m pregnant and I am struggling to eat as well doesn’t help. 'Everything that I buy, I open and look inside because I think I am going to find something.' A spokesman for Doritos confirmed they would be launching an investigation into the find. He said: 'The safety of our consumers is always our number one concern and we take issues like this very seriously. We are waiting to receive the product so that we can conduct a full investigation.' A Tesco spokesman added: 'We set ourselves high standards for the quality of the food we sell and were disappointed to hear of this incident. 'We have contacted the supplier so they can investigate and our Customer Service Team will update Mrs Smith with the findings.' The jar was bought from Tesco in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. The company say they have informed their suppliers .","Katrina Smith bought dip from her local Tesco to enjoy while watching TV .

"By . Richard Spillett . A new Home Office report says a rise in heroin use in the early 1990s could have been behind a huge spike in thefts and other crimes . A fall in the number of drug addicts using heroin and crack cocaine could have led to a 60 per cent drop in crime in the last 20 years, according to a new report. Home Office research claims an 'epidemic' in class A drug use in the late 1980s and early 1990s - made famous in the book and film Trainspotting - was a huge driver in the rise in acquisitive crime. But the new report suggests the current generation of young people have turned their backs on the drugs, leading to a large drop in crimes linked to the substances. Experts have previously disagreed over what has caused the recent fall in levels of thefts and burglaries. Some academics have suggested higher conviction rates are behind the drop, others say greater security technology could be the cause, while others even suggested reduced amounts of lead in petrol are making people less aggressive. The new government paper, written by researcher Nick Morgan, suggests levels of heroin and crack use are key to understanding the rise and fall. He states: 'The number of heroin users increased markedly through the 1980s and early 1990s and many also used crack as their drug-using career developed. 'This ""epidemic"" spread from area to area but the national peak probably occurred between 1993 and 2000. Crime peaked between 1993 and 1995.' He added: 'Evidence suggests that, for at least some users, heroin/crack was the catalyst for offending, and for others it probably accelerated and extended their criminal career.' Statistics reveal that 13 police forces saw the number of burglaries peak in 1992/1993, with a further 19 forces seeing the offence peak the following year. After rising by more than 70 per cent between 1989 and 1994, the offence has generally fallen in the years since. The study highlighted Merseyside and Edinburgh, where Irvine Welsh's book Trainspotting is set, as areas which appeared to show a correlation between the use of hard drugs and the rise in crime. Trainspotting was made into a film in 1996 and followed a group of heroin addicts in the late 1980s in Edinburgh and their life beyond. A scene from 1996 film Trainspotting, whose heroin-addicted characters had numerous brushes with the law . The report continues: 'The starkest example of regional variation was Merseyside, which had a recorded acquisitive crime peak five years before other police force areas. 'Evidence also suggests that Merseyside was one of the first areas to be hit by the heroin epidemic and the first to mount a concerted treatment response.' Mr Morgan suggests that tackling the use of the hard drugs could be seen as key to addressing crime problems in the future. He wrote: 'Evidence also suggests that, for volume-crime reduction, it is crucial to maintain a focus on heroin/crack, despite the higher prevalence of other illicit drugs like cannabis, powder cocaine and ecstasy, and the emergence of new psychoactive substances. 'Specifically, it remains important to identify the minority of heroin/crack users who commit large volumes of crime during addiction periods. 'If that can be done, and those periods of addiction and offending can be shortened or prevented, the potential for further reductions in crime remains significant.'","Heroin epidemic thought to have contributed to  rise in acquisitive crimes .

"By . Richard Spillett . Marks and Spencer have abandoned plans to sell red grouse meat in many of their stores following a row over how the birds are hunted. The High Street chain had planned to sell the game in shops around the country after it was successfully trialled in two stores in west London. But the company have postponed the plans after ornithologists threatened to boycott the store over fears rare birds of prey were being killed to protect the grouse ahead of hunting. Plans to sell red grouse meat in Marks and Spencer have been postponed due to the fears of conservationists . The chain is bringing in a code of conduct for suppliers before selling the game in a bid to allay concerns . M&S became the first retailer to stock whole wild red grouse when it announced the game would go on sale for £10 in its flagship Kensington High Street and Marble Arch stores last August. At the time, M&S's Tom Harvey said: 'Our customers are telling us they are keen to try more game as an alternative to traditional everyday meats.' The birds, which have a distinctive rich flavour, were shot on the moors in Yorkshire and Northumberland and transported to stores in time for the following morning. But the move has since been criticised by conservationists, who fear rare birds of prey like the hen harrier were being killed to protect birds for shooting. Former RSPB conservation director Mark Avery has written to the company urging it to stop selling the meat. The RSPB has said it believes hen harriers are being killed or driven off moorland by game keepers . Mr Avery wrote on his blog: 'The rare and threatened hen harrier hardly exists on British grouse moors these days because of illegal persecution by game-shooting interests. Other protected wildlife is also killed by grouse shooting interests.' The Times reported today that M&S has now decided not to sell the meat until a code of conduct can be enforced with all of its suppliers. The store's Head of Agriculture told the paper 15 estates in North Yorkshire and the Scottish borders had agreed to comply with the new code and would supply the game once it had been independently verified that they are sticking to the rules. The decision was welcomed by the RSPB, who likened it to the responsible sourcing of many other products the stores sell.","Meat was planned for stores after customers in London snapped it up .

"By . Richard Spillett . An Indian schoolboy has become a limbo legend - by roller-skating under 39 cars in a row. It took six-year-old Gagan Satish just 29 seconds to cover a distance of nearly 230 feet with his face just five inches from the ground. The skater, from Bangalore, India, is now vowing to take on the world after becoming a celebrity in his home city and inspiring others to take up the bizarre sport. Scroll down for video . Gagan Satish's incredible flexibility allows him to skate under cars by doing the splits while moving . He set himself the challenge of going under increasing numbers of vehicles as he mastered the skill . He has now broken the world record for the furthest distance skated in limbo by emerging from under 39 cars . His astonishing feat is yet to be recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records, but is in the Indian version . He said: 'I love skating. I have been doing it since I was three years old. My next goal is to skate underneath 100 cars. I also want to go to the Olympics.' Gagan, who unwrapped his first pair of rollerskates on his third birthday, was initially rejected by his local club for being too young. But his mother Hema Satish, 28, was determined he would be taken on. 'We could see that his body was very flexible,' she said. 'After that we decided to send him for proper coaching. 'We always knew he would do well. Hopefully this is just the beginning of his sporting career.' The housewife said her son had been injured many times but always got up again to continue. She added: 'While practicing and training, he has been hurt many times. But he never backs out. His parents Rajanna and Hema say they are very proud of his skill, which has netted him scores of medals . They say he goes out into the streets of Bangalore, India and practices as soon as he gets home from school . Despite having a number of crashes, they say he always gets straight back up and is always keen to improve . She said: 'During a limbo skating session a few months ago, he even had cuts on face because he was too close to the ground. 'He was bleeding also. But he still continued and stopped skating only after the session ended.' His father Rajanna Satish, who runs a washing machine repair centre, said he was nervous throughout his son's record attempt, which was filmed by a local camera crew, but overjoyed he had succeeded. 'We are really lucky to have a son like Gagan,' the 30-year-old added. 'He has been blessed by God. And we thank God for giving him such grace and talent.' Gagan's record-breaking stunt has been recognised by the India Book of Records as the 'Farthest Distance In Limbo Skating Under Cars' - but the feat has yet to be ratified by the Guinness Book of World Records. In achieving his goal, Gagan shattered the previous record of 157 feet set two years ago by Shreeya Deshpande, then five, in Kolhapur, India. His amazing talents have seen him become something of a celebrity in his home city, where he has been filmed . Locals know him for his love of skating and have supported his latest world record attempt . The six-year-old said: 'My next goal is to skate underneath 100 cars. I also want to go to the Olympics' Gagan follows a rigorous routine and never gives his training classes a miss. 'He gets up at 5am. Then we take him for coaching classes. He practices there for a few hours. After that he goes to school,' said his father . 'In the evenings also, after coming back from school, he starts skating out in the street.' They spend two hours each day on speed-training and muscle flexibility to help Gagan pick up as much speed as possible before he ducks into the limbo position. It was the culmination of three months specialist training with his coach Yatish Gowda. Mr Gowda, who says he has believed in Gagan from the start, said: 'He has been working very hard for this for a long time. This is a great achievement and we are all very proud.'","Gagan Satish has taught himself how to limbo while rollerskating .

"By . Kate Lyons . and Richard Spillett . and Louise Eccles . Usain Bolt came under fire from Scots today after he reportedly claimed the Commonwealth Games are 'a bit s***' and the Olympics 'were better'. The world's fastest man arrived in Scotland on Saturday and was expected to compete in the 4x100m relay for Jamaica this weekend. But Scottish fans are predicting the 100m sprint champion will get a frosty reception if he appears before the crowd in Glasgow after a report of his off-hand comments emerged. Bolt and his manager today denied he had criticised the Games, with the sprinter branding the report 'nonsense'. Scroll down for video . Usain Bolt watched the women's netball today after allegedly claiming the Commonwealth Games were 's***' The sprinter has since denied making the comments, calling the reports 'nonsense' on Twitter . The Times claimed this morning that Bolt was waiting for his car when he said the Games were 'a bit s***' and the Olympics 'were better'. The paper said that the world-famous runner was outside the athletes' village in Glasgow last night when he uttered the judgment. Bolt had spent the afternoon with Prince William, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge, chatting and posing for photographs. There . was a backlash against the star on Twitter this morning, with some . predicting a tough reception for the sprinter when he competes on Saturday. Others said the comments would be a blow to those who . had worked hard to organise the event. Shona . Robison, the Scottish National Party's cabinet member for the Games, . told the BBC: 'We need to establish if Usain Bolt has said this and what . he has said. 'The feedback from the athletes - I was in the village the other day - they are having a great time. They have really praised the facilities.' Scots turned on the star this morning, with GP Gregor Smith (above) and Glaswegian Bella Flowers (below) saying the comments would be a slap in the face for those who hope the Games will get children into sport . Others made light of the comments, predicting Bolt may experience a backlash from the home crowd when he comes out to compete in the 4x100m relay on Saturday night . Ms Robison added: 'The spectators, they are just having a . ball, cheering everybody on. It's a great atmosphere. Glasgow is . fantastic and the Games have been amazing on so many fronts - so . well-organised and a great experience for everyone involved.' Bolt later denied he made the comments, tweeting this morning: 'I'm waking up to this nonsense... journalist please don't create lies to make headlines.' The denial was retweeted 1,600 times within two hours of posting it. His manager, Ricky Simms, has also claimed the reports are 'utter rubbish', adding: 'The atmosphere in and around the stadiums has been absolutely fantastic.' Bolt then brushed off questions about whether he made the comments as he watched Jamaica's netball team play New Zealand this afternoon. The six-time Olympic champion arrived at the netball during the second quarter of the match. He was quickly spotted by the fans in the crowd, who clamoured to take photographs of him on their mobile phones. Bolt was handed a Jamaican flag, which he dutifully waved, clapping enthusiastically whenever his team scored. Bolt refused to answer questions from the media about his alleged comments as he watched netball today . The sprinter had vowed to watch 'the Reggae girls' Jamaica netball team if he had time while in Glasgow . Bolt took to Twitter to deny he made the comments this morning, branding the reports 'nonsense' During the match, he tweeted: 'Team Jamaica all day everyday day #Netball #JamvsNZL #Glasgow2014 #CWG2014', along with photographs of the game. During half-time Bolt, who wore khaki trousers, a black hooded top and sunglasses, which were backwards and upside down on his head, signed autographs and posed for photographs with officials and athletes in the VIP area. It seemed his alleged comments about the Games had not diminished his star status among the fans. Jamaican Molly Rhone, president of the International Netball Federation, also gave Bolt a hug and stroked his head and face during half-time, seemingly grateful for the star appearance. When journalists tried to approach Bolt for comment, his manager shouted for security, who escorted them from the VIP area. It was muted this afternoon that Bolt may not compete in the Games at all because the Scottish weather is too cold. Former champion sprinter Darren Campbell told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'We've watched the Jamaican athletes win medals and not do a lap of honour because it's so cold. I'm not saying he's not going to run but it wouldn't surprise me if he didn't.' Bolt allegedly made the comments after meeting Prince William and wife Kate at the athletes' village yesterday . Bolt had been given a tour of the facilities by cycling champ Sir Chris Hoy (left) and met Prince Harry (right) This . is the first Commonwealth Games for Bolt, who said a hamstring injury . prevented him from attending the Melbourne Games in 2006 and bad timing . prevented him going to Delhi in 2010. 'I've always wanted to compete in a Commonwealth Games,' he said over the weekend. Bolt, who . won the men's 100m sprint at the London Olympics in 2012, is due to run . in the 4x100m relay in Scotland's famous Hampden Park stadium starting . on Saturday evening. Bolt did not compete in the 100m sprint, because an injury earlier in the season prevented him from attending trials. The event was won by Jamaican Kemar Bailey-Cole with a time of 10 seconds flat. If Bailey-Cole had run the same time at the final of the event at the 2012 Olympics he would have finished eighth. A . spokesman for the Commonwealth Games Federation initially said the . Jamaican 100m champion 'must just be having an off day', but this morning said organisers were 'pleased' with Bolt's response. Chief executive Mike Hooper told this morning's Games briefing: 'We take Mr Bolt at his word. We're very pleased with how he's responded and that's our position.' Do you think Usain Bolt is right about the Commonwealth Games? Bolt's first press conference in Britain went off the rails at the weekend, with reporters asking him his opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the upcoming Scottish referendum. The Jamaican six-time Olympic champion threw his hands in the air in confusion as he was inundated with questions. Rumours of wider disquiet among Jamaican athletes grew this morning when fellow sprinter Jason Livermore appeared to suggest he was not enjoying the games. Livermore was asked if he thought teammate Bolt was having a good time and replied: 'I hope so, better than me.' Asked what he meant, Livermore back-tracked, saying: 'It's been lovely so far, the people in Scotland are very welcoming, I can't complain. Nice atmosphere, nice crowd, I'm enjoying myself.' Asked how he was coping with the food in the village, Livermore said: 'Ooof, sometimes.' Pressed for more details, he said: 'I can say, I won't say.' Bolt won gold for the 100m sprint at the London Olympics, but did not compete in the event at the Commonwealth Games because an injury stopped him from attending trials . Bolt's teammate Jason Livermore also appeared to suggest he wasn't enjoying himself in an interview today . Livermore . looked to be feeling the cold ahead of his 200m heat on Wednesday . morning and said: 'It's very cold here, I need to put on some clothes, . I'm freezing.' Bookies have now slashed the odds on Bolt pulling out of the games completely in protest at the row. Ladbrokes . now have him at 5/1 to withdraw, with the firm's Alex Donohue saying: . 'Bolt moved quickly to quash the rumours on Twitter but we think there's . no smoke without fire and we can't rule out a late withdrawal.' Another . busy day is planned at the games today, with former Strictly Come . Dancing contestant Louis Smith competing in the artistic gymnastics . individual all-round final this afternoon. Fans . will then pack into Hampden Park tonight to watch a track and field . line-up that includes Olympic long-jump champion Greg Rutherford. Kenya's .

"By . Richard Spillett . Pounds to Pocket sent people emails ahead of their birthdays offering to loan them money to fund their celebrations . An email advert from payday lender Pounds to Pocket has been banned for encouraging customers to use a short-term loan to fund their birthday celebrations. The email arrived with a subject line reading 'Happy Birthday from Pounds to Pocket' and went on to say: 'We’d like to wish you the best on your special day! Now you can apply for the money you need to enjoy your birthday worry-free.' The Citizens Advice charity complained that the ad promoted a casual 'worry-free' attitude to taking out a short-term loan and irresponsibly encouraged consumers to use the money to fund birthday parties. CashEuroNetUK, trading as Pounds to Pocket, acknowledged that taking out a short-term loan was a matter for serious consideration but said it went to 'great lengths' to ensure ads were not targeted at 'inappropriate' individuals, such as children. It said the point of the birthday promotion was to show customers that their business was valued. But after an investigation by watchdog the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) the lender said it would remove the email from circulation. The AQA noted that a 20% discount was offered on a first scheduled payment for those who applied on the day the email was received, and the funds would be sent within 10 minutes if approved. Ruling that the ad must not appear again in its current form, the ASA said: 'While possibly desirable, having money to spend on birthday celebrations was unlikely to be seen as essential, and by encouraging recipients to take advantage of the service through a special offer discount for immediate application, Pounds to Pocket had urged a decision, thereby limiting the amount of time those interested in a loan were able to give to proper consideration. Gillian Guy of the Citizens Advice Bureau said it was irresponsible for the firm to market loans as 'worry-free' 'We concluded that the email was irresponsible because it encouraged taking a short-term loan for frivolous spending and promoted the process of borrowing as trivial and without responsibility.' Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: 'Payday loans can add to financial worries, not take them away. It is irresponsible for any lender to promote a casual attitude to borrowing by suggesting using loans are worry-free and can be used to fund celebrations. 'Citizens Advice helps thousands of people each year who have been landed in debt because lenders failed to carry out checks to assess whether people can afford to repay. 'The ASA’s decision to ban this advert sends a strong message to other payday lenders that this type of marketing is irresponsible and not appropriate.' Campaigners hope the Advertising Standards Authority ruling will curb marketing by payday lenders .","Pounds to Pocket sent emails offering people loans for celebrations .

"By . Richard Spillett . French men may be famous for their language of love, Gallic charm and effortless sense of fashion but British men are now more appealing to women, according to a new survey. A survey of more than 50,000 Europeans found British gentleman are now seen as the third most attractive nationality, ahead of the French in fourth. The results will come as a shock to men in France, who have long seen themselves as the best lovers on the continent. British men, like actor Daniel Craig (left), are now seen as more desirable than Frenchmen, like former footballer Eric Cantona (right), according to a poll of 50,000 Europeans . Women in both France and Belgium ranked British men as the most desirable in Europe. Pollsters at GoEuro, the online travel planner which organised the survey, say the change in fortunes could be down to English now being the most widely-spoken language. Spanish women, such as actress Penelope Cruz, are considered the most attractive by British men, while British women would prefer to have an Italian lover, like former footballer Fabio Cannavaro. Gallic men were the third choice of British women, behind Spanish lotharios in second. The poll of 53,406 European men and women aged 18 to 35 examined the dream nationalities for a holiday romance among citizens of France, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Britain. In the survey, men and women users of social app Lovoo were presented with six major European countries and asked to select their preference in terms of a partner for a romantic date. British men found Spanish women, like Penelope Cruz (left) most attractive, while British women who took part in the survey voted Italians, like ex-footballer Fabio Cannavaro (right), most desirable . Spanish women were the top choice of men in Britain, Germany, Portugal, France and Italy. The poll also revealed that European women most wanted to date Italian men, who were the first choice of women in Britain, Spain and Portugal. Robert Wilfert, creative director at GoEuro, said: 'It is reassuring that, in modern Europe, liking people from other nations bypasses politics and history. 'The thing that has brought us together is travel and learning to appreciate both our cultural quirks and what we also all have in common.' Benjamin Bak, chief executive and co-founder of Lovoo, added: 'It is obvious that Europeans like to flirt with other Europeans from all different nationalities, this is especially true during the summer months when many people use our app to meet people while travelling and on holiday.' 1.

"By . Richard Spillett . The eating habits of some of the world's most powerful people have been revealed at a meeting of top chefs in London. The Club des Chefs, which is made up of those who cook for heads of state and political leaders, met in the capital for its annual get-together this week. They revealed that the Queen does not eat shellfish, Prince Philip likes a lager with his lunch and Barack Obama cannot stand beetroot. Scroll down for video . The Queen is said to have told the kitchen of one head of state that she doesn't eat shellfish. Meanwhile, Prince Philip is said to enjoy a daily beer with his lunch . The Queen speaking at a state banquet for Barack Obama, who is said to dislike the taste of beetroot . Meanwhile, French President Francois Hollande hates artichokes, his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy doesn't like cheese and Russian premier Vladimir Putin has his food tasted by a member of staff to ensure it is not poisoned. Rosaleen McBride, who cooks for Irish presidents, revealed the Queen's aversion to shellfish after speaking to Her Majesty's head chef, Mark Flanagan. The Times reported Mr Flanagan would not say whether his employer disliked the taste of the seafood or whether her dietary requirements were due to health fears. Ms McBride also told the paper that her staff bought lager for Prince Philip after hearing that he has been drinking beer at lunchtime for decades. A former royal chef has previously claimed the Queen dislikes potatoes, starts the day with Kellogg's Special K and enjoys a gin and Dubonnet nightcap. Despite the claims she does not eat shellfish, staff at Buckingham Palace served crayfish as a starter when President Obama visited the UK in 2011, although beetroot remained off the menu. The Queen at a state banquet with French President Francois Hollande, who is said to dislike artichokes . The secrets emerged when the Club des Chefs, made up of those who cook for heads of state, met in London . The 21-member Club des Chefs gathered at London's Hakkasan Michelin-starred restaurant on a Sunday evening. Among them was Barack Obama’s personal chef, Cristeta Comerford, Tim Wasylko, chef for the Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper, and French President Francois Hollande's cook Bernard Vaussion. Hilton Little, the chef to the president of the South Africa, who also served the late president Nelson Mandela, revealed Mandela loved homemade stews and once impressed a guest by serving bangers and mash. Amid growing global anger at his boss's regime, President Putin's chef did not attend the event. It is believed the chefs refuse to tell each other their employer's favourite meals, due to fears leaders will be served the same meal everywhere they go. The group reportedly tried traditional fish and chips while they were in Britain and even attempted to make pork pies.

"By . Richard Spillett . Karl Albrecht, co-founder of the Aldi supermarket empire and one of the world's richest men, has died aged 94 . Karl Albrecht, co-founder of the Aldi grocery store empire and one of the world's richest people, has died  at the age of 94. He was buried on Monday in a family plot in a small ceremony in the western German city of Essen, where he lived. Albrecht and his brother Theo built up the business from nothing after returning home from the war and selling bread and milk cheaply from the family's small shop. Aldi spokeswoman Kirsten Gess said in a statement: 'He created a corporate culture of mutual respect, he trusted his employees and their talents, and he gave them a chance to use them. Our sympathies are with his family.' Albrecht and his brother, who died in 2010, shunned publicity throughout their lives, and when Forbes featured them in 1992 as two of the world's richest men, it had to use silhouettes to illustrate the article because no pictures of them had been published for years. Albrecht was ranked No. 24 on this year's Forbes list of the world's richest people with an estimated net worth of £15 billion. Both brothers worked in their parents' grocery store as they were growing up. After both serving as German soldiers in the Second World War, the brothers took over the business and began a rapid expansion. By early 1960 they were operating some 300 stores. After splitting the company into two, the brothers in 1962 rebranded the group Aldi — a contraction of 'Albrecht Discount' — with Karl Albrecht leading Aldi South, and Theo Albrecht taking Aldi North. They still worked together, using their combined bargaining power to negotiate lower purchasing prices. Their motto was 'concentrating on the basics: a limited selection of goods for daily needs' and their formula sold well. He once said: 'What you want to achieve is that the customer believes there is nowhere cheaper to shop.' Today the group has around 10,000 stores in 17 countries in Europe, North America and Australia, and a family trust established by Theo Albrecht in 1979 bought the U.S. specialty grocery chain Trader Joe's. It made £29billion in 2013. Karl Albrecht is survived by a son, Karl Junior, and a daughter, Beate. His wife of 67 years, Mia, died in 2013. The  chain has taken the world by storm and now has 10,000 stores around the globe with 500 in the UK .","Karl Albrecht and his brother Theo lived in poverty in their youth .

"By . Richard Spillett . Britain is continuing to export millions of pounds worth of  military equipment to Russia despite concerns Moscow is arming separatist rebels in Ukraine, MPs have warned. The Commons Committees on Arms Export Controls (CAEC) have revealed that 251 export licences for the sale to Russia of controlled goods worth at least £132million remain in place. Among the licences which remain valid are permits covering sniper rifles, night sights, small arms ammunition, gun mountings, body armour, military communications equipment and 'equipment employing cryptography'. Despite a promise in March by the then foreign secretary William Hague to stop military sales to Russia which could be used against Ukraine, the committees said that just 31 licences had been revoked. Britain is still selling more than £100million worth of military equipment to Russia despite calls for sanctions. Among the items that are still being sent to the country are sniper rifles,  ammunition and body armour . The disclosure comes after Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday strongly criticised European countries such as France which continue to pursue defence sales to Russia despite Moscow’s backing for the separatists. CAEC chairman Sir John Stanley said that the relatively small number of licences which had been withdrawn exposed the weakness of Mr Hague’s original promise, which referred only to equipment which could be deployed against Ukraine and did not cover Russia’s wider defence requirements. While he said that Britain had been in the vanguard of European countries in taking action to curb defence sales to Russia, it had still not gone far enough. 'Russia is an authoritarian regime. We should have been applying a more cautious approach for some time in regard to Russia,' he said. David Cameron (left) has criticised other countries for selling arms to Russia amid calls for tougher sanctions on the regime of Vladimir Putin (right) Sir John has now written to new Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond asking if he will be suspending or revoking the remaining licences. The CAEC also strongly criticised the award of licences for the export of chemicals which could be used in the manufacture of chemical weapons to Syria. It said the award by the previous Labour government of five licences for the export of sodium fluoride had been 'highly questionable', while the decision of the current Government to issue a further two licences for sodium and potassium fluoride after the civil war had begun was irresponsible. It said that the current Government’s claim that it had no grounds to refuse the licences was 'grossly inaccurate'. The CAEC - which is made up of the Commons Foreign Affairs, Defence, International Development and Business, Innovation and Skills committees - also expressed concern that the Government had watered down its policy on the export of equipment to countries where there were concerns that it could be used for internal repression. It is feared Russia is arming pro-Kremlin rebels in eastern Ukraine (pictured), who are widely believed to be behind the shooting down of Malaysian Airways flight MH17 last week . It said that a 'broad' test that an export licence should not be issued if there was 'concern' the equipment could be used for internal repression had been dropped from the latest set of Government guidelines issued earlier this year. Only the 'narrow' test that there had to be a 'clear risk' of repression remained. In evidence to the CAEC, Business Secretary Vince Cable insisted the policy had not changed, however the committee said that he had been 'directly contradicted' by the Labour former foreign minister Peter Hain who was responsible for issuing the previous set of guidelines in 2000. 'We consider there has been a significant change of policy. We don’t accept that there has been no change of policy,' Sir John said. A UK Government spokesperson said: 'This Government has not approved any licences for the export of rifles or ammunition to the Russian military. 'Export licences for rifles and ammunitions cover hunting and sporting rifles supplied to private individuals and to authorised dealers for resale. 'We do not believe that there is a credible risk that these weapons will be diverted for use by the Russian military.'","Ministers promised to halt flow of arms from UK to Russia in March this year .

"By . Julian Robinson . A trainee nurse has been awarded over £75,000 compensation after a prick on her finger at work transformed her into a cleaning obsessive. Alcinda Tobbal could not kiss or make love to her husband for fear of 'contamination' after being jabbed with a dirty needle whilst working as a nurse assistant at Whipps Cross Hospital in east London. The 45-year-old developed a 'severe' obsessive compulsive disorder focused on cleanliness after the incident in February 2008, a court heard. Alcinda Tobbal, pictured, developed a 'severe' obsessive compulsive disorder focused on cleanliness, after being accidentally jabbed with a dirty needle whilst working at Whipps Cross Hospital, east London . She was dismissed from her job due to the effects of the extreme OCD condition, which saw her wearing gloves even in baking hot weather and scrubbing her children’s shoes with bleach whenever they had been outside. But the most damaging aspect of her condition was that she became incapable of having intimate relations with, or even kissing, her bus driver husband, leading to the disintegration of their marriage, after he dubbed her 'mental'. Now she has been awarded damages by a judge, including more than £20,000 for her ‘pain and suffering’, which takes into account the fact that her marriage broke down due to her condition. Judge Edward Bailey, sitting at Central London County Court, said that the mother-of-five was employed as a nursing assistant and was working towards becoming a fully qualified nurse by studying at night school. But her career was destroyed when she was accidentally stabbed in the finger by a dirty needle sticking out of an 'over full' sharps bin in an operating theatre. Despite being given the all-clear after blood tests to rule out hepatitis and HIV infection, Mrs Tobbal’s distress and anxiety about what had happened to her continued to increase, with her 'main anxieties revolving around her HIV status', the judge said. Her symptoms snowballed until 'a diagnosis of OCD at the severe end of the scale...making it impossible for her to return to work and having a significant impact on her life, most seriously on the breakdown of her marriage,' the judge added. Alcinda Tobbal was working as a trainee nurse at Whipps Cross Hospital, pictured, in east London when the accident happened . Whipps Cross NHS Trust admitted primary liability for the accident and its alarming consequences for Mrs Tobbal, but hotly disputed the extent of Mrs Tobbal’s difficulties and the amount of compensation she deserved. Judge Bailey ruled that Mrs Tobbal ought to be compensated for her inability to work for the past five years. He told the court: 'I am quite satisfied that her continued absence from work after her accident was as a result of the injury she received and her - albeit excessive - psychological reaction to it.' He added that Mrs Tobbal 'developed a habit of compulsive cleaning' after the injury despite having blood tests for hepatitis B and C and HIV which came back negative two weeks after the accident. 'The average person, armed with normal fortitude, would have been able to get on with his or her life, no doubt making a firm mental note to be more careful of the sharps bin. Alcinda Tobbal became incapable of having intimate relations with, or even kissing, her bus driver husband, leading to the disintegration of their marriage, the court heard . 'Unfortunately, Mrs Tobbal was unable to get on in this way. She suffered from what can only be described as an eggshell psychology,' he added. Describing her condition, the judge went on: 'She feels the need to clean and re-clean crockery, cutlery and her house generally. 'She began to wear gloves in everyday activities because she was concerned she might contaminate her family. 'She felt unable to go out, avoiding leaving the home and endeavouring for some time to prevent her children from going out, except for school. 'When they returned from school, she washed their outside school clothing every day and ensured their shoes were scrubbed with bleach. 'She felt unable to have any physical intimacy with her husband for fear she would contaminate him. This led, after an initial period of support, to the breakup of their relationship. 'Even a kiss left her in fear of contamination and resulted in her need to wash. 'Of course, there is more to marriage than physical intimacy - Mrs Tobbal describes a good working friendly relationship with her husband whilst they brought up their children. 'But their emotional as well as their physical relationship has now broken down. 'While there was initial support from her husband, he now describes her as mental.' Judge Bailey awarded her damages for five years of pain, suffering and loss of earnings, including more than £20,000 'for the disruption to her work, her life and her marriage', caused by her 'fear of contamination.' However he declined to give her an award for future losses, saying Mrs Tobbal now has hopes for a brighter future, after her five years of hell. The judge said that recent psychology reports had concluded that 'her prognosis for a return to her pre-accident state was good' if she undertook appropriate counseling. Tara Vindis, for Mrs Tobbal, said of her client: 'She only has one friend as a result of her OCD. 'Her boundaries have shrunk and she lives a very insular life, focused on keeping her house very, very clean.' Mrs Tobbal declined to comment after the hearing.","Alcinda Tobbal became cleaning obsessive after pricking finger at work .

The hooded thief had targeted the social club and Mrs Carey spotted him rifling through her handbag . Yvonne with a mop like the one she chased the burglar with after he made off with her Florida holiday cash . Mrs Carey said: 'I just saw him going through my bag so I shouted at him. I had the mop and bucket in my hand and he started to run away so I chased after him. 'I was desperate to catch him so I kept screaming and yelling at him to stop. Sadly he was too quick. 'Maybe if I'd have chucked the mop and bucket away I'd have caught up with him. 'I didn't think about it at the time but he could have had a weapon like a gun or a knife on him - but I was just desperate to catch him.' Her friend, Dee Grey, was at the club organising a weight watchers class and chased the thief down a pathway but he managed to flee the scene. Mrs Carey revealed she had been saving up for a family holiday in Florida for seven years and planned to use the cash to buy dollars.

"By . Julian Robinson . A 45-storey slum which featured in the hit U.S. television series Homeland is being cleared by soldiers – after becoming notorious around the world. Thought to be the world’s tallest slum, the ‘Tower of David’ skyscraper has been home to thousands of Venezuelans in the capital city of Caracas over the years. But soldiers and officials have started a mass-eviction of the half-built tower, which once appeared in the third series of Homeland, starring Damian Lewis and Claire Danes. Scroll down for video . The giant Tower of David has been home to thousands of Venezuelans over the years, but politicians say it is unsafe . The 'vertical slum', pictured, was abandoned in 1994 and later home to thousands of squatters . Hundreds of families are being evicted from the Tower of David, pictured, in Caracas, Venezuela . The tower was depicted in Homeland as a lawless place where thugs participated in international conspiracies and killed with impunity. Pictured is a scene from series three episode three of the show . The building has become notorious for drugs and crime while politicians say it has become unsafe with children having fallen to their death. During the week, hundreds of families will be ‘peacefully’ moved out of the building, which was originally intended to be a bank centre. It was abandoned in 1994 and later became home to thousands of squatters. Residents are going to new homes in the town of Cua, south of Caracas, under the state's Great Housing Mission project - a flagship policy of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. Nicknamed after its developer, the financier and horse-breeder David Brillembourg, the Tower of David was viewed by many Caracas residents as a focus for crime gangs and a symbol of property ‘invasions’ encouraged in the Chavez era. Residents, though, said the building became a refuge from the city's crime-ridden 'barrios' and had turned into something of a model commune. An initial 160 families, out of a total of more than 1,150, are being moved out of the tower this week . Politicians say the half-built skyscraper has become unsafe and that children have fallen to their deaths . People wait inside the Tower of David, ahead of being evicted to Government-provided apartments . But politicians say people had fallen off dangerous ledges while there are no elevators and only makeshift power and water services. Caracas police did not share the view of a model community, raiding several times to look for kidnap victims. The vistas, however, matched those of the city's finest high-rise buildings. President . Nicolas Maduro's government has not yet said what it will do with the . tower, but one local newspaper reported Chinese banks were buying it to . restore to its original purpose. The Tower of David appeared a number of times in the third series of the hit U.S. television show, Homeland. The building is depicted as a lawless place where thugs participated in international conspiracies and killed with impunity . Episode three of the third series is even named 'Tower of David' and follows the fortunes of Brody (played by Damian Lewis) after he is taken to the building suffering from two bullet wounds in the abdomen. Brody (left), played by Damien Lewis,  in Tower of David, the third episode of the third series of Homeland . He is held in the squat by a gang of mercenaries led by a man who is aware of Brody's true identity. After being nursed back to health, he escapes the skyscraper and seeks refuge in a mosque, only for him to be arrested following a tip off to the police by the imam. However, the mercenaries find Brody and, after killing the police officers, the imam and his wife, take him back to the tower where he is confined to a cell. As the episode ends, Brody - alone in his cell - injects himself with heroin. ‘The tower does not meet the minimum conditions for safe, dignified living,’ Ernesto Villegas, minister for the transformation of Caracas, told reporters at the scene, declining to speculate on its future. Mr Villegas said the eviction was necessary because the tower, which lacked basic fixtures such as walls or windows, was unsafe. Children have fallen to their deaths, he added. And the damp, foul-smelling concrete courtyard where he spoke to reporters was evidence of the lack of plumbing. An initial 160 families, out of a total of more than 1,150, were being moved out this week, he added. Dozens . of residents boarded buses Tuesday morning to move to new, . government-provided apartments in Cua, a town about 23 miles (37 . kilometers) south of Caracas. The Minister of State for the Urban Transformation of Greater Caracas, Ernesto Villegas, said many windows were missing from the 45-storey building . People have already started voluntarily moving out of the skyscraper after being promised new accommodation . The building was home to thousands over the years and many complaining about having to leave . The tower has long attracted international interest: an exhibition about it won a prize at the 2012 Venice Architecture Biennale. Politically, the tower was a stronghold of ‘Chavismo,’ even though opponents saw it as an indictment of the failures of his government to provide adequate housing for the poor. It was depicted in Homeland as a lawless place where thugs participated in international conspiracies and killed with impunity.","The huge 45-storey slum is being evicted in Venezuelan capital Caracas .

"By . Sarah Dean . and Richard Spillett . The parents of a teenage swimming sensation have spoken of their pride after their daughter - who struggled to walk at the age of four - won a Commonwealth Games bronze medal. Erraid Davies, 13, started swimming after developing a rare hip condition called Perthes' disease when she was three which prevented her playing most sports. The youngster's determination has now made her a national hero after she became the youngest ever competitor from any country to win a Commonwealth Games medal. What a star: Scotland's Erraid Davies, 13, holds her bronze medal on the podium after the 100m breaststroke SB9 final. Already the youngest athlete ever to represent Scotland, Erraid became the youngest competitor from any nation to win a Commonwealth Games medal . Glorious moment: Davies smiles as she realised she's won the bronze medal at the end of the 100m race at the Tollcross Swimming Centre . One-two-three: Davies (right) shows off her bronze medal along with winner Sophie Pascoe of New Zealand (centre) and silver medallist Madeleine Scott of Australia (left) The Shetland's schoolgirl produced a storming comeback to take bronze in her 100m breaststroke race in front of a rapturous home crowd. Her father David, 69, told the BBC: 'When she was four she could hardly walk. So the pool was the only thing that kept her fit. 'She swam her first mile before she was six. She's been swimming ever since and she's just got better and better.' He added: 'She got into swimming because she developed a hip condition called Perthes' disease when she was three, and was told she was not to do any weight bearing exercises and that the best thing for her was to swim. 'We had just moved to Shetland and she couldn't swim, but she was soon taught and she has virtually never been out of the pool since. 'She trains in a 16 and 2/3 metre pool with three lanes nine times a week and once a week in a 25 metre pool.' Already her country's youngest ever team member at a Commonwealth Games, she finished strongly just behind Australian silver medallist Madeleine Scott in one minute and 21.38 seconds, with New Zealand's Sophie Pascoe taking gold. Davies kept the fact she was spending her summer holidays in Glasgow a secret from her school friends, but suspects they will have found out about it now. Well done: Gold medallist Sophie Pascoe hugs Davies on the podium after the medals are handed out . Davies, who took up swimming after developing a hip conditon aged three, beams as her medal is presented . She said: 'They didn't know before I came here. I didn't really know how to tell them. I got a medal and I am so happy. I am feeling really, really happy.' Asked if she had a big celebration after her win, the shy youngster said: 'Not particularly, I had my first Irn Bru of the games.' Father David thinks the huge support from the home fans spurred his daughter on to win her medal. He added: 'She's just got a great big grin on her face all the time now. She's very pleased with herself and very happy, as she should be. It's been an amazing day. She's just amazing.' 'Unfortunately we weren't in the best position to see her in the race in the morning so we could only see her on the video screen, but I just couldn't believe how fast she was going. I've never seen her swim as fast as that. 'This evening we were in a much better position at the finish line, and it was just absolutely amazing to hear the noise. 'When she was coming out the noise was just tremendous and it just built up, and I don't think it could have been any more amazing if she won the gold.' It was a first medal for the teenager and she made history by becoming the youngest ever medallist at a Commonwealth Games . Erraid didn't tell her friends at school she would be competing, saying: 'I didn't know how to tell them' Lorraine Gifford, Davies's coach at her swimming club, Delting Dolphins, was ecstatic to watch the race she feels will launch a push for a place at the Olympics in two years' time. Ms Gifford said: 'I was screaming at the telly. I'm known for being pretty loud but I'm sure she could hear me. Perthes' disease is a condition in which the top of the thigh bone and the hip soften, affecting the hip joint. It affects an estimated one in 9,000 children and experts are still unsure what causes it. Children with the condition experience pain during certain types of physical activity and can develop a limp. Others can suffer from arthritis in later life. Some children recover without treatment but others need to use a wheelchair or crutches and sometimes have to undergo an operation to re-shape the bone. 'I started coaching Erraid when she was eight. I did some lessons with her before.' Both Andy Murray's mother, Judy, and Scotland's First Minister, Alex Salmond, were quick to take to their Twitter accounts and congratulate Erraid, who even began trending on the social networking site. Judy Murray tweeted: 'Well done wee Erraid Davies. Just 13 and from the Shetland Islands. Bronze medal 100m Para breaststroke. How big was her smile? Adorable.' First Minister Alex Salmond said: 'Congrats to Scotland's youngest-ever Commonwealth Games competitor Erraid Davies winning a brilliant Bronze.' The youngster will now decide whether to compete in the Paralympic games in Rio in two years time. Davies's victory came as concerns arose about the swimming pool in Glasgow being used for the Games. The moveable floor at Tollcross International Swimming Centre, in the Scottish city's east, became stuck the day before the Games began resulting in uneven depths. Davies will now decide whether to try to compete in the Paralympic Games in Rio in two years' time . Davies's bronze came after she was selected to carry the Glasgow 2014 Queen's Baton through Aith on the Shetland Islands earlier this year . It is two metres deep at the start and then rises up to 1.88 metres at the 12-metre mark, before dropping off down to two metres again. Swimming governing body FINA only requires a depth of 1.35m for competitions that are not the Olympic Games or a world championships. Glasgow 2014 spokesperson Jackie Brock-Doyle told the Sydney Morning Herald the 50-metre pool is 'fully compliant'. 'We've discussed it with the FINA technical delegate. It's fully compliant with FINA rules for the Commonwealth Games,' Brock-Doyle said. 'There will be no impact on the competitors and records set here.' Dutch company Variopool are behind the installation but they will not fix the pool mid-competition in case it ends up in a position that does effect FINA pool depth rules.","Determined Erraid Davies makes history by taking bronze in breaststroke .

"By . Leon Watson . It's all they're talking about down Stonegate's local pub - just who is the notorious great train robber in their midst? But two days on, and still no-one in the East Sussex village has let slip the name of the high-flying executive who avoided paying almost £43,000 in train tickets for his daily commute into London. 'I've lived here 30 years and I've never heard anything like it,' said Lucy Enville, 78. 'It's hot gossip at the moment.' She's not the only one eager to find out who the mysterious the fare-dodging hedge fund manager is. Rural: The hedge fund manager, who dodged £43,000 in rail fares over five years, began his journey into London at Stonegate train station in East Sussex, which has no ticket barriers . A hairdresser, who did not want to be . named, said: 'I've had lots of clients talking about it. No one knows . who it is. I know a few hedge fund managers around here but I couldn't . possibly disclose their names.' On . Sunday it was revealed that over five years, the hedge fund manager . dodged the £24.50-each-way fare while travelling from his home in the . sought-after village to his place of work in the city. The . unnamed man, who is believed to be the biggest fare dodger in history, . exploited a loophole that allowed him to pay only a third of the actual . cost of his 1hour 22minute journey. In . the nearby village of Ticehurst, a waitress told The Independent that . Southeastern trains should have been 'more on the ball'. 'It serves them right,' she said. 'How did he get away with it for five years? It puts the rail system to shame.' He caught the commuter train from Stonegate - a rural station with no barriers or ticket machine and only a part-time ticket office - without purchasing a fare. Free pass: He would arrive at London Bridge station and transfer to another platform, for a service to Cannon Street, while avoiding the barriers . Final destination: He would reach Cannon Street in Central London, only paying £7.20 - a third of the rail fare . Once in London, the executive was then . able to pass through the barriers at Cannon Street by simply 'tapping . out' with an Oyster Travelcard paying just £7.20. But . his scam was finally exposed by a ticket inspector and, in an . out-of-court settlement, he paid Southeastern trains back the £42,550 in . dodged fares and £450 legal cost within three days. The . cost of a standard-class single fare from Stonegate - where the average . home cost half a million pounds - to London is £24.50 while an annual . season ticket costs £4,548. Cheating the system: The unnamed commuter would only 'tap out' his Oyster card once on his journey . According . to a report in the Sunday Times, the senior executive is believed to . have travelled into London without buying any ticket and avoiding . detection from 2008 until the end of last year. He . was able to get off his train at London Bridge and cross a platform to . catch a service to Cannon Street - again avoiding having to go through . any barriers. At Cannon . Street, he used an Oyster card to exit the barriers, paying the then . maximum £7.20 fare incurred when a passenger taps out without having . tapped in. But on November . 25 last year a ticket inspector standing next to the barriers spotted he . had paid £7.20 and not the £2.30 for a single ticket. After . being challenged, the passenger later admitted to dodging the correct . fare on five journeys between London Bridge and Cannon Street. However, . suspicious investigators for Southeastern discovered that the man had . for a number of years up until 2008 been purchasing an annual ticket . from Stonegate. And within . five days of being caught out at Cannon Street, the executive renewed . his season ticket, leading Southeastern to believe he had been dodging . the fare for his commute for five years. Despite . never admitting to this, the executive offered to settle the matter out . of court and paid up within three days of being notified by the train . operator the total owed in dodged tickets. Southeastern, who has not named the man, said all passengers have the option to avoid prosecution and settle out of court. The . train company told the Sunday Times that the executive wanted to . protect his identity because he was concerned about the impact it would . have on his job. A spokesperson added: 'All customers have the option to settle out of court and in this case he chose to pay the settlement fee that we put to him. 'The customer wanted to protect his identity and did not admit to evading fares for five years at any point during the process.' However, crtiics have questioned why the fare dodging executive was allowed to escape being prosecuted and remain anonymous. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said in the report: 'It is not only extraordinary that the biggest fare dodger in railway history got away with it for so long, but has also now escaped criminal prosecution as well.'

"By . Julian Robinson . Journalist Mazher Mahmood suggested ‘sex for payment’ in exchange for a film part during his botched sting on singer Tulisa Contostavlos, court documents have revealed. The former X-Factor judge also suspected her personal psychic was recruited by The Sun to ‘influence events’. She even believes her drink was spiked as the 'Fake Sheikh' Mazher Mahmood plied her with tequilas during a binge at a central London hotel. Scroll down for video . Pop star Tulisa Contostavlos is pictured walking out of Southwark Crown Court yesterday . The revelations come as it was revealed she will open up about her 'horrific' ordeal in a BBC3 documentary to air next week. Tulisa was cleared of helping to supply Mahmood half an ounce of cocaine worth £800 to secure a Hollywood role. The ex N-Dubz star was alleged to have brokered the deal for the journalist while he was posing as a wealthy Bollywood filmmaker named Samir Khan. She was promised a starring role in a Slumdog Millionaire style rags-to-riches story alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. During pre-trial argument which can now be reported, Tulisa’s barrister Jeremy Dein QC, attempted to have the case thrown out before it went to trial. In documents, submitted to Judge Alistair McCreath Mr Dein claimed Mahmood and his team used a variety of tactics to entrap Tulisa, including ‘sex for payment’ with the journalist. Following a meeting in Las Vegas, Tulisa was 'desperate to obtain the part' in the film, the court heard. There are claims within court documents that the so-called 'Fake Sheikh', right, suggested 'sex for payment' in exchange for a film part during his botched sting on the singer . On 10 May 2013, Tulisa met the undercover reporters at London’s Metropolitan Hotel for what turned out to be a six-hour drinking session. ‘Throughout the evening, Samir and his teams were plying TC (Tulisa) and her companions with alcohol, in particular Mojitos and Platinum tequila shots,’ the document states. ‘Samir commented on the expensive drinks he was ordering, but encouraged TC and her party to drink. ‘He and his associate were, unbeknownst to TC, not in fact consuming alcohol; all the while they were cajoling and persuading [their] victims to drink so much they became intoxicated. ‘As a consequence of drink, the events of the evening have become blurred for TC. Tulisa, pictured, is to reveal her 'horrific' ordeal during a BBC3 documentary . Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos will open up about her 'horrific' ordeal in a BBC3 documentary to air next week. The singer, 26, told yesterday, after her trial for allegedly brokering a drugs deal collapsed, how a year of her life had been 'ruined'. Cameras have been following the former N-Dubz singer since the story appeared in the Sun on Sunday. The documentary, to be broadcast on Monday, will also feature Contostavlos talking to programme makers about her experience after the judge formally threw out the case. BBC3 channel editor Sam Bickley said: 'BBC3 has had exclusive access to Tulisa all the way through her ordeal and this hour long documentary will bring you her true story, as events unfolded.' Yesterday the singer issued a scathing broadside at undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, who was the main prosecution witness, after a judge said there were 'strong grounds' to believe he had lied on the witness stand and 'had been manipulating the evidence'. The Sun on Sunday suspended the journalist known as the Fake Sheikh amid questions over whether he could now face a perjury investigation. Contostavlos, who had denied brokering a drugs deal, appeared on the steps of the court and called the case 'a horrific and disgusting entrapment by Mazher Mahmood and the Sun on Sunday newspaper'. She previously appeared in BBC3 documentary Tulisa: My Mum And Me, about being a carer for her mother, who suffers from a mental illness. The show airs at 10pm on BBC3 on Monday night. ‘She recalls parts, but not all. Her recollection as to detail is inevitably impaired. ‘There was discussion of a very wide range of topics. At one stage, TC referred to her problems with depression and the assistance she had in falling asleep from occasional use of ‘weed’. ‘Thereafter, Samir referred repeatedly to weed, and encouraged discussion of it.’ The document continues: ‘In the thick of these events, TC was accompanied to the lavatory by Nish (Mahmood's colleague). There, Nish told TC that she could expect a fee of £3.5m for her part in the film. ‘Nish pretended that she really wanted TC to get the part and commented that TC needed to show she was suitable for the role. ‘Nish said words to the effect that TC should remember her past. ‘This was highly manipulative conduct designed to lure TC into further drug-related talk and activity, while creating an enormous financial incentive for her to do so. ‘TC responded to Samir’s luring and ‘egging on’ by talking further about cocaine, believing that this was what Samir wanted to hear, she hoped to increase her prospect of securing the part by doing so, and believed she could. Tulisa, centre, found fame with her band N-Dubz, she founded with her cousin Dino 'Dappy' Contostavlos, left, and Richard 'Fazer' Rawson, right, who had their first hit in 2007 . ‘TC’s talk of involvement and connection with cocaine was similarly made up by her, but well received by Samir. ‘This was done to please the film-makers, to increase her prospects, not because it was true. ‘In addition, TC recalls that Samir diverted the conversation to celebrity prostitution, with reference to someone known to Samir. ‘TC understood Samir to be hinting at sex with TC for payment. ‘There was a stage of events when Nish attempted to ‘prise’ GV away from the party, suggesting that it would be best if the businessman were left with TC and [friend] Michelle who, by now, was extremely drunk. ‘GV was fearful for TC’s safety if left alone with Samir and he resisted the suggestion.’ The reporter went on to talk about ‘liking white girls’ before ‘Nish eventually suggested that TC go to Samir’s bedroom alone’. ‘Again, TC perceived that sex for payment was being suggested. She declined the offer.’ Mr Dein went on to claim that Tulisa believed her drinks had been spiked that evening. Yesterday, Tulisa’s trial collapsed after Judge McCreath concluded Mahmood’s lies had fatally undermined the prosecution. Mahmood had told the court during legal arguments last month that he had not discussed a witness statement given by his driver Alan Smith. However, while under cross examination on Thursday Mr Mahmood confessed to speaking with Mr Smith about his statement which was later changed to drop Contostavlos’ comments on drugs. News UK announced yesterday Mahmood was ‘suspended pending an immediate internal investigation’ after claims he lied to the court. Contostavlos of New Southgate, north London, denied being concerned in the supply of class A drugs. Michael Coombs of Enfield, north London, pleaded guilty to supplying a class A drug to another but was acquitted by the jury.","Singer cleared of organising £820 drug deal between friend and reporter .

"By . Daniel Mills . NRL CEO Dave Smith has vowed to eliminate players from the game if they continue to misbehave . The NRL has vowed to clean up the sport's off-field image with boss Dave Smith announcing a zero-tolerance policy for players who misbehave. Under a bold initiative to improve player standards in the code, Mr Smith is set to introduce significant reforms including a no tolerance approach to individuals who play-up off the field and a $1 million fine for clubs if they fail to keep clean financial records. It is part of his pledge to move the game out of its troubled limelight - which most recently saw Todd Carney sacked and Newcastle Knight Darius Boyd stood down - towards a more family-friendly atmosphere. The NRL boss told The Saturday Telegraph that players and clubs will feel the full force of the new rules and that if they don't comply will be heavily sanctioned. Clubs receive an annual funding of $7.5 million from a central fund. Mr Smith said that if if they fail to appoint skilled directors, keep an annual business log or monthly financial records will risk losing $1 million of that funding. Darius Boyd, who trashed a Hunter Valley hotel room, is seeking treatment for depression and has stepped away from the game indefinitely . The now infamous bubbler incident which may end Todd Carney's playing career . On individuals, he said players who continue to commit 'indiscretions outside the boundaries of what the general community expects' will face consequences. 'It may be you don’t have a career in the game any more.' Part of his succession plan as taking over from former NRL boss David Gallop in 2013 was to move the game in a more family-friendly direction and the only way for it to succeed in the future was to do just that. He said it was vital that the sport turn itself into a code women and children can enjoy, and mothers played an important role in its future. While he stressed the great majority of players did the right thing, there were players who had been guilty of poor behaviour 'as we’ve seen recently.' The list of names bringing the game into disrepute is endless, but more recently include Todd Carney, Mitchell Pearce and Blake Ferguson. In June, Carney, 28, had his Cronulla Sharks contract terminated for the now infamous 'bubbling' image which circulated on social media. Russell Packer is serving a two year jail sentence for pleading guilty to assaulting a bouncer . It was followed just days ago by the standing-down of Newcastle Knight Darius Boyd who trashed a Hunter Valley hotel room causing $1500 worth of damage. Boyd, 27, said he had depression and has stepped aside from his commitments with the Newcastle Knights while he undergoes treatment. It is unlikely Carney will ever play again but Boyd will likely return to the game, albeit most likely for a different club other than Newcastle. Meanwhile others names which have lead the NRL to make a stand on player behaviour include Mitchell Pearce, who back in May was sacked from State-Of-Origin commitments when he was embroiled in a Kings Cross nightclub incident. Pearce was arrested and issued with a $500 fine. Newcastle Knight and former Warriors forward Russell Packer is serving a two-year jail term for assaulting a bouncer in November 2013, but has been linked with a return to the Penrith Panthers pending his parole. Last year, sacked Canberra Raider Blake Ferguson who self-destructed when he went awol during the Raiders 2013 rugby league season. Smith said: “We’ve seen a number of incidents over a long period of time and there’s a line being drawn here that says we’re not going to accept that going forward,’’ he told The Saturday Telegraph.","CEO Dave Smith is moving the game in a family-friendly direction .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . The childhood home of George Harrison, where The Beatles began to take shape as the pop sensation that would conquer the world, has been put up for sale. The humble three-bed terrace in Liverpool was home to Harrison and his family in the 1950s and was where he and his friends Paul McCartney and John Lennon held their first band rehearsals. And though the house has been formally valued at just £75,000, the owners hope the part it played in the Beatles legacy will boost its value significantly. Live and Let Buy: Beatles star George Harrison lived at the above home . in the Speke district of Livepool in the 1950s and 1960s, just as his . band with John Lennon and Paul McCartney was taking shape . Home boy: George Harrison is pictured left  holding a guitar outside the . front gate of his family home, while the same view can be seen to the . right today . Harrison lived at the property with his parents until the early 1960s, by which point the band were well on their way to international super-stardom. The former council house was bought from Liverpool City Council by Matthew and Edna Kermode in 1983. Mr Kermode continued to live in the house until his death, which triggered the home being passed to his daughter, Linda, who is selling it. Last year John Lennon’s unassuming childhood home in Liverpool was snapped up at auction by a Beatles fan for £480,000 - three times the initial £150,000 estimate. Beatlemania: While Harrison was living at the house The Beatles came into their own - and in 1963, a year after the Harrisons moved out - the band had their first number one album . Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearth Club: The terraced, three-bedroom house, has a claim to fame for having hosted early Beatles rehearsals. Pictured here is the living room . Fab Four (hobs): Pictured is the house's kitchen. The whole property has been valued at around £75,000, but its links to pop history could boost its price significantly . Harrison was only six years old when in 1950 his parents Harold and Louise moved to the modest council house, in the Speke district of Liverpool, close to where Paul McCartney lived with his parents. Some years later the two youngsters met while waiting for a school bus and McCartney convinced Harrison, who had become obsessed with guitars, to join a band he had started with another friend - John Lennon. The Harrison family lived at the terraced house until 1962 when they moved to Macket’s Lane in the Hunt’s Cross neighbourhood of Liverpool. By that point the Beatles were on the road to worldwide fame having just released their first single, Love Me Do. Consequently, Mr and Mrs Harrison were constantly besieged by Beatles fans. Glory days: Mr and Mrs Harrison had to fend off hundreds of fans who would set up camp outside their home . Since then the house has been lived in by several owners, the latest of which died recently and it passed down to relatives. They have now decided to auction the property following the huge success of the sale of Lennon’s first house at 9 Newcastle Road. The auction will be conducted by Countrywide property auctioneers but the date of the sale has not yet been revealed. Steven Green, from estate agents Homes Bought Fast which is selling the house, said: 'We had a call from a lady who had inherited a three-bed terrace in Liverpool from her father who had recently passed away. 'There was nothing remarkable about it whatsoever, until she revealed that it was where George Harrison grew up. Yellow submarine not included: Pictured is the bathroom of the home. The Harrison family stayed in the property until 1962, by which time the Beatles' popularity was well-established . Bed-in: The current owners will be hoping that that the house will suffer a similar Beatles boost to John Lennon's old house, which more than tripled its auction estimate . Pictured is one of the bedrooms . Where the heart is: A Liverpudlian couple bought the home from the council in the 1980s, but later died. Their daughter is now selling the property . 'We did a lot of research into the property and soon established that it was indeed where George had spent his years before joining the Beatles. 'The house is just a typical terrace but inside it has been modernised and it could easily be lived in or rented out. 'We are now in the process of arranging an auction for the house. 'It is hard to know what a house of this significance is worth. We will not be publishing a guide price until much closer to the auction, which should take place in several weeks’ time. 'John Lennon’s childhood home sold at auction last year for £480,000 against an estimate of £150,000 so we are hoping that a similar thing happens with this property. 'The vendor is being realistic about the sale - he realises it could go for a life-changing sum of money but is happy to see what happens. 'You can never underestimate the popularity of the Beatles.' Outside: The former council property has an indelible link to the rise of The Beatles, and therefore to pop history .

"By . Associated Press . The family of James Brady, the White House press secretary who was wounded during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, says he has died. Brady was 73. Brady undertook a personal crusade for gun control after he suffered a devastating head wound outside the Washington Hilton Hotel on March 30, 1981 and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. A federal law requiring a background check on handgun buyers bears Brady's name and was singed into existence by former President Bill Clinton in 1993. A family spokesperson said that Brady had suffered a 'series of health issues' following his injury on that March day in 1981. Scroll Down for Video . Passed away: This March 30, 2011 file photo shows former White House press secretary James Brady as he gives the thumbs-up while visiting the Brady Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, DC . Although Brady returned to the White House only briefly, he was allowed to keep the title of presidential press secretary and his White House salary until Reagan left office in January 1989. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence is named in his honor. The law requires a five-day waiting period and background check on all handgun purchases. 'Jim touched the lives of so many and has been a wonderful husband, father, friend and role model,' his family said in a statement. 'We are enormously proud of Jim's remarkable accomplishments - before he was shot on the fateful day in 1981 while serving at the side of President Ronald Reagan and in the days, months and years that followed.

'Jim Brady's zest for life was apparent to all who knew him, and despite his injuries and the pain he endured every day, he used his humor, wit and charm to bring smiles to others and make the world a better place.' 'Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the family of former White House Press Secretary James Brady on his passing.  Jim is a legend at the White House for his warmth and professionalism as press secretary for President Reagan; for the strength he brought to bear in recovering from the shooting that nearly killed him 33 years ago; and for turning the events of that terrible afternoon into a remarkable legacy of service through the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.  Since 1993, the law that bears Jim’s name has kept guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.  An untold number of people are alive today who otherwise wouldn’t be, thanks to Jim.' 'Every day, reporters and White House staffers walk past a plaque marking the day in 2000 that the White House Briefing Room was renamed the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room.  It reads, “May his courage and dedication continue to inspire all who work in this room and beyond.”  Those words will endure, as will his legacy.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Jim’s wife Sarah, who has been Jim’s steadfast partner in advocacy, and their children Scott and Melissa.' Brady suffered a bullet wound to his head outside the Washington Hilton Hotel on March 30, 1981. Although he returned to the White House only briefly, he was allowed to keep the title of presidential press secretary and his White House salary until Reagan left office in January 1989. Nancy Reagan posted a statement on the death of James Brady on Monday afternoon. The former First Lady said: 'I was deeply saddened to learn of Jim Brady's passing today. 'Thinking of him brings back so many memories - happy and sad - of a time in all our lives when we learned what it means to 'play the head we're dealt with.' She went on to say that in the 'short time he was able to serve as White House Press Secretary, Jim brough sharp instincts, integrity to one of the most demanding jobs in Washington.' Brady, who spent much of the rest of his life in a wheelchair, died at a retirement community in Alexandria, Virginia where he lived with his wife. A federal law requiring a background check on handgun buyers bears his name, as is the White House press briefing room. 'He is somebody who I think really revolutionized this job,' said Josh Earnest, President Barack Obama's press secretary. 'And even after he was wounded in that attack on the president, was somebody who showed his patriotism and commitment to the country by being very outspoken on an issue that was important to him and that he felt very strongly about.

Bravery, thanks and service: Washington, D.C.: Press Secretary James Brady cuts the ribbon opening the new press center at the White House as President and Nancy Reagan look on in November 1981, seven months on from the failed assassination attempt on Reagan's life . Brady 'leaves the kind of legacy ... that certainly this press secretary and all future press secretaries will aspire to live up to,' Earnest said. Of the four people stuck by gunfire on March 30, 1981, Brady was the most seriously wounded. A news clip of the shooting, replayed often on television, showed Brady sprawled on the ground as Secret Service agents hustled the wounded president into his limousine. Reagan was shot in one lung while a policeman and a Secret Service agent suffered lesser wounds. Brady never regained full health. The shooting caused brain damage, partial paralysis, short-term memory impairment, slurred speech and constant pain. The TV replays of the shooting did take a toll on Brady, however. He told The Associated Press years later that he relived the moment each time he saw it: 'I want to take every bit of (that) film ... and put them in a cement incinerator, slosh them with gasoline and throw a lighted cigarette in.' With remarkable courage, he endured a series of brain operations in the years after the shooting. On November 28, 1995, while he was in an oral surgeon's office, Brady's heart stopped beating and he was taken to a hospital. His wife, Sarah, credited the oral surgeon and his staff with saving Brady's life. Before: President Ronald Reagan and Jim Brady review documents in January, 1981, two months before the assassination attempt that would gravely wound both men . Hard at work: President Ronald Reagan sitting at desk for first time, as aides (R-L) Richard Allen, Edwin Meesek, James Brady, Michael Deaver & James Baker look on in the Oval Office of the White House - prior to March, 1981 . Brady was a strong Republican from an early age - as a boy of 12 in Centralia, Illinois where he was born on August 29, 1940, he distributed election literature for Dwight D. Eisenhower. In a long string of political jobs, Brady worked for some well-known bosses: Sen. Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois, Sen. William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, and John Connally, the former Texas governor who was running for president in 1979. When Connally dropped out, Brady joined Reagan's campaign as director of public affairs and research. There, his irrepressible wit made him popular with the press, but not necessarily with the Reaganites. He once ran through the Reagan campaign plane shouting ""Killer Trees! Killer Trees!"" as the aircraft flew over a forest fire. It was a jab at his own candidate's claim in a speech that trees cause as much pollution as cars. Brady remained as transition spokesman after Reagan's election. Return: President Reagan and his wife Nancy greet Press Secretary James Brady on his return to the White House after being critically wounded during the attempt on the president's life in March, 1981 . But Reagan's advisers appeared hesitant to give him the White House job. Nancy Reagan was said to feel the job required someone younger and better-looking than the 40-year-old, moon-faced, balding Brady. 'I come before you today not as just another pretty face, but out of sheer talent,' Brady told reporters. A week later, he got the job. Previously, he had worked in the administrations of presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford: as special assistant to the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, as special assistant to the director of the Office of Management and Budget, and as an assistant to the defense secretary. He was divorced from the former Sue Beh when, in 1973, he courted Sarah Jane Kemp, the daughter of an FBI agent who was working with him in a congressional office. Sarah Brady became involved in gun-control efforts in 1985, and later chaired Handgun Control Inc., but Brady took a few more years to join her, and Reagan did not endorse their efforts until 10 years after he was shot.

James Brady, former press secretary to Ronald Reagan who was severely wounded in a 1981 assassination attempt on the President . Reagan's surprise endorsement - he was a longtime National Rifle Association member and opponent of gun control laws - began to turn the tide in Congress. 'They're not going to accuse him of being some bed-wetting liberal, no way can they do that,"" said Brady, who had become an active lobbyist for the bill. The Brady law required a five-day wait and background check before a handgun could be sold. In November 1993, as President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law, Brady said: . 'Every once in a while you need to wake up and smell the propane. I needed to be hit in the head before I started hitting the bricks.' Clinton awarded Brady the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996. In 2000, the press briefing room at the White House was renamed in Brady's honor. The following year, Handgun Control Inc., was renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as a tribute to Brady and his wife. Brady also served as vice chair of the National Organization on Disability and co-chair of the National Head Injury Foundation. Survivors include his wife, Sarah; a son, Scott; and a daughter, Melissa.","James Brady has passed away after spending more than three decades confined to a wheelchair .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . and Kieran Corcoran . In an age before mass photography, they were the best way to show people the world in all its variety. And whether it is trench warfare, the changing face of womanhood or the invention of the wireless, these illustrated newspaper covers depict world events with clarity and elegance. The collection, originals which were made into front pages of The Illustrated London News, were seen by hundreds of thousands of people during the paper's peak. Big stories: The collection of front page images from The Illustrated London News, including this drawing depicting British officers relaxing in the Ypres Salient drawn by Italian artist Fortunino Matania . Revolution in action: Another one of the intricate images shows hundreds of women working in a munitions factory circa 1915, which was part of a step-change in the nation's attitude towards working women . War and peace: Another one of the pictures shows Armistice Day celebrations in Trafalgar Square - with King George V and Queen Mary shown looking on from the horse drawn carriage. Horrors of war: This image shows soldiers tending to the wounded on the Western Front in 1915, with barbed wire and No-Man's Land visible in the distance . British sea power: This illustration shows the amassed might of the Royal Navy, with ships of all sizes labelled and represented. It was commissioned just after VE Day in 1945 . And, although the news magazine closed in 2003, the images are being given a fresh outing as they are sold to the highest bidder. In its 160-year history the illustrated newspaper, which had a peak circulation of 300,000 in the 1860s, covered events as various as the Queen's wedding to Prince Phillip, the Coronation of George V and the 1951 Festival of Britain. The works were by famous artists such as Terence Cuneo, Fortunino Matania and Bryan de Grineau. Triumphant: This full-colour cover commemorating the 1951 Festival of Britain in London, showing the banks of the Thames, is expected to fetch £15,000 . Historic moments: The Illustrated London News recorded moments of national importance, like the Queen's Royal Wedding in 1947 pictured above . George V is crowned on June 22, 1911, by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Drawn by Fortunino Matania, the vivid artwork is now up for auction . Vintage tech: This detailed illustration highlights the value of pigeon-post as an accompaniment to newfangled wireless communication during the war, drawn by Bryan de Grineau . The return: This image, called 'Home for Christmas' shows a British soldier coming back from war to be greeted by his wife and son at his front door . Alpine adventure: Another illustration shows British holidaymakers travelling to Switzerland, where panel by panel they spend all their money on a skiing holiday . Another illustration shows British forces valiantly fending off a night attack in the WWI trenches using star pistols and rifles at the same time . They were either reproduced in the famous magazine on the front cover or for double page spreads inside. Each of the 70-strong collection is expected to fetch as much as £1,000 when they are auctioned in London this October. The prize lot, Terence Cuneo's Festival of Britain illustration, is estimated to sell for £15,000. James Richards, drawings and watercolours specialist at Christie's auctioneers, said: 'The Illustrated London News was the first magazine of its kind in the world. It recorded current affairs. 'It was at the forefront of the development of visual journalism. This collection is an unprecedented treasure trove of artworks from one of the 20th century's most important publications by some of the best illustrators of the time. 'It is particularly fitting that the core of the collection, world war illustrations, should come to light 100 years after the First World War's outbreak, and offer a first-hand account of that turbulent period in history at such a poignant time.' Fields of slaughter: This illustration shows tourists returning to the battlefields of Ypres in Belgium after the First World War, where thousands of Allied and German soldiers died . Illustration: One of the most famous illustrations is of Lord Kitchener, and functioned as a recruitment tool during the First World War. It originally appeared as a cover illustration on the London Opinion magazine . In the days before photographs could be easily taken, processed, distributed and printed, illustrations were often the quickest way to show people what was going on in the world. So popular were the drawings which accompanied current news events in the periodicals swirling around London and towns beyond at the time that an entire new genre of publication, which focusses on illustrations, was born. Chief among them was The Illustrated London News, founded in 1842 by Herbert Ingram, who had noticed that other newspapers experienced a sales spike when they carried prominent illustrations, and decided to provide a dedicated outlet. Even though just decades after its foundation photography became more widespread, it remained much faster to sketch a drawing and print it than to process a photograph. The most prominent practitioners could create a lavish illustration in a matter of hours and have it ready for the next day's publication. It was challenged by the appearance of The English Illustrated Magazine (1883 - 2014), which competed on similar footing but never gained enough traction to really threaten its rival. Meanwhile, outside of news coverage, illustrations became a very common way for publications to grab attention with a unique, strong image for their front cover. One of the most famous images from illustrated magazines was a portrait of Lord Kitchener, who was Secretary of State for War during the First World War, and whose face appeared on recruitment ads throughout the land. The original was in fact dashed off for an upcoming issue of the London Opinion magazine, by an artist - Alfred Leete - who had never spoken to nor seen the man himself. The power of the original image, much mimiced around the world by the likes of the U.S. government with their Uncle Sam posters, and even by German fighters, eventually began to wane. However, as photographing technology became better it ceased to be an especial need to include illustrations and the job could be done quicker and more cheaply by using different methods. The circulation of The Illustrated London News began to wane as photography became a staple feature of journalism. By the time of the magazine's closure in 2003 the figure had plummeted from the hundreds of thousands to a much more modest figure. The magazine continued right up until 2003, but at that time in only published every other months to a small audience.","The Illustrated London News published intricate artwork on its front covers for more than 160 years .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . The price of an ordinary three-bedroom semi will hit £330,000 by 2020, economists have predicted. An average semi-detached home rocket by almost £90,000 in just six years, while the same in London will be an eye-watering £565,000, a new report predicts. The increase is a significant leap from the current figure of £242,000 for a three-bed home, and will add to fears of Britain being caught in the grip of an 'overheating' housing market. Average home: A three-bedroom semi-detached house, such as the one picture above in Weston super Mare, Somerset, is expected to be worth an average of £330,000 by 2020 . The stark property predictions come in the latest UK Economic Outlook report by financial services firm PwC. It forecasts an eight per cent rise in house prices this year, 5.5 per cent in 2015 and incrementally smaller rises until the final figure of £328,000 is expected to come in 2020. Concerns surrounding soaring property prices - which make housing increasingly unaffordable for the young - come as the Bank of England considers ending the historically low interest rates in the UK which has helped foster the market. William Zimmern, a PwC senior economist said: 'House prices across the UK are accelerating. We do, however, expect the pace to moderate, slowing to around 3.5 per cent between 2016 and 2020. 'We don't believe the housing market is overheating at a national level yet, although evidence of a bubble in London is stronger.' On the rise: PwC predicts that typical homes, such as this one in Kenliworth, Warwickshire, will climb in value by eight per cent this year alone . Trends: The above graph shows the proportional changes in house price value over the past years . Mr Zimmern raised the prospect of the Bank of England increasing interest rates eightfold when the shift does eventually come, to put a dampener on the housing market. He said: 'They could rise to around four per cent, but in the longer term, measures to boost housing supply more directly should be the priority.' The predictions came as a major report gave fresh evidence of the property market continuing to surge, with house prices up 8.8 per cent year-on-year. The figure is the strongest annual uplift since 2007 as consumer confidence continues to rise, Halifax has reported. The increase took the average UK house price to £183,462, although on a month-on-month basis prices slipped back by 0.6 per cent, marking the fourth monthly price fall seen since last December. Homely: Properties - such as this three-bedroom semi-detached home in Grays, Essex - are expected to climb in value, though the Bank of England may tweak interest rates to control the market . The year-on-year uplift in property values has accelerated on an 8.7 per cent annual increase recorded in May and marks the biggest year-on-year jump seen since October 2007, the figures show. A year ago, in June 2013, house prices were increasing annually at less than half the pace they are now, by 3.7 per cent. The latest 0.6 per cent monthly drop in property values marks a large swing backwards from a month-on-month increase of 4 per cent recorded in May. Halifax said month-on-month price changes can often be 'volatile' and its quarter-on-quarter measure of price fluctuations is a more reliable indicator of what is happening in the market. This quarterly measure revealed that the underlying direction for house prices is still pointing upwards. Property values between April and June this year were 2.3 per cent higher than they were between January and March. Stephen Noakes, mortgages director at Halifax, said: 'Housing demand continues to be supported by an economic recovery that is gathering pace, with employment levels growing and rising consumer confidence, although real earnings growth remains sluggish.'","New report predicts the spike in value from current £242,000 figure by 2020 .
House prices will rise 8% next year, and 5.5% in 2015, say PwC .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Georgia dad accused of leaving his baby son to die in their hot car called himself 'harmless' on a dating profile he apparently made. A page on Skout, a social networking app often used for dating and meeting up, appears to show a profile set up by Justin Ross Harris, 33, whose 22-month-old son Cooper died in his car on June 18. If it is indeed his, the profile is the latest question mark over Harris, a married father from Marietta. Investigators revealed in his probable cause hearing that he had sexted numerous women - including at least one he had met on Skout - while at work, and online searches have revealed he looked for information on children drying in cars and 'how to survive in prison'. The Skout profile, which was first found by CNN, shows images that look like Harris - and one is the same photograph he uses on his Twitter profile. Scroll down for video . Secret life: A profile that apparently belongs to Justin Ross Harris on the social networking app Skout is pictured. On the profile, his image can be seen and he lists himself as married and 'just looking to talk' 'Harmless': Although he wrote he was looking to talk, one of the women he contacted told investigators he had wanted to hook up with her after they met through the site . On the page, he calls himself 'RJ' and says he lives in Smyrna, which is close to where he lives in Marietta with his wife, Leanna. He writes that he is 27 - although Harris is 33 - and calls his body type: 'More to love.' 'Just looking to talk,' he writes in the 'About' section. 'Message me, I'm harmless.' In a comment, he admits he is married although a wedding ring is not visible in any of his pictures. 'Yes I'm married,' he wrote eight months ago. According to the time stamps on his profile, Harris has been on the app for a year or longer and it was last updated five months ago, HLN reported. Match: The photo he uses on Skout matches up with an image he uses on his Twitter profile page . But his latest post suggests he wasn't having the best luck. 'If you don't want to talk please just say so. Being ignored is the worst,' he wrote. Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified in a probable cause hearing last week that Harris had been 'sexting' with up to six women on the messaging site, and on another site called Kik. Stoddard said he had spoken with one of the women who had met the man - whom she knew as Ross - through Skout. She said 'that he wanted to hook up with her', Stoddard said. Investigators have said that they are looking into all of his social media posts, including messages on Twitter, Facebook and Pintrest. They are also looking at his posts on Reddit, where investigators say he researched hot car deaths. NBC reported that it had found a Reddit profile that appears to belong to him. Family: Despite his profile on the dating app, he is married to wife Leanna, pictured. Their 22-month-old son Cooper, right, passed away after his father left him in a hot car last month . Questions: Harris, pictured at a probable cause hearing last week, was sexting several women he had met through dating websites, investigators revealed. He remains in jail and is being held without bail . On the profile, he apparently expressed anti-abortion views in April 2013, writing: 'Killing an unborn child is only for the purpose of convenience.' 'I do firmly believe that abortion is the killing of an unborn child,' the poster wrote. 'Although I am religious, it has nothing to do with religion for me.' Just a month before, the man wrote about how happy he was with his own child. 'I am now in my dream job,' the poster . wrote. '(I) have a beautiful 6-month old son and love going to work everyday. I couldn't be happier.' Harris, who claims he forgot to drop off his son at daycare on June 18, is being held without bail at the Cobb County Jail.","A page on Skout appears to belong to Justin Ross Harris, who is accused of killing his 22-month-old son Cooper last month .

"By . Leon Watson . Russia's richest and most powerful female oligarch today won a key stage in her bitter £80 million court battle with an oil tycoon with a pop star wife. Elena Baturina, who lives in Holland Park, west London, is suing oil and gas magnate Alexander Chistyakov claiming he ripped her off for over an investment. Mr Chistyokov, 41, who is married to Russian chart-topper GluKosa, 28, denies any wrongdoing and has accused Ms Baturina of breaching the agreement between them. Today, Ms Baturina won an Appeal Court decision that ruled the case should be heard in the Commercial Court in London, rather than in a Russian court. Elena Baturina (left), Russia's richest woman. The billionairess oligarch is locked in an £80m battle with oil tycoon Alexander Chistyakov. Mr Chistyokov (right), 41, is married to Russian chart-topper GluKosa, 28 . It overruled a decision by Mr Justice Walker to stay her claim against Alexander Chistyakov in favour of the courts of Russia. But Lord Justice Christopher Clarke said: 'Since the monetary claim set out in the Particulars of Claim is unsustainable as it stands there seems to me no point in granting of stay in favour of Russia.' He added: 'For such a claim there is no natural forum, not because several factors point to different jurisdictions but because the claim itself is bad.' It means Mr Chistyakov can now apply to have the claim struck out, according to his lawyers. The dispute is over an investment she made through one of her companies towards a proposed multi-million-pound luxury property development in Morocco in 2008. Ms Baturina, who is married to former mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, is the only Russian woman to have amassed a nine-figure personal fortune. Glukosa - real name Natalia Ionova - is pop star wife of oil tycoon Alexander Chistyakov . The 51-year-old moved to the UK three years ago because of 'political difficulties' says there are good reasons why she does not feel able to return to her homeland. Ms Baturina, whose two daughters, Elena and Olga, attended University College London, made her fortune in cement and construction during the years following the break-up of the Soviet Union. She is well known as an art collector and is the patron of several creative charities. She claims that Mr Chistyakov, 41, chairman of an oil and gas company, 'induced' her into signing away almost £80million, which has now disappeared. Ms Baturina is now trying to force Mr Chistyakov - who caused a sensation in Russia by marrying GluKosa, a pop starlet 13 years his junior - to repay the money and wants her claim against him heard in England. Summarizing her case during a hearing last year, Mr Justice Walker said she claims 'that Mr Chistyakov made fraudulent representations to her which led to her signature of the agreement and to her participation in the joint venture.' GluKosa is a pop starlet 13 years younger than Mr Chistyakov . Mr Chistyakov, 41, caused a sensation in Russia by marrying GluKosa . However, Mr Chistyakov 'alleges that Ms Baturina's representatives caused him substantial personal loss' and that she 'failed fully to invest in the projects, thereby breaching the principal agreement.' The judge dealt Ms Baturina a serious blow when he ruled she would have to pursue her claim against Mr Chistyakov in Russia. Challenging that decision, Barbara Dohmann QC, for Ms Baturina, told the Appeal Court: 'The fundamental issue will be, to put the issue at its most straighforward, what happened to the £80m? 'It is Ms Baturina's case that she trusted Mr Chistyakov and that considerable sums went out... she invested nearly 100 million euros in the projects through funds advanced by a company of which she was then the sole owner. Ms Baturina is married to former mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov (pictured) 'Ms Baturina's claim is that, in breach of the principal agreement, the bulk of the funds which she had provided were not invested in the projects, but were wrongfully dissipated by Mr Chistyakov through a series of international companies.' Insisting the case should be heard by an English judge, the QC added: 'It is apparent that the shape of the case has very little to do with Russia.' She told the court that there had been an agreement between Ms Baturina and Mr Chistyakov that any disputes would be settled under English law, though it was not specified which country would host any hearing. She added: 'Ms Baturina lives in England. Mr Chistyakov has important business interests in England. 'He was served with the proceedings in England in March 2013. There is not a great deal of Russian evidence. We would suggest there is a heavy weight of witnesses on the non-Russian side.' However, Stephen Moverley Smith QC, for Mr Chistyakov, insisted that Russia was the right forum for the case to be fought out. At the time of the deal, the parties were all living in Russia. 'The parties are Russian nationals. Mr Chistyakov resided in and carried on business in Russia. Until 2011 Ms Baturina resided in and carried on business in Russia. Any damage was suffered in Russia,' he told the judges. Ms Baturina says that she and her daughters moved to London after she and her husband were criticised on Russian state television following his dismissal  in 2010. She had retained part ownership of a 10-room Moscow apartment but said she 'did not feel able to return to Russia at present'. In his ruling last year, Mr Justice Walker accepted that she had 'a real anxiety' at the prospect of going back to Russia. But he went on to decide that it was 'clearly and distinctly more appropriate' for her dispute with Mr Chistyakov to be dealt with by a Russian court. Ms Baturina's spokesman Gennady Terebkov said today: 'We are pleased that the Court of Appeal in London supports our view that the case should be heard in an English Court. 'This ruling gives us access to an independent and unbiased court, and we intend to pursue the claim against Chistyakov for 100 million euros in damages for deceit and breach of contract.' Mr Chistyakov's representative said: 'It has always been my position that the claim against me brought by Elena Baturina was one that was without foundation and should never have been brought. 'I am therefore pleased that the Court of Appeal has agreed, and unequivocally confirmed the claim is unsustainable and entirely without foundation. 'As a result the claim should now be dismissed, and the Court of Appeal has recognised that is the next step as it has sent the case back to the lower Court so that I can seek such an Order. I look forward to this vexatious piece of litigation coming to end.'","Elena Baturina claims oil magnate Alexander Chistyakov ripped her off .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Mia Rodgers was murdered in her in bed in March. She was shot in the chest by her custodial grandfather and lived an hour before she died . A suicidal South Carolina man was sentenced to life in prison for killing his bedridden wife and their 9-year-old granddaughter, saying he wanted to spare them the pain of living without him. Ronald Gregory shot his wife, 71-year-old Barbara Gregory, and his granddaughter Mia Rodgers, as they slept in the early hours of March 21. Gregory told detectives that Mia survived for an hour, but instead of calling for help, Gregory held Mia as she bled to death, prosecutor Kevin Brackett said. The prosecutor recounted some of the girl's last words as people in the courtroom gasped and sobbed Monday. 'Paw paw, when am I going to stop hurting?' Brackett said, quoting the girl. After his granddaughter died, Gregory went to the bank and withdrew money. In multiple withdrawals in the three days before and after the murders he took out a total of $40,000. The former power company employee then texted his daughter Kristie, Mia's aunt, that there would be money for her should anything happen to him. He then called 911, asked the operator to send police to his home and shot himself twice in the chest with the same 9 millimeter pistol he used to kill his wife and Mia. But he survived. Gregory, 68, pleaded guilty but mentally ill to two counts of murder. He was sentenced to life without parole. Scroll down for video . SICK: Ronald Gregory, 68 shot and killed his 9-year-old granddaughter and bedridden wife because he didn't want them to live without him, he claimed. He has been sentenced to life in prison after he pleaded guilty but mentally ill Monday to two counts of murder in the shootings at his home . The plea means he will get extra mental health counseling in prison. Gregory acted as his own lawyer. He said little in court and did not apologize. He showed no emotion either. 'In over 20 years of prosecuting, this is just a ghastly case. The thought of what the child went through is unimaginable,' Brackett said. Gregory and his wife were in a custody battle over their granddaughter with her maternal grandparents and uncle after the girl's mother died died in November 2013 from leukemia. The pair had temporary custody at the time of the murders. Just before she died, Gregory took his granddaughter, a 75-lb third grader, to the doctor because he was afraid she had suffered brain damage from inhaling fumes when she got some press-on fingernails, Brackett said. The girl's other grandfather, Paul Rodgers, said the family plans a wrongful death lawsuit against Gregory for lying during the custody battle. Gregory 'called me the morning before when he took her to the doctor and said she was fine,' Rogers said. 'If he doesn't want her to be in pain, then why shoot her?' Mia's father, Ronald's son Kevin, cried and said nothing in court. Watch full court proceedings at the Rock Hill Herald Online . Mia's paternal grandparents sued for custody last fall, while Mia's mother Angie lay dying of leukemia. They won temporary custody shortly before Angie died in November. Barbara, pictured, was a bedridden invalid who was shot to death shortly before her husband shot Mia . Kevin Gregory submitted this photo of himself with his daughter to court in one battle against her mother's family. In addition to a half brother by her mother, Mia also has two half-siblings on her father's side . The custody battle had been complex. The Rodgers' daughter Angie Lee Rodgers Benoit lived with her parents and Mia when the child was born. Later Mia stayed with the Rogers while Ms Benoit was in college in Pennsylvania.  She and Mia's father Kevin never married. Shortly after she graduated college she moved to Texas with Mia, but a short time later was diagnosed with leukemia. Last September Mia moved back in with the Rodgers, Benoit's parents, and enrolled in school in South Carolina while her mother was in the hospital. Benoit died in November. Kevin's parents won temporary custody of the child in October, even though Mia's mom Angie wanted to terminate Kevin's parental rights before death. According to the Rodgers in a March interview, Kevin did not pay child support and would disappear from his daughter' life for months at a time. He has two other children by other women in addition to Mia. In her will Angie left custody of Mia and her son, Mia's half-brother Alexander, to her brother Eric Rodgers. The boy now lives in Alabama with his uncle, who was fighting for custody of Mia when she died. Eric had filed for custody in January and said his sister wanted her two children to be raised together.","Ronald Gregory pleaded guilty but mentally ill to two murder counts .

Judge Mark Lucraft QC told him: ‘The injury inflicted on Amina was similar to the force of a road traffic accident. ‘Her liver was forcibly split into two pieces and a piece of her liver went into her bloodstream. ‘The bruises on her body were all . recent and it was very likely they were inflicted at the same time as . that fatal injury. You are a dangerous young man.’ Amina’s mother Sarah Racqueman, 29, . was given a suspended 11-month sentence this week after admitting two . counts of cruelty to children, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

Amina Agboola's mother Sarah Raqueman (pictured) was taking her oldest child to school when it happened . She was cleared of causing or allowing Amina’s death. In an impact statement read by the . judge, the toddler’s father, Reuben Agboola, said: ‘Every time a picture . of Amina’s face comes up I cry. It has left a void in my heart. The . pain will never go away.’ 'The injury inflicted on Amina was similar to the force of a road traffic accident' Judge Mark Lucraft QC . Paramedics who treated Amina at her . home in Yaxley, Cambridgeshire, on November 21 last year, said they . found her looking like a ‘rag doll’ in a pink nightie, struggling to . breathe. She later died in hospital. While on remand, Harris confessed to a fellow inmate he had lashed out because Amina had wet herself. During his trial at Cambridge Crown . Court, he said: ‘I did not intend to kick her. It just happened in a . split second because I was frustrated.’ Amina Agboola, two, was found injured and like a 'rag doll' at her home near Peterborough after paramedics were called on November 21 last year . Amina was found to have had a number of other injuries, including an untreated broken wrist . Racqueman and Harris, who were both unemployed, began a relationship five months before Amina’s death. 'I did not intend to kick her. It just happened in a split second because I was frustrated' Dean Harris . Social services warned Racqueman that Harris was capable of violence and was a drug user. She claimed she had not usually . allowed Harris to look after her daughter, but was ‘not in her right . mind’ the day Amina was killed.  Harris admitted manslaughter, but was . convicted of murder by a jury last month. Police released a confession he wrote . to Amina’s family, in which he said: ‘At this point all I can remember . saying is “For ***** sake Mina”. ‘I was already in a standing position . and the next thing I knew I had kicked her in the stomach. She had gone . backwards and landed on her front about six feet away.’ Dean Harris wrote a confession letter to Amina Agboola's family confessing that he killed her. The letter, parts of which have been released by Cambridgeshire Police, describe the moment he killed Amina. In the note Harris then apologises to her family - saying 'only wish I could take all this back.' It reads: 'At this point I can remember saying 'for -- sake Mina', I was already in a standing position and the next thing I knew I had kicked her in the stomach. 'She had gone backwards and landed on her front about six feet away. I realised what I had done and went to pick her up. 'She was crying at this point and I could tell it had winded her because of the way she was talking. 'I picked her up to comfort her, I checked her stomach to see if she was OK. I held her in my arms for around three minutes until she stopped crying. 'When I went to put her down on the floor to further see if she was OK I noticed that she had become limp....I then panicked. '...crying.'When I went to put her down on the floor to further see if she was OK I noticed that she had become limp.' In his confession Harris says that he hope the family can find some closure . 'Everything else that happened after this point, the phone calls, the ambulance, is well documented. 'I only wish I could take all this back but I can't so I hope the family can find some closure. 'I would further like to add that none of this was Sarah's fault, she has lost a child, so I think she has suffered enough. 'I am truly sorry for what I have done.

"By . Leon Watson . A wealthy banker who lost a disastrous divorce battle with his fashionista ex-wife has gone back to court complaining that's he's been forced to quit his lavish life in New York. Yan Assoun, 44, says he is being forced out of his £2million condo in Manhattan, New York, and insists his ex-wife Anais Assoun, 45, has been given an 'unfair financial advantage' over him. The former London City trader, who is believed to be French, was previously described by a judge as having spending power 'beyond the wildest dreams' of his fashion writer ex. Divorce battle: Yan Assoun (left), 44, says he is being forced out of his £2 million condo in Manhattan, New York, after losing a disastrous divorce battle with his fashionista ex-wife Anais Assoun (right), 45 . But now, due to a divorce judge’s ruling, he said he has undergone a drastic reversal in fortunes. Mr Assoun says he has been left with just a fifth of his income to survive on. Judge Glenn Brasse, presiding over the final hearing of the couple’s divorce last year, ruled that the 'reasonable needs' of Mrs Assoun and the former couple’s children amounted to almost £294,000-a-year. The judge had earlier said of the banker: 'The husband has been able to acquire a £1.9 million apartment in Manhattan. This kind of spending ability is not within the wife’s reach, not within her wildest dreams.' But Mr Assoun is now protesting at the Appeal Court that he will be effectively exiled from New York by Judge Brasse’s order, as he cannot now afford the cost of maintaining his lifestyle there. Lady Justice Arden heard that Mr Assoun, majority shareholder in a banking business that turned over £4.7 million in 2012, had already handed his ex - who he met and married in London whilst working for BNP Paribas and Credit Suisse - £880,000 in assets and legal costs, prior to last year’s hearing. Mrs Assoun, a 'well educated' woman who lives on a ranch in Texas, which she owns, earns £38,000-a-year herself, Judge Brasse found. Mr Assoun bought a £1.9m condo on Broadway in Manhattan, but says he will now have to leave it (file picture) Yan Assoun's case is being heard at the Appeal Court in the Royal Courts of Justice in London . Her ex-husband had insisted at an earlier hearing that he was 'bust' and 'not rich' - despite owning a  condo on Broadway, one of Manhattan’s most iconic addresses, along with his business interests. But he was found to be reaping a yearly income of more than £411,000 from his business by Judge Brasse, who went on to order him to pay the lion’s share of that to his ex-wife and children in maintenance and expenses. He is now asking for permission to appeal the judge’s order - which he says left him with less than £88,000-a-year to live on, after tax. That is a sum on which it will be 'very difficult to survive' in the big apple, he told Lady Justice Arden. Judge Brasse ruled that a £411,000-a-year maintenance payment, before tax, represented his ex wife’s 'reasonable basic needs', and raised that figure to almost £294,000 when including the needs of their children. Mr Assoun told the appeal judge he will have to start spreading the news that he is leaving his New York home if the order stands. He added: 'The order leaves me living in New York City with an amount on which it will eventually be very difficult to survive, when paying my wife more than myself.' Insisting that Judge Brasse had 'made a miscalculation', he said: 'The award was greater for the wife when she lives in Dallas and I live in New York City, where the cost of living is much higher.' Criticising the judge, he added: 'I felt the judgment was so terrible...the decision led to a gross financial disparity between my ex-wife and myself. 'The judge made a calculation error which led to an unfair financial advantage for the wife.' Lady Justice Arden directed Mr Assoun to set out the details of his challenge in writing to his ex-wife’s lawyers, who will then have a month to respond. She said she would decide after considering Mrs Assoun’s reply whether to grant him permission to appeal. At an earlier hearing, Mr Assoun told the court: 'I own an apartment worth £1.9 million - it doesn't mean I'm rich.' He added: 'Speculation that a turnover of £4.7 million would automatically translate to a large income for myself, because I own 50 per cent of the company, is just wrong... I already have a huge amount of debt, I don’t have any money.' Should Mr Assoun win permission to appeal, his case will be argued before three senior judges, with his wife’s lawyers in attendance.","French Yan Assoun, 44, says he's being forced to quit his New York life .

"By . Leon Watson . A homeowner has taken one of the Big Six energy giants to court and won after they repeatedly harassed and threatened him for money he didn't owe. In a David and Goliath style legal battle, people's champion Barry Payling, 62, represented himself against Npower in his second case against an energy firm in four years. He won £3,000 in total in compensation for the trouble they caused him. The 62-year-old's problem with Npower started when tenants living in his late mother’s house, which he rents out, moved out in July 2013 leaving an outstanding bill of £450. Scroll down for video . People's champion: Barry Payling, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, who was at the receiving end of a number of mistakes by energy firm Npower. He sued them and took them to the county court and won . Mr Payling, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, then began receiving letters from Npower demanding the outstanding money be paid, despite the fact the debt wasn’t his. He began receiving disconnection notices followed by demands from debt collectors. By this point Mr Payling had spent hours of time on the phone arguing his case and asked Npower to compensate him by £80 for the hassle. When the energy giant failed to meet his request Mr Payling summonsed them for approximately £450. Npower failed to turn up to represent themselves in court and Mr Payling won the case. It was Mr Payling's second court battle against a Big Six energy firm in the last four years . Npower failed to pay so in May Mr Payling instructed the sheriffs to redeem the compensation awarded to him through the courts . Mr Payling eventually recovered the compensation he was owe after The Sheriff's Office intervened . No one turned up at Northampton County . Court at the hearing in January 2014 to represent Npower so the case was . granted in Mr Payling’s favour and the firm duly paid him the £450 he . had requested in compensation. He said: 'It . all went quiet and then I popped around to my mother’s house, which was . still empty, and there was a letter from the bailiff’s demanding around . £450 owed to Npower and it said I was due to attend court on that same . day. 'I . had a big job on that day and had to cancel it to go to court. When I . arrived at Rotherham County Court I was informed the case had been . written off the previous day and the Npower had failed to inform me. 'I had lost earnings and was furious with the hassle and stress Npower were putting me through so I summonsed them for £2,500.' Once again Npower failed to turn up to represent themselves in court and Mr Payling won the case. This time Npower failed to pay so in May he instructed the sheriffs to redeem the compensation awarded to him through the courts. The enforcement officers turned up at Npower’s head offices in Wiltshire demanding the money or threatened to take equipment amounting to that sum and after further stalling the red-faced company finally coughed up. Mr Payling, who took on British Gas under similar circumstances four years ago and won £2,000 in a landmark case against them for time wasting, said: 'What is disgraceful is that they are quite happy not to turn up to these hearings and pay the compensation because they know that money will just come by increasing bills for other customers. 'They are bullies and there is nothing a bully hates more than being bullied back. I feel like, in this I have given them a bloody nose and more people should be doing the same by standing up to them. 'I studied law very briefly and was in low level local government many years ago so I have a slight grasp enough to stand up for myself in court but not much more than your average person. Following Barry Payling's court battle with British Gas in 2010, consumer experts told customers that they should keep detailed records of telephone calls made and letters sent to broadband, gas or electricity companies. If the customer is forced to spend serious amounts of time sorting out problems caused by the companies, they should attempt to bill them for loss of earnings. Mr Payling was paid more than £2,000 by British Gas after he threatened the company with court action following two years of disputes. Mr Payling was about to take the energy company to the County Court following claims they miscalculated his bills, sent debt collectors to his home for money he didn't owe and sent his mother a letter asking her to sign up with them – after she had died. He logged every phone call he made and every letter he sent to British Gas during working hours, then billed them for his loss of earnings, to demand the £2,108 sum at court. 'Npower have sent me bills for the same periods for different amounts, demanding money I didn’t owe, threatening me and harassing me. 'They are one of the most complained about companies in the country. MPs are weak about putting any sort of pressure on them to raise their standards. 'It takes people like me standing up to them because they shouldn’t get away with treating people, their customers, like this. 'Energy companies rely on people giving in but it is worth the aggravation because now, thanks to Npower and British Gas, the compensation I have received will cover my energy bills for the next few years.' A spokesman for Npower, who according to Which? Have an average of 83 complaints per 1,000 customers, said the case was not defended to avoid causing any further inconvenience. They added the company paid the money but were not aware that Mr Payling had not received it before an enforcement officer arrived. The spokesman said: 'It was thought the matter had been resolved to Mr Payling’s satisfaction, until without any notice, an enforcement officer attended our head office. 'If he had notified us that he had not received the payment it would have not been necessary for him to instruct the enforcement officer.' Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd . consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving . deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest . deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts. Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. If . you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big . chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. Prices . are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you . will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff . that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison . to find the best price.

"By . Corey Charlton . A mysterious blue lake has appeared in the parched Tunisian desert, creating a new swimming hole for hundreds of locals unconcerned about warnings the water could be contaminated or carcinogenic. The swimming hole was discovered by shepherds about three weeks ago when they stumbled across the huge beautiful blue coloured lake. But three weeks on, it is green with algae and subject to public health warnings. Despite the mystery surrounding how 'Gafsa Beach' suddenly appeared in the area, and what effect, if any, the local phosphate mining industry might have on the water quality, the huge pool has provided much needed respite for locals where temperatures are reaching 40C. Scroll down for video . The lake appeared in the Gafsa mountains area of Tunisia a few weeks ago but there has yet to be a scientific explanation given for its appearance .

Children have continued to swim in the water even though it has now turned green and despite warnings the water could be contaminated due to the local mining industry . There has been no explanation given for how the lake came to be, but some have suggested seismic activity caused groundwater to rise to the surface. Journalist Lakhdar Souid told France 24: 'News of the lake’s appearance has spread like wildfire and now hundreds of people, eager to escape a heatwave, go there to swim.' The region was 'overflowing' with large deposits of phosphate, which can leave behind radioactive residue, he said. 'There is a real risk that this water is contaminated and carcinogenic. On the first few days, the water was a clear, turquoise blue. Now, it is greenish and filled with algae, sure signs that the water is stagnant, which means it’s a perfect breeding ground for parasites and disease.' Gafsa’s Office of Public Safety has issued a public warning the lake is dangerous and unfit for swimming - but that has not stopped locals from using it as their local swimming pool.

"By . Corey Charlton . Saudi Arabian health officials are testing a patient suspected of contracting the deadly Ebola virus as fears grow the disease is starting to spread beyond west Africa. The Ebola epidemic has so far been contained to west African nations, where almost 900 people have died from more than 1600 confirmed cases. But Saudi Arabia is now testing samples from a man who recently returned from a business trip to Sierra Leone for suspected Ebola infection, the Health Ministry said. It said the man, a Saudi in his 40s, was at a hospital in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. Scroll down for video . The lifeless body of a man lies unattended in the street in Monrovia, Liberia, as locals suspect him of dying from Ebola . Health workers outside Connaught Hospital, after the arrival of a patient with symptoms of Ebola in Sierra Leone's city of Freetown . The death toll for Ebola has now reached 887, with more than 1,600 confirmed cases in what is the worst every outbreak in the history of the disease . Sierra Leone police officers hold up posters as they try to educate people about Ebola . The ministry said it had taken precautionary measures, including isolating the patient at a specialist hospital and had sent blood samples to an international laboratory in coordination with the World Health Organisation for further checks. The ministry also recently announced it will not issue visas for nationals from Ebola-struck countries for the annual Hajj pilgrimage in October. The pilgrimage involves millions of Muslims making the journey to the holy cities of Medina and Mecca in Saudi Arabia. However, officials will not be issuing Hajj visas to anyone from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia due to the Ebola outbreak and the potential for its spread during a festival in which millions travel together in close proximity. The country is already battling an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has infected hundreds in the past few months. Meanwhile, the World Bank has pledged up to $200 . million in emergency funding to help west Africa tackle the spread of . Ebola, as hopes grow an experimental new 'miracle' cure can stem the . death toll. Jim Yong Kim, . president of the World Bank, said the injection of funds would pay for . urgently needed medical supplies, salaries for staff and other vital . materials in the struggling health systems of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra .

Peter Fleckenstein, head of care personnel, wears a headset under his ventilated plastic suit so that he can communicate with his co-workers at the university hospital during a simulation exercise for a possible infection with a dangerous virus such as Ebola in Frankfurt Main, Germany . However, the . emergence of an experimental new drug given to the two U.S. Ebola . patients has raised the possibility a medical breakthrough has been made . for a disease which has no previously known cure or vaccine. News of the treatment - which has never before been used on humans - comes as the death toll . reaches 887, with more than 1,600 confirmed cases in what is the . worst outbreak in the four decade history of Ebola. The treatment, called ZMapp, is made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. of San Diego. The serum is created by infecting an animal with the disease then harvesting the antibodies the animals' bodies create to fight it off. It was reported the two U.S. aid workers, Nancy Writebol, 59, and Dr Kent Brantly, 33, used serum taken from infected mice. A source told CNN Dr Brantly's condition took a serious turn for the worse and he was quickly issued with a dose of the medication. He made a 'miraculous' improvement within the space of an hour and was able to board his plane to the U.S. the next morning. ZMapp is the experimental new drug which was administered to the two U.S. citizens who contracted Ebola. Produced by Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. of San Diego, the serum is created by infecting an animal with the disease then harvesting the animal's immune system antibodies which its body creates to fight it. It is a type of drug known as a 'monoclonal antibody', and before this use, it had only been tested on monkeys. Unfortunately, there is very little of the radical new drug available and it has not yet undergone the usual safety tests of other drugs. Times of San Diego reported a company spokesperson as saying: 'ZMapp was first identified as a drug candidate in January 2014 and has not yet been evaluated for safety in humans. As such, very little of the drug is currently available. 'Mapp and its partners are co-operating with appropriate government agencies to increase production as quickly as possible.' Remarkably, ZMapp is grown in specially modified leaves of tobacco. Mapp Biopharmaceutical has contracted a Kentucky tobacco plant to help produce the serum. The plants must be 'infected' with a type of protein, which over time, the plant goes on to reproduce itself. After a week or so, it has made enough of the protein to turn into a useable drug which can be extracted. Mrs Writebol was also given the treatment, but required a second dose before she showed signs of improvement. The $200m in World Bank funding has been earmarked to help contain Ebola and prevent the spreading to neighbouring countries. However, there are fears it is already too late. A doctor has now become the second confirmed case of Ebola in Nigeria after helping to treat a U.S. businessman who died from the disease. Authorities have been monitoring anyone who came into close contact with Patrick Sawyer, a Liberia and U.S. citizen who died of Ebola in Lagos last month shortly after arriving at the airport. The second confirmed case was a doctor who looked after him. There are now a suspected eight cases of Ebola in Nigeria, all of whom came into contact with Mr Sawyer. Health Commissioner Jide Idris also said a further six people who had made contact with Sawyer had been quarantined but were not showing symptoms. Back to the States: Ebola patient Nancy Writebol, a missionary from North Carolina, has left Liberia on a plane bound for Atlanta, Georgia . Recovering: Dr Brantly, seen here with his wife Amber, is improving at Emory University Hospital, after receiving a dose of an experimental serum . The spread of Ebola in Africa's most populous country is an alarming . setback as officials across the region battle to stop the spread of the . disease. The emergence of a . second case also raises serious concerns about the infection control . practices in Nigeria, and also raise the spectre that more cases could . emerge. It can take up to 21 . days after exposure to the virus for symptoms to appear. They include . fever, sore throat, muscle pains and headaches. Often nausea, vomiting and diarrhea follow, along with severe internal and external bleeding in advanced stages of the disease. Doctors in Nigeria had been monitoring people who cam into contact with Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian-U.S. citizen who died last month. There are now eight suspected cases . Doctors . and other health workers on the front lines of the Ebola crisis have . been among the most vulnerable to infection as they are in direct . physical contact with patients. Ms Writebol, who was volunteering as a hygenist in Ebola decontamination . units, has now landed in the U.S., where she is expected to head to Georgia's Emory University Hospital where Dr . Brantly has already been taken. The . two both contracted Ebola after working on the same medical mission . team treating victims of the virus around Monrovia, Liberia. Meanwhile, a third American has been taken into isolation at New York City's Mount Sinai hospital showing symptoms of Ebola. The . patient arrived at the hospital’s emergency room early on Monday . morning with ‘a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms,’ according to a . statement. However the Department of Health has since released a statement stating that the patient is unlikely to have the deadly disease. A leading British scientist has also claimed we may have seen the peak of the epidemic. Chris Whitty, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said Guinea had already seen the worst of the outbreak, according to The Telegraph. 'This is the largest outbreak of Ebola that so far has been recorded. The numbers are increasing in Sierra Leone but they appear to have peaked in Guinea where the epidemic first started,' he said.","Saudi Arabia health ministry confirms it is testing businessman for disease .

Briana Holland, 22, was swiftly arrested and is facing one charge of neglect of a dependent . Police at the United Technology Carrier Corporation facility on Friday evening where the boy was found . After being contacted by employees at United Technology Carrier Corporation, they arrived to find a newborn baby boy inside the company's bathroom trash can. Holland now is facing a preliminary charge of neglect after police said she gave birth to the unnamed boy at the facility and then abandoned him in the bin. Police found the baby about 8pm that evening - thought to be only an hour after he was born. Holland was arrested by detectives at 5am the following morning and taken away for processing. Police said the young boy is now in a good condition. Although he was taken to Riley Hospital for Children in a critical condition, his health has improved and he is in the care of Department of Child Services staff. The authorities were notified after staff at United Technology Carrier Corporation raised the alarm . Following the incident police reminded locals of the State of Indiana's safe-haven law. Under the law, the parent, relative or adult responsible for a child can give up custody of a baby less than 30 days old - with no questions asked - and it will be taken into the custody of social services. The goal of the law is to prevent incidents of abandonment such as that which occurred at the weekend. As long as there is no evidence of abuse, no information is required of the person leaving the baby - which they can do at hospitals, police departments and even fire departments.","Young mother arrested after newborn child found in bathroom trash can .

The girl, who is now aged 19 and cannot be named, reluctantly gave evidence against him by video link and refused to have him prosecuted. Banned: PE teacher Luke Atkinson has been banned from the classroom for life after having sex with a 17-year-old pupil in a hotel room after a night out clubbing in Doncaster . Atkinson started working at Balby Carr Community Sports College, Doncaster, in 2010 but his career was left in ruins because of his one-night stand with the girl. He was recommended for a five-year ban by a disciplinary body - . but then Education Secretary Michael Gove over-ruled it and . prohibited him from teaching indefinitely. His downfall began on a Saturday night in June 2012 when the then 23-year-old met the teenage girl in The Priory nightclub in Lazarus Court, where she was out with a group of friends. In the early hours he took her to a hotel room where they ‘engaged in sexual activity’, a misconduct hearing found. After a disciplinary hearing in November that year, following a police investigation, he was sacked from Balby Carr. The misconduct panel said the girl was a ‘very credible’ witness and found the allegation of engaging in sexual activity with her proven. Atkinson . did not attend the Professional Misconduct Panel of the National . College for Teaching and Leadership in Coventry last month and his . request for it to be heard in private was refused. They also found Atkinson guilty of failing to co-operate with the police investigation into a safeguarding matter, and attempting to mislead those responsible for investigating the incident by lying about booking into the hotel. Atkinson worked at Balby Carr Community Sports College (pictured) from 2010 until he was sacked in 2012 following a disciplinary hearing. Then Education Secretary Michael Gove imposed a lifelong teaching ban . The panel found his behaviour amounted to unacceptable professional conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute. The panel recommended a prohibition order should last for a minimum of five years because the girl had engaged willingly in sexual activity and was above the age of consent at the time and it was an isolated incident which had not been pre-planned. But Alan Meyrick, on behalf of the Education Secretary, said there was insufficient evidence that Atkinson had expressed remorse. He added: 'Although he was a young teacher at the time, his behaviour was deliberate and he would have had no doubt that it was a serious breach of the standards that are expected of a teacher. 'His behaviour is so serious that a review period is not in the public interest. 'This means that Mr Atkinson is prohibited from teaching indefinitely... and shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of his eligibility to teach.'","PE teacher Luke Atkinson banned indefinitely from the classroom for taking 17-year-old pupil back to hotel room after night out clubbing .

"By . Corey Charlton . Once bitten, twice shy, the old saying goes. It’s advice that Michelle Spencer clearly has no time for. After being left penniless and broken-hearted by a Tunisian toyboy she met online, the 51-year-old claims to have found love again. And amazingly, her new love is another young man from Tunisia ... whom she met while surfing the same Internet chatrooms. Scroll down for video . Michelle Spencer and her former husband Rami Selmi, who she spent her life savings on over two years . The divorcee says she blew £18,000 of her benefits money on toyboy No1, smooth-talking 22-year-old Rami Selmi, after he showered her with compliments online and begged her to come to his country to meet him in person. She agreed, and at the end of a two-week holiday Rami proposed. Despite warnings from her family, Miss Spencer said yes, and used her savings to arrange the wedding in Tunisia before flying home without her new husband, as he had no UK visa. As soon as she returned to Stockport in Greater Manchester, she claims, Rami started bombarding her with messages asking for money. Then, when she visited him again in Tunisia, his ardour appeared to have cooled and he insisted they sleep in separate beds. Miss Spencer, who claims incapacity benefit for depression, said she spent her entire life savings on Rami during their two-year marriage, which ended when their divorce was finalised two weeks ago. Michelle Spencer said she fell in love with 22-year-old Rami Selmi as the two got to know each other via an internet chat room . Now, however, she claims she is turning things around with the help of her new 26-year-old Tunisian boyfriend Mesbeh, saying: ‘I know he wants me for who I am.’ She added: ‘I am very happy with Mesbeh and I have definitely learned from my mistake.’ Miss Spencer’s problems began three years ago when she met Rami in an online chatroom following her divorce from her first husband of 24 years. ‘It all happened very quickly but it was a whirlwind and it felt so right,’ she said. ‘I didn’t mind spending the money at first. I was completely swept off my feet.’ Her daughter Rachel, 19, warned her she was being taken for a ride but Miss Spencer ignored the advice, saying: ‘I thought she was being silly.’ Ms Spencer with her new Tunisian love interest Mesbeh, who she talks to online for several hours each day . Her new boyfriend, 26-year-old Mesbeh, is also from Tunisia and Ms Spencer says it is true love . She added: ‘Rami would ask me for money for things like driving lessons so he could get a job. ‘I didn’t mind sending it over, because he was my husband after all, and I was sure he would treat me as soon as he got a job. ‘I feel foolish giving him the money now, but I loved him and I thought he loved me. But now I feel as though he was using me. He even disappeared to go out drinking with friends on our wedding day.’ Despite her heartbreak, Miss Spencer insisted she is not worried about the same thing happening with her new boyfriend. ‘I’ve been with Mesbeh for 19 months and it’s going really great,’ she said. ‘He is so different from Rami. Despite losing her savings on the failed marriage, Ms Spencer is happy to have found love with another Tunisian man . ‘He doesn’t ask me for money at all and we talk online for a couple of hours every day. I’ll try and go and see him again as soon as I can, but it’s hard now I have spent all my money on Rami. ‘Mesbeh is a trained sports coach so he doesn’t need my money. That’s why I know it’s love. All he will ask me for is a bottle of vodka from duty free when I come and visit him.’ Miss Spencer added: ‘My advice to anyone chatting to men online is watch out for the sweet-talkers. ‘Never send money, no matter how much they pester you. I was foolish and I don’t want anyone else to make the same mistake.’","Michelle Spencer blew £18,000 on whirlwind marriage to 22-year-old Tunisian .

"By . Corey Charlton . It is as dangerous as it is infuriating - and half of us are guilty of doing it. A new study has revealed the M1 near Leeds as the worst spot in the nation for tailgating and a remarkable 49 per cent of drivers to be driving too close to the vehicle in front. The M1 near Leeds and four different sections of the M42 have featured prominently on the top 10 list of the worst stretches of motorway for tailgating incidents. The study revealed tailgating accidents cost us up to £129 million and kill five people every year . In second and third place respectively . were a section of the M42 near Solihull, West Midlands, and the M1 near . Brent Cross in north-west London. Using traffic flow data from 6,500 . different sites, the Direct Line Insurance study identified hotspots . across the country's motorway network where tailgaters are most active . and result in the most accidents. More than 1,700 injuries on Highways . Agency roads are caused by tailgating, which is costing us £129m and claiming five lives a year. 1. M1 at A1M to J47 south - Leeds . 2. M42 J6-7 north - Solihull . 3. M1 within J1 north - Brent Cross, London . 4. A1M J51-50 south - Leeming, North Yorkshire . 5. M27 J7-5 west - Southampton . 6. M42 J6-5 south - Solihull . 7. M42 J4-3A south - Solihull/Redditch . 8. M42 J7-6 south - Birmingham . 9. A627M between start & J1 north - Oldham/Rochdale . 10. M11 within J9 north - Bishops Stortford/Cambridge . The M42 takes four places on the top 10 list - with three sections near Solihull and one near Birmingham featuring on it. It's recommended drivers keep a . two-second gap between themselves and the vehicle in front. At a speed . of 70mph, a two-second gap would equate to a distance of 62 metres. Rob Miles, director of car insurance at Direct Line, said: 'All drivers have a responsibility to keep a safe distance between their vehicle and others on the road. 'Tailgating is extremely dangerous and also against the law, regardless of whether it’s done intentionally or in ignorance. 'Often people can find themselves too close to other vehicles on motorways as they rush to their destination or try to keep up with traffic flow. 'We’d urge drivers to keep their stopping distances in mind, as these are often forgotten in times of haste or frustration. 'Drivers should aim to always have at least a two-second gap – over 60 metres - between themselves and the car in front to keep safe on the motorway and avoid facing the on-the-spot fines for tailgating that were introduced last year.' The M1 near Leeds is the nation's worst spot for tailgating and accidents involving vehicles travelling too close . In second place on the list was the M42 near Solihull. It was the first of four times the M42 featured on the list . In third place came the M1 again, with tailgating incidents very common near Brent Cross, north-west London . In August last year police clamped down on tailgating offending as part of a campaign targeting 'inconsiderate driving'. New £100 spot fines were introduced to deal with the offence of 'careless driving' while police targeted those spotted tailgating, hogging the middle and outside motorway lanes or purposely driving on kerbs. The new instant fine method of dealing with the offences is thought to be snaring about 200 motorists a week.","Revealed: The nation's top 10 worst stretches of motorway for tailgating .

"By . Leon Watson . A group of gypsies have won the right to a 'fixed abode' on a council-owned football pitch because one of them is having a baby. The court ruling came after the travellers argued they should stay because by law a woman needs a fixed address for her newborn child. It means the travellers can stay at playing fields, in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, for another two weeks, leaving a local football team unable to kick off the new season. Legal battle: Travellers who set up camp on these council-owned playing fields in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, argued they should stay because by law a woman needs a fixed address for her newborn child . But with two other women living on the playing fields also expecting babies there are fears it could be some time before the team get their pitch back. Today residents and politicians today hit out at the ruling which was slammed as 'ridiculous'. The travellers set up camp on the car park and playing fields 10 days ago. It is the fourth time in the last 12 months they illegally moved on to the land. Residents had been expecting the gypsies to be kicked off Birchenwood playing fields, in Kidsgrove, today after Newcastle Borough Council launched eviction proceedings. But they have been stunned to find out the gypsies can stay for longer - because one of the travelling community is due to give birth at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. Now a judge sitting at Stoke-on-Trent County Court has ruled the gypsies can remain on the car park and playing fields until 7pm on Sunday, August 10. Not moving on: Residents are furious as they had hoped the travellers would be kicked off the land which they have occupied four times in 12 months . Youth football teams which run from ages six to 18 have been unable to do pre-season training on the fields as the travellers have been there for the last 10 days . Borough council leader Mike Stubbs criticised the court ruling and asked why some of the 20 caravans unconnected to the pregnant woman could not be shifted. He said: 'This is ridiculous, but the law is the law.' It is not yet known how much the court action and the clean-up of the area will cost taxpayers. Mr Stubbs explained: 'The travellers have been able to block our application to the court using something called a social contract. Residents had been expecting the gypsies to be kicked off Birchenwood playing fields, in Kidsgrove, today . A judge sitting at Stoke-on-Trent County Court has ruled the gypsies can remain on the car park and playing fields until 7pm on Sunday, August 10 . 'Three of the women on that site are pregnant, and one of them is due to go in for a caesarean, so by law she has to have somewhere to go to for the first two weeks after having the baby which means the travellers cannot be moved yet. 'The judge said the earliest he was willing to allow us to move them on was at 7pm on August 10 and we have now served the order for that date. Councillor Mike Stubbs criticised the court ruling and asked why some of the 20 caravans unconnected to the pregnant woman could not be shifted . 'We have done everything we can to move these people on and I am disappointed with the outcome. 'I am unhappy that none of the group has been moved on because of one member.' Kidsgrove Borough and Town councillor Terry Turner said: 'I can understand that the lady who is pregnant may need medical attention and that she should be able to stay for a while longer, but I don’t know why all 20-odd caravans should be allowed to stay too. 'It beggars belief and causes lots of problems. 'It means the residents have to put up with the caravans for another two weeks and the Ladsanddads teams using the field can’t get back to normal in terms of football. 'It’s not fair on anyone. The people of Kidsgrove have not been taken into consideration. There are loads of gypsies all spread out on the park.' Council officials are now considering measures to try to stop the gypsies getting back on the site. Sharon Boote, 53, said: 'The council could have done more to stop them coming onto the park. They should put in height restriction barriers to stop any more caravans coming on in the future. 'During the school holidays the park is full of children playing and people walking dogs, but nobody feels safe going through there anymore.' Another local Kevin Spruce, 57, said: 'The gypsies can’t just be allowed to go on to public land, it’s not fair on the residents.' It is the fourth time travellers have set up camp at the site off Mount Road in the town in the last year. A council spokesman said: 'The court has given us a possession order which comes into effect at 7pm on August 10. 'The travellers have been informed. Following the vacation of the site a clean-up exercise will take place.' In January 2013, a group of travellers in Aberdeen stayed at a site in the city after successfully arguing that one of them was heavily pregnant. They were told they had to vacate Calder Park by February 25 before an eviction notice was served on them in March that year.","Court ruling means travellers can stay at Kidsgrove, Staffordshire .

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Associated Press . Snap unhappy: Eric Stonestreet refused to have his picture taken with Republican Rick Santorum . Modern Family star Eric Stonestreet revealed that he refused to have his picture taken with Rick Santorum because of the Republican’s views on gay marriage. Stonestreet, who plays gay character Cam on the hit sitcom, said that the politician wanted to pose with him at a White House Correspondents Dinner. However, Stonestreet, who is heterosexual, said that he refused. He told Huff Post Live: ‘Rick Santorum wanted a picture with me. It was at a time when he was publicly saying, “Gay marriage, gay marriage [is wrong],” and I'm like, “You know, I can't do it.” It was with him and his kids or something like that, and I said, “I'd be happy to take a picture with the kids, but I can't just be in a picture with [Santorum].”’ He added in the interview that he had read about President Barack Obama and his family being fans of the show. He said: ‘To hear the leader of the free world, the president of the United States, say that and to know we have that sort of reach with people and that the people in power and leadership are watching the show [is incredible].’ Mr Santorum has received criticism in the past for suggesting that same-sex marriage could harm children. He said: ‘Every society in the history of man has upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. Why? Because society is based on one thing: that society is based on the future of the society. And that's what? Children. Monogamous relationships. Scroll down for video .

'In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality.' Earlier Mr Stonestreet predicts that one day, it's not going to take an act of courage for an openly gay person to play in the NFL. ‘It's going to be considered common. It's not going to feel taboo, and people are not going to feel they need to be closeted or keep their sexuality a secret because of other people's opinions,’ Stonestreet told The Associated Press.","Eric Stonestreet said that Rick Santorum wanted to pose in a photo with him .

"By . Corey Charlton . This swallow 'choir' pictured during feeding time certainly look as if they're singing for their supper. Lined up on an old barn door in Merseyside, wildlife photographer Steve Ward captured the chicks bursting into life as their mum returned with food. It took Mr Ward three hours before he managed to photograph the great summer scene, but he said he left knowing he had some great shots and 'memories to cherish forever'. The quartet of chicks realised the birds in the centre of the group were more likely to get fed first by their mother, so they edged closer and closer together . The moment the 'choir' of swallow chicks burst into song as the moment their mother returned with food was captured on camera by the patient photographer . The group of swallows look rather grumpy as they sit patiently waiting for their mother to bring them their food . The group appeared on the old barn door entrance in Merseyside three hours after Steve Ward arrived to try and photographed them as they fed . Mr Ward, 35, from Crosby first saw the delightful birds as he drove home through the village. He said: 'I spotted these whilst driving home from work one day through Little Crosby Village. 'They were all lined up on an old barn door entrance that was blocked up with a fence panel to keep trespassers out. But these little intruders must have been reared in the barn and were now able to fly down on to the doorway to be fed by mum. 'At the time I never had my camera and knowing they would soon be fledging I went back the next day and after an early 6am start the birds appeared after three hours of waiting. 'They would line up at first slightly apart, then would realise that mum kept feeding the birds located in the middle of the doorway. Slowly but surely they would shuffle tight together in the hope that mum would pick them when she flew in with some insects and flies. Mr Ward said the chicks had him in 'hysterics' as they all sat silently waiting for their mother to return before bursting into life when she arrived . Despite the 6am start and long wait for the birds to appear at the doorway, Mr Ward said he left the site a 'happy man' knowing he had taken some remarkable photographs . 'They looked so cute and very alert to all the small flies going past the doorway and mother flying past regularly. 'Their little heads were bobbing around like puppets on string waiting for a meal. 'They had me in hysterics as they would sit patiently all relaxed with their mouths shut. 'As mum approached they all went crazy. It was like they were all shouting ""me, me"".' 'They flapped their wings and stood up on their legs screaming with their beaks wide open hoping for mum to pop some grub in.' The father-of-three said there were dfficult shots to get as the doorway was shaded and the light was bad. 'On top of that, mum would be in and out with food in less than a second. I was shooting 12 frames per second on my camera to stand any chance of such images. 'In the end I left a happy man knowing I had captured some great shots and memories to cherish forever.'","Group of swallow chicks photographed waiting in 'choir' formation for their meal at Little Crosby Village, Merseyside .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Police who arrested a suspected schoolgirl psychopath on suspicion that she cut off the head of a friend discovered that the alleged killer had been practising by cutting off animal's heads. The 16-year-old schoolgirl had even told her father and stepmother that she planned to kill someone after getting bored of torturing animals, yet when her desperate parents tried to raise the alarm they were told there was no room for any more patients in the psychiatric hospital, and advised them to call back again in a week. The schoolgirl, not named for legal reasons, had also attacked her father with a baseball bat before allegedly attacking and severing the head of fellow student Aiwa Matsuo, 15, in the western Japanese city of Sasebo. Victim: Police said Aiwa Matsuko was killed during a visit to the accused schoolgirl's apartment . After the attacks on animals - and on him - the suspect’s father had rented a small flat for his daughter where she lived alone and apparently carried on with her animal torturing tactics. He had re-married about three months ago, after the girl's mother died of cancer last year, and is believed to have given cash to his daughter so that she could get by on her own after he failed to get her admitted to a psychiatric institution. The rejection was made despite the fact that she had told her parents that she ""wanted to dissect someone"". Scroll down for video . Suspect: A van carrying a schoolgirl - who was arrested on suspicion of killing a school friend at her home - leaves a police station for the prosecutor's office in Sasebo in Nagasaki prefecture . Crime scene: Police seal off the apartment building in Sasebo where the teenager was killed. The horrific crime came to light after Aiwa Matsuo's parents contacted police to say their daughter had not returned home . Details: A teacher at the school which both the victim and suspect attended tells assembled media about the staff's response to the grisly murder following an emergency meeting . Location: Both the victim and the suspect attended this school in the small town of Sasebo. The murder  comes just 10 years after Sasebo was rocked by a primary school girl being stabbed to death by a classmate . A day before the incident, her parents consulted with a psychiatrist and tried to get the girl hospitalised but the request was turned down due to lack of space at the facility. The father then called a local child welfare office, but a security guard told him to telephone back after the weekend. But before he could do that, the murder had been carried out. After the alarm had been raised, police who went to the high school girl's apartment in Sasebo, 900 miles south west of Tokyo, found the bedroom soaked in blood, with the decapitated body of her friend lying on the bed. A police investigator told the AFP news agency that the accused admitted to strangling the victim before severing her head and left hand 'using tools... and something like a cord'. Police alleged that the suspect struck Matsuo on the back of the head more than 10 times with a blunt instrument and while she was unconscious strangled her. Then as a final act, it is alleged, the suspect cut off Matsuo's head and her left hand with a large knife. The horrific crime came to light after Matsuo's parents contacted police to say their daughter had not returned home. Police said Matsuo had earlier sent a message to her parents to say she was going to visit her friend at her apartment - then later sent her parents a text at around 7pm to say she was about to leave for home. 'She has not provided us with a motive for the attack at the moment,' said a police spokesman.

"By . Corey Charlton . Angry residents this week accused TV producers of inciting racial hatred as they met to discuss filming of a documentary on immigration in their road. Residents of the Derby Road area in Southampton came face to face with the Love Productions crew and vented their anger about the show called Immigration Street. The programme is billed as a follow on from Channel 4's controversial Benefits Street which aired earlier this year and sparked a nationwide debate about welfare in Britain. Last night, furious residents with banners and placards heckled creative director Kieran Smith, telling him: 'We don't want you here'. The creators of the controversial show Benefits Street are currently filming a follow up series called Immigration Street in Southampton, which has angered locals who say it is placing a 'stigma' on the community . The show has provoked a furious backlash from locals - who last night called for the show to be cancelled . Residents then accused Mr Smith and the production company of ‘inciting racism’ by calling the programme Immigration Street. He failed to win over the public at the tempestuous meeting, held at Maytree Primary School on the street, and was interrupted regularly. From the outset, audience members turned up with banners reading ‘Go Away Love Productions, We Don’t Want You Filming Here’. One furious resident said: 'Do you realise the stigma that you are bringing on a community? For you it’s a six-to-eight-week project - for us it will go on for a generation. Do you appreciate that?' Filming has been taking place over the last few months, with the production company saying the show will ‘reflect the honest experiences of people who have settled in the UK and [have] come to consider it as home’. Local Kate Gladders said she saw people being filmed outside the centre and one of them had ‘quite distinctive National Front markings’. Derby Road, Southampton, where the show is based and filming has taken place for the past few months . More than 200 locals attended the meeting last night and TV show producers were routinely heckled and booed . She said: 'I personally think you chose that particular person because you wanted to incite some racial disharmony in the community.' But Mr Smith responded: 'We are not cherry-picking vulnerable individuals and we are not here to cause racial tension.' Derby Road was picked by Love Productions to be the focus of the programme, which is due to be aired on Channel 4 next year. Kieran Smith, creative director for Love Productions, told the audience the show's name conveyed the message it was an area 'transformed' by immigration over several decades . Mr Smith said the name, which is still a working title, conveyed the message that the street had been ‘transformed’ by immigration over several generations. Any resident who was filmed would have a chance to see the footage before it was used, and he denied residents were offered cash to take part. Several times, he was asked what it would take for the company to decide not to continue filming the programme. But Mr Smith said he was not in a position to cancel the programme or make changes as it would be a joint decision between Love Productions and Channel 4. He said: 'What we wanted to do with this series is find a street and we found Derby Road in an area which over the years has been transformed by immigration. 'What we’re not doing is saying that everyone who lives in it is an immigrant. 'What we wanted to do was to observe and reflect who lives in one street.' Southampton Test MP Alan Whitehead was one of the politicians who had urged Love Productions to stay away when the plans were first announced. He addressed the meeting, organised by Newtown Residents’ Association, and urged Love Productions to think again. Speaking afterwards, he said: 'I think the meeting showed that this company has picked the wrong community. 'Residents have said they want nothing to do with this and they really ought to listen to that.' Two senior Labour city councillors - Jacqui Rayment and Satvir Kaur - also addressed Mr Smith at the meeting and urged him to listen to the residents. Before the meeting, residents living on Derby Road and the surrounding community said the show would evoke national emotions. Skip Bawa, 58, a social worker from Northam Road, said: 'This is a multicultural community that has a lot of culture, passion and harmony. 'This would evoke all sorts of emotions nationally and bring up the old chestnut of immigrants coming to our country and taking our jobs and houses.' Dil Bhakar, 34, a marketing consultant from Derby Road, added: “I think it’s really disgusting. It’s not a true representation of what the local community is about and it is just a commercial move to get more viewers. It should be stopped.' A local speaking at last night's meeting. Many who attended voiced strong opposition to the show . Mr Smith told MailOnline he was invited to the meeting but there had been a gathering before that and he felt 'people had been a bit whipped up to not really listen'. He also completely rejected claims the show was inciting racial disharmony. Immigration Street is not the first Love Productions show to attract controversy. Its predecessor Benefits Street was a five part series first aired in January 2014 which provoked hundreds of complaints to police, broadcast watchdog Ofcom, and Channel 4. Among them were claims it portrayed criminal activities, foul language and misleading portrayals of those on benefits. Some critics labelled it ‘poverty porn’ and said it painted a false picture of life in modern Britain. Those starring in the series, including single mother White Dee (real name Deirdre Kelly), were also subjected to death threats by Twitter trolls. The show even attracted fierce political debate and was the subject of the Prime Minister's Questions in early January. Channel 4 was criticised for demonising those living on the breadline, while some of the residents claim they were misled into appearing. 'I genuinely don't understand that. One, why would we even want to do that, and two, how would we ever be allowed to do that? 'There are places in the country that if that was our intention we could have filmed a neighbourhood a lot less harmonious, a lot less cohesive. 'It just seemed that a lot of people weren't prepared to listen to that so really our hope is that people will start to listen.' He said production for the TV show will continue. He added: 'My hope that the misinformation that is out there can be corrected and that was the hope of the meeting last night. That we can try again.' Channel 4 is screening the show sometime next year and a spokesperson said claims of racism were 'pure fiction'. 'We understand immigration is a much debated issue which is why Channel 4, as a public service broadcaster has a duty to explore it and not shy away from difficult subject such as this. 'Anyone who does not want to be in the series won’t be but we intend to continue to film with residents who are very happy to share their experience of living on Derby Road.'","Filming currently underway in Southampton for follow up to Benefits Street .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A senior Japanese scientist embroiled in a stem-cell research scandal died on Tuesday in an apparent suicide, police said. Yoshiki Sasai, who supervised and co-authored stem-cell research papers that had to be retracted due to falsified contents, was found suffering from cardiac arrest at the government-affiliated science institute Riken in Kobe, in western Japan, according to Hyogo prefectural police. Sasai, 52, was deputy chief of Riken's Center for Developmental Biology. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Yoshiki Sasai, who was embroiled in a stem-cell scandal, committed suicide and was found with a rope around his neck at his place of work . A security guard found him with a rope around his neck, according to Riken. Sasai was rushed to a hospital, but was pronounced dead two hours later. Police and Riken said Sasai left what appeared to be suicide notes, but refused to disclose their contents. Riken spokesman Satoru Kagaya told a news conference that Sasai had three letters with him, each addressed to Haruko Obokata, a co-author of the research papers, as well as senior members of Riken and fellow researchers. Two other notes addressed to Riken officials were on Sasai's secretary's desk. Sasai's health had deteriorated over the past few months, and he had been receiving medical treatment. Kagaya said that Sasai started looking depressed in May, and that the two had hardly seen each other recently. In this January 28, 2014 picture, Yoshiki Sasai, right, and biologist Haruko Obokata, a unit team leader of RIKEN, pose for photos in Kobe after a talk they'd given . Influential: Sasai, 52, was deputy chief of Riken's Center for Developmental Biology (Riken's Kobe office pictured) 'He seemed exhausted. I could tell he was tired even on the phone,' Kagaya said, referring to one of his last conversations with Sasai. Sasai's team retracted the research papers from the British science journal Nature over Obokata's alleged malpractice, which she has contested. Retractions of papers in major scientific journals are extremely rare, and the scandal was a major embarrassment to Japanese scientific research. Obokata was in shock when she heard the news of Sasai's death, Kagaya said. Obokata has been in and out of the hospital since the scandal due to her mental condition, and Riken has arranged a team of medical staff and colleagues to give her support, while monitoring her around the clock, he said. In two papers published in Nature earlier this year, the researchers reported that they successfully transformed ordinary mouse cells into versatile stem cells by exposing them to a mildly acidic environment. Scientists hope to harness stem cells to grow replacement tissue for treating a variety of diseases. Riken later held Obokata, a main author of the research, responsible for falsifying data. The investigation also focused on Sasai and two other employees, though the three were not accused of research misconduct. Sasai had said he was 'deeply ashamed' over the problems with the papers.","Yoshiki Sasai, who was embroiled in a stem-cell scandal, committed suicide .

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Associated Press . Angela Merkel has ordered its intelligence service to spy on the U.S and Britain for the first time since 1945, according to reports. The move will see Germany’s equivalent of MI5, the BND, monitor British and American spying operations on its soil. The move is thought to be a response to the discovery earlier this month of two alleged U.S. spies in Germany and revelations that the U.S. National Security Agency was conducting mass surveillance of German citizens and eavesdropping on Merkel's cellphone. Scroll down for video . On the look-out: Angela Merkel has ordered its intelligence service to spy on the U.S and Britain for the first time since 1945 . After 1945 West Germany had a policy of turning a blind eye to the spying activities of America and Britain. Pictured is the United States embassy (right)  in front of the Reichstag building in Berlin . A government source told Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper: ‘We need to send a strong signal.’ After the defeat of the Nazis and the end of World War II in 1945, the new authorities of West Germany adopted a policy of turning a blind eye to the intelligence activities of some of the victors, namely the U.S., Britain and France. In response to the discovery of the U.S spies Merkel demanded the departure of the CIA station chief in Berlin. This week President Barack Obama dispatched two senior advisers to Germany in an apparent effort to soothe tensions following the new allegations. The White House says chief of staff Denis McDonough and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco are in Berlin for meetings with their German counterparts. The White House says intelligence and security matters were in the agenda. Spying game: The CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, shown during the BBC's Spies R Us series . This week President Barack Obama dispatched two senior advisers to Germany in an apparent effort to soothe tensions following new spying allegations . The White House says the U.S. and Germany agreed to set up a dialogue to address intelligence concerns on both sides. 'Trust can only be restored through talks and certain agreements,' Merkel said. 'We will seek out such talks, though I can't announce anything concrete right now.' Merkel, who grew up in communist East Germany where state surveillance was a fact of life, said her administration and that of U.S. President Barack Obama have 'different positions on what's needed to guarantee security and at the same time protect personal data.' While the Obama administration has remained largely silent, U.S. commentators have defended the need to spy on even close allies such as Germany, citing the country's close links to Russia and fact that several members of the 9/11 terror cell lived in Hamburg before the attacks. Despite the spy row, Merkel insisted that Germany and the U.S. remain close partners 'and nothing about this will change.' Merkel dismissed the idea that her government would allow Edward Snowden, the NSA contractor whose leaks sparked a worldwide flurry of reports on U.S. spy activity, to come to Germany. 'We learned things (from him) that we didn't know before, and that's always interesting,' she said of Snowden's revelations, but added, 'granting asylum isn't an act of gratitude.' Earlier a top White House official pledged that the CIA will no longer use vaccination programs as cover for spying operations. The agency used the ruse in targeting Osama bin Laden before the U.S. raid that killed him in 2011. Lisa Monaco, President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, wrote to the deans of 13 prominent public health schools, saying the CIA has agreed it would no longer use vaccination programs or workers for intelligence purposes. The agency also agreed to not use genetic materials obtained through such programs.","The move will see Germany's MI5 monitor British and American spying .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A five-year-old boy who's been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor who asked for just cards for his sixth birthday, which is today, has been sent 15,000 of them from well-wishers. Danny Nickerson was diagnosed with a tumor last October. According to ABC News, doctors say that less than 10 per cent of children with the disease, called Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glimoma, live longer than 18 months. Since he had to drop out of kindergarten, Danny's mother says he occasionally feels lonely - but he gets really excited to receive cards with his name on them. Cruel: Danny Nickerson was diagnosed with a tumor last October . Sitting on top of the world! Mail started pouring in days before Danny's sixth birthday . Happy days: Danny's mother says he loves seeing cards with his name on them . Carley Nickerson says her son can identify his name, and when he saw it on packages at Easter, 'he was so happy.' The Easter presents he received were from Magical Fairy Missions, an organization that sends mailings to children with brain tumors, as well as their siblings. At this point, Danny is getting chemotherapy every two weeks, and despite the 18-month outlook, his mother remains optimistic. 'I don't really believe in that. He is doing great,' she said. 'Every day is a blessing.' The Nickersons lives in Foxboro, a small town about 22 miles south of Boston. Besides Danny, Carley and Dan Nickerson have one other son, Matthew, who's four years old. According to the Danny's Warriors Facebook page, an account Mrs Nickerson created to keep everyone updated on her son's progress, Danny was first diagnosed after he complained of having double vision. Pushing the envelope: One well-wisher sent a gigantic birthday card to Danny . Envelopes in every color! Carley Nickerson said some of the mail Danny's received have made him 'laugh very hard' Cards and more cards! Danny has received thousands of cards from well wishers . Little hero: Danny Nickerson, wearing his Superman shirt, was diagnosed with a chemotherapy-resistant form of cancer in October 2013 . Over the course of four days, Danny saw multiple doctors before finally getting an MRI. 'After the MRI, we were taken into a small room and given the worst news we have ever heard,' Mrs Nickerson said. 'Our lives fell apart, my heart felt like it exploded. There were no words to explain the pain that instantly hit my chest.' 'We are shocked and speechless,' Mrs Nickerson says of all the cards they've received. 'We opened about 200 of them... and he loved seeing them! One had a picture of a fat cat on it and another with a cat blowing out candles and he laughed so hard.' Besides sending cards, there's another way to help Danny: His family has started a fundraising page on GoFundMe to help pay for his medical expenses. Of the $15,000 the family was seeking, they've already raised $20,247 at the time of this article's publishing. Let's shower him with cards!

"By . Ted Thornhill . Chinese police are looking for a father who allowed his son, aged three, to drive along what appears to be a motorway. Not only did he make illegal turns, but at one point he heads the wrong way against what should have been oncoming traffic. Video footage of the risky move quickly became one of the most popular shared items on Chinese social media sites. Scroll down for video . Risky: A Chinese father let his son, aged just three, drive down a motorway in Beijing . Many commented that the lack of traffic on the road meant that it might well have been somewhere that had been recently built and was not yet in operation. However, it was later identified by other users as being a section of motorway outside the capital, Beijing, which was open to traffic but meant for a business park and industrial complex that had not been built yet. It therefore had very little traffic, they said. Dangerous: Local police said the stunt put the lives of other road users at risk . The six-minute long clip includes comments from the father about how proud he is of the three-year-old boy . The clip was posted anonymously, although police suspect it was the father who uploaded it . Local police declined to comment but said that allowing a child to drive on a public road was an offence for which the car owner risked a jail term, as it put the lives of others at risk. The six-minute long clip includes comments from the father about how proud he is of the three-year-old boy. From what he says it is clear that he videoed it for later internet publication, telling the boy to say hello to the people that would be watching. The clip was posted anonymously, although police suspect it was the father who uploaded it. Although the father comments on the video that the lack of traffic makes what his son is doing legal, it is still illegal for a child to drive on a public road.","Video footage has emerged of a boy aged just three driving a car in Beijing .

But after the baby was born she was told that not only was the child suffering from Down's syndrome, but also that the baby had a congenital heart problem that meant it was unlikely to survive for long. She said: ‘I visited many hospitals but no one could help me. Then suddenly we found that my husband had packed his bags in the night and left without saying a word, and without any income we ended up homeless.’ Unable to see a way out, she took the baby, not yet a year old, and carried it out into the river.

She also told the site: ‘I wasn't speeding, I was qualifying.’ Ms Palin, 50, was reportedly fined $154. On Saturday GOP vice presidential candidate Palin blasted President Barack Obama and demanded his removal from office. The tea party speaking-circuit darling said at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver, Colorado that talk of impeachment 'has got him nervous.' Condemning the White House's response to a swarm of illegal immigrants cascading across the U.S.-Mexico border, she accused Obama of 'not defending [America's] borders and called it a 'dereliction of duty, violating the oath of office.'

"By . Ted Thornhill . A Chinese woman's attempt to visit her parents to show off her new car failed miserably after she mixed up the accelerator and brake pedal while parking – and demolished not just her car but part of her parents' house as well. Ye Chia, 29, who had passed her test last December, had not bothered to drive again until buying a brand new car this summer and packing in her husband and two daughters, aged seven and three, for a trip back home to see her parents. The trip to the house in Gaoli village in the city of Wenzhou in east China’s Zhejiang province had gone well, until the proud daughter drove into the front garden where instead of using the brake, in her excitement at being home again she pressed the accelerator. Wrecked: A Chinese woman drove her brand new car into her parents' house . Mistake: It's thought that the woman accidentally stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake . As a result the car drove at high speed into the house. She told local TV: 'I felt the impact of the car hitting the house and the airbags went off, then I heard a cracking sound and tons of rubble fell on the car as well. I thought we were going to die.' The woman's mother Jun Hsiao, 56, said: 'I know that it's a disaster that the house and the car were destroyed, but we are only happy that our daughter and family got out unharmed.' Proud: The daughter had wanted to show off her new car, but ended up ruining it . Collapse: The rooms that had been destroyed were bedrooms belonging to the woman's mother and brother . Police spokesman On Chang said: 'The house was 40 years old and was not in the best condition but probably would have been good for a few more years if it hadn't been hit at speed by the car. The accident was caused by the woman's driving skills – after passing her test she hadn't bothered to practice again and got confused presumably in the excitement of arriving home. Fortunately nobody was in the house when it collapsed, so nobody was hurt.' He said that the accident happened in the late afternoon, and the rooms that had been destroyed were bedrooms belonging to the woman's mother and brother. Ye Chia is reportedly now arguing with the insurance company after they refused to provide her with a replacement hire car for the return journey.","Ye Chia, 29, drove her new car to her parents' house to show it off .

"By . Associated Press . and Ted Thornhill . A man suspected of shooting two South Texas police officers during a three-hour-long standoff Tuesday night is 'presumed dead' after officers raided the house in which he had barricaded himself and exchanged gunfire with him, authorities said. Joaquin Cibrian, 29, a capital murder suspect, had been spraying bullets toward officers who were outside the house in the Rio Grande Valley town of La Joya. The man was silenced just after 8pm on Tuesday evening after officers rammed the front door with an armoured vehicle, inserted tear gas and exchanged fire, Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra said. A Hidalgo County Sheriff points a rifle from the top of an armored vehicle Tuesday during a standoff with a capitol murder suspect in La Joya, Texas . Law enforcement officers secure a neighborhood during the standoff . Suspect: Gang member Cibrian, 29, fought with officers in La Joya, but is now 'presumed dead' The man is 'presumed dead,' but that won't be confirmed until a bomb squad establishes that the house is not booby-trapped with explosives, as the man had suggested it would be, Guerra said. The ordeal began about 4:45pm on Tuesday when a vehicle matching the description of one related to the killing of a 19-year-old Mexican national in Edinburg was sighted, Edinburg Police Chief Rolando Castaneda said. The 19-year-old was found shot in the back of the head behind a vacant home in Edinburg last weekend. Edinburg police responded and joined other agencies that had already tracked the vehicle to a La Joya home. 'As our officers were getting out of the car, the suspect ... opened up on our officers,' Castaneda said. 'One of my officers was shot in the arm. The other officer was shot in both legs and possibly a third time. He's in surgery right now. They're all doing fine. 'Arriving officers were able to rescue the two officers, throw them in their patrol car while under gunfire the whole time,' Castaneda said. 'Those officers were heroes.' Armored vehicles were brought in to extract responding officers who were pinned behind their cars by gunfire, said Guerra. Such was the danger posed by the suspect that nearby residents were ordered to evacuate their homes. Negotiators were called in and made contact with the shooter. Guerra identified him only as the capital murder suspect on the day, but Police had earlier named Cibrian as the suspect.

The man told the negotiators he was ready to surrender. 'However, as he opened the door, he immediately engaged our personnel that were waiting to make the arrest,' Guerra said. 'He was contacted again, and he made arrangements to surrender again,' Guerra said. 'At that point, again, he engaged our officers with multiple shots. ... We decided that he was not going to give up, so we deployed an armored vehicle and rammed the front door and injected tear gas. At that point he came out firing.' A law enforcement officer moves toward shots fired in La Joya . Officers returned fire, and the suspect was presumed dead, Guerra said. The bomb squad was checking the scene late Tuesday.

The woman is alleged to have stolen items from the store, at the Westfield Santa Anita mall, on the evening of June 29 and put them in her purse. However, she was confronted by a Macy’s loss prevention officer before she could leave. Bizarre: A suspected female shoplifter fled a Macy's (pictured) in the San Gabriel valley topless after a struggle with one of the store's loss prevention officers . A struggle then ensued in which she hit the officer several times and lost her clothing. A police officer told CBS Los Angeles: ‘During the altercation, the suspect’s shirt and bra came off.’ The woman, 44, is described as being of Asian origin, but hasn’t been named yet. The officer added: ‘[The woman] ran to her car topless and left behind her purse containing her driver’s license.’ Wanted: Police said the woman was 44 years old and left her licence behind, but she hasn't been named yet . A witness saw her driving away in a white Mercedes and took note of the licence plate number. Earlier this month footage has emerged of Arkansas officers pursuing and arresting a naked female who was running through a parking lot. On the evening of July 1 police in Fayetteville received a call from a member of public who said that a naked woman ‘intoxicated on drugs and “tripping balls”’ was running around the town center. Two squad cars were dispatched, with the woman in question, later named as 21-year-old Melissa Valencia, filmed on an in-car camera. At the start of the footage she is seen running away from the police units and an officer giving chase on foot. The clip then shows her struggling with officers as they try to arrest her.

"By . Ted Thornhill . A Star Wars mad Canadian may have taken the title of greatest ever father after building his son a Lego Boba Fett suit. By using the mini Lego figurine as a source of inspiration, costume king, Keith Sheppard, 41, from Ontario, has been able to replicate the iconic character with incredible accuracy. The graphic designer has spent over 100 hours building the child-sized bounty hunter for his Star Wars mad son, Caillen, seven. At a convention far, far away... Keith Sheppard with his amazing Boba Fett costume . May the force be with him: Caillen Sheppard shows off the Boba Fett costume without the helmet . And it’s no surprise that the fantastic suit took first place at this year’s Burlington Toycon convention in Ontario. Both huge fans of the Star Wars series and the Lego brand, Mr Sheppard has previously made two other Lego mini figure designs for his son, learning and perfecting his craft with each attempt. Constructed using using Sintra, a lightweight but rigid PVC material, Mr Sheppard was able to construct the torso, hands, jetpack, antenna, legs and most of the helmet. While inside the helmet, Mr Sheppard used pink insulation foam board to carve the dome shape and a closed cell foam called Plastazote to carve the rocket tips and exhausts found on the jetpack. Out of this world: The Boba Fett suit took first place at this year's Burlington Toycon convention in Ontario . But it's the attention to detail that really makes the suit something special. Not only was the costume spray painted and clear coated but Mr Sheppard even printed vinyl adhesives to copy the graphics on the tiny toy. If that isn't enough, both the antenna and jetpack are in fact removable, just like the Lego version of the cult character, giving his son, Caillen, a welcome break from the full weight of the suit and turning him into a real living, breathing Lego Boba Fett. However, Mr Sheppard has an even more ambitious idea in the pipeline and hopes to create a Star Wars Lego mini figure costume of a character that has not even yet been built by Lego. Mr Sheppard said: ‘I've been a fan of Star Wars for 35 years and never made a Star Wars costume until now, If I hadn't a child, perhaps I would still be saying the same thing. The real deal: Jeremy Bulloch as bounty hunter Boba Fett in the 1980 hit film Star Wars . ‘I've turned my attention from sculpting my own work to making costumes for him. We love the Star Wars Lego culture and Boba Fett is a great character to recreate. ‘Every Imperial figure would be awesome to build, but Boba Fett is so lush with colour, and has details that are both challenging and visually appealing. ‘Making a Star Wars costume for a child is cool - children are the perfect dimensions to bring the mini figure to life. ‘Caillen has an extensive Lego collection that includes among others, Star Wars. His love for the movies, characters and mini figures sort of rebooted my passion for both the Star Wars fan culture and the Lego brand. ‘I think the mini figure is reflected in a child. They share an innocence and playfulness and I believe that's why people react so positively to these types of costumes. ‘Considering this costume was both Star Wars and Lego, I was confident that it would be well received by fans of both communities. However, I never anticipated the costume going viral. ‘My partner is very supportive of my projects and loves the results. However, she's not a fan of both the mental and environmental chaos they create. Ultimately, she knows why I do it, for my son, and that makes her happy.’","Graphic designer Keith Sheppard from Ontario created a Lego Boba Fett .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Accused: Pedro 'Pastor Pete' Custodio is alleged to have sexually assaulted three women in the Florida homeless shelter he owns and operates . A Florida pastor has been charged with sexually assaulting three females who used a shelter known as Our Father’s House of Refuge that he set up to help homeless women, police said. Pedro L Custodio, 44, known as ‘Pastor Pete’, was arrested after three female clients of the Eustis shelter told police that he’d forced himself on them. Custodio, who is married with children, has been charged with two counts of sexual battery and one count of attempted sexual battery. Police allege that he ‘exploited [the women] by gaining their trust’. The attacks are said to have taken place in the shelter, in Custodio's car and at his house. He denies all charges. One woman told police that in July 2013 Custodio locked himself in the shelter’s food pantry with her and removed his underwear. He is then alleged to have told her that he could ‘help her sexually’ because he’d heard that her boyfriend was jail and that her sex life had diminished as a result, the police report said, according to the Orlandosentinel.com. He is alleged to have grabbed her by the hips and kissed her face and neck. She was eventually able to persuade him to stop by reminding him that he was a married father, police said. Last month another woman told police that although she had been in a consensual sexual relationship with Custodio, he raped her on her birthday after they’d been for drinks. The police report said: ‘(The victim) advised she was crying during the entire incident and (was) repeatedly begging for Pastor Pete to stop.’ The third woman told police in an interview that Custodio ‘pressured’ her into having sex with him. The shelter, which Custodio set up in 2010, has the following mission, according to its website: ‘To assist the needy and homeless of our community, with spiritual guidance, food, clothing, information of other resources in our area, and feeding the soul and body.’ Custodio had been detained in Lake County Jail but has been released on a $30,000 bond. Custodio, who is married with children, has been charged with two counts of sexual battery and one count of attempted sexual battery .

"By . Ted Thornhill . ESPN SportsCenter anchor Stuart Scott, who is fighting a recurrence of cancer first diagnosed seven years ago, was awarded the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance at the ESPY Awards. He gave an inspirational speech likely to be remembered for years to come that finished with an emotional embrace with his youngest daughter and a touching message to the audience: 'Have a great rest of your night and have a great rest of your life.' Mr Scott was presented the award on Wednesday at a packed Nokia Theater in Los Angeles by Kiefer Sutherland shortly after a film had been shown documenting his battle. Scroll down for video . Honored: Kiefer Sutherland presents the Jimmy V award for perseverance to Stuart Scott  at the ESPY Awards at the Nokia Theatre on Wednesday . His speech began with a thank you for Mr Sutherland, whose TV show 24, he admitted, was his favorite. He then reminded the audience of a line spoken by Jim Valvano that he described as ‘the most poignant words ever uttered in a speech anywhere’. The former North Carolina State University basketball coach created The V Foundation for Cancer Research with ESPN in 1993 and gave a legendary speech at the first ever ESPYs, two months before he died of bone cancer, in which he said: ‘Don’t give up… don’t ever give up.’ Those words became the foundation’s motto and Mr Scott said: ‘To be honored with this, I know I have a responsibility to never give up. I'm not special. I just listened to what the man said.’ He said the V Foundation had 'tangible benefits' which helped him, and ‘thousands like him’. 'Live, fight like hell,' he said. 'And when you're too tired to fight, lay down and rest and let someone else fight for you. That's also very important. I can't do this ""don't give up thing"" all by myself. I've got thousands of people on Twitter and on the streets who encourage me.' Emotional Mr Scott asked his youngest daughter, Sydni, to give him a hug on stage at the end of his speech . Heartfelt: Sydni shakes 24 star Kiefer Sutherland's hand at the end of the speech . He described how he had recently 'crashed' with kidney failure. He revealed: ‘I had tubes running through every part of my body! As of Sunday, I didn't even know if I could make it here. I couldn't fight. But the doctors and nurses could, the people that I loved and my friends and family, they could. This whole fight, this journey thing, is not a solo venture, this is something that requires support.’ Mr Scott further emphasized  how important his friends, family and colleagues have been in his fight against cancer. Glitzy: (Pictured from left) Kim Scott, Stuart Scott and Sydni Scott at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles . He marvelled at the fact that his bosses will offer to bring him food when he’s had chemotherapy and expressed his gratitude to family members who he would sometimes ring just because ‘he needed to cry’. Parts of the speech received applause, with many people in tears at times. Mr Scott saved his most heartfelt thanks for his daughters, Taelor and Sydni. His voice charged with emotion, he said that they were the reason he was standing on the stage and ‘being dad to them would be the best thing he would ever do’. It ended when he invited Sydni on stage for a hug, which brought the audience to its feet.","Stuart Scott is fighting a recurrence of cancer diagnosed seven years ago .

"By . Ted Thornhill . The family of a known sleepwalker found injured and freezing to death on a hotel roof criticised colleagues for not raising the alarm sooner, an inquest heard today. Rob Williams, 27, wearing just a shirt and suit trousers was knocked unconscious and spent hours freezing to death on a rain-soaked roof after falling 13ft. He was only found the next afternoon following a work's Christmas drinks around Waltham Abbey, Essex. After he died his girlfriend later discovered she was pregnant with his child. The surveyor at construction firm BR Hodgson had been booked to stay elsewhere, but returned to the De Vere hotel with two colleagues and they fell asleep in the second-floor hotel room. Tragedy: Rob Williams, pictured with his girlfriend Carla, died from hypothermia on Christmas Day 2013 . In love: Mr Williams and his girlfriend Carla, pictured in November 2013 . However the next morning colleagues David Mellis and Bill Andrews woke to find Mr Williams not there, although his coat and shoes were still there and the window was open. Thinking nothing of it they went for breakfast and took his belongings with them back to the office. Both men claimed to have drunk so much they could not remember anything about their return to the hotel or the evening's events. It was not until lunchtime later that day that the firm's secretary was told to ring around local hospitals to track down their missing employee, Hertfordshire Coroner's Court heard. His father, Jestyn Williams, fought back tears as he criticised the men for not raising the alarm when they awoke to find the window open and Mr Williams' belongings still in the room. He said: 'Didn't alarm bells ring when you got up Rob's coat and shoes were there, thinking where in the hotel is he? 'You didn't raise the alarm and search for him. That's the thing we can't come to terms with. 'You remember what you did in the morning. You went to breakfast while he was lying above you and I hope you feel very bad about it.' Inquest: Hertfordshire Coroner’s Court heard how Mr Williams (pictured with his nephew) was prone to sleepwalking, especially after he'd had a lot to drink . The firm eventually contacted Mr Williams' partner, Carla Hilton, who called Essex police to report him missing around 1pm, who rated him as 'low risk'. Mr Williams said to the court: 'I have learned one thing today - if you are ""low risk"" don't bother calling the police.' Ms Hilton appeared alongside her dead boyfriend's father where she was equally critical of the firm's decision not to contact them first to see if he had gone home to sleep off his hangover. She said: 'If I had known that he hadn't turned up for work the next morning, I would have been worried because it was highly unlike him.' Coroner Edward Thomas said that a different course of action by colleagues the morning afterwards could have saved him. He said: 'What concerns me is at what stage do you get worried that he had not turned up for work. 'What we don't know is if calling him at 10 would have meant he survived.' Agony: Father-to-be Mr Williams was found 'groaning' on the flat roof of the four-star De Vere Theobalds Park in Hertfordshire . Sporty: Mr Williams loved keeping active and is pictured here on a snowboarding holiday . The inquest heard it was not until the following afternoon that a workman in a first-floor room raised the alarm after spotting him lying unconscious. At the hospital doctors attempted to warm him back up while bypassing his heart in an effort to avoid any cardiac arrests as he stabilised but he had been cold for so long that his internal organs, including his brain, had been irreversibly damaged. A blood sample taken on his arrival at hospital showed a blood alcohol level of around 110mg, well over the 80mg drink drive limit. But pathologist Dr Nathaniel Carey calculated that with the reading taken at 5pm the day after the works do, his peak level could have been around 300mg. Mr Thomas said: 'Dr Carey tells me that the cause of death, that I accepted, is complications arising from severe hypothermia. 'It was December, it was getting light at around 7.30 in the morning, this fall would have occurred well before that so that even if they were called at 10 or 11 he would have been out for a significant time in the cold. 'But we don't know because it was 2pm until he was found by the ambulance workers who found him profoundly hypothermic at 14.35. 'I have people die from 300mg, it causes coronary and respiratory failure, people have choked on their own vomit lying in bed.' Earlier in the inquest Mr Williams' family said he had a history of sleep walking. However the coroner added: 'People were quite excited about the sleep walking situation, but there is no evidence that. 'That's all speculation, there is no CCTV evidence, there is no forensic evidence, there is only the evidence of where he was found.' He said the failure for his drunk colleagues to remember anything about the night made it 'extremely difficult'. Recording death by misadventure he told the family: 'If concerns were escalated earlier it may have been a different story, but we don't know. 'I suspect this will always be with you and I just feel so sad for you, so sad.' Outside court Mr Williams' family and relatives declined to comment. The inquest continues.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Amid celebrations to mark the 45th anniversary of the first moon landing, former Nasa administrator Michael Griffin has warned that Russia has the U.S in a ‘hostage situation’ over its ability to send men to space. Mr Griffin has underscored that the U.S, since it cancelled its Shuttle program in 2011, relies on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft to get its astronauts to the International Space Station. However, this arrangement is in jeopardy, with tension between the two nations the highest it’s been since the end of the Cold War in 1991. They have been trading tit-for-tat sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine and their relationship turned even frostier after the downing of MH17 last Thursday. Reliance: U.S astronauts currently hitch rides into space on board Russian Soyuz rockets . Griffin told ABC News: ‘We’re in a hostage situation. Russia can decide that no more U.S. astronauts will launch to the International Space Station and that’s not a position that I want our nation to be in.’ Secretary of State John Kerry lamented over the weekend that the level of trust between Washington and Moscow is now at a low ebb. Even before the attack on MH17, Russia had declared that it may stop letting U.S astronauts hitch rides to the ISS. Warning: Former Nasa boss Michael Griffin has said that Russia can hold the U.S 'hostage' over space travel . Russia’s deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said in May that Moscow was planning ‘strategic changes’ to its space program and warned: ‘The Russian segment [of the ISS] can exist independently from the American one. The U.S. one cannot.’ However, Nasa’s ability to launch humans into space once more took a giant leap earlier in July with the signing of a $2.8billion contract with Boeing to build a giant rocket it is hoped will take us into deep space, possibly on manned missions to Mars. It comes as the team complete the Critical Design Review (CDR) on the core stage – the last major review before full production begins. 'Our teams have dedicated themselves to ensuring that the Space Launch System (SLS) – the largest ever - will be built safely, affordably and on time,' said Virginia Barnes, Boeing SLS vice president and program manager. 'We are passionate about Nasa’s mission to explore deep space. 'It’s a very personal mission, as well as a national mandate.' This milestone marks Nasa’s first CDR on a deep-space human exploration launch vehicle since 1961, when the Saturn V rocket underwent a similar design review as the United States sought to land an astronaut on the moon. Scheduled for its initial test flight in 2017, the SLS is designed to be flexible and evolvable to meet a variety of crew and cargo mission needs. California-based SpaceX is also striving to put humans into space. Russia’s deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin warned in May that 'the Russian segment [of the ISS] can exist independently from the American one, the U.S. one cannot' Its Falcon 9 reusable development vehicle is already in test mode and it will eventually deliver the smaller Dragon capsule containing humans into space. The Dragon made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and safely return cargo to Earth, a feat previously achieved only by governments. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first men on the moon on July 20, 1969. Ten more U.S. astronauts followed in their footsteps before the Apollo program was canceled in 1972. No one has been back since.","Ex-Nasa boss underscored that U.S relies on Russia for space travel .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A father with throat cancer who is about to permanently lose his voice will still be able to speak to his family – and dog, Daisy – thanks to an iPad. Ray Rodda, 61, from Sunderland, has been diagnosed with throat cancer and is having his voice box completely removed - leaving him unable to make a sound. The retired graphic designer is determined he won't be silenced and has recorded around a dozen messages for his family, including his kids and wife Shirley, 52. Heartfelt: Throat cancer sufferer Ray Rhodda, pictured with wife Shirley (left) and daughter Emma, has recorded messages for his family on an iPad because he's due to have his voice box removed . Commands: Mr Rodda has even left instructions for his beloved dog, Daisy (pictured), on the iPad . But Mr Rodda has also made commands for his beloved pet golden labrador Daisy - including sit, heel, lie down, high five and dance. The messages, recorded onto an iPad, will mean even after his voice has gone he'll be able to play with his dog - and say hello and 'I love you' to his family. Daughter Emma, 24, said: 'After the operation he won't be able to say anything or make any noise. 'He had been given the iPad by the NHS and will be able to type in it like a text message and it will speak the words. 'But that will be in a different computer voice and he was worried that the dog wouldn't listen to him or know who was talking. 'It seems like a little thing, but to be able to record his own voice makes a real difference. 'My dad has never complained about anything through all this and I don't think he has really thought about how life-changing this will be at the moment. 'He is just looking forward to the surgery because he is suffering so much.' Mr Rodda, a retired graphic designer, visited doctors last year with a persistent sore throat, but was initially told it was high blood pressure and then an infection. But after three visits doctors found a tumour and despite intense chemotherapy and radiotherapy the disease spread to his tongue and lymph nodes. Mr Rodda was put on six weeks of daily chemotherapy and radiotherapy in December, which failed to eliminate the cancer. The father-of-three is set to have a complex 13-hour operation to remove his voice box, tongue and the glands in his throat. Three weeks ago his family were told the best chance he has of beating the disease is having the huge operation, which he is due to have today. After the operation at Sunderland Royal Hospital he will breathe through a tracheotomy, be fed through a tube connected to his stomach and will speak using the iPad. Upbeat: Mr Rodda's daughter, Emma (pictured), said that he is doing his best to be positive about his plight . Sit down, Daisy . High five, Daisy . Show me want you want, Daisy . I love you . Heel, Daisy . Lie down, Daisy . Dance, Daisy . Hi Andrew . Hi Emma . Hi Shirl . Hi Mum . Hi Alison . Wife Shirley, a special educational needs teacher, is also teaching him symbols and gestures to help him communicate. Emma, who is engaged to partner Andrew Howells, 30, said: 'When you say to my dad about it he says 'what's the alternative?' 'It is such a difficult time for us but at the end of the day, we are pleased that there is another option. He is just looking forward to getting rid of the pain. 'He is upbeat about it and even jokes. When his doctor was asking how he might feel about something or other he joked 'well, you won't hear a peep out of me about it'. 'With the recorded messages he will be able to tell Daisy all the tricks he has taught her like 'Heel Daisy', 'Lie down Daisy', 'Dance Daisy', just simple things. 'He will also be able to say 'Hi Andrew' to my fiance, 'Hi Shirl' to my mum, 'Hi Mum' to his mother-in-law and 'Hi Alison' to my sister.' The family is hoping that the operation will save Mr Rodda’s life. Emma added: 'The doctors say that it doesn't look like it has gone anywhere else, but it did go to his lymph nodes. 'The hope is that the surgery will remove all of the cancer. Hopefully this will work.' Emma is fundraising for the Northern Centre for Cancer Care in Newcastle where Ray had his treatment.

"By . Ted Thornhill . A pensioner fell out of her wheelchair and died after her friend who was pushing her tried to photograph some ducklings with her iPad, an inquest heard. Jean Sloan, 81, was being pushed by Jane Miller when they stopped to watch a duck and ducklings near a pond. She asked her friend to photograph the birds and Mrs Miller let go of the wheelchair as she reached for her iPad to take a photo. Tragedy: Wheelchair-bound Jean Sloan died after the friend pushing her let go to photograph ducklings . Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake said: 'As she did so the chair moved forward. She did go to grab it, but then Mrs Sloan then fell out of the chair.' Mrs Miller ran for help after Mrs Sloan fell near the Walcot Hall nursing home where she lived in Diss, Norfolk. Paramedics were called, but the pensioner, who had been in a wheelchair since having a stroke last August, died at the scene on June 25. Verdict: Norfolk Coroner's Court (pictured) returned a verdict of accidental death after an investigation . Mrs Miller said in a statement that the wheelchair had not been on a noticeable slope. A post mortem found mother-of-two Mrs Sloan had died from a ruptured spleen due to the fall. It also found there were contributory factors of heart disease which were not directly linked to the cause of death. Mrs Lake said police had investigated and were satisfied there was nothing suspicious and there were no problems with the wheelchair. She added: 'In the light of the events leading to her death my conclusion is accidental death.'","Jean Sloan, 81, was being pushed in a wheelchair when tragedy struck .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Jailed: Peter Wood, 44, of Wainscott, Kent, admitted attempted murder . A husband who tried to murder his sleeping wife after discovering she was having an affair with a lesbian has been jailed for 10 years. Enraged Peter Wood smashed mother-of-two Tina over the head with a rolling pin and then tried to smother her in her pillow in front of their young sons. Mrs Wood, 34, managed to stagger out of the house but Peter chased her and stabbed her 12 times. The couple’s eldest son David, 14, ran out in his pyjamas and managed to intervene and he protected his mother until paramedics arrived. A court heard how Peter planned the murderous attack in February after seeing a Facebook message between his wife and a female friend. In it Mrs Wood - who had been married for 14 years - revealed she had started a lesbian affair. Peter, 44, of Wainscott, Kent, admitted attempted murder and was jailed by Judge Jeremy Carey at Maidstone Crown Court on Monday. The judge told him: 'It is troubling in the extreme you took the course you did. That night you were set on a course you had planned. 'You made the decision to kill the mother of your two sons. You set about that attack with a purpose. 'It is to the credit of Tina Wood that she showed great presence of mind in what was a terrifying ordeal for her. 'You were of good character, a caring father who worked hard to support his family. You have lost all that.' Martin Yale, prosecuting, said the couple had been together for 14 years after ‘a bit of a whirlwind’ relationship. When Mrs Wood fell pregnant with their first child her husband ended up on antidepressants and suicidal. On one occasion he had gone looking for a kitchen knife in a bid to kill her and there were further bouts of violence and rows before they split up last year. They continued sleeping in the same room but in January Peter discovered his wife had started seeing another woman and attacked her the following month. He said: 'She could hear him saying he was going to kill her. She began to scream to the boys as loudly as she could.' Wood grabbed at her throat, but despite attempts by sons David and Oliver, nine, to get him off she felt a stabbing pain to her ribs. The terrified victim managed to get down the stairs and out of the house but Peter followed and stabbed her in the ribs again. She fell to the ground and could no longer make any noise at which stage son David went to get a nurse who lived in the street. Peter called 999 declaring: 'I tried to kill my wife. I need an ambulance and police. I hit her and I have stabbed her too.' Shocking: Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) heard how Peter Wood planned the murderous attack in February after seeing a Facebook message between his wife and a female friend . Asked why he did it, he replied: 'I had to do it. I am not explaining. I just had to do it.' Mr Yale said Mrs Wood was lying in a pool of blood and having trouble breathing when emergency services arrived to take her to London’s King’s College Hospital. Despite multiple wounds and a collapsed lung, her condition was stable. She believed her life was saved by the eldest son. A police officer went into the house and found Peter wearing a T-shirt covered in blood with the knife left lying on the floor. He said he had been planning to kill his wife for two days because he hated her and had recently discovered she was having an affair with a woman. Wood threatened that he would 'finish her off' if he saw her again. Judge Carey said David deserved a reward for saving his mother’s life. He said: 'He showed great courage and presence of mind, not only in protecting his mother, but doing what he could to save her before the arrival of paramedics and the air ambulance.' Under an extended sentence for public protection, Peter will not be considered for parole until he has served two thirds. He will be on licence for a further four years. Det Sgt Stephen Biddiss, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'It is clear that Peter Wood was trying to kill his wife and it is only through good luck and the intervention of her son, who showed tremendous courage, that she is alive and has made a full recovery today. 'I have no doubt that had Wood had his way, she would be dead and buried, all due to what he perceived as a betrayal when she entered into a new relationship.'","Peter Wood smashed his wife, Tina, over the head with a rolling pin .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . and Jane Flanagan In Cape Town . Two university students are facing disciplinary action after taking photos of themselves dressed up as black South African maids. The girls, who are studying at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, smeared their faces with brown paint and shoved pillows down their skirts in a bid to make their bottoms look bigger. They then struck a number of poses for the camera, before the images were uploaded to the social-networking site Facebook. Under fire: Two university students are facing disciplinary action after taking photos of themselves as South African maids. Above, the girls are pictured sporting brown face paint and pillows shoved down their skirts . Now, the university in Pretoria, Gauteng Province, is carrying out disciplinary action against the students, who dressed up in the outfits for a friend's party. The photos, which have since been deleted from Facebook, show the girls posing in a bedroom while donning clothing typically associated with domestic workers. They appear to be deliberately sticking their bottoms out, while their smiles seemingly suggest they believe their outfits are amusing. Today, Nicolize Mulder, of the University of Pretoria, said the institution was dealing with the matter seriously. Outrage: After the photos were uploaded to Facebook, they quickly went viral. One Twitter user wrote:  'Look at the Tukkies' [a nickname for students at the University of Pretoria] #blackface pic. The skin, doeks, big butts' Institution: The University of Pretoria (pictured) in Gauteng Province today deemed the images 'unacceptable' She told Eyewitness News the students would be punished for bringing the university's name into disrepute - despite the photos having been taken at a private event. She added that the institution would not tolerate any form of racist behaviour and described the conduct in the pictures as 'completely unacceptable'. After the photos were uploaded to Facebook, they quickly went viral, with many social media users condemning the students' choice of outfits. One Twitter user wrote: 'If I showed that picture to my domestic worker, she would be reduced to tears and would feel belittled and small. #FACT #Blackface.' Shock: One woman retweeted the image, expressing her shock at the girls' behaviour. She wrote: 'If I showed that picture to my domestic worker, she would be reduced to tears and would feel belittled and small. #FACT' 'Not funny': Meanwhile, another user wrote: 'Blackface is masked racism.  There's nothing amusing about it' Meanwhile, another said: 'Look at the Tukkies' [a nickname for students at the University of Pretoria] #blackface pic. The skin, doeks, big butts. It is performed stereotype of the black female body.' And one wrote: 'Blackface is masked racism.  There's nothing amusing about it.' The two students from the Madelief residence did not respond to questions from the news site. Meanwhile, the South African Human Rights Commission said it had not received a complaint relating to the images.","University students dressed up as South African maids for a friend's party .
