"(CNN) -- Switzerland and Belgium will shake up the seedings ahead of next year's FIFA World Cup finals in Brazil. The appearance of those two countries in the top bracket of seeds means it is possible that hosts Brazil could be drawn in a group with Italy, or Argentina with Netherlands. Ottmar Hitzfeld, who on Thursday announced he'll be stepping down after the tournament, led the Swiss through their qualifying campaign unbeaten. Switzerland won seven of their group matches, drawing the other three and have leaped seven places up the official FIFA rankings to seventh. Belgium were also unbeaten in qualifying, finishing nine points of second place Croatia. The population of Switzerland and Belgium (7.9 million and 11.1 million respectively) is dwarfed by many of the other nations, with the exception of Uruguay (3.3 million). Hosts Brazil and defending champions Spain, along with Germany, Argentina and Colombia are all seeded while England and Italy, both unbeaten in qualifying, narrowly miss out. Uruguay will be seeded should they win their two-legged qualification playoff with Jordan, but if they miss out then Netherlands -- who won nine of their ten group matches -- will take their place. The draw for the finals will be held in Bahia in Brazil on December 6, by which time the results of the playoffs in various territories will be known. France go into the European playoffs unseeded due to their current ranking of 21 which means they could face Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in the two-legged tie. As well as Portugal, Greece, Croatia and Ukraine are seeded while Iceland, Sweden and Romania are not. The draw for the playoffs will be conducted on October 21 with the matches played on November 15 and 19. Hitzfeld said his decision to relinquish his role as Switzerland coach after the World Cup was the ""most difficult decision of my coaching career."" The 64-year-old, who has held the post since 2008, led the Swiss to a famous 1-0 win over world and European champions Spain at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. ""The association's management, with the players and the staff is absolutely ordered for the best, so this is the most difficult decision of my coaching career,"" Hitzfeld said on the Swiss Football Association's official website. General Secretary Alex Miescher added: ""Ottmar Hitzfeld is a gentleman from head to toe, and leaves us plenty of time (to find a successor).""","Switzerland are among eight seeded teams for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil .

"(CNN) -- Detroit could probably use another Eminem boost following Tuesday's news that it lost 25% of its residents from 2000 to 2010. You may remember the catchy Chrysler ad during January's Super Bowl. To the sounds of a jangly guitar, the rapper drives through the city's gritty streets, telling the viewer, ""This is the Motor City and this is what we do."" The spot ends with ""Imported From Detroit,"" a message that may have a new meaning, given the latest census numbers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Detroit saw its population drop from 951,270 in 2000 to 713,777 last year -- its lowest since the 1910 census. That tells only part of a classic rise and fall of a city that lost residents to the suburbs and the dramatic decline of the auto industry. Buoyed by industrialization and Henry Ford and other entrepreneurs, Detroit's population skyrocketed at the dawn of the 20th century. Home to 285,704 people in 1900, the Michigan city enjoyed a peak of 1.85 million residents in 1950. Detroit once was the fourth-largest city in the country. Tuesday's news was a double blow to Michigan, which learned in December it was the only state to have a cumulative population loss in the decade. The state's population fell 0.6% -- from 9.94 million to 9.89 million -- costing the state yet another congressional district. At its peak, after the 1960 census, Michigan had 19 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The state's Capitol Hill clout has eroded, one or two seats a decade, since 1980. Now, it's down to just 14. Detroit leaders said Tuesday the census figures were not accurate. ""I don't believe it will stand up"" to the city's planned challenge, said Mayor Dave Bing, saying the census has a history of undercounting residents in large cities. ""We are in a fiscal crisis and we have to fight for every dollar,"" Bing said. If another 40,000 residents are verified, Detroit would meet the 750,000 threshold for ideal federal and state funding, Bing said. Detroit City Council President Charles Pugh told CNN affiliate WIDV the census figure is about 100,000 short. ""That's clearly less money from the state and clearly less money from the government if we fall below certain thresholds,"" Pugh said. Bing told reporters he is committed to help create new jobs and reduce crime. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said ""figures clearly show how crucial it is to reinvent Michigan."" ""We cannot cling to the old ways of doing business,"" Snyder said in a statement Tuesday. ""Michigan will not succeed if Detroit and other major cities don't succeed. ""Losing our best and brightest young adults to other states, or failing to rejuvenate our urban areas, are not acceptable options,"" Snyder continued. ""Fundamental change is needed and we will achieve that by working together with relentless positive action."" The state is working to stem the losses. The Detroit Region Aerotropolis Development Corporation, for example, is hoping to tie business development to airports in the region. And the news wasn't all bad. Suburban Monroe, Macomb and Kent counties saw population increases. The question now is whether Detroit residents will come out swinging. Their hockey heroes, the Red Wings, may lead the way. Playoff tickets go on sale at noon Saturday.","Detroit has lowest population since 1910 census count .

"(CNN) -- One day after a court in eastern China sentenced him to life in prison for corruption, former Communist Party official Bo Xilai appealed his verdict and sentencing, a source with direct knowledge of the case told CNN. Bo -- a former rising political star who fell from power amid a scandal involving murder, betrayal and financial skullduggery -- was convicted Sunday of bribe-taking, embezzlement and abuse of power. 5 big moments from the trial . He received the life sentence for bribe-taking,15 years for embezzlement and seven years for abuse of power. When Bo heard the decision at Jinan Intermediate People's Court on Sunday, he called out, ""This verdict seriously contradicts the facts and it is unfair"" before being led out of the courtroom, the source said. The court's official account of the proceeding, posted on its microblog as well as state media reports, did not mention Bo's reaction. The sentences, which came shortly after the guilty verdicts, surprised some analysts. ""I'm actually a little bit surprised. I think it's a very strong verdict"" compared with some previous cases, said Yuhua Wang, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ""He was a political star before falling from grace. He was ... the son of a revolutionary veteran. His father was Mao's colleague,"" he added. During the politically sensitive trial that took place over several days last month, Bo, 64, denied the charges and strongly challenged the prosecution's case against him, according to accounts published by the court in Jinan. The closely watched trial was considered to be much more transparent than most cases in China. But international and independent journalists weren't allowed inside the courtroom, and doubts were raised about the fullness of the court's version of events. 'I can bear the suffering' Days before the court announced the date for delivering the verdict, Bo, in a letter written to his family, reiterated his innocence but said he expected a lengthy imprisonment. ""I was dragged into this and really wronged, but the truth will come out one day,"" Bo wrote in a letter dated September 12, referring to the bribes allegedly taken by his wife and other scandals involving her and her friends. Read more: Corruption fight a political purge? ""Meanwhile I will be waiting quietly in prison,"" Bo continued. ""Dad was thrown into prison multiple times in his lifetime and I will look up to him as my role model."" Bo's late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Chairman Mao Zedong and late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. During the tumultuous Cultural Revolution that Mao launched in 1966, however, the senior Bo was persecuted, tortured and imprisoned for over a decade. He was ""rehabilitated"" in 1979 and became one of the most influential senior politicians under Deng. ""Dad and Mom have passed away, but their teachings are deeply ingrained in my mind,"" Bo wrote. ""I will never bring disgrace to them and their glory. I can bear the suffering no matter how great it is. ""I have put Mom's photo by my bed. With her by my side, I don't feel lonely."" Was Bo Xilai's trial in China truly transparent? A source with close ties to the Bo family confirmed to CNN the authenticity of the letter, which has been circulating on the Internet. She adds that the content online is only part of the original letter, which appears to be addressing the family members -- including a son and four siblings -- present in the courtroom during his trial. Dramatic downfall . Bo's trial brought to light a wealth of eye-opening details about the apparently lavish and emotionally fraught life of his family and inner circle, giving Chinese people insights into how some of the ruling elite live. His glittering career, during which he drew both admirers and detractors for his populist policies, fell apart last year. Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policy-making body of the Communist Party. He had been tipped to ascend farther up the party hierarchy. A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing, a metropolis in southwestern China. But when his deputy, Wang Lijun, walked into the U.S. Consulate in the city of Chengdu in February 2012 and told American diplomats that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was involved in a murder case, Bo's career began to unravel. Wang's move precipitated Bo's political demise. Soon after news of the events began to emerge, Bo was removed from his party posts. A court found Gu guilty in August of last year of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood in a Chongqing hotel room in 2011. She was given a suspended death sentence. The following month, Wang was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking. He received a 15-year prison sentence. Wang and Gu both appeared as witnesses at Bo's trial last month. Bo attacked their testimony and even claimed that Wang and Gu had been romantically involved.","Source: Bo Xilai says the verdict contradicted the facts and was unfair .

"(CNN) -- Talk about dedication to the job. Detroit paramedic Joseph Hardman is being hailed as a hero for performing CPR on a patient having a heart attack -- even as he began to have one himself. One doctor said the odds of this happening are ""one in a million."" ""A sudden explosion-type feeling in my chest"" is how Hardman, 47, described the incident to CNN affiliate WXYZ. Hardman's partner drove him and the patient to the local hospital. Both men had identical stents put in to remove blockages, and both are recovering. Hardman knows how lucky he was to already be on his way to an ER, telling reporters ""If I hadn't been in the position I was in, I would have been deceased."" ""I would have to say one in a million is about appropriate"" a hospital doctor told WXYZ. ""I haven't ever seen it and I haven't heard of it"". Hardman has been working as a paramedic in Detroit for 15 years, and says he has no prior medical history of heart problems. The blockage was found in a key artery that is often referred to by cardiologists as the ""widow maker"". Doctors say he likely faces months of rehab before he'll be able to return to work.","Doctor says the odds are ""one in a million""

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Scott Charles walks briskly across a hospital lobby toward a group of high school students waiting to meet him. ""Welcome,"" he said, panning their faces, ""I work with gunshot patients. How many of you know somebody who's been shot?"" Hands spring up into the air from roughly half of the more than 20 students. Without flinching, Charles continues his introduction. ""What we're going to do today is take you behind the scenes, pull back the curtain and let you see what we do in treating gunshot patients,"" he said. It's all part of the Cradle To Grave program that Charles helped create to reduce violence in what is supposed to be the City of Brotherly Love. Inside Temple University Hospital's trauma center, these high school students will relive the final minutes of life of a teenager who was killed by gun violence. Among America's largest cities, Philadelphia's homicide rate is the worst. Guns are the weapons of choice, with more than 80% of homicides committed with a firearm, according to the most recent police statistics. African-Americans make up 85% of the victims . ""Statistics suggest that as a young, black man, you have a greater chance of being shot and killed in Philadelphia than you would have if you were a soldier serving in the conflicts in Afghanistan or Iraq,"" Charles said. ""That's absurd to me."" Despite the daily gun violence plaguing American cities like Philadelphia, Chicago or New Orleans, it's the mass shootings at a school or a theater or a public event -- like the tragedies in Newtown, Aurora and Tucson -- that trigger outrage and a serious, nationwide discussion on gun violence. ""The tragedy of the parents isn't greater in Newtown than that of a parent of someone who was shot elsewhere,"" Charles said, expressing sadness for the lives lost in the school shooting. ""At the end of the day, their kids aren't coming home, and there's no way to compare that anguish. ""Newtown has made us stare the (gun) issue in the face and ask ourselves if this is the price we're willing to pay."" Despite emotions, little happens legislatively after mass shootings . 'White noise' Standing with students in a hallway leading to the hospital's trauma bays and holding an iPad, Charles tells the story of 16-year-old Lamont Adams, who was shot 24 times. ""That young boy stood over Lamont and fired 10 more shots into him,"" he said, the sound of gunshots playing in the background. A few students gasp, while others stand stoically with hard-to-read expressions, as Charles leads them into the trauma bay. One by one, he places 24 red stickers on the body of a student volunteer lying on a gurney. ""He had a bullet wound here ... Lamont had a bullet wound right here ... Lamont had a bullet wound right here,"" Charles says, as he places each sticker on the student. Across the United States, more than 5,700 children and teens were killed by guns in 2008 and 2009 -- a number that would fill more than 200 public school classrooms -- according to data compiled by The Children's Defense Fund. That number includes 173 preschoolers, nearly double the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty during the same time. Responding to last month's Connecticut school shooting, President Obama created a task force led by Vice President Joe Biden charged with developing ""concrete proposals"" for dealing with gun violence no later than January. Obama exploring executive orders to combat gun violence . Among those serving on the vice president's task force is Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, whose city had a bloody start to the New Year with five homicides in the first 48 hours. Philadelphia has seen a slow uptick in its homicide rate. Last year, 331 people were the victims of homicides, up from 324 in 2011 and 306 the year before that. But last year's toll marks a 15% drop compared to 2007, when the city earned the nickname ""Kill-adelphia"" after suffering more than one murder a day. The fact that most of those killed in Philadelphia are victims of gun violence is emblematic of a national trend: Federal data for 2011 shows that more than 67% of all homicides in the United States were carried out with a gun. So where's the nation's outrage? Daily, inner-city gun violence has become ""white noise,"" said Chuck Williams, founding director of Center for the Prevention of School-Aged Violence at Drexel University. ""At this point it's like, 'Oh, another six people got shot and killed over a week in a poor black community. Business as usual,'"" he said, shrugging his shoulders. ""So America says, if the urban communities don't care enough about it, then why should we?"" Williams hopes that will change in the wake of the mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. ""If this (Newtown) is not enough for all of us to come together and say that something needs to be done, I don't know what is,"" he said. ""Our kids are dying and they're leaving us way too soon, and we have the power to do something about that if we so choose."" A look at U.S. gun laws . 'I hurt the same way' Eddie Bocanegra, born and raised in the rough and tumble section of Little Village on the southwest side of Chicago, is no stranger to gun violence. Bocanegra, who spent 14 years in prison for murder, is now on a mission to save lives. He is featured in the documentary ""The Interrupters,"" which follows the lives of three community activists fighting to interrupt the fervent violence in Chicago. The shooting in Newtown spurred the nation to respond, from prayer vigils and donations to around-the-clock news coverage of the event. Although moving, the reaction was also sobering, Bocanegra said. ""A kid growing up in the 'hood has different expectations than a kid growing up in Newtown,"" said Bocanegra, who works with ex-offenders at the faith-based nonprofit Community Renewal Society in Chicago. ""We have worldwide attention on this tragic event in Connecticut, but it shows us how we value life, and it's a shame murder isn't treated the same across the board."" ""I hurt the same way you hurt. Murder shouldn't occur, and I say that as someone who took a life,"" Bocanegra said. ""All lives are precious, and one is not worth more than the other."" Every single day in the United States, 13 young people between the ages of 10 and 24 are the victims of homicide, according to federal data. More than 80% are killed with a firearm. In Philadelphia, the majority of homicide victims are African-Americans between the ages of 15 and 24. ""Every time there is a loss of life, we have to remind ourselves that these are often children. And we have to ask ourselves where have we failed to protect this child?"" said John Rich, director of the Center for Nonviolence and Social Justice at Drexel University. The indifference toward urban slayings often comes down to ""victim blaming,"" said Rich, author of ""Wrong Place, Wrong Time: Trauma and Violence in the Lives of Young Black Men."" ""We're using shorthand and stereotypes to draw a conclusion,"" Rich said. ""There's something undeniably different when we have this scale of horrible in Connecticut. And there's something undeniably horrible about a killing a day."" Trauma, poverty and unsafe neighborhoods must be included in the gun control debate, said Ted Corbin, co-director at the Center for Nonviolence and Social Justice. Both Rich and Corbin want to explain the cycle of violence, not excuse it. As an emergency room physician, Corbin said he regularly sees the carnage of gun violence, and added that it's not enough to ""treat them and street them."" ""Hurt people hurt people,"" Corbin said matter-of-factly. ""It really is what's perceived by society as what's deserving. A veteran who has served our country deserves services, but the empathy is not there for young people who are chronically exposed to adversity."" ""The assumption is that they're bad kids, (without) giving society any responsibility,"" he said. Back at Temple University Hospital, the students head from the trauma bay to a classroom for a discussion before they visit the hospital's morgue, Lamont's last stop. More than 7,000 students have come through the Cradle To Grave program. Amy Goldberg, the hospital's chief trauma surgeon and a co-founder of the program, said she and Charles are committed because the cost of violence is too high. ""I really think it's our responsibility to prevent these kids from coming in. So as much as I may get frustrated on any evening, it really can't stop us,"" Goldberg said. ""We really want to teach them the preciousness of life, that in an instant your life can be changed forever.""","Philadelphia has the worst homicide rates among large U.S. cities .

"(CNN) -- The Philippines could begin feeling the effects of a powerful typhoon churning toward the island chain as early as Sunday, forecasters said Saturday. Typhoon Megi, also known as Typhoon Juan, is expected to make landfall by Monday in northern Luzon at or near super-typhoon strength with winds possibly in excess of 200 kph (124 mph), according to the Philippines' Science and Technology Secretary Mario Montejo. Strong winds and storm surge were the largest concern. As of 4 p.m. Saturday, Megi was located 820 km (510 miles) east of northern Luzon with winds of 140 kph (87 mph) with higher gusts, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration reported. Montejo said the government is alarmed by the speed and strength of the typhoon. He warned of potentially devastating effects the storm may wreak in Luzon. As the storm moves across the rugged terrain of Luzon, it is expected to decrease in intensity before moving out over the South China Sea. Megi is expected to dump large amounts of rainfall over the mountains, which could potentially trigger mudslides and localized flooding. CNN's Judson Jones contributed to this report.","Typhoon Megi is expected to make landfall Monday .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The first giant panda to be born in Japan in 24 years has died just one week after generating huge excitement in the country as locals celebrated the rare birth. The seven-day-old unnamed cub died from pneumonia after its mother's milk accidentally entered its airway, according to officials at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, where it was born. Toshimitsu Doi, the head of the zoo, told reporters at a televised press conference that the baby panda was found not breathing on its mother's belly. It had been returned on Tuesday to its mother's cage from an incubator, and zookeepers had heard its cries at 6:45 a.m. on Wednesday. Less than an hour later, they discovered the lifeless cub and tried to revive it by massaging its heart. The baby panda was confirmed dead at 8:30 a.m. local time. Only panda born in U.S. in 2010 named 'Po' ""The cub swallowed milk into its respiratory organs and developed pneumonia,"" Doi said, while wiping away tears. The seven-year-old mother, Shin Shin, had given birth to the baby after conceiving naturally, a first in Japan and a rare feat among the bears who have a low birth rate and are usually bred in zoos using artificial insemination. The cub was celebrated by the zoo as a success of its breeding program, and officials held daily press conferences since its birth last Thursday to report on its development. The cub was monitored around the clock and was occasionally placed in an incubator. Zoo officials said at the press conference that 60% to 70% of baby giant pandas die within their first week. China leased the mother, Shin Shin, and her mate, Ri Ri, to Japan in early 2011 for a fee of $1 million per year. China is known to use gifts or loans of pandas as gestures of diplomacy. After the cub's birth, a spokesman at the Chinese foreign ministry said the newborn could promote better relations between China and Japan. Shortly before the cub was born, Shintaro Ishihara, the governor of Tokyo, sparked outrage in China by suggesting the cub be named ""Sen Sen"" or ""Kaku Kaku"" -- both in reference to Senkaku, the Japanese name of disputed islands lying 120 miles east of Taiwan that are a prominent source of tension between the two countries. In 2010, a 14-year-old panda under loan by Japan died while under anesthesia during a semen-extraction procedure. Its death worsened the strained relations between China and Japan at the time over the islands, which are called Diaoyu in Chinese.

"(CNN) -- Education is under threat, but the Internet and the growth of Massive Open Online Courses are not to blame. Like the arts and journalism, whose value may be difficult to measure in dollars, higher education has long been understood as a rather ""soft"" pursuit. And this has led people to ask fundamental questions about it: . What is learning, really? And why does it matter unless, of course, it provides a workplace skill or a license to practice? Is the whole notion of a liberal arts education obsolete or perhaps an overpriced invitation to unemployment? The inability to answer these questions lies at the heart of universities' failure to compete with new online educational offerings -- the rapidly proliferating MOOCs -- as well as the failure of most Web-based schools to provide a valid alternative to the traditional four-year college. Education is about more than acquiring skills. When America and other industrialized nations created public schools, it was not to make better workers but happier ones. The ability to read, write and think was seen as a human right and a perquisite to good citizenship, or at least the surest way to guarantee compliant servitude from the workers of industrial society. If even the coal miner could spend some of his time off reading, he stood a chance of living a meaningful life. Moreover, his ability to read the newspaper allowed him to understand the issues of the day and to vote intelligently. What we consider basic knowledge has grown to include science, history, the humanities and economics. So, too, has grown the time required to learn it all. While the modern college might have begun as a kind of finishing school, a way for the sons of the elite to become cultured and find one another before beginning their own careers, it eventually became an extension of public school's mandate. We go to college to become smarter and more critical thinkers while also gaining skills we might need for the work force. Accordingly, we all wanted our sons and daughters to go to college until recently. The more of us who could afford it, the better we felt we were doing as a society. But the price of education has skyrocketed, especially in the tiny segment of elite schools. This has led to the widespread misperception that a good college education is available only to those willing to take on six-figure debt. Worse, in making the calculation about whether college is ""worth it,"" we tend to measure the cost of a Harvard education against the market value of the skills acquired. Did my kid learn how to use Excel? If not, what was the point? To the rescue come the MOOCs, which offer specific courses, a la carte, to anyone with a credit card; some even offer courses for free. Following the model of University of Phoenix, which began offering a variety of ""distance learning"" in 1989, these newer Web sites offer video lectures and forums to learn just about anything, in most cases for a few hundred dollars a class. MOOCs have exploded in the past few years, enrolling millions of students and sometimes partnering with major universities. For pure knowledge acquisition, it's hard to argue against such developments, especially in an era that doesn't prioritize enrichment for its own sake. But it would be a mistake to conclude that online courses fulfill the same role in a person's life as a college education, just as it would be an error to equate four years of high school with some online study and a GED exam. Don't get me wrong: I have always been a fan of online education -- but with a few important caveats. First off, subjects tend to be conveyed best in what might be considered their native environments. Computers might not be the best place to simulate a live philosophy seminar, but they are terrific places to teach people how to use and program computers. Second, and just as important, computers should not require the humans using them to become more robotic. I recently read an account from an online lecturer about how -- unlike in a real classroom -- he had to deliver his online video lectures according to a rigid script, where every action was choreographed. To communicate effectively online, he needed to stop thinking and living in the moment. That's not teaching; it's animatronics. Online learning needs to cater to human users. A real instructor should not simply dump data on a person, as in a scripted video, but engage with students, consider their responses and offer individualized challenges. The good, living teacher probes the way students think and offers counterexamples that open pathways. With the benefit of a perfect memory of student's past responses, a computer lesson should also be able to identify some of these patterns and offer up novel challenges at the right time. ""How might Marx have responded to that suggestion, Joe?"" Finally, education does not happen in isolation. Whether it's philosophy students arguing in a dorm about what Hegel meant, or fledgling Java programmers inspecting one another's code, people learn best as part of a cohort. The course material is almost secondary to the engagement. We go to college for the people. Likewise, the best of MOOCs should be able to bring together ideal, heterogeneous groupings of students based on their profiles and past performance, and also create ample opportunities for them to engage with one another in the spirit of learning. Perhaps this spirit of mutual aid is what built the Internet in the first place. Now that this massive collaborative learning project has succeeded, it would be a shame if we used it to take the humanity out of learning altogether. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: Education is under threat, but online computer courses are not to blame .

"(CNN) -- A couple of years ago I started a program to try to get rock-star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate -- government. It's called Code for America, and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks. We select a few fellows every year, and we have them work with city governments. Instead of sending them off into the Third World, we send them into the wilds of City Hall. And there they make great apps and work with city staffers. But really what they're doing is showing what's possible with technology today. Watch Jennifer Pahlka's TED Talk . One of the applications the Code for America fellows wrote last year is called Adopt-a-Hydrant. It lets Bostonians sign up to dig out fire hydrants when they're covered in snow. This is a modest little app, probably the smallest of the 21 apps the fellows built. But it's doing something that very few government technologies are doing: It's spreading virally. It's open-source, so anyone can take the code. Forest Frizzell in the IT department of the City of Honolulu found it and realized he could use it to recruit citizens to check on the tsunami sirens in his city to make sure they're functioning. Seattle is planning to use it to get citizens to clear clogged storm drains. Chicago has rolled it out to let people sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows. There are now nine cities we know of looking to use this app, and it's happening organically, frictionlessly. TED.com: Being young and making an impact . This app invites us to think a little differently about government. This is not how government normally procures software; that's generally a multi-year process. One of our teams of fellows built a web app for parents trying to find the right public school for their kids. The project took two fellows about two-and-a-half months. We were told that if it had gone through normal government channels, it would have taken two years and cost over $2 million. So an app that takes just a few days to write and spreads virally is a shot across the bow to the institution of government. It suggests how government might work more like the Internet itself: permissionless, open, generative. But what's more important is how a new generation is tackling the problem of government, not as the problem of an ossified institution, but as a problem of collective action. This is good news, because it turns out we have actually gotten very good at enabling collective action with digital technology. And when we can put aside all the emotional baggage we all carry about government, government is simply what we do together. If you've given up on government, I would ask you to reconsider -- because government is changing. Technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government by being a platform for citizens to help themselves and help others. Adopt-a-hydrant is a small example of government as a platform, but the story of the possums in Boston adds another element. Many cities now have a 311 line, where citizens can report issues. But some of them also have Web and mobile apps that do the same thing, and there's a difference. When you call in, it's person-to-person communication. If you use the app, your service request is public. One day, on Boston's 311 app, a resident reported a possum in her trash can, wondering if it was alive, and asked for help from the city in getting it removed. But because it was public, a neighbor saw it, and commented: . ""Walked over to West Ninth Street. Located trash can. Possum? Check. Living? Yep. Turned the trash can on its side. Good night, sweet possum."" In this case, a citizen helped another citizen, but government had a critical role: It connected them, and it could have connected them to government services if they'd been needed. But a neighbor helping a neighbor strengthens a community. Sending out Animal Control just costs money! TED.com: Paul Romer's radical idea -- charter cities . We have this opportunity to reframe government in very promising ways, but ""we the people"" are going to have to do few things differently if we want this to work. For one, we need to understand that government is not the same thing as politics, and that voting can't be our only input into the system of government. How often have we elected a new political leader and then expected everything to change? That doesn't work, because government is like a vast ocean, and politics is like the 6-inch layer on top. What's under that is bureaucracy. And the contempt that most people have for that word disempowers us. It allows a system that we own, and we pay for, to forever be something that works against us. People seem to think politics is sexy, but if we want this institution to work for us, we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy -- because that's where the real work of government happens. We can't do without government, but we do need it to be more effective. Secondly, we need to remember that we're not just consumers. We're citizens. And we are not going to fix government if we don't also fix citizenship. TED.com: Make data more human . The good news is there's a generation that has grown up on the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to do things together. Members of this generation have grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted. They have dozens of channels where they can express their opinions about any topic, so when they're faced with the problem of government, they don't care as much about using their voices. They're using their hands. They're using their hands to write applications that make government work better, but they're also writing apps that let us use our hands to make our communities work better: shoveling out a fire hydrant, pulling a weed, or turning over a garbage can for a neighbor. So, when it comes to the big important things we need to do together, are we just going to be a crowd of voices, or are we also going to be a crowd of hands? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jennifer Pahlka.","Jennifer Pahlka: A new generation has the potential to reinvent government .

"(CNN) -- For Kim Kardashian, the third engagement really is the charm. The 33-year-old reality star has gushed that the father of her child and now-fiancÃ©, Kanye West, pulled off a proposal this week that swept her off her feet. ""I am the luckiest girl in the world!"" Kardashian said to E!, which airs her family's reality series, ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians."" ""I get to marry my best friend!"" West and Kardashian have known each other for years, as West told Kardashian matriach Kris Jenner on her talk show in August, and for the Grammy-winning rapper it was love at first sight. ""I was in love with her before I even got to talk to her,"" West, 36, said. ""Being in the limelight, you have to have a match, or someone that's equally yoked. It's difficult, because there's people that you would date who would try to date you to maybe be more famous, or people who would want you to be less famous than you were, and just not accept who you are in life. And when I would be on the phone with (Kim), even at my lowest moments, she'd give me energy and remind me of who I was."" After dating publicly for a little over a year and welcoming their first child together, daughter North, in June, West popped the question on Kardashian's 33rd birthday Monday. The artist set up an elaborate surprise at San Francisco's AT&T Park, which he rented out for the proposal and filled with Kardashian's close friends and family members. Kardashian's mom knew what 'Ye was up to, as he'd asked her for her blessing. So on Monday, the artist got down on one knee and proposed as his question flashed on the arena's jumbotron: ""PLEEEASE MARRY MEEE!!!"" And that wasn't all: a 50-piece orchestra played Lana Del Rey's ""Young and Beautiful"" followed by West's own song with Keri Hilson, ""Knock You Down,"" with the whole extravaganza being topped off with fireworks. Accepting West's 15-carat Lorraine Schwartz sparkler, Kardashian responded to his proposal with an enthusiastic ""YES!!!""","Kim Kardashian has spoken on her new engagement .

"(CNN) -- With Halloween just around the corner, the weather is giving the northeastern quarter of the United States a taste of the chills to come this winter. A wintery cold front plunging down from Canada is shoving America's fall weather down toward the Gulf of Mexico and replacing it with frost and in some places snow. Jack Frost is nipping at noses in the Midwest, where temperatures are 10 to 15 degrees colder than average, the National Weather Service says. Thursday night temperatures are predicted to fall into the 20s, and residents from Missouri to Pennsylvania will need to unpack their ice scrapers for their morning commutes, along with winter coats. A belt of hard freezes threatens crops, as it stretches to farmland in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, extending possibly into the Carolinas and north Georgia. Moisture from the Great Lakes is predicted to combine with the cold weather to produce snow in areas downwind. Residents of Columbus, Ohio, and Baraboo, Wisconsin, watched flurries come down on Wednesday. Western New York state may see as much as a foot of snowfall in the coming days, but high temperatures will rise into the 40s, making it hard for much of it to stick. The World Series will not turn into a hockey match, but the brisk blast began rolling into Boston's Fenway Park in time for Game 1. The first pitch sliced through 48-degree air, making it the third-coldest start to the baseball championship. The blanket of frigid air should roll down over the mountain states by early next week, triggering sleet and snow, the weather service said. An early blizzard in South Dakota killed tens of thousands of heads of cattle and displaced thousands more in early October. A cold snap blindsided ranchers and caught cattle before their winter coats had grown out.","Temperatures in the Midwest are 10 to 15 degrees colder than average, weather service says .

"(CNN) -- A ninth motorcyclist has been arrested and charged in connection with the beating of an SUV driver on a Manhattan street on September 29, according to court documents. Jason Brown, 40, was taken into custody by the New York Police Department on Monday night and was arraigned Tuesday on charges of first degree gang assault and assault, as well as third degree criminal possession of a weapon and criminal mischief in the attack of motorist Alexian Lien. Brown is seen on video allegedly hitting Lien with his helmet, court documents state. In attack, can bikers get a fair shake? ""Those are serious crimes ... and serious allegations against him,"" said Brown's lawyer Stephen Pokart. ""The issue is: Do they have serious proof against him? And based on what the prosecutors offered the judge, it doesn't sound that way to me,"" he added. Authorities say Lien was chased by bikers after he initially bumped one during a biker rally. When his SUV was surrounded by several bikers, Lien called 911, told police he feared for his life and drove off, running over bikers and critically injuring one. Prosecutor: Off-duty officer 'terrorized' family as SUV driver was beaten . Lien's wife and 2-year-old daughter were in the vehicle with him. Lien has not been charged. The chase that followed ended in traffic. Police say Lien's windows were smashed. He was dragged out of the SUV and beaten. He was treated and released from a hospital. Brown is being held on $150,000 cash and $300,000 bond. His next court appearance is scheduled for October 25. The NYPD, which has appealed for the public's help in identifying people in photos, hasn't ruled out more arrests or charges. The beating drew widespread attention after a video of the incident was posted online. Of those arrested, at least three have been indicted by a grand jury. Three NYPD officers are under investigation for allegedly waiting several days to tell their superiors they were at the rally where the SUV driver was beaten and kicked. Outlaws or stunt artists?

"(CNN) -- Syria was plunged Wednesday into a nationwide blackout, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. A ""terrorist attack on the gas feeder line for a power plant"" in southern Damascus led to ""power outages in all provinces"" and efforts were under way to restore it, Electricity Minister Imad Khamis told SANA. Syrian activists were posting video to social media accounts showing what they described as a gas line fire near the Damascus airport. The video showed unidentified buildings in the dark, with a fire burning on higher ground behind the structures. And the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that a large explosion rocked Damascus late Wednesday. The blast targeted a government checkpoint and injured soldiers there, the London-based activist group said. In London on Wednesday, at a meeting of the ""Friends of Syria,"" the head of Syria's main opposition umbrella group laid out a list of conditions for participation in a conference to be held by the end of the year in Geneva with the goal of ending the bloodshed that has wracked the country since March 2011. Ahmad al-Jabra, leader of the Syrian National Coalition, said they include: . -- releasing prisoners; . -- lifting the siege from affected areas and allowing the entry of aid; . -- stopping the use in civilian areas of ballistic missiles, cluster bombs and fighters jets; . -- the departure from Syria of Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces; . -- the renewal without conditions of ex-pats' Syrian passports; . -- a commitment from President Bashar al-Assad to implement the provisions reached in the first such conference, dubbed Geneva 1; . -- a declaration by al-Assad to accept a transition of power to an interim government body with executive powers, written in the constitution; . -- an agreement by all sides that the transitional government is the sole source of legitimate law in the country; . -- an agreement that the U.N. Security Council will guarantee any agreement under Chapter VII of its charter, which would allow military action; . -- a timetable for the transition; . -- stipulation that those responsible for war crimes against humanity be removed from power and held accountable. British Foreign Minister William Hague told reporters Wednesday that al-Assad should play no political role in Syria. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said at least 33 people were killed Wednesday across Syria. State-run SANA said at least 10 people were killed in ""terrorist"" attacks in Damascus and Aleppo.

"Valdosta, Georgia (CNN) -- The family of a teen found dead in a rolled-up wrestling mat went to court Tuesday to demand a coroner's inquest into his death, arguing that conflicting autopsy reports require a second look by authorities. Chevene King, a lawyer for the parents of 17-year-old Kendrick Johnson, said he expected an inquest would find Johnson ""was the victim of foul play,"" not the accident that authorities in his south Georgia hometown have ruled. ""How could you, in the midst of all these questions, deny this family an opportunity to have an investigation into the cause and manner of their child's death?"" King asked. ""This is one way in which that investigation could be reopened."" School attorney: Others in surveillance footage in gym mat death case . The Johnson family has asked Lowndes County Coroner Bill Watson for an inquest before, in March. In May, after investigators closed the case, Watson had indicated he would be willing to hold one -- but he refused to discuss the issue in a recent interview with CNN, and there was no immediate response from Watson to Tuesday's filing. King said he expects a judge to hear the request by October 30. Kenneth Johnson told reporters that he expects a difficult fight, but added, ""Kendrick was my son. It can't be no harder than that."" A state medical examiner ruled the high school athlete suffocated in January after getting stuck head-down in the gym mat. But his parents, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, disputed the findings and won a court order to have their son's body exhumed for another autopsy. The private pathologist who conducted that autopsy in June found that Johnson had a blow to the right side of his neck ""consistent with inflicted injury."" And in the process, he discovered that the teen's body had been stuffed with newspaper after his internal organs were removed for the original autopsy -- a grisly find that only fueled the Johnson family's suspicions about their son's death. Parents want answers . In a coroner's inquest, a jury hears evidence and determines whether a death was the result of natural causes, an accident, suicide or homicide. Another lawyer for the family, Benjamin Crump, said the proceeding is needed ""so this family can have some peace in knowing what happened to their child."" ""This coroner has to consider witness testimony, video surveillance, in light of all the other things that are questionable about this to make not only the public have confidence in this finding, but this family to have some peace of knowing what really killed their child,"" Crump said. Authorities in Valdosta, about 230 miles south of Atlanta, say the case is closed. But the U.S. attorney for the district that includes the town has said he is reviewing the case and weighing whether to open his own investigation. Scene points to foul play . Friday, a lawyer for Lowndes County High School told CNN that surveillance footage from the gym shows other teens were inside around the time Johnson died. But the school has refused to release certain photos or video, citing state law that exempts the release of ""education records of a minor child."" The Johnson family has called for that video to be released, and Crump said a coroner's inquest may make that possible. ""If that video shows others in that gymnasium, as has been reported, then they have a right to have this coroner's inquest,"" he said. ""It is right, and justice demands so."" Autopsy shocker: Body stuffed with newspaper . CNN has now filed a motion to join a lawsuit by the family that seeks full access to the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office's investigative files in Johnson's death. In the motion, the network asserts that under the Georgia Open Records Act, the ""public has a right to evaluate the sheriff's conclusions, and further evaluate...the expenditure of public funds and the efficient and proper functioning of its institutions."" CNN is seeking the release of additional surveillance footage from the gym where Johnson was found dead, among other items. The sheriff's office asserts that some items within the investigation were withheld or redacted to protect the privacy of minors or because they constituted school records. CNN's Devon Sayers reported from Valdosta with Matt Smith in Atlanta.","Coroner should hold an inquest ""in the midst of all these questions,"" lawyer says .

"Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN)  -- President Obama announced what he called a ""meaningful and unprecedented"" climate change deal with China and other key nations that was expected to be sealed before the president headed home from the Copenhagen summit late Friday. ""For the first time in history, all major economies have come together to accept their responsibility to take action to confront the threat of climate change,"" Obama told reporters. The president said he met with leaders from India, China, Brazil and South Africa, and ""that's where we agreed ... to set a mitigation target to limit warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius."" It's a nonbinding goal, and the emissions targets ""will not be by themselves sufficient to get to where we need to get by 2050,"" Obama said. However, he added that it is a first step, and that for many countries ""this is going to be the first time in which even voluntary they offered up mitigation targets."" ""I think that it was important to essentially get that shift in orientation moving,"" Obama said. The president said he believes it's necessary that the countries get to a legally binding treaty, but said, ""If we just waited for that, we would not make any progress."" Earlier, a senior Obama administration official said, ""No country is entirely satisfied with each element but this is a meaningful and historic step forward and a foundation from which to make further progress. We thank the emerging economies for their voluntary actions and especially appreciate the work and leadership of the Europeans in this effort."" Critics of the U.N. Climate Change Conference have said that without specific commitments from the leaders to actually cut carbon emissions it would be difficult to reach any target. The deal calls on nations to submit their ""concrete commitments"" into an appendix attached to the agreement to specifically lay out each country's intentions for climate change, Obama said. Those commitments will be subjected to an international ""consultation and analysis"" that will help foster accountability among the nations. ""It will not be legally binding, but what it will do is allow for each country to show to the world what they're doing,"" Obama said, ""and there will be a sense on the part of each country that we're in this together, and we'll know who is meeting and who is not meeting, the mutual obligations that have been set forth."" Another senior administration official had said the precise details of the agreement were still in some flux, so it was unclear whether the final version would include language that was in earlier drafts aimed at forcing nations to set legally binding targets for reducing emissions. The president worked behind the scenes on getting a vote among key nations -- including China and India -- to approve the agreement before taking it to the wider group for a vote, according to the official. The first official added Obama would leave Copenhagen shortly after addressing the media about the tentative deal in order to return to Washington before a major snowstorm hits. CNN's Ed Henry contributed to this report.","NEW: President announces ""meaningful and unprecedented"" climate change accord .

"(CNN) -- Huddled around a table for hours, a handful of top journalists at CNN's political unit has been poring over YouTube videos by the thousands. The Republican hopefuls will face off Wednesday in the CNN/YouTube debate. It's a laborious process, but it's necessary to ensure the best questions make the cut for the CNN/YouTube debate between Republican presidential hopefuls in St. Petersburg, Florida, which will take place Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET. ""The questions are funny. Some of them are striking. Some of them are sad. They are incredibly meaningful,"" said Sam Feist, CNN's political director. ""You watch hundreds of these questions and you really get a sense of what's on people's minds."" The CNN producers have viewed more than 3,500 video submissions from people around the world. They'll continue sifting through more, through the submission deadline of November 25, right up to the debate. Only about 40 will pass muster.  Watch some of the questions sent in so far » . It's only the second time such a debate has taken place -- Democratic candidates duked it out in a similar format this past summer. That debate christened YouTube as a venue for prodding politicians and a way to get the public involved. While the GOP debate will also face a YouTube audience, don't expect to hear the same questions. ""This debate is to let  Republican voters pick from among their eight candidates,"" said David Bohrman, Washington bureau chief and senior vice president for CNN. ""We are trying to focus mostly on questions where there are differences among these candidates."" The White House hopefuls -- accustomed to the political tradition of stump speeches followed by queries from journalists -- have no idea exactly what to expect. ""There is some sense of the unknown and so they're going to be a little bit out of their normal comfort zone, which is a good thing,"" Bohrman said. Each of the eight GOP hopefuls will answer to real people displayed on a 25-foot screen (or their animated creations, as witnessed in the Democratic debate). The candidates will have to deal with the person asking the question as if that person were in the room. ""They really need to relate to these as people because they are very human. They are somebody somewhere who's taken the time to submit these questions,"" Bohrman said. And some of those submitters will be in the room -- creators of some of the most compelling questions will be flown to St. Petersburg to watch the debate in person and offer reactions afterward. The user-generated format marks a major step toward involving people in the process of selecting a nominee. It's also changed the way people view presidential debates. Unless someone happened to be in an Iowa farmhouse or a New Hampshire coffee shop, having an impact on the nominating process was ""impenetrable"" to outsiders Bohrman said, referring to the first two states to hold caucuses or a primary. That's no longer the case because questions asked during the Democratic CNN/YouTube debate continue to resonate on the campaign trail, according to Feist. ""We've really begun to find a way for people around the country and even around the world to play a significant role in the process. There's no going back from this. It may not look like this in 2012, but I think never again will there be no participation from the public,"" Bohrman said. So will any stars be born during this week's debate, like when Billiam the Snowman made a guest appearance during the Democratic debate? Will Jackie Broyles and Dunlap be back with the Red State update? CNN's political unit is keeping the questions a secret, but those selecting them say viewers should be prepared for presentations that are funny, questions that are poignant and a format that is unprecedented for the GOP. ""I'm not going to give you any hints about what sorts of questions we're going to pick or we're not going to pick,"" Feist said. ""There are plenty of animated figures out there, there are certainly some funny questions, but more importantly, there are hundreds, if not thousands of really, really good, solid questions from real people on real issues.""

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Police used water cannons to disperse hundreds of demonstrators gathered Tuesday in Istanbul's main commercial street to protest the building of a road through a university forest in the Turkish capital city of Ankara. Protesters gathered in Istiklal Street and chanted anti-government slogans such as, ""This is just the beginning, the resistance will continue,"" ""A thousand greetings to the resistance,"" ""Killer police will pay,"" and ""Police go away, these streets are ours."" The new round of protests in Istanbul erupted after the Ankara Municipality began cutting trees Friday in the Middle Eastern Technical University forest to make way for a highway development project. Police used their shields and water cannons to clear the main part of Istiklal Street, pushing protesters into side streets. ""This is not a designated meeting area. Please clear the street,"" the police announced over loudspeakers. One protester was knocked to the ground by a water cannon and lost consciousness for several minutes. ""In a bit they will start rounding up people. There is no law left in the country,"" said a lawyer from the Istanbul Bar Association on standby in case of detentions. Earlier in the day, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech delivered in parliament that the construction of the road would go on and criticized the demonstrators. ""For a road, everything can be sacrificed, because a road is civilization. But those who are not civilized will not understand the value of a road. They don't know it,"" he said. The ruling Justice and Development Party has come under criticism for its large-scale development projects. In May, widespread protests swept through Turkey over plans to turn a central Istanbul park into a shopping mall.","Demonstrators in Istanbul protest construction of a road through a forest in Ankara .

"(CNN) -- Kia Horton was thin as a little girl. ""Like fit your fingers around (my) ankles skinny,"" she recalls. But at 5, she says, she became a victim of sexual abuse, triggering more than a decade of poor eating habits. By the time she started eighth grade, she was borderline obese. At 15, Horton weighed almost 200 pounds. Her father allowed her to sign up for a diet meal delivery service. She lost 30 pounds on the program, but she says, ""I hated the food, and the program was not sustainable because eating their food was the only key to success."" She gained back the 30 pounds and then some. By the time she graduated college, she weighed 260 pounds. ""I immediately joined a gym and hired a personal trainer,"" Horton says. ""This also proved to be futile because I was not ready to change my eating habits."" She lost no weight working out with the trainer. ""I quit!"" she remembers thinking. Her bad eating habits continued, and in 2006, at 31, the Chicagoan topped out at her heaviest weight of 319 pounds. Horton is 5 feet 4 inches; her body mass index at the time was 54.8, which is considered morbidly obese. ""Every night for dinner I would stop and get two Happy Meals from McDonald's,"" she says. She didn't have kids at the time, but Horton acted like she was ordering the meals for her children. She didn't want anyone to realize she was eating both kids' meals by herself. Everything felt out of control, Horton says. She didn't have a great relationship with her mother, she didn't feel valued at her job, and some of her personal relationships were in disarray. For weeks at a time, she wouldn't interact with family or friends outside of her co-workers. She continued to allow food to be her comfort. ""Food was the only thing that was good,"" she remembers. ""It didn't talk back."" She knew starting a weight loss journey would be useless if she didn't address the issues that led her to gain the weight in the first place. ""There was so much going on in every aspect of my life,"" says Horton, now 38. ""I would have lasted on a diet for a week."" Making progress . At her heaviest weight, in 2007, Horton got engaged. She knew she wanted to look amazing in her wedding gown. But she often wondered, ""How can I possibly look good in a wedding dress at 300 pounds?"" Horton had begun attending therapy sessions in her early 30s to work through the early childhood abuse and other personal issues. Now she felt she was ready to consider weight-loss surgery. Horton had the Lap-Band procedure done in March 2006. Doctors placed an adjustable band around her stomach, restricting its capacity, which limited the amount of food she could consume. She was supposed to have the band tightened every three months to continue losing weight. But shortly after the procedure, Horton became pregnant with her first child. She was ecstatic. But after learning of her pregnancy, doctors told her they wouldn't be able to adjust the band during her pregnancy or if she breast-fed. Horton had lost 50 pounds by the time her daughter, Asha, was born in February 2007, but she hasn't had the band adjusted since. She married a few months later and became pregnant again. But five months into her pregnancy, she lost the baby. Stress from the miscarriage and other personal problems caused Horton and her husband, Otto, to split shortly after saying their vows. All of a sudden, she was a single mom. She began eating again to deal with her pain. Two years later, Horton and Otto reconciled. He moved back home, and they had a son in 2010. By then, she was back up to 300 pounds. 'You have such a pretty face' Out with her girlfriends for dinner in January 2012, Horton began chatting with a stranger who was extremely fit and a bit of a health buff. ""You have such a pretty face,"" he said. ""Have you ever thought about losing weight?"" Usually, Horton would have been offended by such a question. But she realized he didn't know about her past weight-loss struggles and began to mull over the question he'd posed. The next week, Horton put a call out to her Facebook friends, saying she wanted a friend to join Weight Watchers with her. She began the program on January 17, 2012, and she hasn't looked back. The first week, Horton lost four pounds. ""I almost jumped off the scale!"" she says. ""I couldn't believe it."" It was just the push she needed to continue. By March 6, she was down 25 pounds. Lifestyle changes and support . Horton follows the guidelines of the Weight Watchers plan by counting points and taking accountability for everything she puts in her body. She has oatmeal almost every morning for breakfast. For dinner, she sticks to protein and plenty of vegetables. But at lunch, she says, she eats out every single day. Her strategy? ""I literally check out every item on the food menus in my local area, and I make conscious choices and good decisions on what I am putting in my body."" She also incorporated exercise into her routine. ""I have never been very patient, so I knew in order to stick with this I was going to need to see results fast."" She began to do Zumba with her husband and kids on their Wii game console. She started walking the trail around her neighborhood, then running. By July 2012, with her new active lifestyle, she was down to 225 pounds. Today, Horton has reached her goal weight of 142 pounds and, to be honest, she doesn't know what's next. She's thinking of dealing with some of the excess skin that she has from the weight loss, but other than that, she says she's comfortable with her weight and body. She's lost a total of 177 pounds from her highest weight and says she feels like ""a totally different person."" Horton credits her husband with some of her success, saying he's been supportive since Day One of her weight-loss journey. She appreciates that he's never tried to change her eating habits or derail her plan, even though the couple find it costs more to eat healthy. ""I eat about a pound or two pounds of grapes per day. It's an expensive habit,"" she says, laughing. ""He hasn't divorced me for driving us to financial ruin because of my grape habit."" She'll also soon start work as a part-time receptionist for the Weight Watchers in her neighborhood. She says she's excited to help others and considers herself the first line of offense: The receptionist is the person a potential Weight Watcher speaks to about their trials and triumphs when they check in. Plus, it will help her stay accountable because anyone who works for Weight Watchers must stay at their goal weight. ""The best advice I can give to people is to face their whole life down,"" she says. Horton says she believes weight gain is a symptom of other issues. ""You can't take control over just one aspect of your life; you have to take control over everything. Once you do that, then your journey can begin."" Do you have a weight-loss success story?

"(CNN) -- An Ohio driver recently made a confession that he caused a fatal wrong-way crash after drinking heavily. That, by itself, nothing new. After all, every day, hundreds of suspects sign full confessions, and many more defendants plead guilty before a judge. A person volunteering to take criminal responsibility is not a novel concept. In fact, it's commonplace procedure in police interview rooms and courthouses. Nor is it unique that these admissions are videotaped; police often tape interview confessions and courtrooms record most guilty pleas. What's novel in this case is the way he took that responsibility: 1) On his own. 2) Online. Via video. He took the initiative. In a remarkably well-produced, three-and-a-half minute video, Matthew Cordle admitted he killed a suburban Columbus man, said he ""made a mistake"" in deciding to drive that evening and urged people not to drink and drive. In making this video, it clearly appeared he was not coerced. He was not being interrogated or even interviewed by police. In fact, he volunteered this admission, stating that he was fully aware of the consequences. Skeptics have suggested the online confession is not sincere and he only produced the video to curry favor with the court to receive a lesser sentence. Quite the contrary, Cordle has risked sealing his fate with a maximum sentence by giving this confession. Many others have applauded this act by Cordle. Undoubtedly there is a benefit to society in taking responsibility. He not only gives the victim's family closure, but he also saves the people of the state of Ohio the cost and burden of a trial. Even the victim's ex-wife has opined that perhaps Cordle deserves some consideration for his video apology. Bravo, right? Wrong. While this may have appeared a morally correct thing for Cordle to do, our justice system can actually penalize those who ""do the right thing"" and volunteer admissions. Cordle's case just might end up as an example of this. In a criminal prosecution, the strongest playing card in the hand of the defendant is a guilty plea. Sometimes, it's the only card he holds. In Cordle's case, assuming for the moment that this case was what we defense attorneys call a ""dead-bang loser"" (one likely to be lost at trial), then his defense attorney could have approached the prosecution and made an offer: In exchange for a lesser sentence or charges, Cordle would plead guilty, apologize to the family and save the prosecutor's office the manpower and the burden of trying the case, and ultimately, the risk of losing at trial. In return, the prosecution would agree to a lesser sentence or a lesser charge. In this case, Cordle's voluntary mea culpa actually eliminated his strongest bargaining chip. The defense now has nothing to offer the prosecution, so the prosecution has no incentive to make any concessions in a plea offer. Now, if this were a business transaction or negotiation, you'd say: well, that's the way business is. Too bad, so sad. That's just market forces and economic Darwinism at work. But prosecutors have a greater moral obligation than a CEO or an investor. They cannot simply exploit any weakness in the defendant's bartering position. Prosecutors have a greater moral obligation: justice. It's not an easy job at all. So, has Cordle's prosecutor adequately considered the video? The prosecutor in this case has said he will seek the maximum sentence and suggested that his office has enough evidence to seek a conviction notwithstanding the video confession. The maximum sentence? Is that how we should incentivize taking responsibility? After all, Cordle is partially correct in that he has spared resources and offered a judicially efficient resolution. In the video, Cordle says: ""I consulted some high-powered attorneys, who told me stories about similar cases where the drivers got off. They were convinced that they could get my blood test thrown out. And all I would have to do for that was lie. Well, I won't go down that path."" First, it's doubtful any experienced DUI lawyer really told Cordle to lie. The obvious reason is that it's unethical. But second, thanks to modern defense strategies and technology, challenging breath and blood testing has arguably never been more effective. Recently, courts have invalidated scores of breath and blood tests for a myriad of reasons related to the reliability of the science as applied, including improper blood draws/retention, administration of tests, noncalibration of blood testing devices and improper lab procedures. Because DUI trials can be burdensome for the prosecution, most jurisdictions have adopted some version of a pretrial program to treat this crime differently than most others. The quid pro quo is usually this: The defendant admits to what he did, gets a one-time admission to probation and a ton of fines and fees, avoiding a criminal conviction, and the prosecution is saved the burden of calling breathalyzer operators and lab technicians to trial and avoids the risk of loss at trial. As in the court system, drinking and driving is also treated differently than other taboos in society. Certainly in public, we all agree it's wrong. But when a rustic pub is isolated on a winding country back road and the parking lot is filled with cars on a Friday night, does anyone doubt how the patrons arrived? Or how they plan to leave? There are not a lot of subway stops, taxis or bus routes out at the more rural watering holes or even in the city suburbs. We publicly oppose drinking and driving, but we also are all aware it's going on everywhere -- and with our tacit permission. Until we resolve the social paradox that is drinking and driving, more than a few citizens will read about Cordle's case and admit, to themselves: ""coulda been me."" Or worse: ""that was me last Saturday."" What happens when or if it is you that is in Cordle's position? Will you still be an anti-DUI crusader? Will you fight the breath and blood tests tooth-and-nail? Or will you take personal responsibility? YouTube video, perhaps? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Danny Cevallos.","Ohio man confesses online to killing someone while driving drunk .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Charles Schumer, saying he sees few tangible benefits for passengers, called Sunday on the Transportation Security Administration to reverse its decision to allow small pocketknives on airplanes. At an afternoon news conference in New York, Schumer said TSA agents would be distracted by having to measure knives and other items like baseball bats. ""These items are dangerous, and have not become less so in the years since they were banned from planes,"" the New York Democrat said. ""Now is not the time for reduced vigilance, or to place additional burdens on TSA agents who should be looking for dangerous items."" During the news conference, Schumer held up a slender bladed object that he said would be allowed under the new rules. ""It looks dangerous and it is dangerous. This can kill someone,"" he said. A representative from Schumer's office later identified the object as a knife similar to ones made by office supply companies. The TSA subsequently responded by saying that knife would not be allowed on flights under new regulations because the blade can be locked in place and because the blade appeared to be a razor blade, which remain banned from passenger airplanes. Schumer's request on the TSA rule change came a day after U.S. Rep. Ed Markey also came out against the TSA's move. In a letter to TSA Administrator John Pistole, the Massachusetts Democrat expressed concern about the new policy and asked it be reversed. ""The attacks on September 11, 2001, demonstrated that in the confined environment of an airplane, even a small blade in the hands of a terrorist can lead to disaster,"" wrote Markey, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat recently vacated by John Kerry. ""In addition, the additional responsibility of assessing which knives meet the new requirements could be a distraction for already overburdened screeners at TSA checkpoints, potentially leading to increased wait times and decreased security."" Knives on a plane? Really? Under the rules outlined this week, knives with blades no longer than 2.36 inches (6 centimeters) and less than a half-inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins as long as the blade is retractable and does not lock into place. Razorblades and box cutters are still prohibited. The rules also allow a passenger to carry two golf clubs, toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry-on luggage. Pistole said the move brings the United States into alignment with international rules and is in keeping with his ""risk-based security"" approach. Kip Hawley, who oversaw the TSA from 2005 to 2009, said the search for knives interferes with the search for objects such as bombs and toxins that can threaten aircraft. Ex-TSA chief backs decision . But others have sharply criticized the change, which takes effect April 25. They include the Flight Attendants Union Coalition, a nearly 90,000-member group that has launched a campaign to reverse the TSA's decision. The policy is also opposed by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, a union representing more than 26,000 officers from 65 agencies. Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson said Friday he shares the same ""legitimate concerns"" as his flight attendants. Delta CEO opposed to allowing small knives on aircraft . ""If the purpose is to increase security checkpoint flow, there are much more effective steps we can take together to streamline the security checkpoints with risk-based screening mechanisms,"" he wrote in a letter to Pistole. CNN's Jordana Ossad and Greg Botelho contributed to this story .","Senator from New York says ""now is not the time for reduced vigilance""

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- The most foolish argument I've heard from the never-ending efforts to discourage young Nigerians from cybercrime is that money isn't everything. Well, lack isn't everything either. There's also the equally common argument about integrity being worthier than wealth, as if a dichotomy must always exist between the two. No wonder the many 419 scammers -- for whom the specter of a destitute and unfulfilled future is a daily terror -- don't appear ready to budge from their fraudulent ways. And so it was with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism that I attended an 'Alternatives to Cybercrime' event organized by Microsoft and Paradigm Initiative Nigeria (PIN). What new doctrine did the anti-cybercrime brigade have to preach this time? My 419 scams-themed novel had earned me an invitation to address the audience of university and secondary school students. Another guest speaker was Adeolu Akinyemi, a young man who runs Street Skills, an organization that rehabilitates 419 scammers. The more he spoke, the more I found myself sitting straighter in my chair with rapt attention. No, he doesn't warn the fraudsters against the ills of materialism or notify them that money doesn't buy happiness. That grand sermon may wait until after they can afford three square meals a day. Adeolu's method is to teach the young men how to use the same skills developed from years of diligently scamming hard currency from gullible Westerners, to make legitimate money online. Felix Ekpa, the very first case Adeolu worked with, was a successful 419 scammer between 2004 and 2007. The 31-year-old now makes an honest living from various online businesses. I went searching for him after the event. ""I have been actively involved in network marketing for about three years and I daresay it is the shortest and fastest way to living the life of your dreams,"" he told me. The former scammer also trades Forex in his spare time. Felix first contacted Adeolu in 2007 after coming across his blog which provided information on various online investment schemes. He was intrigued enough to contact Adeolu requesting a meeting. ""When we met, I was shocked to see someone of my age range,"" he said. ""So it was easy for me to tell him my story and how I had been motivated by his write ups and how I was looking forward to change if he was going to help."" Under Adeolu's tutelage, Felix eventually felt confident enough in his new line of work to completely abandon the old. Both men then decided to reach out to other scammers. Thus, Street Skills was born. Felix started by reaching out to the scammers he knew personally, his former colleagues. His experiences as a ""former street boy"" now making money through legitimate means enabled him to get through to some of the scammers, he said. Today, Felix is Adeolu's partner and the ""Lead Driver"" of Street Skills. ""He heads the organization, and I play a support role,"" Adeolu said, adding that his aim is to ""push"" Felix as a positive role model, since he's ""been there and done that."" Felix has also done some restitution, refunding his victims their swindled money. One of his former victims was shocked when he confessed that he had been scamming her all along. Then Felix promised to refund her the approximately $25,000 he swindled from her. He eventually sent an initial $1000, followed by several other installments. ""She is now more of a family friend, as she is in touch with my family and friends till date,"" he said. A brief survey of Nigeria's 419 communities appears to present three distinct categories of scammers. The first are the pioneers of the late 80s and early 90s, common criminals who simply saw yet another opportunity to make a dishonest living. The second, mostly university graduates from decent backgrounds, were chance criminals who found respite from unemployment and hopelessness, in scamming. It didn't help that they had watched the first category scam their way to respectability and philanthropy. The third group had simply observed the second, and saw them as role models. Like their heroes, they also desired to ride fast cars, have assorted damsels perch on their arms and occupy prominent seats at public functions. Despite being well provided for by his family, university graduate Felix says he fell into this third category of criminals after observing the lavish display of wealth and big cars driven by ""small boys"" in his area. ""I got curious, asked questions, and the adventurous side of me took over,"" he said. ""I learned the game and got involved. It was fun and the easiest way to make real money. It was quite lucrative."" Street Skills says it currently has about 10 rehabilitated scammers that have found legitimate opportunities to fend for themselves and their families, there are also around 40 who they describe as ""work in progress."" But their vocation is certainly not a stroll in the park; it takes patience to break into these networks and convince the scammers to opt for money-making opportunities that won't have them constantly looking over their shoulders. Those who eventually sign up for ""rehabilitation"" are then followed up with seminars and training, where they are taught the basics of network marketing, entrepreneurship, e-books marketing and internet marketing till they actually start making money through the opportunities presented to them. Unfortunately, a lean purse has forced Street Skills to go from monthly group meetings to more one-on-one sessions, which Felix says are not as effective as group meetings. Most of the funding for the work they do comes from his and Adeolu's pockets and he believes proper funding would allow them to set up more centers around Nigeria . But there is an increasing number of young people turning to email scams in the country. ""You'd be shocked to learn that we have youth as young as 15 in the cybercafes, sending scam mails to unknowing victims. Some are in secondary schools, while some are not even educated,"" Felix said. He believes a long-term solution is to provide these young people with alternative occupations. The world can continue to fight as hard as it will against 419 scams, but the 18 and 19-year-olds who troop to Nigerian cybercafes everyday in search of that one ignoramus americanus or britanus -- whose hard currency will transform their lives -- have more severe worries to contend with than fear of the FBI or Interpol. And until these idle youngsters find a better alternative to the work which Beelzebub has found for them, sadly, the world will know no rest from their torment.","Microsoft organized the 'Alternatives to Cybercrime' event in Nigeria .

"(CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama's official trip to southern Africa next week will focus on youth leadership and education, and will include meetings with key figures in the anti-apartheid struggle. Obama will make stops in South Africa and Botswana during the weeklong visit that starts Monday. She will highlight the benefits of education and wellness, and urge youth in the continent to be part of the national dialogue, according to the White House. ""The trip is a continuation of Mrs. Obama's work to engage young people, especially girls and young women, at home and abroad,"" the White House said. The first lady's first stop will be in Pretoria, where she will meet with South African President Jacob Zuma. Before heading to Johannesburg and Cape Town, she will take a tour of an apartheid museum with Nelson Mandela's wife, Graca Machel. She will also visit Robben Island, where Mandela was held for the majority of the 27 years he was in detention for fighting apartheid. The schedule released by the White House did not mention a meeting with the 92-year-old former president. The latter part of the trip includes a meeting with Nobel laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and a visit to Soweto and the site of the 2010 World Cup. Her visit to neighboring Botswana will include a tribute to girls overcoming hurdles to success. In addition to visits with top leaders, she will also attend a series of public events, meet embassy officials and take part in community service projects in both countries. After a safari, she will depart from the Botswana capital of Gaborone on Sunday. Her visit marks the second to sub-Saharan Africa by a member of the Obama family since the president took office more than two years ago. President Barack Obama went to Ghana in 2009.The first lady made similar trips to Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, India, Mexico and the United Kingdom. She will be accompanied by her mother, Marian Robinson, and two daughters, Sasha and Malia.","Michelle Obama's first stop will be in Pretoria to meet South African President Jacob Zuma .

"(CNN) -- Never work with children or animals they say. But for artist Chris Levine, who has previously photographed Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, the opportunity to digitally capture super horse Frankel in portrait was just too good an opportunity to turn down. After all, it's not often you are given the chance to capture greatness. For an artist who has worked with supermodel Kate Moss and diva Grace Jones this was an assignment harder that it might seem. He spent two days with Frankel -- the first horse he has shot -- to produce his otherworldly 3D image of the stallion. ""On the light box he literally is luminescent,"" said Levine of his work, set to be unveiled on Champions Day at Ascot Racecourse this weekend. ""It somehow goes beyond the physical and into the spiritual. ""This beautiful creature is a divine creation ... Life is a pretty miraculous phenomenon that we're all part of, it's an unfolding miracle. An animal like Frankel, if you contemplate it, is a divine creation."" Levine's striking portrait of the Queen -- entitled ""Lightness of Being"" -- was unveiled in 2004 and the photographer suggests sport's foremost thoroughbred shares a magisterial quality with the world's most famous monarch. The artist depicted the Queen in full white regalia with her eyes closed almost as if she was inhaling the essence of power. ""They're supreme beings with iconic status,"" Levine told CNN. ""We were really interested in shooting icons, they don't necessarily have to be human icons. ""I saw it when I looked at (Frankel's) head shot, you could see that this really was a great being. ""For some reason it made me think of emperors on a coin, you get a profile shot of a head of state, somehow it was aligning with that contextually."" While Queen Elizabeth's reign is very much ongoing, Frankel ended his two-year racing career with a perfect 14-0 winning record. He is now enjoying a lucrative retirement with trainers paying Â£125,000 ($199,000) to breed their mares with ahorse . ""Frankel is a superstar,"" explained Levine. ""He's got a huge following. It was a real challenge, to take it somewhere different in the land of equine images, portraiture and art. ""I wanted to do something that portrayed Frankel as extraordinary. He really is an octave about greatness. I wanted to convey the extremity of what he is."" The finished product, which is 1.2 meters wide and 90 centimeters high, is the culmination of months of work which began when Levine asked to photograph Frankel. ""We got an enthusiastic response and they were terrific and made Frankel available to me,"" said Levine. ""We wanted to shoot the horse in direct sunlight because that would really show his coat. ""We had about six days on standby waiting on the weather, we shot it in two days. In terms of post-production and editing it's been about two months."" Frankel might not be racing any longer but it didn't take long for Levine to understand why this horse transcended its sport. ""You take the bridle off and this is a horse that is so pumped up that it will just go,"" he said. ""At that level it is just supercharged. That was my first challenge. ""In the end I shot it in the stable. We did a lot of shots of the horse outside, but he was always being held back. He had so much vitality and energy. ""He's used to having photos taken of him, he's a superstar. He actually likes the attention and you can kind of tell."" Levine is not the first artist to draw inspiration from Frankel. British surrealist painter Mick Kirkbride depicted the horse leaping out of a television set following its demolition of the field in 2011's 2000 Guineas race. The global spotlight isn't Frankel's alone. Equestrian's ""Super Mare"" Black Caviar retired in April this year with a record which puts her male rival's in the shade, winning all 25 of her races. Horse racing's first lady earned legions of fans in her homeland of Australia, even gracing the cover of the country's edition of prestigious fashion magazine Vogue. With the media glare focused almost constantly on these two champion horses, they have grown accustomed to the flash of cameras, and it's just as well. To capture his final image of Frankel, Levine first shot the horse with multiple cameras before conducting a complete 3D body scan to produce a virtual wireframe of its body. The scan allowed Levine to build a virtual model of Frankel, laying bare its physical prowess. ""I really felt that in itself was really interesting, just to see the horse in wireframe, to see that construction, the power and the physique, broken down into geometry,"" said the artist. ""It was quite an unusual thing to look at ... The beauty of the animal is in the entirety of his body. I wanted to shoot the horse naked in all his glory, but couldn't because of practical problems."" After making his first foray into equine photographer, Levine would prefer to revert back to human subjects for his next portraits. And after picturing three of the world's most recognizable women, he's looking to shoot two of the planet's most famous men: David Bowie and Nelson Mandela. ""Bowie has been a huge influence on me artistically and he really strikes a chord with me,"" said Levine. ""Nelson Mandela for being of greatness, both are icons.""","""Frankel the Great"" portrait to be unveiled at Ascot Racecourse .

"(CNN) -- What do you do with 6,000 tons of space junk traveling at thousands of miles an hour? Harpoon it of course. It might sound like a scenario straight off the pages of a science fiction novel but it is a suggested solution to an increasing and potentially costly problem in space -- that of debris littering low earth orbit. The harpoon plan is one of a range of options being discussed by scientists at a forum in Germany next week, and aimed at finding a way of tackling space debris that threatens commercial operations. Engineer Jaime Reed, who is leading the harpoon project for the space technology company Astrium, explains that if a rogue satellite hits another, not only does it ruin the mission but it creates more debris and propagates the problem. This run-away scenario is often called the Kessler Syndrome, named after NASA's Don Kessler who first highlighted the risk. ""There's a lot of space debris -- 6,000 tons in orbit -- that could pose a threat,"" said Reed. ""Perhaps unwittingly, the average person relies a lot on space -- GPS in their phones, telecoms, TV, weather forecasts -- they are things people expect to have,"" he said. Read more: 3 new planets could host life . ""Space debris could very easily take out some of those satellites -- it would have a real impact on people's lives."" Astrium's plan to tackle defunct satellites is to use an unmanned chase spacecraft to get in range, fire a barbed harpoon into the body of the rogue hardware and then use a smaller propulsion unit attached to a tether to tow it back towards the atmosphere where it will burn up safely on re-entry. ""Because the harpoon we are using is very light and the chase satellite more than a ton, momentum is very tiny... it's a small recoil,"" said Reed. The harpoon system has been tested in the laboratory in the UK and Reed will present findings at the conference on Wednesday. Reed estimates that the system could tackle 10 targets per mission and says simulations show that if five to 10 objects were removed each year then that would ""stabilize the debris population."" Read more: NASA shoots for asteroid . He said he hoped the next step would be a demonstration mission to capture something small. So how big is the problem? Reed warns that if space junk is not removed it could mean that low-earth orbit might eventually become unusable. According to NASA there are about 20,000 pieces of space junk bigger than 10cm (3.9 inches) and its chief scientist for orbital debris Nicholas L. Johnson says most robotic satellite missions are vulnerable to particles as small as 5mm (0.2 inches) -- there are thought to be millions of those in orbit. ""A 5mm (0.2 inches) particle striking a large solar array is likely to have a very little long-lasting effect, but such an object hitting the main body of a satellite could cause a vital component to fail,"" he said. ""Normally, it takes the impact of an object about 10cm (3.9 inches) or larger to cause the satellite to suffer a severe fragmentation in which large numbers of new debris would be created. ""Collision speeds can vary from less than 1km per second (2,236mph) to 16km per second (35,790mph)."" He explained that ground-based radars are able to track objects of about 10cm (3.9 inches) and sometimes smaller, depending on altitude above the earth, while other sensors can detect particles down to about 5mm (0.2 inches) in low earth orbit. ""Space debris poses real threats to both human space flight and robotic missions. However, today those threats are largely handled by spacecraft design and operation techniques,"" said Johnson. ""Since the 1980s considerable efforts have been made to curtail the creation of new space debris."" The NASA scientist said the odds of an operational satellite being disabled by space debris remain quite small, though he points out that two have been lost after being hit by man-made debris -- a French satellite in 1996 and an American craft in 2009. Last month, CNN reported that space debris left over from a 2007 Chinese missile test had collided with a Russian satellite, according to a researcher at the Center for Space Standards & Innovation. And in 2012 the crew of the space station were ordered into escape capsules as a precaution after a piece of debris passed close by. Both Reed and Johnson say the focus over the last 30 years has been on mitigation but NASA and other space agencies are looking at ways to remove large derelict spacecraft and rocket launch stages from low earth orbit. The harpoon is clearly aimed at capturing the larger objects but many other solutions have been proposed, including the use of lasers to nudge space junk out of the way, or using giant nets and space tugs. ""It's a very active area,"" said Reed. ""Lots of people are coming up with ideas.""

"(CNN) -- It began with high hopes and lofty rhetoric, as a newly reelected President Barack Obama ended his State of the Union wish list with a call to action: ""It remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter in our American story."" But 2013 will hardly be remembered as a great chapter. Instead, even with Wednesday's debt ceiling and government funding deal, this is a wasted year in Washington, one of more band-aid budgeting, polarized partisanship and Republican chaos. Yes, public opinion polls suggest the government shutdown and debt ceiling crisis is more damaging to Republicans than to the President and his fellow Democrats. And Obama gives up little in the deal struck Wednesday to fund the government through January and raise the debt ceiling through early February. But with precious time in his second term ticking by, it is safe to say the President is losing even as he may ""win"" the short-term political blame game. In defeat, Boehner may live to fight another day . Consider the priorities laid out in his February State of the Union Address: . *A new jobs plan . *Infrastructure investments targeting roads and the 70,000 American bridges he noted are deemed structurally unsound . *An increase, to $9 an hour, in the federal minimum wage . *A guarantee of quality pre-school education for every child in America . *New background checks for gun purchases and, the President asked, for an up or down vote on new gun restrictions, including a ban on certain assault style weapons . *Plus sweeping immigration reform, including, in his words, ""a reasonable pathway to earned citizenship."" Also in his address: a plea to end the budgeting by brinksmanship and crisis and a hopeful call for bipartisan negotiations on tax reform and Medicare and other entitlement spending. Eight months later -- as the end of that critical first year of the presidential term comes into focus -- none of those priorities has been realized. Not one. Nine things we missed during the shutdown . And Washington's dysfunction appears to be only deepening, as differences between Democrats and Republicans are often overshadowed by the internal civil war within the GOP. Don't count on that environment improving once Washington stumbles its way past this latest crisis. The deal provides a temporary fix - essentially kicking the can down the road to January and February to give Congress and the White House time to negotiate. A welcome respite, perhaps, but the issues won't get any easier over the course of those three or four months, and the politics - believe it or not - could get even more difficult because those new deadlines are early in the midterm election year. Republican shutdown pain may boost Dems in 2014 .","With high hopes after reelection, President Obama sounded call to action .

"(CNN) -- The mystery winner of a New York lottery ticket worth $1 million has until Sunday to claim the prize, or the money will return to a pool for future winners, according to state lottery officials. The winning lottery ticket was purchased at the Playland Market in Rye on August 25, 2012. According to New York Gaming Commission rules, winners have up to one year to claim their prize. New York Lottery officials have been urging players to check their tickets for the winning numbers: 1-6-7-20-49, Powerball 23, and come forward before the ticket expires. ""We're hopeful the lucky winner has already signed the ticket and is making plans to claim it before it's too late,"" said Gardner Gurney, acting director of the Division of the Lottery. The New York Gaming Commission uses all means possible to get the word out when it is presented with an unclaimed prize, including news media and social media, said Christy Calicchia, spokesperson for the commission. Sandy victims among the 'Ocean's 16' Powerball winners . To claim the money, the winner must present the ticket at any one of New York's seven customer service centers during business hours. Since the one-year anniversary of the ticket's purchase falls on a Sunday, the winner would technically need to have presented the ticket by the close of business Friday, said Calicchia. It is unclear how the situation would be handled if the ticket were to be turned in on Monday, she said. Lottery winners may also turn in winning tickets by mail. As long as the ticket is postmarked by August 25, it will be deemed valid. The gaming commission will be monitoring incoming mail to see if the ticket turns up, Calicchia said. New York state has seen several prizes go unclaimed, the largest of which was drawn more than a decade ago. In 2002, the owner of a winning ticket sold in Brooklyn never came forward to collect the $68 million prize. It remains the highest jackpot to go unclaimed in New York Lottery history. The next year, a ticket in Brooklyn went unclaimed again, this time for a jackpot of $46 million. Winnings can go unclaimed for a variety of reasons, Calicchia said, noting sometimes tickets or lost or become unreadable after being left in a pocket and washed. She said many tickets are unclaimed because winners don't notice they scored with smaller, tiered prizes in lottery jackpots. ""Most people don't realize that there is more than one prize in the lottery drawing,"" she said. Rye is in Westchester County and is about 30 miles north of New York City.

"(CNN) -- Facebook's latest defense of the mental distraction it creates for its users? It's not a bug, it's a feature! At least that's the meaning I take from a Web commercial for the new smartphone start screen, Facebook Home, in which founder Mark Zuckerberg's announcement of the portal's launch is disrupted and interrupted by a host of Facebook updates. ""After all your hard work,"" he says to a group of employees in their work space, ""Facebook Home is ready to ship."" But as he continues, one employee glances down distractedly at his phone and begins thumbing through his, new, supercharged Facebook Home device. Zuckerberg's voice fades as a ""screaming goat"" appears on a desk and bleats loudly. A friend leaps out of nowhere, racquet in hand, saying, ""Dude, forget work -- come play!"" Eventually, the whole office is a race track and then even a pool party that only the one, distracted employee can see and hear. Of course, the employee has missed the whole announcement. When it's over and Zuckerberg asks for his response, he glibly replies, ""You know it, Mark."" Zuckerberg has no idea he's been ignored. By casting himself as the butt of the joke, it's as if Zuckerberg seeks to inoculate himself from critique. Can't we all just lighten up? Everyone knows that this stuff is distracting. We have all pretended to be listening to someone on the phone or in real life while actually checking e-mail. At least Facebook is aware of it, and -- if the commercial is to be believed -- the distractions it offers are pretty darned engaging. Yes, you can be with your friends and at work at the same time. Except you can't. The ad is an apt, if sanguine, depiction of what I've been calling ""present shock,"" the human incapacity to respond to everything happening all at once. In a rapid-fire, highly commercial digital environment, this sense of an overwhelming ""now"" reaches new heights. Unlike computer chips, human beings can only process one thing at a time. Whatever succeeds in attracting our attention only wins it at the expense of something else. Joke as we might like about it, our efficiency, our accuracy, our memory and our depth of understanding go down when we try to multitask. Yet Facebook collapses time in more ways than that. Consider how people from your distant past, as far back as, say, second grade, can show up right in your Facebook present, asking to be ""friends."" If you click yes, they will show up right alongside and indistinguishable from your current friends. The distance once afforded by decades of time vanishes in the Facebook universe, as everything old is now again. But wait, there's more. It's not just the past that comes careering into the present on Facebook, but the future. Facebook is just the front end -- the consumer interface -- of a big data engine. Facebook and its affiliates are busy churning the data generated from every keystroke to figure out who of us is likely to go on a diet, get pregnant, change political affiliation, question our sexuality and more. All so advertisers can act on our probable future behaviors by targeting marketing messages to us today. Facebook brings us both friends from our past and advertisements from our future, all competing to distance us from the boring but emotionally grounded present. And this temporally compressed digital landscape is supposed to be our new ""home."" Meanwhile, as if to prove that humans really can exist in more than one place at the same time, our Facebook profiles continue to carry on our online lives for us even when we're not logged on. An advertising feature called Sponsored Stories inserts our names and pictures into advertisements, so that we may endorse products tangentially associated with people or things we may have once ""liked."" To our friends, it looks like we're adding a live update, while in reality, we're sleeping, eating or even tweeting elsewhere. This is the disorientation produced by present shock. I call it digiphrenia, the experience of trying to exist in more than one incarnation of yourself at the same time. Of course, now that we're in on the joke, we're supposed to realize that coming back online to discover one of our other selves has been hawking a coffee bar we've never even visited isn't a violation: It's sort of funny. Just take it in stride, like Zuckerberg does. In the end, however, the joke may really be on Zuckerberg after all. Young people, teens in particular, are drifting away from Facebook for less overwhelming social applications such as the 140-character Twitter and the intentionally temporary photo service Snapchat. And when I looked up Facebook Home online to try to find out just what it was, the first search results that came up were from users sharing how to disable it. This way, consumers can buy the discounted phones on which Facebook Home ships, and turn them back into a regular Android smartphones, where Facebook is just another app we can use in our own good time. Ha. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Doug Rushkoff: New Facebook app allows you to be disoriented even more by message flow .

"Washington (CNN) -- In Alaska, the ""You Can See Russia From Here"" state, state Rep. Chris Tuck is more concerned about what the U.S. government can see. Tuck, a conservative Democrat, this week is appearing in an unusual television ad warning travelers that new full-body scanners at Alaska airports will enable airport screeners to ""see through your clothes,"" and advising passengers they can instead opt for a pat-down. ""If you don't want inappropriate pictures of you or your children taken and stored, or if you're concerned about the possible health effects, then all you've got to say is 'I opt out.' It is your right,"" Tuck says, standing in front of the state seal. ""Instead they will pat you down, and if they touch you inappropriately, call the airport police. This is still a free country,"" he says in the 30-second spot. Watch the spot on YouTube . Tuck told CNN he is concerned about both the privacy and health impacts of the full-body imagers, and about the government's slow encroachment on people's constitutional rights. ""There's fear that some of these pictures are going to be distributed on the Internet,"" he said. But the Transportation Security Administration says the ad is flawed on several accounts. The body imagers now installed in Fairbanks, and soon to be installed at three other Alaska airports, all use software that displays a generic body outline to protect people's privacy. All use harmless radio waves instead of low-level radiation. And none record images, said TSA spokesman Greg Soule. ""As we have said all along, our machines in airports do not have the ability to and will not ever save images,"" Soule said. Tuck, a second-term state representative, videotaped his ad last week, placed it on YouTube, and is spending $2,060 in leftover campaign money to air it on television newscasts this week. The audience has been receptive, he said. Fellow state legislators and a schoolteacher called ""congratulating me and thanking me,"" he said. Told of the TSA's statement that the imagers in Alaska use harmless radio waves and display only a generic body outline, Tuck called it ""good news,"" but said his concerns remain because Alaskans also travel out of the state, where the older body scanners are in use. ""That's great that they're using that (privacy) technology up here in Alaska, but people are still traveling out of state, and it's the return flights that they need to be aware of,"" Tuck said. ""It's really the process that's really unnerving,"" he said. ""You have people holding their arms out like they're criminals and being treated like criminals. And it's the whole psychological effect that we're imposing on society, and instilling fear and ... breeding suspicion of one another."" Tuck said he created the announcement to alert travelers that they can refuse to stand in front of the imager, and opt for a pat-down instead. Most travelers do not know they have that option, he said. Indeed, a federal appeals court in July said ""many passengers ... remain unaware of this right (to opt for a pat-down), and some who have exercised the right have complained that the resulting pat-down was unnecessarily aggressive."" The Alaska Legislature has a history of bucking the Transportation Security Administration. Earlier this year, state Rep. Sharon Cissna, a breast cancer survivor, famously chose to catch a small plane from Seattle to Canada and ride a ferry to Juneau rather then submit to either the full-body imager or the pat-down. After that incident, the state legislature overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling on the TSA to reconsider its use of pat-down searches and urging the U.S. Congress to ""exercise greater oversight"" of the TSA. ""Here in Alaska, it's really import for Alaska residents to have the ability to fly,"" Tuck said. ""You can't go to the doctor without flying. You can't leave your village without flying. In some cases children go to school with flying."" ""I get a little upset with people accusing me, or being suspicious of me, as a citizen trying to travel,"" Tuck said. Tuck said when he travels, he asks for a private pat-down to prevent bystanders with camera-phones from taking his photo being patted down. ""I don't want people thinking of Chris Tuck as a criminal with my hands in the air being frisked by someone with a badge and a uniform. That's not the image I want to put out,"" he said. The TSA did not comment directly on Tuck's ad. But it defended its screening practices. ""While there's no silver bullet, imaging technology is a valuable tool to detect potential threat items concealed on passengers,"" spokesman Soule said in a statement. ""We routinely find prohibited or illegal items on passengers, which illustrates our ability to detect threats concealed under clothing -- such as explosives. â€ªâ€ªThe use of imaging technology has led to the discovery of more than 300 dangerous or illegal items hidden on passengers.""","State representative warns travelers about full-body scanners at airports .

"(CNN) -- The biological father of a Native American child was arrested Monday after defying a court order to return the girl to her adoptive parents, the latest development in a four-year case that has spanned state lines and tested an unusual federal law. Matt and Melanie Capobianco, a white couple from South Carolina, legally adopted Veronica at birth in September 2009. When Veronica's father, Cherokee Nation member Dusten Brown, learned of her adoption a few months later, he asserted his custody rights under the Indian Child Welfare Act, setting off a lengthy legal fight. A family court judge ruled in Brown's favor in late 2011, and he took his daughter back. The Capobiancos have fought ever since to have Veronica returned. Timeline of 'Baby Veronica' adoption case . The case has bounced from family court to the U.S. Supreme Court and back again. After South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled last month to allow the Capobiancos' adoption to be finalized, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene, thus giving the ultimate go-ahead for the Charleston couple to regain custody of Veronica. The girl's transition back to the Capobiancos was supposed to begin last week. Brown, however, never showed up with his daughter. A family court judge in South Carolina ordered the girl to be handed over immediately, saying she was being ""unlawfully withheld from her lawful parents."" The Charleston County Sheriff's Office issued a warrant for Brown on Friday for interfering with custody. Brown was arrested Monday in his home state of Oklahoma after turning himself in. He posted a $10,000 bond, according to the Charleston County Sheriff's Office and Amanda Clinton, spokeswoman for the Cherokee Nation District Court. Justices refuse again to intervene in adoption dispute . It wasn't clear Monday evening, however, where Brown or his daughter were. Melanie Capobianco told reporters that Veronica is being ""illegally held against the wishes of her parents and the courts,"" and she pleaded for her daughter's return. ""With every passing hour, we fear more and more for her safety and well-being,"" she said. ""If anything should happen to our daughter while she's being left in the hands of those who hold her captive from us, the responsibility will be shared by many."" She added, ""We pray that those who are holding Veronica will do the right thing and send Veronica home to us, please."" Charleston County authorities said they are in touch with Oklahoma officials about extraditing Brown ""as well as pursuing all available options in locating Baby Veronica."" Brown told CNN's Randi Kaye over the weekend that he is willing to go to jail for his daughter. ""I'm going to fight till I have no fight left in me and till they say you can't fight no more,"" Brown said. ""This is my daughter. It's not a yo-yo that I can just say, hey, I borrowed it for two years and here's it back."" Brown claims the Indian Child Welfare Act allows him to have parental custody of Veronica over the Capobiancos. The Supreme Court, however, ruled that Brown could not rely on the act for relief because he did not have legal or physical custody of Veronica at the time of the adoption proceedings, which the birth mother initiated without his knowledge. Brown, who was not married to Veronica's non-Indian mother when she was conceived, signed a legal document agreeing to put the girl up for adoption and relinquishing his parental rights in exchange for not paying child support. His attorneys say Brown did not understand the extent of the waiver and that the mother never indicated she intended unilaterally to give Veronica up for adoption. CNN's Marlena Baldacci, Christine Theodoru, Mayra Cuevas, Joe Sutton, Randi Kaye and Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Dusten Brown says the adoption of his daughter should not have been allowed .

"(CNN) -- A Boston grand jury has subpoenaed two more men to testify Thursday in its ongoing investigation into whether former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez is connected to an unsolved double homicide in Boston last year. Alexander Bradley and John Alcorn Jr. were ordered to answer the questions of a grand jury investigating the fatal drive-by shooting of Daniel Abreu, 29, and Safiro Furtado, 28, outside a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Bradley, however, failed to appear before Superior Court Judge Joan Alexander in Hartford, Connecticut, on Tuesday to respond to the subpoena, and the judge issued an arrest warrant for him, according to court officials. Hernandez pleads not guilty . Bradley's New York-based attorney, David Jaroslawicz, told CNN he wasn't aware of the warrant or the subpoena and declined to say whether he has talked with his client about the grand jury matter. Bradley filed a civil suit against Hernandez in federal court, saying the former football player shot him in the face, causing Bradley to lose sight in one eye, after the men visited a strip club in Miami earlier this year, according to the lawsuit. In July, Bradley testified before a separate grand jury in Fall River, Massachusetts, that later indicted Hernandez on a charge of murder in the death of a friend, Odin Lloyd, June 17. Hernandez pleaded not guilty last week to that charge and weapons counts. Alcorn, 21, from Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, became involved in the investigation last month, when a friend of his, Jailene Diaz, told police a gun found in her car after a crash may have belonged to Alcorn and his friends, according to police documents obtained by CNN. Hernandez investigation turns to fiancee's actions . Law enforcement sources told CNN the .38-caliber handgun was identified by ballistics tests as the murder weapon in the unsolved Boston double homicide. Investigators have also confiscated an SUV that law enforcement sources say is believed to be linked to the deaths. The vehicle is registered to Hernandez. It was found parked in the garage of Hernandez's uncle in Bristol after Lloyd was killed. Alcorn is related to T.L. Cummings, a man who used to live at the same uncle's home. Cummings, who died in a car crash in June, was married to Hernandez's cousin Tanya Singleton. Singleton is jailed on a contempt of court indictment for refusing to testify before a grand jury in the Hernandez murder investigation. Hernandez's lawyers have asked a federal judge in Miami to stay Bradley's civil lawsuit pending the resolution of the murder case against the fallen football star.","Alexander Bradley and John Alcorn Jr. are ordered to answer questions .

"(CNN) -- A woman in Ohio recently wrote us about her struggles in finding the time and the money to take care of her health. Billie wrote, ""I am 33 years old and without Planned Parenthood I would have never found out in time that I'm a woman with precancerous cells in my uterus and cervix. I cannot afford to pay for my health care, and by them having a sliding scale I could afford it or else otherwise I may have died from cervical cancer. I wouldn't have found out about it in time. ... (Now) I can see my children grow up."" This week, as we celebrate National Women's Health Week -- a time when women are encouraged to make our health a priority by scheduling wellness checkups -- Billie's story came to my mind. Like many women, Billie is busy with her family, balancing bills and struggling without health insurance. But she finally took the time to put herself first and went to get a checkup. It's amazing to think that those few precious moments she spent in an exam room potentially saved her and her family from mounds of medical bills and emotional agony. But for a significant number of women in this country, accessing preventive health care services such as lifesaving cancer screenings, birth control, and well-woman exams is becoming more difficult, thanks to legislators who are putting politics before women's health. In fact, in Billie's home state of Ohio this week, the legislature is debating a bill that if enacted would hurt thousands of women by eliminating federal funding for Pap tests, breast exams, STD prevention and treatment, and prenatal care at Planned Parenthood health centers throughout the state. For many women, Planned Parenthood is the only doctor's visit they will have all year. Billie doesn't come to Planned Parenthood to make a political statement, but to get high-quality, affordable health care. Yet what is happening to patients in states like Ohio is just a preview of what women can expect from Mitt Romney if he is elected president. His promise to strike down the Affordable Care Act and its requirement that health plans cover birth control without co-pays, along with his pledge to end the nation's family planning program -- which provides preventive care to nearly 5 million women -- and his vow to ""get rid"" of Planned Parenthood would have real and serious consequences for millions of women nationwide. Unlike Mitt Romney, we won't let politics interfere with the health care that one in five women in America have relied on at some point in their lives. Planned Parenthood's doors are open today and they'll be open tomorrow. But that doesn't mean these attacks aren't dangerous for all of us -- our mothers, sisters, daughters, nieces, and grandmothers. Mitt Romney prides himself on being an astute businessman, but any woman balancing her checkbook right now could tell him that attacking basic preventive care is fiscally irresponsible. Unintended pregnancies already cost taxpayers $11 billion a year. Breast cancer caught late can be deadly, and it leaves families emotionally and financially bankrupt. Preventive care saves lives and money. My hope this National Women's Health Week is that together we can shine a light on the irony of these legislative maneuvers. Most important, I hope that the annual observance provides an opportunity for lawmakers to take pause. They must be made to see that attacks on health care threaten the lives and well-being of real women.

"(CNN) -- Be cautious if you plan to Bing Jessica Biel or Google Brad Pitt. A new report says you might get a virus. Actress Jessica Biel tops a list of the ""most dangerous"" celebrity searches online. The Hollywood actors are among the top 10 celebrity searches online that can lead to computer problems, according to a report released Tuesday by the computer security company McAfee. The company named Biel the ""most dangerous celebrity in cyberspace."" One in five Internet searches for terms related to ""Jessica Biel"" leads to a Web page, photo, video or piece of spam that contains a cyber-security threat, the report said. The former ""7th Heaven"" star and girlfriend of singer Justin Timberlake is followed on the ""most dangerous"" list by singer Beyonce, actress Jennifer Aniston and football hunk Tom Brady. Singer and reality TV star Jessica Simpson rounds out the top five. Pitt, who topped last year's list, moved down to 10th. The report shows that hackers use pop culture trends to spread viruses and malicious software, said Shane Keats, a research analyst at McAfee. Biel is ""very, very popular right now, so it says to me that the cyber criminals really do know who's hot and who's not,"" Keats said. ""They really are smart. They can spot a trend as well as anyone else can -- as well as Paris Hilton can."" Risks associated with the searches range from ""annoying to devastating,"" he said. But they don't mean people should be afraid of using the Internet. Keats' advice? Surf Web sites you know and trust. ""You really can't go wrong if you stick to the really well-lighted parts of the Internet,"" he said. ""As soon as you go off the big boulevards, you go off map and you have the potential to land in a dark alley."" Those ""dark alleys"" are where fake photos and harmful downloads are most likely to damage a person's computer, he said. Keats acknowledged that computer viruses can come from many places and many types of searches. He said McAfee chose to highlight celebrity searches because they are popular and because they're a good teaching tool -- a way to make cyber security resonate with everyone. McAfee makes anti-virus software that can be used to combat cyber attacks. Reports from computer security companies are often criticized as somewhat promotional. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has information on anti-virus software and tips on how to stay safe online. The company said it surveyed 900 Web sites and 150 ring tones for its analysis. It ranked celebrities based on the percentage of search results that were found to be damaging and on how harmful those sites turned out to be. Biel's publicist did not respond to a CNN request for comment. A news release from McAfee said the company was surprised to find President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama relatively low on the list. They ranked 34th and 39th, respectively. Young Hollywood stars were popular on the list. Miley Cyrus and Lindsay Lohan both were in McAfee's top 15. Only two men -- Brady and Pitt -- made the top 10.","Report says Jessica Biel is the ""most dangerous"" celebrity to search for online .

"(CNN) -- Saying no one can can diminish what she and her team accomplished, a confident Diana Nyad took on her critics Wednesday night on ""Piers Morgan Live."" Her record-breaking Cuba to Florida swin, she said, was by the book. ""We swam fair and square, squeaky clean across that thing,"" Nyad said, at times raising her voice, during the interview. ""No one's going to take our joy and our moment that the world was inspired by away from us. Nobody."" The 64-year-old marathon swimmer has been hit with criticism ever since she finished her record-breaking 53-hour, 110-mile journey last week. Some say the numbers don't add up. Was it really a record? Did she cheat? Nyad answered her critics, point by point. Did she get help? No, Nyad said. She said she was out in the open ocean the whole time. ""Never, never took a rest, never touched a boat, never got out on a boat,"" she said. During 27 hours of swimming, she went from 1.5 mph than to more than 3 mph. Many marathon swimmers say that's deeply suspicious. Her explanation? It's simple math, Nyad said. And also a lucky stretch. She said she hit a perfect current that pushed her along at a quicker speed. ""If you got lucky, which I did that day and I'm swimming at 1.7 miles per hour I have a current at, let's say, 2. 2 miles per hour... You add them together and you're close to 4 miles an hour. It's easy."" Critcs say that it's impossible for her not to eat or drink for more than seven hours during the swim. Her response? That's pure fiction, Nyad said. That rumor started, Nyad said, when a doctor said she was having serious stomach problems during the swim. The doctor said she was having problems eating solid food. ""That doesn't mean you don't eat,"" she said. ""My handlers, they made me nutritional supplement drinks. I'm always taking in food, every half hour, 45 minutes. Seven hours. That never happened."" Some question whether she violated the traditions of the sport by using a specialized mask and wetsuit to protect herself from jellyfish stings. Did she break the rule? The specialized mask she wore is allowed in the rules, Nyad said. And by the way, she added, that mask could hardly be called an aid. It's cumbersome and makes it harder to swim. ""It's not an aid, believe me. You wish you didn't have this thing on,"" she said. ""They're the most dangerous jellyfish in the world. They're fatal. You need to be protected. In many areas of the world, those types of suits are allowed; just not in the English Channel."" Does she think her effort will be ratified? Did she swim for nothing? Nyad said she'll have to wait and see if she is officially affirmed as the first person to have completed the Cuba-Florida swim unassisted and without a shark cage. These questions don't help. But she says, in some ways, she understands the scrutiny. ""People have been trying since 1950 to get across. It did seem nearly impossible,"" Nyad said. ""It better be vetted. But our team is squeaky clean. This swim will the ratified in due time."" Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The mother of Michael Jackson's two oldest children broke down in tears when she was asked to describe the impact of the singer's death on his daughter Paris. ""Their father is dead,"" Debbie Rowe responded. ""I almost lost my daughter! She is devastated. She tried to kill herself. She is devastated. She has no life. She doesn't feel she has a life anymore."" Paris, 15, attempted suicide in early June and is still being treated in a facility for her emotional problems. Jurors sitting for a 70th day of testimony in the wrongful death trial of Jackson's last concert promoter have laughed loudly at times during the colorful testimony of Rowe, who alternated between tears and jokes. When she and Jackson divorced after their three-year marriage in 1999, the singer ""got custody of the doctors,"" she joked Wednesday. Rowe returned to the witness stand Thursday for a second day of testimony in the small Los Angeles courtroom. She was ordered to testify about the singer's drug use by lawyers for AEG Live, the concert promoter being sued by Jackson's mother and three children. Wednesday's questioning by AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putnam centered on Jackson's use of prescription drugs -- to deal with pain from scalp surgery, and two times in Germany, where doctors used the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. Thursday's testimony, however, began with Rowe's description of Jackson's skin problems, which included vitiligo -- a condition in which his pigment disappeared, leaving large white spots on his face, hands and body. ""Everyone says he bleached himself, but he didn't,"" Rowe said. Many of his visits to Dr. Arnold Klein, the Beverly Hills dermatologist where she worked for 18 years as a medical assistant, were to treat the condition, she testified. Jackson compared himself to the ""Elephant Man,"" a 19th-century Englishman who became a circus sideshow curiosity because of severe disfigurements, she said. ""He was worried that people would see the disease or the disfigurement before they would see him working sometimes,"" Rowe testified. He also suffered from discoid lupus, which made his skin tissue ""mushy,"" especially on his scalp, she said. Jackson's scalp was severely burned during a pyrotechnics accident while he was filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984. MJ's insomnia struggle . Two German doctors treated Jackson's insomnia with propofol 12 years before he died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic, Rowe testified Wednesday. Dr. Allen Metzger -- Jackson's general practitioner in the United States -- arranged for the German anesthesiologists to infuse the singer with propofol in a Munich hotel in July 1997 after sedatives failed to help him sleep between concerts, Rowe testified. ""I think they tried it and it hadn't worked, and if he couldn't sleep, he couldn't perform,"" she testified. Jackson ""was at the end of his rope; he didn't know what else to do."" He ""felt better"" after eight hours of propofol-induced sleep and decided to get a second treatment after his second Munich show, she said. Metzger testified at the criminal trial of Dr. Conrad Murray that he was never involved in propofol treatments for Jackson and was not aware of the drug until much later. Rowe backed away from her previous statement during a deposition, in which she said doctors also gave Jackson propofol infusions in hotels in France during the HIStory tour, in the late 1990s. AEG Live contends that Jackson used propofol for years to treat his insomnia, including when Rowe was traveling with him in Europe in the 1990s. The coroner ruled Jackson died on June 25, 2009, from a propofol overdose administered by Murray, who is serving a prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter. AEG Live executives, who were promoting and producing Jackson's comeback concerts, had no way of knowing that Murray was infusing him with propofol each night for two months in the spring of 2009, AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam said in his opening statements 16 weeks ago. ""Almost no one knew until after his death,"" Putnam said. ""AEG Live certainly didn't know about it."" The Jackson family's lawyers contend that the promoters ignored warning signs that Jackson's health was deteriorating in the two months before his death. Instead of getting him to another doctor who might have saved his life, they gave Murray the responsibility of getting Jackson to rehearsals, they argue. Michael Jackson's mother, Katherine Jackson, and three of her children contend AEG Live is liable in his death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Murray. The company's agreement to pay Murray $150,000 a month put the doctor in a conflict of interest because he was in deep debt and could not risk losing the job by refusing Jackson's demands for propofol, their lawyers contend. AEG Live argues that while its executives negotiated with Murray to serve as Jackson's physician for the ""This Is It"" tour, it was Jackson who chose and controlled the doctor. ""Getting a grip' on MJ's pain . Jackson underwent surgery in 1993 to repair burns suffered in the 1984 accident, including placement of a balloon under his scalp to stretch it over several months, Rowe testified. His doctors ""couldn't get a grip of the pain"" the procedure caused and two doctors ""were having a pissing contest over who gave him the better drug,"" she said. ""Michael had a very low pain tolerance, and his fear of pain was incredible,"" Rowe testified. ""And I think that doctors took advantage of him that way."" Rowe said many of the doctors who treated Jackson were ""idiots,"" including the dermatologist she worked for from 1979 until she quit in 1996 before she married Jackson. ""Michael respected doctors immensely, that they went to school, that they studied ... to do no harm,"" Rowe said. ""Unfortunately, some of the doctors decided that when Michael was in pain or something that they would try to outbid on who could give him the better drug, and so he listened to those doctors."" Metzger tailored a plan to help Jackson withdraw from dependence on demerol, a powerful painkiller given him because of the scalp pain, she said. That plan, however, was derailed when Jackson resumed traveling on his ""Dangerous"" tour, she said. After six weeks, when the tour reached Mexico City (in autumn 1993), Jackson was ""a hot mess,"" she said. ""He was depressed,"" she said. ""He had taken something. I don't know what he had taken or who he had got it from."" After a three-day argument with Jackson, Rowe said, she convinced him to end his tour early and enter a drug rehabilitation program. ""You need to straighten up,"" she said she told Jackson. ""You need to face whatever it is that is going on and we'll get through this."" Jackson eventually announced publicly that he was entering a rehab program to deal with an addiction to prescription drugs. Rowe said Jackson's drug use was not a secret among people in the ""Dangerous"" tour production. AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware, who was the over the ""This Is It"" production when Jackson died, was also tour manager for the ""Dangerous"" tour. One revelation from Rowe was that a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon faked doing a procedure on Jackson on two occasions, although he told the singer he had done it. Jackson complained about painful scars in his nose and went to Dr. Steven Hoefflin to inject them with collagen, she said. ""He put Michael out and didn't do anything but put tape on him as if he had treated him,"" Rowe testified. The doctor told her he did that because he could not find the scars Jackson thought were there. Thursday is the 70th day of testimony in the trial, which the judge told jurors would likely be given to them for deliberations in late September.","NEW: ""I almost lost my daughter!""

"(CNN) -- At least 43 people were killed and dozens more injured in the latest round of attacks Sunday in Iraq's Anbar and Baghdad provinces, local police said. In a Sunday evening attack, at least 37 people were killed and 42 others wounded in Baghdad province. A suicide bomber wearing an explosives-laden vest blew himself up in a crowded coffee shop in the predominantly Shiite al-Amel neighborhood in southwest Baghdad, according to police officials. Many of the victims were young men gathering to drink tea, smoke hookah and play games, officials said. Some buildings nearby were also damaged in the attack. Iraq's security force has since sealed off the area and started a security operation searching houses and buildings close by. Earlier, three attacks in Anbar province targeted a checkpoint, a mayor's office in a government complex and a police station, killing at least six people and wounding 19 others, according to police in the provincial capital of Ramadi. The attacks occurred in the predominantly Sunni town of Rawa. The first Anbar suicide attack targeted a joint security checkpoint manned by Iraqi soldiers outside the offices of Rawa's mayor. A suicide bomber also attacked inside the municipal building where the mayor's office is. A car bomb targeted a police station in the third attack. The attacks come as internal conflicts tear through the country. At least 50 people died and 170 were wounded on Thursday in a series of car-bomb and roadside explosions across Baghdad, police officials said. At least 10 car bombs and three roadside bombs exploded in several Baghdad neighborhoods. The attacks were primarily targeting amusement parks where families and children typically go to celebrate the Islamic holiday of Eid Al-Adha, according to police. At least 350 people have been killed in October during the violence in Iraq, based on CNN reporting.","Bombings also leave dozens wounded in Anbar and Baghdad provinces .

"(CNN) -- Misty Croslin, the last person known to see a 5-year-old Florida girl before she was reported missing in February 2009, was sentenced to 25 years in prison Friday on an unrelated drug charge. Circuit Judge Wendy Berger also ordered Croslin to pay $500,000 and to follow her prison time with five years of drug-offender probation. Croslin had pleaded no contest in the St. Johns County courtroom to a single count of trafficking oxycodone. She faces sentencing on October 19 in a Palatka, Florida, courtroom for a conviction on similar charges. At the time Haleigh Cummings went missing, Croslin was 17 and residing in the family's mobile home with her then-husband, Ronald Cummings, Haleigh and her 4-year-old brother. Croslin and Ronald Cummings were both arrested in January along with three others after allegedly selling about $3,900 worth of drugs to undercover officers, authorities said. The two divorced after Haleigh's disappearance. Croslin told police she tucked Haleigh and the brother into bed about 8 p.m. February 8, 2009, and went to sleep two hours later. She said she awoke at 3 a.m. to find Haleigh missing and a cinder block propping open a back door. Ronald Cummings reported Haleigh missing when he returned from work at dawn. Authorities previously said physical evidence contradicts Croslin's account of events that night. However, police have stopped short of naming Croslin as a suspect. In televised interviews, Croslin has said she does not know what happened to Haleigh but believes ""the other side of the family"" knows where she is. Police have said Cummings and Crystal Sheffield, the girl's mother, are not considered suspects. Authorities believe Haleigh is dead and are treating the case as a homicide investigation.

"(CNN) -- American politicians have a deep need to interpret foreign leaders and foreign cultures and governments as though they were American. Thursday night on ""Crossfire"", I described the Russian president as a KGB official of enormous toughness. In fact, we showed Vladimir Putin in his KGB colonel's uniform to drive home the reality of who he is. Putin is a great Russian nationalist who is coldly and methodically maneuvering to maximize Russia's prestige and influence. And why shouldn't he? It is his country. It has a longer history than we do. He served in the most intensely pro-Soviet institution in the old empire. Yet, American politicians keep rejecting the realities of Putin's life, statements and actions. Putin jabs U.S. This is a bipartisan self-deception. In June 2001, then President George W. Bush met him for the first time and concluded: . ""I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy and we had a very good dialogue. ""I was able to get a sense of his soul. ""He's a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country and I appreciate very much the frank dialogue and that's the beginning of a very constructive relationship."" Gingrich: Syria a distraction from real U.S. challenges . This was said two years after Putin launched the second Chechnya war in which an estimated 300,000 Chechens would be ruthlessly killed. It also assumed a former KGB agent has a soul that is viewable. The less positive view came in August 2013 when President Obama compared his Russian counterpart to a tiresome schoolboy. ""He's got that kind of slouch, looking like the bored kid in the back of the classroom,"" Obama said of Putin. But Putin isn't a bored kid. Putin is one of the most effective and successful leaders in the world. He took over a chaotic decaying Russia in the 1990s and methodically rebuilt the authoritarian state centered system he had learned from the KGB. He may today be the strongest, most stable Russian leader since Stalin. He has achieved it with steady methodical application of power to isolate, imprison and, occasionally, kill those who oppose him. Putin's recent op-ed in the New York Times was another calculated step. Putin despises Obama and resents his attitude and his tone. This was a chance to return the attitude. (Obama acknowledged the difference in an ABC interview: ""I don't think that Mr. Putin has the same values that we do."") American politicians as usual tried to force Putin into an American frame of reference. The overall tone of Putin's latest broadside was too much for Sen. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said he read the article at dinner on Wednesday. Opinion: American 'exceptionalism' -- who are they kidding? ""I almost wanted to vomit,"" he said. ""I worry when someone who came up through the KGB tells us what is in our national interests and what is not."" House Speaker John Boehner said he was ""insulted."" On a bipartisan basis, American politicians seemed surprised. If American leaders would spend a little time studying Russian history they would understand Vladimir Putin. He is a Russian nationalist and seen in that tradition is very understandable and even predictable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Newt Gingrich.","Newt Gingrich: U.S. politicians reacted with surprise to the views of Vladimir Putin .

"(CNN) -- When was the last time you adjusted your business strategy based on China's changing consumer behavior? With economic growth, comes consumer maturity. China's emerging consumers are becoming more independent, confident and connected. Like all of us, China's consumers are changing not only demographically and geographically, they are adjusting to choice. Lots of choice. Much of that choice is emerging in the world of e-commerce. There are nearly 600 million netizens in China and they are beginning to aggressively shop online. The challenge for online commerce outlets is to define just who their customers are and how they make their purchase decisions. In other words, what influences them to spend money online? What we do know is that men shop differently than women, even when it comes to online purchases. For example, we know that men tend to be more, let's call it, goal oriented when they shop online. But they also tend to buy things specifically for themselves. That said, both sexes are looking for two key things: lower prices and greater convenience. Nielsen's 2012 annual report on online shopping behaviors of Chinese consumers showed that for a couple of key categories covered in the survey, men were more active than women in online shopping. Eighty percent of male respondents, (vs. 59% of female respondents) went online for consumer electronics purchases, while 71% of male respondents, (vs. 66% of female respondents) went online to purchase services. With more people shopping on the Internet, we are also seeing online shoppers increasingly becoming impatient as they shop. If they can't easily find what they want, they quickly move on. They want to shop on their terms and their timelines. So, how do we ensure online shopping is embedded in the broader Internet experience for China's online consumers? According to the survey, 66% of connected consumers were both microblog and social networking site users. The implication for brands would be to use their microblog presence as information delivery centers to combine and bring together all other digital platforms such as a company website, campaign mini-site, social networking brand page and viral video content. With the high penetration of smart phones, e-commerce evolves a step further to m-commerce. We can see that consumers aren't even waiting to get back home to switch on their computers and start spending. Consumers want to browse and shop whenever they want -- on the subway, while waiting for friends, or even during meal times. Engaging with mobile users is critical in this and most other markets. Unlike Amazon's dominant position in the U.S., there are many big scale e-commerce players competing fiercely in China, so it might take more time for a standout leader to emerge. For now, existing e-commerce players face expensive challenges surrounding logistics and pricing. Some are also grappling with aligning online and offline shopping experiences. Flexible shopping and delivery/pick-up options are proving popular, particularly when combined with smart promotions across online and offline platforms. Satisfied customers with successful online purchases are likely to drive more sales as consumers share positive experiences via social media. A Nielsen survey found 85% of Chinese consumers regularly used social media to share their experiences with online purchases. As retailers look to align and grow their offline and online businesses, the challenge is how to develop successful marketing strategies for the sophisticated Chinese consumer: . 1. Earn trust -- Create a trusted environment with your customers and make them feel valued. Every brand should take some time to understand the specific online networks with which their customers engage and to become a part of it. Leveraging trusted experts or appropriate celebrities in China has also been successful in building trust. The bottom line is that emotion is the key. In a world where the consumer sees hundreds of advertisements in the span of just one day, triggering an emotional response is proven to give your product or brand the attention and recognition it needs to stand out. From there, you build brand dependency; success here will take care of itself as consumers will recommend the product to others. 2. Get connected - Chinese online shoppers are primarily young and educated consumers who are seeking value and convenience. Offering unique product assortments online and giving the consumer multiple convenient options for payment and delivery are also likely to resonate with these shoppers. 3. Communications - Again, social media is a powerful communication platform that is looked at multiple times a day. E-commerce and online shopping flip the traditional store-to-consumer, one-way conversation. Consumers are now searching out retailer websites for specific products and learning about goods via social media. Retailers need to engage in this social conversation and interact with China's tech-savvy consumers who are increasingly open to boosting e-commerce spending. It is also suggested that an integrated online/offline campaign can double your brand's recall.","Rust writes advice on capturing e-commerce market as it rapidly changes in China .

"(CNN) -- Blame it on Damascus? No, let's not. This week's preferred media narrative comes in two parts: . First, that comprehensive immigration reform isn't just headed to the back burner but will be completely off the stove until 2015 and beyond. And second, that it was the crisis in Syria that pushed the issue off the agenda. After all, we're told, how can Congress concentrate on anything else when it has to decide whether to approve a military strike against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad? The first part is fact, but the second part is fiction. It's true that Congress is done with the immigration debate for the rest of this year. The GOP-controlled House of Representatives might hold a vote on a ""reform-lite"" bill where illegal immigrants get legal status but not citizenship. Or it might offer legal status only to farm workers and DREAMers, those publicity-seeking undocumented young people who want preferential treatment because they intend to go to college or join the military. But any hope of a large-scale reform that offers legal status to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States has faded. And because Congress really only shows up for work in odd-numbered years (so members can run for re-election in-between), we'll probably be having this conversation in 2015, 2017 and 2019. It is not true, however, that it was Syria that killed immigration reform for this Congress. That's just a quick and easy explanation -- one favored by those who don't understand the issue in all its complexities -- and it's also an excuse that comes in handy for lawmakers looking for an exit door. One of them is Rep. RaÃºl Labrador, R-Idaho, who recently told Univision's Jorge Ramos that it is becoming less likely that immigration reform will pass anytime soon because Congress is turning its attention to Syria. Weeks ago, Labrador walked away from immigration reform efforts in the House. No, a proper autopsy would show that immigration reform is meeting its demise in this Congress for a variety of reasons. Here are three of them: . One: The major legislative offering -- the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act -- collapsed under its own weight. When the Senate's bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" unveiled its masterpiece in April, the bill was 844 pages long. The amendment process pushed it past 1,000 pages. The folks who have helped pass immigration reform legislation -- i.e., the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act -- before will tell you that when you want to pass legislation, you want the bill to get smaller as time goes on, not the opposite. Besides, there was too much pork. Many of the giveways have had nothing to do with immigration but were merely intended to get the support of senator so-and-so from such-and-such state. That's because, as California-based policy analyst Arnold Torres maintains, the debate was always about politics instead of what it should have been about: policy. Torres knows this terrain well, having contributed to the debate over reform in 1986 as executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens. Many advocates this time around were too busy worrying about passing something, anything, to give a thought to whether what they had on the table was worth passing or how it would be implemented. Two: As broken as Washington is on most issues, when the subject is immigration, it is doubly dysfunctional. That town is filled with people who use this issue to further their own agendas. If you interviewed illegal immigrants and asked them what they would have liked to have achieved in the immigration reform process -- and I've done just that -- they would ask for three things: a work permit, the ability to travel across borders and a driver's license. What's not on that list? Citizenship and the voting privileges that come with it, which is a repeated deal-breaker for politicians. Washington is also filled with people who think they know more than the folks on the frontlines. If you sat down with Border Patrol agents and supervisors and asked them what they need -- and I've done that, too -- they would ask for new roads on the border, surveillance equipment and tunnel detection capability. Whatever you do, they'd say, don't give us more agents to train and more fencing that doesn't keep out anyone. So what did the Senate bill -- thanks to the Corker-Hoeven ""border surge"" amendment -- offer? More agents and more fencing. Three: The debate has been inherently dishonest, with neither side able to trust the other. Posturing and hot air to the contrary, neither party really wanted to have this debate. It divides their constituencies. Republicans have to referee a civil war between nativists who want less immigration because they fear that the country's complexion is changing, and business interests that want more immigration because they need workers. Democrats have to keep the peace between Latinos who want illegal immigrants to have a pathway to citizenship because they feel their pain, and some members of organized labor, who--despite the fact that their leadership supports reform-- would like to give immigrants a one-way bus ticket to their home country because they fear the competition. The solution? Fool everyone. Republicans talk tough but go soft on employers by creating loopholes and delaying enforcement efforts. Democrats talk soft but pander to working-class Americans by ratcheting up deportations and building walls. Sometimes, it works. Still, it is one heck of a tough spot to be in. Now thanks to the crisis in Syria, members of Congress in both parties have a way out. And, with the enthusiasm of a dying man in the desert reaching for a bottle of water, they're grabbing it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Some say Syria kept House from passing immigration reform. That's bogus .
He says debate over until 2015; bill was cumbersome and pork-laden .
He says sticking points are over things not vital to reform movement, such as citizenship .
Navarrette: Both parties panicked; Syria gives them out, but it's not the real reason ."
"(CNN) -- When he digests all the evidence, referee Felix Brych -- who is also a lawyer -- will probably admit he got things wrong in a Bundesliga football game Friday. Brych awarded a goal to Bayer Leverkusen's Stefan Kiessling in the second half even though replays showed that the forward's header against home side Hoffenheim went wide of the post and crept in through a hole in the net. Kiessling put his hands to his head as he thought he spurned a good chance and couldn't quite believe it when the goal was given. It turned out to be the winner in a 2-1 result that sent Bayer Leverkusen to top spot in the league, two points ahead of idle Bayern Munich. Afterwards, Brych spoke and said his hands were effectively tied. ""There was no indication that it was not a regular goal,"" Brych was quoted as saying by Britain's Daily Mail. ""I had a bit of doubt, but the reaction of the players was clear. There was nothing to suggest otherwise."" Kiessling wasn't sure how to react. ""Everyone started rushing towards me,"" he told Sky Germany. ""What could I do? ""Honestly, I couldn't really judge what I saw but when Hoffenheim pointed to the hole in the net, I had an inkling."" Hoffenheim manager Markus Gisdol wants the game to be replayed, citing a similar incident between Bayern Munich and Nuremberg in 1994 when Bayern's Thomas Helmer scored a 'phantom' goal. Having won the controversial game 2-1, they indeed replayed the affair and Bayern cruised 5-0. ""If they do not repeat the game then I don't understand the world of football anymore,"" Gisdol told Hoffenheim's website. Added Hoffenheim managing director Alexander Rosen on the Hoffenheim website: ""It is unbelievable ... what happened here today."" Roma still perfect . Miralem Pjanic's week just keeps on getting better. Part of the Bosnia and Herzegovina team that qualified for the World Cup for the first time, Pjanic scored both goals as red hot Roma stayed perfect in Serie A by beating second-place Napoli 2-0 on Friday. Pjanic netted the opener in first-half injury time on a free kick and got the second from the penalty spot in the 71st after Napoli defender Paolo Cannavaro fouled Marco Borriello -- who came on for injured Roma legend Francesco Totti. Roma rose to 8-0-0 in the Italian top division and has scored 22 goals while conceding once. Despite the sizzling start, Roma only has a five-point lead over both Napoli and two-time defending champion Juventus. Juventus can cut the gap to two points with a victory at Fiorentina on Sunday. Rafael Benitez's men, watched by former Napoli great Diego Maradona, made the better start in Rome and some would feel deserved better. Lorenzo Insigne's pass put Goran Pandev in the clear but his shot was partially stopped by ex Napoli keeper Morgan de Sanctis and then cleared off the line by Daniele De Rossi. Insigne struck the post and Napoli paid the price for missing the two opportunities when Pjanic deposited his free kick into the top corner. Cannavaro gave away the free kick, taking down the resurgent Gervinho. Napoli struck the woodwork twice more early in the second half and its night got worse when Cannavaro tangled with Borriello. Pjanic sent Pepe Reina the wrong way for his third goal of the campaign.","Leverkusen goes top in Germany after a contentious goal against Hoffenheim .

"London (CNN) -- Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, the only person convicted in connection with the Lockerbie airline bombing that killed 259 people on board Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 on the ground, went to his grave protesting his innocence. And there are others who believe that Megrahi, who died on Sunday from cancer, was not responsible for bringing down the jet over Scotland in 1988, including some of the victims' families. Why does the tragedy continue to raise questions? CNN examines the issues. Why was al Megrahi convicted? After a nine-month trial that concluded in January 2001, a Scottish court based in a former U.S. base at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands, convicted al Megrahi of the murders and he was sentenced to life in prison with the condition that he serve at least 27 years before being eligible for parole. Scotland does not have the death penalty. The trial followed years of negotiation with Libya, after British and American investigators indicted two men for the crime in 1991. Lockerbie bomber dies more than two years after release . The U.S. and UK blamed both al Megrahi, who was once security chief for Libyan Arab Airlines, and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah -- accusing them both of being Libyan intelligence agents. Libya eventually handed over both men to the United Nations in 1999 and later paid $2.7 billion to victims' families. Sanctions against Moammar Gadhafi's regime were lifted on the same day the men were taken into custody. At al Megrahi's trial, prosecutors said he placed a bomb in a Toshiba cassette recorder and hid it in suitcase on a flight from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany. The bag was believed to have been transferred to a Pan Am flight that went first to London Heathrow and then to Flight 103 to New York. Lockerbie victims' families: Relief, anger . The prosecution maintained that al Megrahi, who worked at the Malta airport, had been seen buying clothes, fragments of which were found in the suitcase that contained the bomb. Al Megrahi was found guilty but Fhimah was acquitted. Many of the victim's families believe the right man was convicted and expressed a mixture of relief on hearing of al Megrahi's death and anger that he had been released from his sentence. Susan Cohen, whose daughter was among the 189 Americans killed, said: ""He was a mass murderer. I feel no pity."" Why was he released early? In August 2009, eight years after al Megrahi's conviction, there was uproar when Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill announced that he would be released from prison on compassionate grounds because he was suffering from terminal prostate cancer. His release -- and the celebrations that greeted him on his return to Libya -- sparked condemnation from the United States, and from some victims' families. Despite being given just a few months to live, he survived for more than two years, sparking anger against the Scottish authorities and accusations in the British press that a deal had been struck with Libya. A group of U.S. senators then attempted to investigate rumors that the Lockerbie bomber was released as part of a deal to allow BP to drill for oil off the coast of Libya. On Sunday, British Prime Minister David Cameron reiterated his belief that al Megrahi should never have been released from prison. But Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond said al Megrahi's death put to rest ""some of the conspiracy theories which have attempted to suggest that his illness was somehow manufactured."" Why is al Megrahi's guilt questioned? In an interview with Reuters in 2011 al Megrahi vowed that ""new facts"" would come to light. He always maintained his innocence. After al Megrahi lodged an appeal whilst still in prison, the evidence was reviewed by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission. New evidence uncovered during the investigation and other evidence not submitted at al Megrahi's original trial led the review commission to state that he ""may have suffered a miscarriage of justice."" The commission said there was no reasonable basis to suspect that al Megrahi purchased the clothes in Malta on the day alleged. It also said evidence that the clothes shop owner had seen al Megrahi's picture in a magazine article that linked him to the bombing before picking him out in a lineup was not put to the court. The U.N. observer at the trial, Hans Kochler, has also called into question the verdict, telling the UK's Independent newspaper in 2009 that he believed al Megrahi to be innocent. ""I watched a case unfold that was based on circumstantial evidence. The indictment against him and Fhimah went to great lengths to explain how they supposedly planted a bomb on Flight 103, and yet Fhimah was acquitted of all the charges against him. It made no sense that al Megrahi was guilty when Fhimah was acquitted,"" he said. Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died on the Pan Am flight, has also expressed doubt about al Megrahi's guilt and is a member of the Justice for Megrahi Campaign. CNN's Nic Robertson, who tracked down al Megrahi in Libya during the uprising against Gadhafi, spoke to his family in August 2011. They told him they believed al-Megrahi was the victim of both international justice and the regime of the ousted Libyan leader, who they say used him as a scapegoat. Nic Robertson: Finding the Lockerbie bomber . Are there other suspects? Robertson says about the case: ""There are forensic inconsistencies. There are so many holes in the evidence. There are serious questions that have not been answered. ""According to my Jordanian source, the Jordanians had an agent inside the cell that operated inside Germany. The agent was the bomb maker. He made five bombs to go in transistor radios but informed his handlers that one was missing. The CIA said 'nonsense, all bombs are accounted for.' Scottish investigators were never able to interview that cell."" TV producer and author John Ashton has spent many years studying the case, and worked as a researcher with al Megrahi's defense team between 2006 and 2009. He believes al Megrahi was innocent and presents his reasons in his book ""Megrahi: You are my jury - the Lockerbie evidence.'"" He believes that Iran is the likely suspect behind the bombing, using the Palestinian group The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC) to carry out the attack. He told CNN he believed the group operated from Damascus but had a cell inside Germany, and alleges the attack was in revenge for the accidental shooting down of an Iranian passenger jet by the Americans in July 1988 with the loss of 290 lives. Missiles from USS Vincennes hit the plane as it flew over the Persian Gulf. In his book he presents what he says is new evidence about the Lockerbie bomb's timing device but says this has been ignored by investigating authorities. Where is the investigation going next? On Monday, Scotland's First Minister told British media that the Lockerbie case was still a live investigation. But new evidence may be hard to find. Saif Gadhafi, Moammar Gadhafi's son, who is in custody in Libya and wanted by the International Criminal Court to face charges of alleged crimes against humanity, will have the facts, according to Robertson. Britain confident Libya will allow police probe . ""He was heading up the campaign to free al Megrahi,"" he said. ""He will know whether or not this was a Libyan operation, accepting the blame for the bombing as the price of admission for doing business -- a way to sell Libyan oil again."" He also suggests that the former head of Libyan intelligence, Abdullah al-Senussi, currently held in Mauritania, may know more. ""Al-Senussi as the head of Libyan intelligence would perhaps have had broader knowledge behind some of the issues relating to this particular case,"" he said. But Ashton remains pessimistic about finding the whole truth. ""I'm not confident that we will get evidence that will stand up in court ... leads have gone cold,"" he told CNN. ""One hope is Syria. If the Syrian government crumbles then evidence may emerge from there, but I would be surprised."" Before al Megrahi's death, Kochler told the British press: ""We will probably never really know who caused the Lockerbie bombing. So much key information was withheld from the trial. The British have yet satisfactorily to explain why. ""I want to know when the bomb was placed on the plane and by whom. I find it very difficult to understand why there seems to be so little pressure from the British and American public on their governments to investigate the bombing properly.""

"MUMBAI, India (Reuters) -- They are the arteries that keep Mumbai's economy ticking, rattling six million people a day to offices, shops and factories. But arriving safe and sound for work after a trip on Mumbai's clogged railways is no mean feat. Even after a $2 billion upgrade, Mumbai's trains will still have to carry 1.5 times their capacity at peak hours. On average, 4,000 people die a year on Mumbai's railways, crushed under trains, electrocuted by overhead power lines or killed as they lean from jam-packed carriages to gasp for air. It is perhaps the world's deadliest commute. ""Everyday it's a nightmare. The train is so crowded that one has to look up at the ceiling to breathe,"" said Natasha Pillai, a young student in India's financial capital. At peak hours more than 550 people cram into a carriage built for 200. Passengers fall to their deaths from moving trains or tumble under the wheels from crowded platforms. People hang from coaches, balance precariously on the roofs of carriages or risk a ride on the bumpers between cars as they trundle along three lines and through nearly 120 stations. The crush to board is so bad commuters take trains in the wrong direction so they can grab seats when they turn around. Fatal accidents are so common that stations stock sheets to cover corpses, and officials spend hours entering details of mangled remains to try to identify victims in a gruesome database. In the first four months of this year, more than 1,200 people have been killed, according to official figures. Many get run over crossing the tracks, too rushed or tired to use pedestrian overpasses. ""People here believe in shortcuts which is a very bad habit,"" rail official Bhagwat Dahisarkar said with extravagant understatement. His office fined about 30,000 people $12 each last year for breaking rules. Tickets average about 10 rupees (25 cents). Last year, 186 people died when bombs went off on seven trains during the evening rush hour. The British built the first railways in Mumbai in the 1850s, but more recently a lack of investment and a city growing rapidly as migrants flood in has stretched the system to breaking point. Officials are splashing out on a $2 billion upgrade -- the first major overhaul since independence in 1947 -- that will add 180 km (110 miles) of new track and 147 trains over five years. But even when all these new coaches are rolling, commuter trains will have to carry 1.5 times their capacity at peak hours. For Mumbai's 17 million residents, the railways are indispensable but a form of slow torture: traveling from the southern business districts to the ever-lengthening northern suburbs where most live takes about two hours. Road travel is also painfully slow and often impossible during the annual monsoon, when torrential rains flood streets waist deep. Mumbai's stations are busy round the clock, as waiting passengers, new arrivals with one way tickets looking for work, the homeless, beggars, drug addicts, dogs and cows battle for space. Trains -- plastered with adverts for items like toothpaste, underwear and condoms -- run every five to seven minutes, but delays are common, leading edgy commuters to hit out at the slightest provocation. Angry passengers riot a few times each year, rampaging through stations and, occasionally, torching trains and clashing with police. ""We feel like goats and sheep herded into a compartment with no space to move and no proper ventilation,"" said 52-year-old shop owner Rajesh Vasavda. ""I bet no high-level government official ever takes a ride back home in these crowded trains. The day they are forced into one, I am sure immediate action will be taken."" Authorities say the ongoing network upgrade will improve matters, but commuters are skeptical. ""Plans are always made, but nothing really happens,"" said Bidisha Mukherjee, a young commuter. ""If they want to do something, it had better be quick."" E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- Friday was an extremely unusual day, astronomically speaking. Just as scientists were gearing up to witness an asteroid's closest ever approach to Earth in recorded history, a sizeable meteor exploded over Russia, causing thousands of injuries and major damage to buildings. The asteroid, named DA14, came within 17,000 miles or so, as close as a telecommunication satellite in geosynchronous orbit. DA14 is quite a bit smaller than YU55, the asteroid that passed Earth in November 2011, but DA14 came more than 10 times closer. These two rare events occurred the same day. Your inner mathematician and your inner prophet of the end times think they should be connected. But scientists say they are not. What gives? 11 meteor tweets we wish we'd thought of . First, some facts. Meteors are rocky bodies that enter the Earth's atmosphere. Some are leftover debris out of which planets like Earth are formed, while others are the remnants of shattered comets and asteroids. As long as their orbit intersects the Earth's orbit, these rocks can in principle impact the Earth. Actually, this happens all the time, although usually the impacts occur in unpopulated regions since most of Earth is uninhabited. In fact, most meteors fall into the ocean simply because water covers two-thirds of the planet. So we don't witness most meteor impacts. If one landed in New York City or Moscow, people would definitely notice. Fortunately, the odds are very much against hitting a densely populated region. The meteor that fell Friday near Chelyabinsk, Russia, was pretty big, maybe 50 feet across. In 1908, a slightly larger meteor -- perhaps three times larger in diameter, or 27 times larger in mass -- flattened a thousand square miles of forest near Tunguska, Russia, downing some 80 million trees. NASA scientists estimate that meteors as large as Friday's might hit the Earth every decade or two, while Tunguska-like events are estimated to occur once every 1,000 years. The close fly-by of an asteroid like DA14, like the Tunguska meteor, is a once-in-1,000-years event. Asteroids are large, irregular, rocky bodies orbiting the Sun roughly between Mars and Jupiter. Many have impacted the Earth over its 4.5 billion-year history --as they have hit the moon, Mars and other planets -- leaving craters behind. A particularly large asteroid -- roughly 300 times larger across than DA14 (and 30 million times its volume, and far more rare) -- created a planetary extinction event that did in dinosaurs 65 million years ago, allowing mammals to rise to their present-day prominence. Opinion: Meteor shows why it is crucial to keep an eye on the sky . Using NASA's WISE infrared satellite, astronomers estimate there are about 5,000 known meteors that can impact the Earth with sizes of about 100 feet or larger -- that is, larger than the Chelyabinsk meteor. Smaller ones are fainter and thus harder to find. It makes sense that smaller asteroids pass Earth more frequently and, on average, closer. That's because in nature, small things are more common than big things. So asteroids like YU55 are more rare than DA14, which in turn is more rare than the Chelyabinsk meteor. Because there are more DA14s filling interplanetary space than YU55s, a 50-foot asteroid can be found in a smaller volume of space, on average, and thus closer to Earth, than a 150-foot one.Now let's talk about coincidence. Mathematicians frame this issue in terms of probability -- that is, the likelihood that something will happen. A rare thing is unlikely, so we say it has a low probability of occurring. Two rare events happening at approximately the same time is much more unlikely. Here is how to think of it mathematically: If the events are not associated, the probability of this coincidence comes from multiplying the individual probabilities. For example, the probability that your birthday is on a given date -- say, January 1 -- is 1/365. That is, of every 365 readers of this article, roughly one will have a birthday on January 1. Five things to know about asteroids and meteors . Now, the probability that the next reader's birthday is also on January 1 is 1/365 times 1/365, or about 1 in 130,000. If that many people read the article, such a coincidence could happen. Of course, it's much more likely that two non-consecutive readers will have a birthday on January 1. And it's very likely that lots of readers have the same birthday as other readers. (In fact, in any group of 23 or more people, it is more than 50% likely that two will share a birthday, but calculating that probability is a bit more complicated.) Back to the meteor and the asteroid. Both events happening within one day makes us think they could be connected. That instinct comes from doing the math -- if it is improbable, then we think it cannot be a coincidence. But the facts don't support this conclusion. First of all, in the time between the two events, the Earth moved roughly 300,000 miles, meaning the asteroid and the meteor were in completely different places. Moreover, they traveled in completely different directions, so they couldn't have been associated. So there is no way the meteor and the asteroid are connected. It has to be a coincidence that the two events happened on the same day. Yet this would seem to be at odds with our instinct that two very rare things would not happen at the same time. Russian scientists track down fragments of Urals meteor . How can we reconcile these two opposite thoughts: the impossibility of an association based on the physics of trajectories, and the improbability of coincidence (lack of association) that the math suggests? The answer is that we need to rethink the probability calculation. If asteroids as big as DA14 pass close to Earth once every decade or two, and meteors as large as the Chelyabinsk one impact once every 100 years (a similar meteor having caused the Tunguska event in 1908), the chance of both events happening on any one day are indeed very small: 1 in 3,650 days times 1 in 36,500 days, or about 1 in 100 million -- not odds you would bet against. But think again: The Earth has been around for 4.5 billion years -- which is 1.6 trillion days. So the chance that these two events would happen on a day sometime in the earth's history is actually larger than we first thought -- it ought to have happened about 12,000 times already. Of course, during most of that 4.5 billion year history, the earth was not populated by intelligent life -- human beings who might have noticed the two events happening on the same day. So what is the probability that the meteor hits and the asteroid passes Earth on the same day when someone could record it on video? That's probably been possible for about 50 years, or only about five years if we have to do it on a smartphone or dashboard camera. That's 1,825 days, which means the chance of someone filming the event is only about one in 70,000 -- and that's if people blanketed the Earth. Given how sparsely the Earth is populated, we should correct this number downward by a (large!) geographical factor. It's also unlikely that this event would happen within 3,000 miles of the Tunguska impact. What to think? Our rough calculation says a large meteor impact on the same day as closest passage of the DA14 asteroid is really improbable. But it did happen. Something in our assumptions could be wrong. For example, the frequency of meteor impacts could be much larger and our estimates too low because we don't notice most of them. Then again, maybe sometimes, long odds just pay off. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","Meg Urry: Friday was an extremely unusual day, astronomically speaking .

"(CNN) -- To start with, Cordell Jude was hungry. He was 22, the spring days were growing longer and the temperature in Phoenix had climbed to 80 degrees that Tuesday in April 2012. It was not much cooler as the sun slipped behind the Sierra Estrella mountains, so shortly before 8 pm, Jude drove with his pregnant fianceÃ© toward a suburban intersection crowded with fast-food restaurants, a Home Depot, a Starbucks, drug stores and gas stations. Not far off, another man was headed the same way. Daniel Adkins was 29, older than Jude, but mentally disabled. His family described him as more like a 12- or 13-year-old. Adkins was walking his yellow Labrador retriever named Lady past a Taco Bell in the gathering evening, when he stepped around a blind corner and was nearly hit by Jude's vehicle. Police say the two men exchanged angry words, the dispute rapidly escalated, and it ended when Jude pulled out a .40-caliber pistol and shot Adkins dead. Jude, who was still in his car at the time of the shooting, told police it was self-defense, that Adkins had lunged at him with a bat of some kind. But investigators found no such weapon, and even if they had County Attorney Bill Montgomery says, ""The threshold that people believe needs to be crossed when they brandish a weapon, never mind actually use it ... is a lot higher than what it actually is."" Jude is now charged with murder in that killing last year, and because he is black and Adkins was not, the case is drawing comparisons to the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman. Why the comparison? If Jude is convicted, some would argue there's racism in the justice system. In the Florida case, a black teen is killed and an Hispanic shooter is acquitted. In the other, a black man who claims self-defense faces prison time. Unstable ground: The fine line between self-defense and murder . The key questions being asked by many: If Zimmerman was acquitted because he felt threatened, shouldn't Jude also walk? And if he doesn't, will his race and that of the victim have played a role? The nation has a long history of self-defense laws. Almost every state allows some version of the ""castle"" defense, as in ""a man's home is his castle."" These laws generally allow people to defend themselves, their family and their property against anyone who intrudes upon their living space, with deadly force if necessary. CNN legal analyst Mark NeJame says, ""If you walk into my house uninvited, odds are you aren't going to be walking out. And most people support that. You're going to protect your home and your family, and there's very little argument about that."" It gets trickier when we start talking about so-called ""stand your ground"" laws which exist in more than 20 states. Those laws extend the castle principle so that if you are legally in some place --a parking lot, a mall, a football stadium -- it becomes like your home. Accordingly, if someone attempts to attack you there, once again you are free to fight back and are under no compunction to attempt to avoid the conflict. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder finds such laws troubling, saying they ""senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods. These laws try to fix something that was never broken."" But if self-defense laws have never been broken, many legal analysts have long noted that they can certainly be bent. Rob a bank, steal a car, set fire to a house and authorities usually don't much care how you feel about the crime. But self-defense cases are all about feelings. Why did the person feel afraid? Was that fear justified? Was the response warranted? NeJame says that is where the slope gets slippery. ""The standard is generally what a reasonable person would do under the circumstances and do you reasonably fear death or bodily injury? That's a very subjective standard. It's not an objective standard. We're all human beings. Everyone is going to perceive something differently."" The Zimmerman case illustrates his point perfectly. Many African-American trial watchers had no trouble seeing Zimmerman -- trailing after Martin with his cell phone on a rainy night -- as the aggressor. That interpretation makes sense if you frame it with a long history of black people feeling unfairly targeted by police, security guards and others. As President Barack Obama put it Friday, ""I don't want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida."" Many whites, however, have enjoyed a different relationship with the police and saw Martin as an architect of his own violent end. They asked: Why didn't he call the police if he felt threatened? Why didn't he ask Zimmerman if something was wrong and explain where he was going? Everyone who watched the trial saw the same facts and heard the same witnesses, but like characters in the old Japanese film ""Rashomon"" they came away with different stories. Grappling with such vagaries is the challenge in a great many self-defense cases. To be sure, sometimes cases in which people are purportedly protecting themselves or their property are easy to sort out. Protesters stand up to 'stand your ground,' but laws likely here to stay . Just this past week in Milwaukee, 76-year-old John Spooner, who is white, faced charges that he killed a 13-year-old neighbor who was black. Spooner accused Darius Simmons of burglarizing his home, and two days later accosted the young man as he retrieved his family's trash cans from the curb. On a surveillance tape, Spooner is seen emerging from his house with a pistol in hand, waving the weapon at Simmons, and ultimately shooting him at a distance of five or six feet. The boy, who offered no visible signs of resistance during the entire confrontation, died on the street in his mother's arms. Spooner's lawyers argued that their client suffers from mental illness, saying ""He didn't appreciate the wrongfulness of what he was doing"" as he railed about his property. The court did not buy it, and Spooner was convicted. But so many other matters of self or property defense involve difficult, complicated questions. Was the defendant previously assaulted and thereby living in a state of heightened alarm? Was he or she a naturally excitable or nervous type? Did something else happen near the same time or in close proximity to the final incident that might have spurred an excessive reaction? ""We have to defend ourselves if someone is truly coming after us,"" NeJame says. ""The last thing anyone wants to do is put themselves, their home or their family at risk. On the other hand, we need to make it so that we don't have a trigger-happy society."" All of that means in the end, as much as people may want to find a perfect parallel to the Zimmerman case; a ""gotcha"" verdict from some other place in which a black man is convicted for doing just what Zimmerman did, it is unlikely. Because self-defense cases that look alike from a distance on a dark evening, may be substantially different when the details and defendants are dragged into the light of day.","Arizona fatal shooting raises questions of self-defense .

"(CNN) -- Fresh sectarian clashes in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine killed three people and left more than 400 houses, a monastery and a mosque burned to the ground, authorities said Tuesday. The clashes began Sunday night and spread to four townships, said state Attorney General Hla Thein. Rakhine is home to the Rohingya, an ethnic Muslim minority who say they have been persecuted by the Myanmar military during its decades of authoritarian rule. More on Myanmar: Leader holds landmark press briefing . The unrest between the majority Buddhists and the Rohingya minority began five months ago and has tested the efforts of President Thein Sein's administration to seek reconciliation with Myanmar's different ethnic groups and move the country toward more democratic governance. Authorities have declared at state of emergency in two of the townships, with the state's prime minister instructing that medical teams be accompanied by security personnel when they visit them. The situation in the region has been tense since May when police detained three Muslim men in relation to the rape and killing of a Buddhist woman. Two of the men were sentenced to death; the third hanged himself while in detention. More on Myanmar: U.S. to ease Myanmar import ban . News of the crime appears to have motivated several hundred people to attack a bus in Rakhine in early June, killing 10 Muslims who were on board. The violence then spread across the northern part of the state, resulting in the destruction of thousands of homes and the deaths of dozens, according to the government. The national government declared a state of emergency in Rakhine, bringing in the military to help restore order. Hundreds of Rohingyas tried to cross the border into neighboring Bangladesh, but were turned back. Bangladesh said it already has too many Rohingya refugees, estimating that about 300,000 live in the country.

"(CNN) -- Ten people suffered minor injuries Monday when the nose gear of a Southwest Airlines jetliner collapsed after landing at New York's LaGuardia Airport, the city's Port Authority reported. Southwest Flight 345 was landing at LaGuardia from Nashville about 5:40 p.m. when the accident occurred. The nose of the blue-and-orange jet came to rest on the ground after the aircraft came to a stop, and passengers evacuated the aircraft on emergency slides. ""The aircraft skidded down the runway on its nose and then veered off and came to rest in a grass area between the runway and taxiway foxtrot,"" Thomas Bosco, the airport's general manager, told reporters. It stopped about halfway down the 7,000-foot runway. Kathy Boles, a passenger aboard the Boeing 737, said a ""strong jolt"" could be felt inside the cabin when the gear failed and the nose slammed into the tarmac. ""It was just a bang and a bounce, and then a slam on the brakes and a skidding feeling,"" Boles told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""I feel extremely blessed to have come off that,"" she said. ""It just really felt like the plane could have broken in half, it was such a hard impact."" Fellow passenger Anastasia Elliot said the situation was ""pretty chaotic."" ""We hit the ground pretty hard and slid,"" she said. ""There was a lot of smoke filling the plane, just a lot of smoke and burnt rubber."" Another passenger said it felt like the plane crashed and then skidded to a stop. ""Everything in the plane that was loose went flying forward,"" Bill Roland said. ""There were cell phones, iPads, books (and) drinks all skidded up."" A total of 150 people were aboard the flight. In addition to the 10 injured aboard the plane, a Port Authority police officer was treated for heat exhaustion, Bosco said. There were conflicting reports about how many members of the aircraft's crew were among the injured. Southwest said three flight attendants had reported being hurt, while Bosco said the six-member crew had been taken to a hospital for observation. LaGuardia was closed to arriving flights as emergency vehicles surrounded the disabled jet, but the airport was back open for arrivals and departures by 7 p.m., Bosco said. Initially, the Federal Aviation Administration said the crew reported a possible nose gear problem before landing, but later amended that to say that after it reviewed air controller tapes, no issues were noted ahead of time. The National Transportation Safety Board was aware of the incident and sent an investigator to the scene. The incident followed a runway crash of an Asiana jetliner in San Francisco last month that killed three people and injured more than 180 others. Investigators in that crash will not determine a cause for several months at least but initial attention has focused on actions of the crew during approach. The 737 has a conventional hydraulic landing gear system -- a unit under each wing and a steerable wheel that extends from under the nose. Pilots can land safely with only the main gear operable and such incidents occur from time to time. Southwest has more than 600 of the 737s in its fleet, including those operated by its subsidiary AirTran. In May: Plane lands without landing gear at Newark .

"Washington (CNN) -- Internships can be crucial career-builders. But what if you can't afford to work for free all summer? Jessica Padron of Nevada may have found the solution. After securing a prestigious unpaid student internship in the office of Senate leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, she has begun a crowdfunding appeal online. She is asking donors to help pay for her housing, transportation, and food, which she estimates will cost her $6,500 over the four months in the capital. ""If I don't reach my goal,"" she writes in her appeal, ""I will be forced to relinquish this opportunity and miss out on this once in a lifetime chance."" As of Tuesday, online donors had already chipped in enough for half of her costs. Some observers say there is some irony here, given that plenty of lawmakers are pushing to raise the minimum wage, yet don't pay a cent to some of their hardest workers. ""Of everybody in the federal government, only Congress is allowed to use unpaid interns,"" says Eric Glatt, a former unpaid intern who is now an activist with the Fair Pay Campaign. ""They have explicitly written an exemption for themselves into the law."" And it's not just Congress. Private employers in Washington and across the country can offer internships without pay. (Disclosure: CNN pays its interns.) Glatt warns that because only affluent students can afford to work for free, many students will be denied a crucial career experience. ""It is excluding the vast majority of people who cannot afford to work for free, or have their parents afford for their children to work for free,"" he said. ""It also promotes inequality."" Glatt worked for free as an intern on the movie ""Black Swan,"" but later successfully sued the movie studio, claiming that it was not fair that he was paid nothing. ""Employers think that if they slap the word intern on a job then they don't have to pay for it,"" he said. ""Why do people think they can get away with this?"" But at a time of elevated unemployment, and government spending cuts, it may be difficult to persuade employers to pay minimum wage. And requiring all interns to be paid could have a downside, according to Michael Saltsman at the Employment Policies Institute. ""If we mandate that all internships must be paid, and then we have fewer internships, I don't think that helps anyone,"" he said. Plus, he said, while internships often involve menial work, they also provide valuable experience and interesting work, and should not be jeopardized with new requirements. ""These are internships that dozens or hundreds of people would really pine for."" Indeed, one intern, with the publication ""The Daily Caller,"" had a chance to ask a question at the daily White House briefing last month. And several interns for news outlets became famous during the live coverage of the Supreme Court's biggest decisions in June, as they sprinted out of the court holding the papers that announced how the court ruled on the Civil Rights Act and same-sex marriage. The spectacle was nicknamed ""The Running of the Interns."" And the value of internships on a resume is something undergraduates are keenly aware of. ""All I hear from the career center at school is, internships are almost a necessary thing,"" says Emma Dolson, a student at Wake Forest, who scored a (paid) internship with a lobbying firm in D.C. ""Your resume needs to have internships on it or you are way, way behind,"" she said.","One intern turns to web to raise money to cover housing, food costs .
Congress only area of government allowed to have unpaid interns .
But private employers can offer similar work without pay .

"(CNN) -- Two of the dozens of bush fires burning out of control in the eastern Australian state of New South Wales were sparked by power lines that had been buffeted by strong winds, fire officials said Saturday, citing preliminary investigations. In the Springwood fire, 193 homes have been destroyed and another 109 damaged. In the Mt. Victoria fire, seven homes have been destroyed and one damaged, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said in a statement. Fire investigators were still looking into the cause of the other fires. Earlier, authorities said they were trying to determine whether one of the fires was caused by a military training exercise. A huge blaze near Lithgow, New South Wales, started on October 16, when officials ""were conducting an explosive ordnance training activity,"" the Australian Department of Defense said. Investigators were trying to determine whether the two events are linked, the statement said. Authorities said this week that some 95 fires were burning and that 34 of them were out of control. The Springwood and Winmalee areas of the Blue Mountains were among the hardest hit, the fire service said. It suggested residents seek shelter and protect themselves from the heat. Emergency alert telephone warning messages were being sent to people in the area, the fire service said. The fires have caused numerous road closures in the state, the fire service said, adding that a damage assessment was underway. At least one fatality has been reported. Walter Lindner, 63, died of a suspected heart attack on Friday while defending his home against a blaze on the New South Wales Central Coast, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Lindner collapsed while working alongside his neighbor to save his heritage-listed homestead, according to ABC. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. The toll has been emotional for many. ""I said to my husband, I remembered when he carried me across the threshold,"" a 54-year-old woman whose house was a total loss told Reuters. ""I've got to start again, but we will ... as a family, together."" The Blue Mountains area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site west of Sydney. Fires sent plumes of smoke into the air. New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell warned Thursday that hundreds of homes could be destroyed. Footage broadcast earlier by CNN affiliate Seven Network showed flames consuming homes.","NEW: ""I've got to start again,"" says a 54-year-old woman .

"BLOWING ROCK, North Carolina (CNN)  -- Behind the bar at a local restaurant, Doc Hendley leans in to hear his customer over the band. ""You like the pinot? Cool,"" he says. Bartender Doc Hendley has tapped his regular customers to help provide funds for clean water around the world. It's a seemingly average interaction, but Hendley is not your average bartender. As he pours wine in the United States, he's also helping to save thousands of lives on the other side of the world -- and he's tapped into his regulars to help. ""[They] sit on the same stool, drink the same drink, pay the same tab every day. I felt like they really did want to be a part of something,"" Hendley says. ""They just were waiting for somebody to bring that something to them."" That something is Wine to Water, Hendley's organization that provides clean water to people in developing countries through funds raised at wine tasting events. Since 2004, Hendley has traveled to Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda and Cambodia, working with local communities to build clean water wells and sanitation systems. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year . The 30-year-old first learned about the world's water crisis when he took a break from college, and his job as a bar-keep, to travel the world; he hoped it would ground his education and provide some direction. It did. ""I began seeing the figures [of] people that don't have access to clean water -- and it absolutely floored me,"" he recalls. At least one in six people worldwide lack access to adequate amounts of safe water for drinking and hygiene, according to the UN. This contributes to diarrhea, the leading cause of illness and death, and translates to 1.5 million preventable deaths each year. After returning to school, Hendley realized that just by using his ability to bartend and create relationships with people, he might be able to help the problem. At the bars where he worked, he solicited evenings to host wine tastings and provide information about the global crisis. By graduation, Hendley's ""Wine to Water"" events had yielded enough funding to implement water projects in the developing world. He approached a local contact, Kenny Isaacs of Samaritan's Purse, with the intention of handing over the funds for their international charitable water projects. Instead, Hendley found himself in Sudan in the spring of 2004, training to oversee water projects and developing and installing water systems in zones deemed too dangerous for United Nations aide workers -- all in the midst of civil war. ""[I was] seeing these people living in conflicts, bullets whizzing by their ears -- yet their biggest concern was the huge loss of life because of the unclean water,"" he recalls. ""That's when water changed from being my passion to the burden of my life.""  Watch Hendley describe how the experience in Darfur affected him » . After a year of service in Darfur, Hendley returned to the States and continued his fundraising events while focusing on ways his group could improve upon other water project models. ""Throughout the desert there were bore holes [for wells] all over the place, they just weren't working,"" says Hendley. ""Organizations would put a brand new, $15,000 bore hole in a village that already had one; [they] didn't stop to think that maybe that one is broken or just needs some parts."" Wine to Water is dedicated to achieving sustainability through education and empowerment of local community members, training them to install, maintain and repair their own water systems.  Watch Hendley help a Cambodia community build a well for its school » . Hendley has found this approach reduces overhead costs, leaving more for investment in water initiatives and local economies. Because his operation is small, Hendley says he's less deterred by the instability of areas in dire need and is able to access pockets of the world that larger organizations may have to avoid. To date, Hendley's group has worked in five developing countries, including India, bringing safe drinking water to more than 25,000 individuals in refugee camps, orphanages, schools, hospitals and a leper colony, as well as directly into hundreds of homes through the installation of bio-sand filters.  Watch how Hendley is changing lives around the world » . In the face of the overwhelming global crisis, Hendley says his work may be a drop in the bucket, but to him it's nothing short of a miracle. ""You can be a bartender in Raleigh, North Carolina; you can be just a regular anybody. And you really, really can change the world,"" he says. ""You can touch thousands of lives. I'm walking truth of that."" Want to get involved? Check out Wine to Water and see how to help.","Bartender raises funds and awareness for clean drinking water projects .

"(CNN) -- Panicking passengers turned to prayer as a Cathay Pacific flight with one engine ablaze made an emergency landing in Singapore on Monday, witnesses said. ""We heard a series of loud bangs, then smelled fire, and the aircraft started shaking uncontrollably,"" a CNN.com online commenter under the name of Augustus2002 said. ""The noise on board was incredible, we could not hear any of the announcements of the crew,"" he added. CNN has not been able to confirm his account, but it matches a description from a Reuters photographer who was on the plane with his family. The photographer, Beawiharta, who uses only one name, told the news agency that his 15-year-old son spotted flames out the window of the twin-engine Airbus A330, which was on the way to Jakarta, Indonesia, but turned back after the engine problems began. ""Panicked, he then asked: 'Will we die? Will we die?' "" the photographer recalled. The atmosphere among the plane's 136 passengers quickly changed to a ""surprising calm,"" Augustus2002 wrote, as people began to pray. ""God, save our flight,"" they said, according to Beawiharta's account. ""Give us your protection."" Flight CX715 landed safely, the airline said in a statement ""following a stall warning"" on one engine. No passengers were injured. The flight landed at Singapore  Changi Airport, where it had originated. ""Fire services met the aircraft on arrival,"" Cathay Pacific's statement said. ""The aircraft stopped on the taxiway and sparks from the No. 2 engine were reported. They were doused by fire extinguishers."" Cathay Pacific and Rolls Royce, the maker of the engine, have launched an investigation into the incident, which has been reported to the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department, the airline said. ""We are aware of the incident and working closely with our customers to provide support and technical assitance,"" Rolls Royce said in a statement. It was the second time one of the Hong Kong-based airline's Airbus A330 planes has made an emergency landing. Eight passengers aboard a Cathay Pacific plane were injured last year after an Airbus A330 with engine problems made an emergency landing in Hong Kong. Several tires deflated as the aircraft landed at high speed with severe braking, the company's CEO said at that time. Less than a month later, an Airbus A330 plane operated by Afriquayah Airways crashed just before landing in Tripoli, Libya, killing all but one of the 104 passengers on board. Shortly afterward, investigators said low visibility caused by mist and sand created poor flying conditions for the plane's pilot. CNN's Ayesha Durgahee and Andrew Henstock contributed to this report.","NEW: Rolls Royce says it is aware of the incident and providing technical assistance .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Three American crew members died when a Zimbabwean cargo plane crashed early Saturday at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said. The embassy said one of the injured crew members was also an American. The crash happened at about 8:15 a.m. (7:15 p.m. ET Friday) during takeoff in Shanghai, according to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. The plane was destined for Harare, Zimbabwe, said the agency. The NTSB is sending an investigation team to site of the accident. Four other people on the plane were seriously injured, and the cause of the crash is not yet known, the NTSB said. Earlier, China's official Xinhua news agency reported that the plane was on its way to Kyrgyzstan and caught fire on takeoff.

"Washington (CNN) -- The number of Americans who say the economy is in good shape has dropped to the lowest level of the year, according to a new national poll. And a CNN/ORC International survey also indicates that economic pessimism is growing in the wake of the government shutdown, with nearly six in 10 forecasting poor economic conditions a year from now. The poll's Tuesday morning release comes a few hours before the Labor Department announces the September unemployment report. The release of last month's jobless figures was delayed because of the 16-day partial government shutdown. In the poll that was conducted this past weekend, 71% of those questioned say that economic conditions are poor right now, with only 29% saying that current conditions are good -- a drop of 4 percentage points since late September, just before the shutdown began. Opinion: 3 ways to avert the next budget crisis . ""That number has not been particularly high in 2013, but throughout the year it has always been over 30%, making the current level of 29% the worst number since December of last year,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Only 40% say that the economy will be in good shape a year from now. That's down from 50% in June and represents the lowest level of optimism since October 2011. Some 59% say the economy will be in poor shape next fall. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International October 18-20, with 841 adults nationwide questioned by telephone.

"(CNN) -- For a brief moment, I consider interrupting the first Monday of my vacation. I have been trying to schedule three calls for weeks. On the Friday before my vacation starts, I learn that everyone I've needed to interview for the past few weeks will be available on the first weekday of my vacation. Can I do it? I have no idea what we might be doing that Monday. Maybe we'll be at the beach, canoeing with the kids, at a seafood shack for lunch or celebrating my friend's birthday with cake or pie or whatever she likes. (What does she want? Note to self to ask her sister or her son.) I realize the irony here. How often have I written stories extolling the benefits of a real vacation? I've often suggested putting down the smartphone and leaving work e-mail and projects behind. Never mind living your vacation on social media: I've even reported that taking too many pictures can get in the way of truly experiencing a vacation. I have no doubt that a real vacation free of work is good for me. I'm looking forward to time off with my daughter and my friends. And if I let the farmland that is my brain go fallow for a time and enjoy my vacation with friends and family, I might come back rested with more story ideas for CNN.com. So why is it so hard to put down work and enjoy time off? Eventually, I discovered a solution that kept me true to the people I wanted to interview -- and to myself. But first, I wanted to learn more about this tricky issue: . Maybe I'm not indispensable? About 57% of Americans who get vacation time don't use all of it, most of them because of their heavy workload, according to a Harris Interactive study for JetBlue. And almost 10% of those surveyed reported that the unstable job market -- the U.S. unemployment rate was 8.3% in July -- made them afraid to take time off. Those twin concerns are real: Workers heading out on vacation legitimately worry about the work that can pile up while they're away. They also might feel guilty about leaving work to others who may not do as a good a job. Or maybe they will? Any injured Major League Baseball player knows the rookie brought up from the minor leagues is auditioning for his slot. Who's getting paid time off? Whatever the reason, many of us don't ever truly disconnect from work. Only 2% of respondents to a global survey didn't check in with work while on vacation, according to Leslie Perlow, a Harvard Business School professor who conducted a 2009 survey of Harvard Business School executive education alumni. While her survey respondents weren't explicitly concerned about losing their jobs, they did worry about how they would be perceived by others and what might happen in their absence. ""It's very hard to just turn off because things do happen (at work) and there are internal and external expectations,"" says Perlow, author of ""Sleeping with Your Smartphone: How to Break the 24/7 Habit and Change the Way You Work."" ""If something important comes up and people don't know about it, they can get their hands slapped for it. So they check in just in case."" The addiction to connection . In a fast-paced work environment where thousands of e-mails get sent every day, the stimulation from work can be addictive. It's also an easy way to avoid nagging personal issues like the state of one's marriage or the problems the children are having at school -- or even your bad childhood relationship with your parents. (Have you been avoiding anything lately?) Turning off the technology to enjoy a nature hike or a sunset can seem boring or torture (for those with family troubles) in comparison. That doesn't sound like fun. ""A lot of people are really busy because they take a little dose of family and then they want to back off,"" says Joanne Cantor, a communications professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. ""You can see parents with teenagers and see teens going for their gadgets all the time. It's a good thing, but not necessarily the easiest thing to devote more time to your family."" Why bother vacationing at all if it's going to cause stress at work or force you to hang out with family you don't even like? At least taking your smartphone or computer will allow you to get away from all that restfulness and togetherness. Vacation makes you a better employee . Cantor promises there is a benefit. When we're looking through the narrow tunnel of what we need to do just for today or tomorrow or this week, we tend to see things the same way. Stepping outside the workplace for a bit can help people see new solutions to age-old problems. ""Your brain can't focus constantly [so] just getting out of that routine of focusing on your screen just refreshes your brain and makes your brain work better,"" says Cantor, author of ""Conquer CyberOverload: Get More Done, Boost Your Creativity, and Reduce Stress."" ""If you get away, it allows your brain to relax and allows all these other things you know that you haven't thought of in awhile and don't think are related to what you're doing and to come to the forefront naturally."" Which countries have the most vacation days? My enjoyment of a sunset apparently doesn't just benefit me. A workplace where everyone works together in advance to cover each other on vacation can actually become a more efficient workplace. Imagine a workplace where managers and staff talk in advance about priorities and what actually needs to get done when anyone goes on vacation. ""It causes us to be much more open and aware of what really needs to get done,"" says Perlow. ""It's a tremendous learning (opportunity) because we better understand our work and have more collective ownership (of the workplace). Managers talk about how their team members can step up and solve problems they couldn't solve before."" It's OK to take a work call . It doesn't mean you'll never get interrupted on vacation, Perlow says. A collaborative work environment might designate a colleague who will check your e-mail while you're away and only call you ""if it's truly urgent and no one internally can respond,"" she says. ""It avoids you having to check your e-mail just in case."" That happened to me the first time my boss went on vacation. She trained me in advance to cover for her, made sure I knew who to ask for help and didn't penalize me for any mistakes I made while she was away. My colleagues helped, explaining all sorts of technical tasks that made no sense to me. She gave me enough information that I could leave her alone while she was away. So I made a commitment to stay away from work for my week in Wellfleet. No matter that our house would have wireless Internet access: I decided to try to only use it for fun: the phone number for the kayaking rentals at Gull Pond, the hours for my favorite seafood shack and other good stuff. That didn't mean I wouldn't take any urgent work calls (I had just one) or reply to a few e-mails. But I'd try to be on vacation. For all those reasons, I wrote some version of the following message to my interviewees: ""I'm on vacation next week and must protect it or all my travel stories about the importance of taking a vacation will be a lie."" ""I applaud and envy your fence-building around personal time ... enjoy!"" replied Brad Hawkins, a spokesman for Southwest Airlines. We scheduled his call for the Tuesday after my return. How do you handle work while on vacation? What (if anything) do you wish you could change about how you vacation? Please tell us in the comments section below.","Most Americans who get vacation time don't use all of it because of their workload .

"(CNN) -- American history is replete with examples of people who try to build a reputation by standing in the way of presidential initiatives. We see that today with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who is acting as if he believes that, aided by a small group of tea party-supported members of Congress, he can force the president to do his bidding by shutting down the government. In this respect, Cruz is like Huey Long, the Louisiana senator and Depression-era demagogue. Long believed that he could gain a national following by being a thorn in the side of President Franklin Roosevelt. Cruz -- who, like Long, revels in the use of the filibuster -- appears to think that he can do the same by being a thorn in the side of President Barack Obama, whose Affordable Care Act he is seeking to derail. Cruz routinely says that he does not want a government shutdown, but he continues to encourage House members to refuse a continuing resolution vote that would let the government get back to business as usual. In a Sunday interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" with Candy Crowley, Cruz rejected the idea that an alternative to shutting down the government would be for him and his fellow tea party supporters to persuade Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act in a straight up-or-down vote. The situation, Cruz told Crowley, was too dire to rely on the normal legislative process to settle matters. If Obamacare is enacted, ""it's going to destroy the private health insurance system,"" Cruz predicted. The only alternative, he contended, was for the House Republicans to force a government shutdown until the president and the Senate made more concessions on the Affordable Care Act. Ted Cruz: Democrats' new bogeyman . As for his actions hurting what Crowley called ""the Republican Party brand,"" Cruz had a confident, two-word answer: ""Not remotely."" For Huey Long, annoying the president was great fun. He helped get the Senate to reject the treaty that would have brought the United States into the World Court, and he launched an unsuccessful effort to make employees of the National Recovery Administration subject to Senate confirmation. The problem was that Long often went beyond being annoying with his obstructionism. The classic case of Huey Long not caring about the consequences of his actions occurred in August 1935 as Congress was getting ready to adjourn. Long conducted a filibuster against an otherwise routine deficiency-appropriation bill, because he believed the bill did not help wheat and cotton farmers enough. When Senate colleagues told Long, who earlier in the summer had filibustered for over 15 hours, that his actions would also deprive the government of funds for railroad pensions and New Deal welfare projects, he ignored them. As a result, the deficiency-appropriation bill was killed, and among those hurt by its failure to pass the Senate were many of those most vulnerable to the Depression. Long, a Democrat, was assassinated in September 1935 when he returned to Louisiana for a special session of the state legislature, but his rear-guard action against Roosevelt and the New Deal did not go unnoticed by FDR's foes on the right. After Congress passed the Social Security Act in 1935, Republicans and their supporters did everything they could to prevent it from being implemented in January 1937, much as the House is trying to do now with Obamacare . In the 1936 elections, Alf Landon, the Republican presidential nominee, called Social Security a ""cruel hoax"" and announced ""the Republican party will have nothing to do with any plan that involves prying into the personal records of 26 million people."" Opinion: Four ways for Obama to lead U.S. out of crisis . As far as FDR was concerned, the eleventh-hour political attacks against Social Security were different from the partisan campaigns both parties had previously waged. FDR refused to give his opponents credit for acting in good faith and he refused to waver in his defense of Social Security. Roosevelt's resolution paid off. He won the 1936 election in a landslide, carrying all but two states, Maine and Vermont. He even increased his majority in Congress. Obama is not the campaigner that Franklin Roosevelt was, but he does not have to be when it comes to refusing to let his Affordable Care Act be made a hostage to the threat of a long government shutdown. The most recent Quinnipiac University Poll shows that nearly three-quarters of all voters, 72%, oppose a government shutdown designed to stop or weaken the Affordable Care Act. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","Nicolaus Mills: Ted Cruz has acted to enhance his reputation, heedless of consequences .

"(CNN) -- A bag from a missing plane carrying a member of the famed Missoni fashion house has been found on the Caribbean island of Curacao, according to U.S. Missoni spokeswoman Angela Mariani. The plane went missing off the coast of Venezuela on January 4. Aboard were Vittorio Missoni, his wife and four others. Missoni, 58, is a director of the fashion house, which he runs with his siblings, Luca and Angela. According to Mariani, the bag belonged to an Italian tourist whose plane took off just minutes after the Missoni plane departed. Because there was no room on the tourist's plane for his bag, it was put on the Missoni plane. The aircraft was traveling from Los Roques, an archipelago and resort, south to Caracas. The bag was discovered by a German tourist on the island of Curacao, about 124 miles west of Los Roques. ""The Missoni family is aware of this news. However, no conclusions can be drawn from this information. The search is continuing in full force,"" the family said in an official statement.

"(EW.com) -- Obi-Wan Kenobi said act on instinct â€” but others might see this as a disturbance in the Force. Lucasfilm has announced that ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" director J.J. Abrams and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" writer Lawrence Kasdan have taken over screenwriting duties from Michael Arndt, an Oscar winner for ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and nominee for ""Toy Story 3,"" who had previously been working on the story. The movie is slated for release in 2015 but no firm date has been set. In its announcement about the screenwriter shuffle today, Lucasfilm said the current plan is still to begin shooting in Spring 2014. Abrams started out as a screenwriter with such films as ""Regarding Henry"" and ""Forever Young"" before becoming more genre and sci-fi focused with ""Alias,"" ""Lost,"" and movies such as ""Mission: Impossible 3,"" ""Super 8"" and the ""Star Trek"" reboot. 'Star Wars: Episode VII' will be filmed in the United Kingdom . Kasdan has a rich history in the ""Star Wars"" universe. While best known as a writer-director of dramas such as ""Body Heat,"" ""The Big Chill"" and ""The Accidental Tourist,"" Kasdan also co-wrote ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi."" He had been consulting on the development of the new trilogy, which picks up with the Rebellion after the death of Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. Kasdan was also working with screenwriter Simon Kinberg on the development of spin-off prequels being developed by Lucasfilms. Sources tell EW that one film will follow the adventures of young Han Solo, while the other focuses on Boba Fett and his rival bounty hunters. 'Star Wars' spin-offs: A young Han Solo movie, and a Boba Fett film . It's not clear what role Arndt will have moving forward. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy characterized the change-up as a positive in her statement. ""I am very excited about the story we have in place and thrilled to have Larry and J.J. working on the script,"" she said. ""There are very few people who fundamentally understand the way a 'Star Wars' story works like Larry, and it is nothing short of incredible to have him even more deeply involved in its return to the big screen. J.J. of course is an incredible storyteller in his own right. Michael Arndt has done a terrific job bringing us to this point and we have an amazing filmmaking and design team in place already prepping for production."" Massive productions like this typically go through multiple rewrites, so it would be premature for anyone to have a bad feeling about this just yet. While Abrams and Kasdan get the script in shape, pre-production for ""Episode VII"" remains underway. The plan is to shoot mostly at London's Pinewood Studios, but exterior locations are being scouted, nearly every actor in the business is trying to land a role with the casting department, and sets and costumes are being designed in preparation for those actors to inhabit when principal photography gets underway.

"(CNN) -- Can we simply enjoy movies without having to fact-check every little thing? Apparently not, because so many people feel compelled to show us how clever they are by attempting to point out factual errors depicted in film after film. News flash: Movies are supposed to be an entertaining experience. They are an escape from reality. If you want to learn history or facts, read a book. Or if you are too lazy to do that, then google it. We have seen this self-aggrandizing spectacle of people fact-checking movies with two recent films. The first is the current box office champion, ""Gravity,"" with the other being ""The Butler."" ""Gravity,"" which stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, follows a space mission that goes terribly awry. Despite its box office success, a chorus of critics have attacked numerous scientific flaws in the film -- such as pointing out the allegedly inaccurate way Bullock's hair floated in zero gravity. But that's nothing compared to the recent barrage of Twitter attacks launched at the film by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. His tweets ranged from criticizing the direction space debris was depicted as travelling to more nuanced issues such as faulting filmmakers for showing that the Hubble Space Telescope, the International Space Station and a Chinese space station were, ""all in sight lines of one another."" This is not the guy you want to sit next to in a movie theater during ""Star Wars."" I can just hear him whispering things such as: ""The Death Star is too big to fly at that rate of speed,"" or ""Yoda could never survive in that atmosphere."" Look, ""Gravity"" doesn't even pretend to be based on anything more than the screenwriter's imagination. And here's the biggest thing for people like deGrasse Tyson to keep in mind: it's science fiction, for God's sake! You would think the ""fiction"" part of ""science fiction"" is something that an astrophysicist could comprehend. And then there's ""The Butler,"" the Lee Daniels film about a man who served for decades as a butler for various presidents at the White house. This film was attacked by the left and the right for being historically inaccurate. Some have cited errors with the film's account of specific instances of the civil rights movement while others expressed outrage over the way President Ronald Reagan was depicted -- apparently some view Reagan as a deity. Here's a spoiler alert (and by ""spoiler alert,"" I mean a spoiler to people who have never googled or read anything about the film): It was fiction -- that means it was made up. There was no ""Cecil Gaines,"" the butler character played by Forest Whitaker in the film. The film does not even purport to be a bio pic. Sure, it was loosely inspired by the life of Eugene Allen, a man who served as a butler in the White House for 34 years for eight presidents, but the film was a fictionalized account. And we saw similar obsessive fact-checking last year with movies such as ""Argo"" and ""Lincoln."" I guess we should be thankful that Twitter wasn't around when ""Forrest Gump"" was released because people would have gone crazy with tweets over that one. Can we agree on something? A director who is making a documentary should be required to present an accurate recitation of facts and history. But for all other movies, filmmakers should be afforded creative license to make the movie that fulfills their vision of the story they want to tell, even ones based on real events. Filmmakers are not historians, nor should they be held to such a standard. Consequently, directors must be allowed to add scenes or dialogue that make the film more entertaining, such as the fictionalized depiction in ""Argo"" of American diplomats trying to board a plane to escape from Iran before they are discovered. So here's my advice to all you self-appointed movie fact-checkers who are just waiting to pounce on any mistake you detect in a film to show off how clever you are: Relax. Go to a movie, log off of Twitter, silence your phone, sit back, eat some overpriced cold popcorn that's part of the criminally expensive ""value combo"" and watch the film. You never know -- you might just find that you actually enjoy it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Some popular films have come under attack for being loose with the facts .

"(CNN) -- The company responsible for a runaway train that exploded in a small Canadian town Saturday said an engine shutdown may have released air brakes holding the train in place. At least five people are dead and around 40 are unaccounted for in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, after a 73-car train carrying crude oil derailed and crashed, local law enforcement officials said. Tankers exploded, sending thick plumes of smoke into the night sky, leveling dozens of homes and buildings and forcing nearly 2,000 people from their homes. The train had stopped for a crew change Friday night in a station about seven miles from Lac-Megantic, the Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway said in a statement. The train's engineer had ""tied down"" and checked into a motel. ""One fact that has emerged is the locomotive of the oil train parked at Nantes station was shut down subsequent to the departure of the engineer who had handled the train from Farnham, which may have resulted in the release of air brakes on the locomotive that was holding the train in place,"" the company said in a statement, noting that it still didn't have ""complete information."" The explosion devastated the small lakeside town, where firefighters were still working Sunday to contain hot spots so law enforcement could expand its investigation. Investigators with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada found the locomotive event recorder and planned to analyze it for information on throttle position and speed, among other data. The burned bodies of the dead have been sent to Montreal for identification, but ""we know that there will be many more"" deaths, police spokesman Lt. Michel Brunet said Sunday. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper likened the town to a ""war zone"" after touring it Sunday. ""There is not a family in this area that is not touched by this,"" he said in a press conference outside Polyvalente Montignac High School, the main staging area for recovery efforts. ""A beautiful downtown here has been destroyed,"" he said. ""There's going to be a need for substantial reconstruction."" Harper would not comment on specifics of the disaster except that he expected information ""about why this occurred"" to lead to a police investigation. ""I've heard things that concern me greatly,"" he said. ""There will be investigations that will point to guilty or responsible people."" Witnesses told the CBC they heard five or six explosions. One person saw the first train tanker tip over and yelled ""run, run!"" as he dashed toward the lake for which the town is named. He told CBC the flames chased him to the edge of the water. ""The fire was moving so quickly,"" he said. ""We saw balls of fire shooting out onto the water."" One woman told CNN affiliate CTV she was working at a bar nearby and got off work an hour before the accident. ""I have no news from my friends; I haven't heard from any of them,"" she told tearfully told CTV. ""I can't say more than that. We're waiting for confirmation."" Amid the chaos, friends and families are scrambling to find their loved ones. More than 17,000 people have joined a Facebook page to help people connect with their loved ones in the town. Locals and outsiders have posted desperate notes to try to figure out where their friends and family were on the night of the crash. Some posts bring relief -- ""Mom it is alisun and oceannie and rosaly we are all alive I love you,"" one reads in French. Others look less promising. Multiple posts ask about Guy Bolduc, a singer who was performing at Musi-Cafe in town. ""All of his fans, all over Quebec, but also his fellow singers (of whom I am one) hope to see him again alive!!! Come on my GuyBol, come out of your hiding place,"" one member wrote. The group administrators ask that members not post about deaths until they're confirmed. Residents told the CBC they have never seen anything like it. ""It's dreadful,"" Claude Bedard said. ""It's terrible. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is gone."" Authorities evacuated more than a third of the town of 6,000 people, most from the center of the town and a home for the elderly. As authorities worked to get more details, residents of the scenic town grappled with the loss. ""It's like the town has been cut by a knife,"" Sgt. Gregory Gomez del Prado told the CBC. Resident Amanda Gabrielle said the train crashed on her birthday. She lost her dog, she's now homeless, and she doesn't have any family or friends. ""I lost everything,"" Gabrielle told the CBC. ""I don't know what's going to happen to me."" For information on missing people, call 1-800-659-4264.

"(CNN)  -- Bode Miller fulfilled his Olympic dream at last with a gold medal in the men's super-combined at Whistler Creekside on Sunday. The flamboyant U.S star has been in superb form at the Vancouver Winter Games and his victory completes a full set of medals, after he claimed silver in the super-G and bronze in the downhill. Miller, seventh after the downhill section, relegated pre-race favorite Ivica Kostelic of Croatia to the silver medal position after producing a superb slalom run. Silvan Zurbriggen of Switzerland claimed the bronze medal ahead of teammate Carlo Janka, with reigning Olympic champion Ted Ligety of the United States back in fifth. Super-G gold medalist Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal, quickest on the downhill, slid out near the finish to spark scenes of wild celebration as Miller realized the gold was his after drawing blank in the 2006 Winter Games in Turin. SI.com: Gold medal proves Bode has finally come full circle . Miller, who snubbed the official U.S. ski team in 2007 and appeared on the brink of retirement, returned to the fold last year and prepared carefully for the Games. He added to his two silvers from Salt Lake City in his first two events and finally made his breakthrough with another virtuoso display. ""When I passed the line I did my normal thing and stood for a second and I was like, 'that was unbelievable, I can't ask for anything more',"" Miller told reporters. ""For my first Olympic gold, it was absolutely perfect."" Miller's combined time of 2:44.92 left him 0.33 seconds faster than Kostelic, who won silver in the discipline in Turin behind Ligety, who left himself with too much to do after a lackluster downhill display. SKI CROSS . The first ever gold in the new Winter Olympic sport of ski cross went to Switzerland's Michael Schmid with Austria's Andreas Matt taking the silver and Audun Groenvold in the bronze medal position. Canada's Christopher Del Bosco was the fourth member of the final but saw his medal hopes disappear when he crashed near the end of the final at Cypress Mountain. BIATHLON . Russia's Evgeny Ustyugov took the first gold of the tenth day with a comfortable victory in the men's 15km mass start biathlon. His flawless shooting display saw him cross the line ahead of France's Martin Fourcade and Slovakian Pavol Hurajt. Norway's Ole Einar Bjoerndalen failed in his bid for a sixth Olympic gold as poor shooting saw him finish 27th. The women's 12.5km mass start event led to a second gold of the Games for Germany's Magdalena Neuner, who also took a silver in the sprint. SPEEDSKATING . Ireen Wust of the Netherlands claimed the women's 1500m crown at the Richmond Oval as she got the better of home hope Christine Nesbitt in the final heat. Nesbitt blew up on the final lap and failed in her bid for a second gold at the Games, finishing sixth but fellow Canadian Kristina Groves did take silver ahead of Czech Martina Sablikova.","Bode Miller claims his first Olympic gold medal by winning super-combined in Vancouver .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Navy crew rescued more than 100 men from a raft in rough water in the central Mediterranean on Wednesday, the service said. The news release said 128 men ranged in age from 20 to 30 and were taken aboard the USS San Antonio, an amphibious transport dock ship. A patrol aircraft from Malta spotted the raft being rocked by winds and waves. The San Antonio, which was 60 nautical miles away, answered a call from the Maltese government. The Navy crew used two 11-person boats to rescue the men from the raft, which was about 75 nautical miles southwest of Malta, according to Maltese officials. The Navy didn't say whether anyone was injured. The Maltese military said the men were migrants from Somalia. A Maltese military statement said the men would be taken to Maltese Grand Harbour and turned over to the Maltese coast guard.

"(CNN) -- I blame Kris Kardashian. Think about it. Doesn't the most recent episode of ""Keeping Up with the Debt Limit"" feel more as though it were an E! production than one by C-SPAN? Hasn't it been as predictable, brief and of itself, as inconsequential as a Kardashian marriage, as odious as Kanye and as certain to lead to unhappiness as Lamar's reputed drug problem? Doesn't the pinheaded disconnect from reality seem familiar? The problem is that it is easier to deal with the Kardashians than their counterparts in the Capitol. We can just change the channel. The reality is, we all depend on the U.S. government in enough ways that letting it turn into a repetitive, meaningless form of basic cable melodrama would be a formula for national catastrophe. We should therefore try to draw lessons from this round of Beltway follies: what we must fix if our country is not to go the way of Kris and Bruce's marriage. Here are five critical problems we must address. 1. The political system is broken . Gerrymandering has caused House districts to be essentially ""owned"" by one party or the other. That makes general elections irrelevant. So it is primary voters who determine who runs, and they tend to be the more energized, activist voters of the left and right wings. The result? Extremes are rewarded and virtually ensured of re-election. Add to that campaign finance rules that give disproportionate power to big money, and incumbents and Senate rules that give the minority and individual senators too much power, and you have system in which gridlock is virtually institutionalized. We need campaign finance reform, an end to gerrymandering and rules reform in both houses of Congress, and we need to make these initiatives a top political priority of America's centrist majority. 2. Our national conversation has gotten off-track . Promote extremist politicians and reward them for their extremism, and you get tension, incivility and a reluctance to embrace the compromise that is essential to democracy. Bring in the language of religion and culture wars, and the debate becomes about what divides us rather than what we need to bring us together, about our problems and not about their practical solutions. Wedge issues then play a greater role in campaigns than new ideas. Opponents become enemies rather than neighbors with alternative views. We need to defuse the language, edit the loaded terminology, reinvest in the separation of church and state and call out dangerously divisive ideas, racism, sexism and sheer stupidity, like denying science, history or basic arithmetic. 3. Governance has become a lost art . The least-valued skill set in Washington is the ability to actually get things done. We mistakenly believe that articulating a problem is the same thing as solving it. We reward those who give good speeches and not those who have a proven track record of fixing things. Politicians are too often elected because they advance an ideology, and when they serve, they inevitably focus on what they need to do to be re-elected. But their jobs were created to serve the public, to govern and to lead, even if that means making their positions of power more precarious. We need to start voting for people who have proved their skill at bridging partisan divides and focusing on the needs of the electorate. 4. We are ignoring the really big problems . We are trapped in a cycle of punting problems ahead a few months and chipping away at the margins of issues. When this shutdown/debt-limit crisis is finally resolved, we will have a few months until it recurs. If a deal is struck before another crisis happens, it will be incremental. Yet America has much bigger issues: a too-slow recovery from a great economic setback, an inability to create good jobs at the rate of past recoveries and, perhaps above all, a failure to address the growing inequality that is dividing our society. It is not just an economic quirk that 90% of the benefits of the current recovery are accruing to the top 10% of our society; it is a formula for social breakdown and national decline. It is also profoundly unjust. We need to start demanding that leaders address these bigger issues. 5. The American people have failed their government ... and each other . You can't blame the politicians. You elected them. You turned away from the system. You didn't run for office. You didn't write your views down and pass them along to people in power. You didn't fund campaigns that supported people committed to big solutions. You have become ill-informed, caught up in the name-calling and the partisanship and the climate that created the Washington we have today. You've got the government you deserve. Remember, according to the Constitution, the top job in the U.S. government goes to the voter. If these clowns in Washington can't get it right and you don't fire them, you deserve what you get. This is not reality television, even though it feels as pointless. This is just reality. And reality, in this democracy, is what the voters make of it. You can't blame Obama or Boehner. Scarily enough, the TV screen, whether it shows the Kardashians or C-SPAN or cable news, is just a mirror, a reflection of what America wants and is. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: ""Keeping up with the debt limit"" seems like a seamy reality show .
He says our political system is broken, national conversation is off-track .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A court in eastern China on Friday upheld the guilty verdict and life sentence against former high-flying politician Bo Xilai, effectively ending one of the messiest political scandals to hit the ruling Chinese Communist Party in decades. Shandong Province High People's Court in Jinan affirmed the decision handed down by a lower court in the same city last month when Bo was found guilty of all three charges brought against him. He received the life sentence for bribe-taking, 15 years for embezzlement and seven years for abuse of power following a trial that revealed tantalizing details of the lavish lifestyles of China's elite. The high court rejected Bo's appeal as it lacked any ""factual or legal basis,"" court vice president Hou Jianjun told reporters in a press briefing, adding the court's decision is final. China state broadcaster, CCTV, released footage from the court session, which showed Bo standing handcuffed between two court policemen in what was likely his last public appearance. He appeared to be smiling while listening to the judge read the court's decision and several of Bo's family members were seen seated in the audience. A family source told CNN the court session lasted for around 45 minutes with Bo repeatedly interrupted the judge to rebut the court's findings, angering the judge. Bo met with his lawyer frequently after he filed the appeal and prepared diligently for the process, but his request to meet his wife was denied, the source added. Bo filed his appeal the day after his conviction in September. Legal experts said Bo would begin to serve his sentence immediately, although he could still file a motion with the high court or the nation's Supreme People's Court to review his case based on new information or evidence. Chances of a judge accepting such a motion and overturning the verdict are slim. 'Hotel-line' prison awaits . Court documents said Bo would be incarcerated in Qincheng Prison, a maximum-security prison in Beijing where former senior officials usually serve their sentences. It's often described as having ""hotel-like"" conditions. During his trial in August, Bo mounted a lively defense, denying the charges against him, according to transcripts published by the court. Bo's glittering career drew both admirers and detractors for his populist policies. It began to unravel last year amid a murder scandal in which his wife, Gu Kailai, was convicted of poisoning British businessman, Neil Heywood. The son of a revolutionary veteran, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policy-making body of the Communist Party. He had been tipped to ascend farther up the party hierarchy before he was sacked as party chief in the sprawling metropolis of Chongqing. Bo's wife, Gu, was found guilty by a court last year of murdering Heywood and given a suspended death sentence. Her video testimony formed a major part of the prosecution's case against her husband. China's leaders are keen to put the case behind them ahead of an important Party meeting in November -- the third plenum of the Party's Central Committee -- when President Xi Jinping is expected to push for economic reforms. ""The idea is to allow a period to calm down public backlash over this issue before the party meeting,"" said a Beijing-based observer, who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to comment publicly. ""They want nothing to distract from the important meeting."" However, not everyone thinks Bo's political career has been laid to rest. Wang Juntao, a political exile and former class mate of Bo, says the case has only raised his profile: . ""The Communist Party may have ended his career in the party, but it has given him a distinct political identity and charisma as a leftist. In a way, this has made him a hero.""

"London (CNN) -- For six years, Eve King worked as a commercial lawyer for a leading London City law firm, complete with its long hours and fat pay check. But after she had her first child eight years ago she felt she had no choice but to swap the lifestyle for that of a stay-at-home mom. ""I gave it up because I knew I couldn't be a city lawyer and spend time with my kids,"" she said. ""After that I discounted myself because I knew that if I had been out of law for a few years, who was going to be interested in me?"" Today, King is helping to run a company that allows highly qualified former City lawyers to work flexibly from home to fit in with family commitments. Run by an all-woman core team, Obelisk Legal Support, has around 100 lawyers and 250 legal translators on its books. The company was founded in 2010 by Dana Denis-Smith and Charlotte Devlin in an attempt to harness the talents that are lost to the legal profession when women leave after having children. The exodus from the profession is stark. According to the Law Society, there were 25,786 women solicitors in the UK aged 26-35 last year, but only 17,524 aged 36-45, and 9,622 aged 46-55. Denis-Smith said: ""At the starting point in their careers, 70% of lawyers are women, but at partner level just 12% are women. ""I had seen all these talented people dropping out of the profession around me and had the idea to go back and find out what all these women were doing. ""These women feel they have been forgotten and their skills don't matter anymore."" She added: ""We have built a business around a skillset that has not been tapped into. We have fantastic lawyers of City caliber who can deliver results. ""We are using people that have disappeared from the market. I'm keen to challenge the idea that professional women with children should be given work out of sympathy rather than be seen as a fantastic business proposition."" Also on Leading Women: Why women will impact global economy as much as China . Obelisk works as a legal outsourcing company, taking on support work for law firms and in-house legal departments. It then distributes the work to the lawyers on its books, who choose how many hours they want to work. Mateja Simic, the company's marketing director, said: ""This is not a compromise on the part of the lawyer or the client. The client is getting 'top brain' for their money and the lawyers are totally committed."" The idea has been popular with some top names in the legal profession, who are keen to see the gender imbalance redressed. Helen Mahy, one of only a handful of women General Counsels in the UK, has agreed to become chairwoman of Obelisk's advisory board when she retires from her job as group company secretary at National Grid next year. She said: ""There's a hole in the market for somebody like Obelisk to tap a pool of talent that is otherwise being wasted. Nobody else is doing that."" Mahy said everyone in her own team of 100 lawyers at National Grid was offered flexible working, but that was rare in private law firms. ""Most of their staff are willing to flog themselves to death, so (the firms don't worry) if they lose a few good people,"" she said. ""If law firms used a bit of creativity in helping women get back after a career break, it would be a huge benefit to everybody."" Also on Leading Women: $800 million biotech business started in a garage . Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, president of the UK Law Society, said: ""The situation will only change if the legal sector takes resolute action by investing in specific career development support for women, improving support around maternity transition and addressing the lack of flexible working practices which continues to hinder women's career development."" While the vast majority of lawyers on Obelisk's books are women, the firm also welcomes men who want flexible working. The lawyers were on average earning $160,000 (Â£100,000) before their career breaks, and are now paid an equivalent hourly rate. ""What do we want to say to our daughters?"" said Charlotte Devlin, co-founder of Obelisk. ""That law is a great profession until you have children?""","In the UK, the legal profession loses a huge number of women after career breaks .

"(CNN) -- After many years of euphoria over China's rapid growth and the country's apparently inevitable rise to global economic dominance, the China story has taken a serious turn for the worse. China, it now seems, is about to collapse, and along the way it may well bring the world economy down with it. Fortunately, the new story may be as muddled as the old one. China's economic model has relied heavily on investment and debt. It shouldn't be a surprise that after many years of tremendous growth driven at first by badly needed investments, Chinese spending on infrastructure and manufacturing capacity is slowing down. During the same period, debt levels surged as borrowed money poured into more highways, airports, steel mills, shipyards, high-speed railways, and apartment and office buildings than the country could productively use. A few economists predicted as far back as 2006 that China would face a serious debt problem. By 2010, it became obvious even to the most excited of China bulls that this was indeed happening. To protect itself from the risk of a debt crisis, China must bring spending to a halt. Beijing now wants to rebalance the economy away from its excessive reliance on investment and debt, and to increase the role of consumption as a driver of growth. But this cannot happen except at lower growth rates. So what happens next -- will China collapse? Probably not. A financial collapse is effectively a kind of bank run, and as long as government credibility remains high, banks are guaranteed and capital controls are maintained, it is unlikely that China will experience anything like a bank run. What is far more likely is that in the coming years, China's gross domestic product growth rate will continue to decline as the country focuses on stimulating consumption. Growth rates during the administration of President Xi Jinping are unlikely to exceed 3% to 4% on average if the economic rebalancing is managed well. Will the slower growth rate be a disaster for China? Certainly, it would be huge departure from the growth rate of roughly 10% a year for nearly three decades. Would much lower growth rates create high unemployment and huge dislocations for the economy? Some are worried about such scenarios. But the Chinese economy has so far shown a lot of resilience despite passing storms such as the global financial crisis. Beijing has huge challenges ahead. China's growth has been a boon to large businesses, the state, the powerful and the wealthy elite. What the Chinese government needs to do is recalibrate growth so that average household incomes can rise and consumers have more money to spend. This will not be easy to pull off, but there are positive signs. Xi's government seems determined to make the necessary changes, even at the expense of much slower growth. Even if GDP growth declines but average Chinese household income grows at 5% to 6% a year, it would put China in the right direction. As for the rest of the world, there's no reason to panic over China's economic slowdown. Contrary to popular beliefs, China is not the global engine of growth; it is merely the largest arithmetic component of global growth. What drives global growth is demand. China, with a large trade surplus, is not a net provider of demand to the world. What matters to the world, in other words, is not how fast China grows but rather, how its trade with foreign partners evolves. If China rebalances in an orderly way, its imports of manufactured goods and services should rise faster than its exports. This will be good for the world. What's more, manufacturing industries around the world that lost out to China in the export business will benefit. When wages rise for Chinese workers -- so that they have more money to buy goods and services at home -- it means other developing countries will have a chance to compete for exports if they offer lower labor wages. There is no doubt that Beijing has a long road ahead in terms of managing a huge economy, but as of now there should be nothing surprising or unexpected about the slowing growth of China. It will probably benefit the Chinese people and the global economy.

"Miami (CNN) -- An American Airlines plane was searched and cleared at Miami's airport Monday after a ""suspicious item"" was identified in its cargo hold, the Transportation Security Administration said in a statement. American Airlines Flight 930 from Sao Paulo, Brazil, landed in Miami at 8:46 a.m., the agency said. ""In the process of unloading cargo, a suspicious item was identified,"" it said. ""Out of an abundance of caution, local law enforcement and EOD (explosive ordnance disposal, or a bomb squad) arrived on scene to inspect. The item was cleared and declared safe at 10:37 a.m.,"" according to the statement. The agency did not disclose details about the item. Earlier, American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith said that no explosive material or devices were found on board the plane. He said that empty fuse holders were found and described them as like a fuse but not an explosive device. The flight had 169 passengers and 11 crew members on board, Smith said.

"(CNN) -- The in-laws of late Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev appeared Thursday before a federal grand jury in Boston, a family attorney said. Joshua Dratel -- the lawyer representing Katherine Russell, who was married to Tsarnaev before he died following a police shootout days after the deadly April bombing -- said that the widow's parents answered questions for four hours Thursday from the grand jury. But, citing grand jury secrecy rules, Dratel declined to elaborate further about what the Russells testified about. Christina Sterling, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for Massachusetts, said only that she ""cannot confirm or deny the existence of a grand jury."" Four people have been charged in connection with the Boston attack, including Russell's brother-in-law, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is suspected of carrying out the attack along with his brother, Tamerlan, 26. Neither Katherine Russell nor her parents have been charged, and investigators haven't said what they believe she knew about the twin April 15 blasts that killed three people and injured more than 260 others. What did suspected bomber's widow know? A lawyer representing Russell, Amato DeLuca, said eight days after the bombing that Tamerlan Tsarnaev's widow was ""doing everything she can to assist with the investigation."" DeLuca said that Russell, then 24, knew nothing about any plan to plant explosives near the Boston Marathon's finish line and that reports her husband was involved came as an ""absolute shock"" to her and her family. A 2007 graduate of North Kingstown High School in Rhode Island, she moved that year to Boston -- where she met Tamerlan Tsarnaev at a nightclub -- and enrolled at Suffolk University. Russell dropped out of college her freshman year. Eventually, she converted to Islam before the couple married in a Massachusetts mosque in June 2010. Together, she and her husband had a daughter, who was 3 at the time of the Boston bombing. Tamerlan Tsarnaev reportedly stayed home to care for the girl while Russell worked long hours as a home health aide. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","The in-laws of the late Tamerlan Tsarnaev appear before a federal grand jury in Boston .

"(CNN) -- Watching 3-D movies generally means suffering through two things: crappy plotlines that favor spectacle over substance and the need to wear some annoying, dorky glasses. Scientists may have solved one of these frustrations. (You might be able to guess which.) Researchers in South Korea have created a new method that would allow moviegoers to simply sit down and start watching a 3-D movie with no extra gear necessary. The research was published Monday in Optics Express. ""This is essentially the next step that was required for 3-D display technology without glasses,"" said physicist John Koshel, who studies optical science at the University of Arizona and was not associated with the new work. We see the world in three dimensions because our eyes are spaced slightly apart, each looking out at a different angle. Your brain combines the information from both eyes, determining where each object in your field of view is to generate depth perception. To achieve 3-D movies or television, the trick is to send a slightly different, offset picture to each eye. Special glasses handle this task for most modern 3-D blockbuster movies, with each lens only letting in one polarization of light. Polarization describes the direction in which the electromagnetic waves in light oscillate, either up-down, left-right, or something in between. When you sit down to watch something like ""Avatar,"" two projectors are displaying two images on the same screen, with the light from one polarized left-right and the other up-down. This is why the screen looks kind of blurry when you take the glasses off -- there are two movies playing on it at the same time. The 3-D glasses correct the situation by separating these images, allowing the left-projector movie to go to your left eye and the right-projector movie into your right. But needing two projectors perfectly synced in a theater is awkward and expensive. There are some glasses-free methods around, where a special filter covering the screen sends some of the light to your right eye and some to your left, creating a 3-D image. This is the technology in Nintendo's 3DS gaming system and several smart phone displays, such as the HTC Evo 3D. In a movie theater, this glasses-free 3-D technique would require the projector to sit behind the screen, but most theaters are not designed for this. The new method would allow movie theaters to keep their projectors where they've always been, behind the audience, and uses fairly simple optical technology. A special array sits in front of the projector and polarizes its light. A filter covering the screen then obscures different vertical regions of the screen, like the slats of venetian blinds. Each of your eyes, sitting at a slightly different angle, has some of the screen blocked and some of the screen visible. The movie has the right-eye and left-eye images interleaved in vertical columns with one another. The trick then is to have the light visible to your left eye contain the left-eye pixels and vice versa for the right eye. The new method is less cumbersome than both the current two-projector and the behind-the-screen-projector methods. But because it blocks some of the light to your different eyes, the current image resolution is fairly low. Koshel expects that 3-D movie companies will be interested in upgrading the method's abilities and resolution to bring glasses-free 3-D to the masses. ""This technology is still in its infancy, but it's a new step that was hidden for a long time,"" Koshel said. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- The Clash was falling apart. More specifically, says guitarist Mick Jones, the band's original master tapes were falling apart. ""A bit like nitrate film,"" he says in a phone interview from Britain. Except, instead of burning up, the oxide layers to such records as ""London Calling,"" ""Sandinista"" and ""Combat Rock"" were disintegrating. To save them and make proper digital masters, the tapes had to be baked in an industrial oven and transferred to other media. ""It has been a bit of a restoration,"" says Jones. ""I don't think it was a moment too soon, because the tapes were rotting -- mold in the boxes and stuff."" But the ultimate result was worth it: spanking-new releases of the band's catalog in a new boxed set called ""Sound System."" The collection, which is shaped like a boombox, contains newly remastered versions of the group's five official albums, as well as three CDs of demos and singles, a DVD of video footage, a new edition of the ""Armagideon Times"" fanzine, and even some buttons for that classic 1979 look (denim jacket not included). The box will be released Tuesday along with a 2-CD best-of called ""Hits Back."" The band, of course, broke up long ago -- 1985, two years after Jones was fired. Though relations were soon repaired, there was never a reunion. Singer and lyricist Joe Strummer died in 2002. A year later the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Their legacy is indisputable -- and not just in the punk movement. Indeed, calling the Clash a ""punk band"" is like calling the Beatles a ""Merseybeat combo."" Their music included dollops of rockabilly, reggae, country, rap, soul and jazz, a true mix of styles that made for some of the most exciting records and live shows of the rock 'n' roll era. The boombox, says bassist Paul Simonon, symbolizes the way the four would share music and ideas. ""When we would go out on tour, each member of the band had one of these boomboxes, so in a hotel room or backstage or on some street corner we could play music,"" he recalls. ""Everybody was playing something."" Jones and Simonon talked about the Clash's career in separate interviews with CNN. The following has been edited and condensed. On their influences: . Mick Jones: The Big Five groups over here -- the Beatles, the Stones, the Kinks, the Who and the Small Faces. I was lucky enough to grow up at the time when they were doing their most fantastic music. When you do music yourself, it's interesting -- it's like a two-way highway. You go back and find out what influenced the people you liked, so you're going backwards, at the same time you're in the present trying to do something. It led us back to so many American artists -- blues, soul and rock and roll. Paul Simonon: Reggae and rockabilly. And mostly reggae, because that's what I grew up on, and that's the only music that seemed to me at that time that had something to say for itself. Whereas Led Zeppelin, progressive rock, it didn't speak to me. I couldn't relate to it. On being labeled as a punk band: . Simonon: I don't care about it. People are going to say what they want to say anyway. Some people are going to say, 'They're rubbish.' I don't really care, because I know in my mind what we were. We initially started out as a punk band, but we evolved. We evolved into quite a magnificent rock and roll band, I daresay. Jones: We can't really deny that's where we come from, but we always hoped to be more. A lot of our contemporaries, if they did make more than one record, they made the same record. And of the people I liked, I was really looking forward to their new record coming out, because I knew they were doing something different. I knew they weren't going to do the same thing every time. That was like a given with us. That was only natural -- I always knew we were never going to make the same record twice. On their fashion choices: . Simonon: That was my department, really. If you go see a band and they look amazing, you get really inspired. But if the band looks not very well-dressed, it's hard to get inspired by the music. As our manager said, if somebody goes to see a band, and the audience is better dressed than the band, then why should the audience listen to what the band have to say? There's a like-minded thought process going on at this time anyway. We don't want flares, we want straight-leg trousers. The whole world's got flares. And everybody's got long hair -- (so) we want short hair. It was very tribal, too. You had the mods, you had the rockers, you had skinheads, you had hippies, people were very defined by how they looked, and it reflected the music they liked, too. On ""the only band that matters"": . Jones: The record company came up with that; it wasn't us. We weren't like trying to blow our own trumpets. It was kind of a moniker and it stuck. Every group wants to be the best group when you're young. On becoming stars: . Jones: I remember once, I was talking to Pete Townshend (at a stadium show). I said I know what ""quadrophenia"" means now, because if you look in one direction, you're ignoring 50,000 people! He just looked at me like I was mad. It was a big thing, but we had something we wanted to say, so it was interesting to see how we'd get on in that environment. Simonon: In the early days when we first started out in a hotel room, it wasn't a great hotel room, but the hotel was better than where I lived. Then as the journey continues you get more successful, suddenly the hotel rooms have one big bed in it rather than two narrow beds that you have to share. So it's a gradual thing. When you do get to the point where you're in the lap of luxury, it's easy to lose contact with yourself and where you're from. In some ways it's not a bad thing that the Clash split up when they did, because we would have become ""the only band that mattered"" and very pompous. So maybe in some ways cutting your own throat was a good idea at the time. Who knows what sort of people we would be now? On writing songs with Joe Strummer: . Jones: It started off as, ""We need another song."" ""OK, give us five minutes,"" and we'd go upstairs to rehearsals and bang something out. At the other end of the scale would be, I don't want to see him, just post the lyrics through the post box. (Sometimes) he would sit at the typewriter and bang it out like a guy who worked at the newspaper, and he'd pull it out of the typewriter and hand it across the table. It was always pretty quick. It usually comes naturally, especially with Joe's lyrics. Even the tune was there sometimes. It was the words, really, and the music was kind of a vehicle for those words. On feeling Strummer's presence while preparing ""Sound System:"" Jones: Yeah, it's impossible not to. (Because) it was his words that carried the whole thing, or was the most important thing to it, I like to think he was with us. He's definitely with us through his music, and somehow with us in spirit, as well. (sounds a little choked up) I feel that, anyway. Simonon: No. The reason I say that, is because it's like each person in the band was an individual. There was no leader. We spent seven intense years working together, so you get a pretty good idea of how each other is. Getting along: . Jones: We became friends very soon after, that was the main thing. I've had a great time these last couple years while we've been putting this box together. It's been wonderful to spend time with the guys, and have complete creative control over all our work. Simonon: I see Mick and we do things. We went to a play once (in which) they wanted to use the song ""Know Your Rights."" They invited us to the play. What they didn't realize was that back when the record was being recorded me and Mick had like a two-hour argument in the studio about the bass sound. I said it needed to be not louder, but a bit deeper. So we went to see this play. And I heard the song being played back, and it sounded really tinny. And I turned to Mick and said, ""I told you I was right!"" There's no antagonism anymore. We're sort of grown up now. We know that we were really fortunate to be working together at the time that we did.","New Clash boxed set collects albums, video, ephemera .

"(CNN) -- Matthew Cordle hasn't yet been found liable of killing a man while drinking and driving, but there's not much question about whether he's guilty. It's not because of the the homicide charges that were filed against him on Monday. But it's because Cordle went on YouTube last week and told the world he'd done just that. Cordle's confession, a highly produced, three-and-a-half minute video that has been viewed by more than 1.2 million people, is the sort of pronouncement that would have been impossible before the world had social media platforms at its fingertips. And it's raising questions that go far beyond the 22-year-old Ohio man's guilt or innocence. Chief among them: Was Cordle, who says he plans to plead guilty and accept whatever punishment is handed down, just trying to get a lighter sentence by using the Web to get out in front of a criminal case in which he hadn't even yet been charged? On Flip the Media, a blog by students, faculty and alumni of the University of Washington's master's program in digital media, graduate Brook Ellingwood argues that parts of the video seem orchestrated to do just that. ""That he sees the video as a tactical move in a legal chess game is evident,"" Ellingwood writes, noting the way Cordle cites depression as a reason for his drinking. And if it buys Cordle some sympathy from the court? Well, it's not farfetched to imagine others trying a similar tactic, he writes. ""We may well be in for a flurry of copycat videos as miscreants of all sorts try to duplicate what works in this one,"" wrote Ellingwood. ""One can imagine the appearance of less and less competent videos, resulting eventually in a criminal confession so ineptly scripted and produced that it becomes an ironically viral phenomenon in the manner of Rebecca Black's 'Friday'."" Cordle's attorney, George S. Breitmayer II, dismisses such speculation. ""Despite any speculation of his intentions, the video was meant to raise awareness related to the serious issues surrounding drinking and driving,"" he said in a statement sent to CNN. But what does it mean for criminal justice -- a system that is designed to move deliberately -- that a new generation of young people can potentially influence the system by sharing something instantly with the entire world? Alex Sheen is the founder of ""Because I Said I Would,"" the website where Cordle's video began spreading. He's also the person who produced it, enhancing the raw footage with a swelling orchestral soundtrack and visual effects that make it look like a public service announcement. He told CNN that Cordle was familiar with his site, on which people make public pledges to help them follow through with good deeds, and reached out to him with his story. Sheen said he didn't consider contacting police because he knew Cordle was already a suspect and that prosecutors were preparing charges. A grand jury in Franklin County, Ohio, indicted Cordle on Monday on charges of aggravated vehicular homicide and operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. He is charged in the death of Vince Canzani, 61, who was killed June 22 when a wrong-way driver hit his Jeep on Interstate 670 near Columbus, Ohio. ""The whole goal of this video is to convince people to not drink and drive -- to come to that realization that a lot of people make the same excuses that Matt makes in his life about drinking and driving,"" Sheen said. ""To make that message compelling, we made this video."" Sheen calls Cordle's confession and plea for others to avoid drunken driving, ""honorable."" But he's pushed back against those on his site who have heaped praise upon the young man. ""While Matt certainly made an honorable decision to confess, Because I Said I Would does not believe that Matt should be praised as a 'hero,' "" Sheen wrote on the site. ""Matt made an irresponsible choice to drink and drive that ended an innocent man's life. ""Matt decided to release this video because he wants to raise awareness about the dangerous and irreversible consequences of drinking and driving. If that message is not heard ... if viewers do not make the commitment to never drink and drive, then the video has certainly failed in its mission."" He's got at least one perhaps unlikely believer. ""He ruined two lives,"" said Cheryl Oates, the victim's ex-wife. ""He took Vince's life, and he ruined his life."" ""It's gut-wrenching, coming from a mother, looking at that young boy,"" she said, saying she admired him for confessing so publicly. ""You've got to respect him for that. I'm sorry. You do."" It's impossible to know the full measure of Cordle's motives. Was it self-interest? Sincere remorse? Perhaps some of both? Ellingwood, now interactive director for a Seattle TV station, can envision it as part of a new, look-at-me world in which Internet celebrity is celebrated, regardless of the reason for it. ""Today, the only thing standing between any one of us and instant celebrity is our ability to create a message with resonance,"" he wrote. ""Cordle may view the death he caused as a personal opportunity, the mother of all Facebook timeline life events. He may lose a few years to prison, but he won the Internet and when he gets out, he'll have a chance to parlay this 15 minute shot of fame into a repeat. Only time will tell if his redemption story gets him onto 'Dancing With the Stars.' ""","Video confession raises questions about social sharing .

"(CNN) -- An ambitious employee of ""The Circle,"" an all-seeing, all-knowing tech company at the heart of the new novel by Dave Eggers, raises her hand to pitch an idea to her bosses: Use the firm's social network to register virtually everyone in America to vote. Then she takes it further. ""Our interfaces are infinitely easier to use than, say the patchwork of DMV sites around the country,"" she says. ""What if you could renew your license through us? What if every government service could be facilitated through our network? People would leap at the chance. Instead of visiting a hundred different sites for a hundred different government services, it could all be done through the Circle."" The idea of substituting a frictionless private network for clunky government sites might seem an appealing one, given the much-publicized woes of Obamacare's HealthCare.gov. It's just one of the ways Eggers is fortunate in the timing of his book, which seems ripped from recent headlines about privacy, technology and social media. ""The Circle"" will send many readers hunting for the paperback copies of ""1984"" they haven't opened since high school. But does its portrait of a digital totalitarian future inspire the same kind of foreboding that George Orwell's dystopian novel did at a time when many people believed dictatorships were destined to control the world? Are Google, Facebook and Twitter taking us to, as a Joe Nocera column in The New York Times suggested, ""a world without privacy""? Eggers builds his story around Mae Holland, a naive employee of her hometown's public utility, who escapes the boredom of her life in a cubicle by landing a job at The Circle, the most desirable tech company around. Through a friend, rising Circle star Annie, Mae is installed in a ""customer experience"" post where she is dazzled by the company's feature-rich 400-acre campus, full of benefits for workers ranging from tennis courts to gyms to theaters to a cafeteria where famous singer-songwriters show up to entertain. Powerful politicians are always visiting the campus. Company parties offer primo food and drink. Employees are encouraged to help themselves to the merchandise at a company store stocked with cutting-edge products that haven't yet been publicly released. Mae's father, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, and who, with her mother, is locked in constant battle with his health insurer for the care he needs, is soon put on The Circle's generous health plan, at Annie's behest. Yet Mae's work, a grueling round of interaction with The Circle's customers, is at odds with the paradise of benefits the company touts. Everything she does is instantly measured and rated and she's encouraged to keep going back to the customers to persuade them to give her higher scores. She goes to absurd lengths to win favorable ratings. And those parties aren't only a reward for her hard work; attendance is mandatory for those who want to be seen as embracing The Circle's values and suitable for promotion. Officials blithely talk about the importance of ""work-life balance"" when what they really mean is that people should be using their ""off hours"" to be furthering The Circle's agenda through social media. Eventually, Mae will graduate from ""customer experience"" and gain fame as she wears a camera that makes her life almost totally transparent. She only has to look at her wrist device to see the ""zings,"" Twitter-like bursts of comments her millions of followers send as they react to every conversation she has and every letter she reads. Mae's ties to Annie, her parents and an old boyfriend and to her passion for kayaking are steadily weakened as she falls afoul of The Circle's imperatives to share and to reveal all. Rather than rebel and quit her job at the prestigious company, though, she becomes the fiercest adherent of its values. At The Circle, employees are encouraged to think big, to hatch ideas for new services relying on the power of big data, measurement and intrusiveness. And those ideas are breathtaking in their ambition -- and scary in that they don't seem as far from realization as they should in Eggers' fantasy world. A book that begins as a lighthearted cautionary tale grows into a claustrophobic portrait of relentless effort to achieve the culmination of ""closing the Circle,"" erasing privacy and anonymity to the point where anyone anywhere can be located with precision within minutes and tracked by The Circle's ""SeeChange"" cameras or by fleets of drones. How much of ""The Circle"" is tongue-in-cheek? There are parts where Eggers surely is having fun with Mae's innocence and her bosses' laughable rhetoric and overweening ambition. None of the characters is fully formed enough to seem real. Still, he seems to be searching also for a way to prod people to ask whether the cost of surrendering privacy is always an acceptable price to pay for the newest service or the coolest device. In a recent interview with The Telegraph, Eggers was asked: ""What is the greatest threat to our freedom today?"" His answer: ""Our feeling that we're entitled to know anything we want about anyone we want."" In this respect, ""The Circle"" isn't all that far away from ""1984"" in its ability to sound an alarm. Yet Orwell's vision, from the vantage point of the late 1940s, was guided by the actual horrors of the Soviet Union's totalitarian regime. Eggers, as much as his narrative evokes the events of today from the NSA surveillance controversy to the Obamacare website troubles, imagines a horrific future that hasn't arrived and likely will never come.","In a novel, a character proposes that a social network should take on government functions .

"(CNN) -- Bloodshed has unfortunately become commonplace in Iraq. And it reached a fevered pitch this year, the United Nations said in a monthly tally of violent deaths. At least 4,137 civilians have been killed and 9,865 more injured in the country since January. Add to that hundreds of security personnel. ""We haven't seen such numbers in more than five years,"" said Gyorgy Busztin, a spokesman for the U.N. mission in Iraq. Sectarian factions bomb and shoot one another on a nearly daily basis, and reports on the violence often fade into the back rows of news coverage, as one month of deadly statistics follows another. But the dimension of the bloodletting is alarming, the U.N. reminded in its report Thursday. The U.N.'s total for July was 238. And in June, 258 civilians were killed in Baghdad, the U.N. said. In those two months, an additional 1,411 people were injured in violence across the city. Across Iraq in those months, violence killed 1,818 people, the U.N. said. The U.N. on Thursday called out once more to Iraq's political leaders to stop the mayhem. It does not want to see Iraq return to a level of death similar to that wrought during active combat. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Across Iraq, at least 4,137 civilians have been killed since January .

"(CNN) -- Every year, a combination of power, performance and perfection brings over 200,000 motorsport devotees to an English country estate for the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Motorsport fans have long regarded Formula One as the pinnacle of all racing cars and F1 car designers have responded by pushing the boundaries of speed since the Championship started in 1950. In the 1970s, Renault's designers pioneered the turbo engine for use in F1. The visceral acceleration of the turbo cars was well known, the speed intoxicating for both the drivers and the fans but it was not widely well received by some in the industry. Four-time world champion Alain Prost began his Formula One career at the start of the turbo-engine era, and says it was something of a laughing stock when Renault unveiled its RS01. ""When Renault introduced the first turbo engine everybody was laughing -- especially in England,"" Prost told CNN. ""The turbo engine was very different to other engines. You had more power -- more top-end power. But the weight of the car was much bigger,"" explained Prost. ""We were learning all the time. The team was getting more and more experienced and being very curious, working very close with the engineers, I really loved it."" Turbo technology was slow to take off, but once it did, it paved the way for an exciting new era in F1 racing. It wasn't until 1979 -- two years after its launch -- that Renault's turbo-charged car finally won the French Grand Prix, driven by Jean-Pierre Jabouille. ""As much as I loved experimenting with the new design, it was a very frustrating time too,"" said Prost. ""We very often blew up the turbo, blew up the engine, but it was part of the time and I think everyone has accepted it. However their domination in the sport was relatively short-lived following safety concerns. After a raft of restrictions, the Formula One governing body, FIA, eventually banned turbo-equipped engines in 1988. It seems though that Renault will have the last laugh as from next year, all F1 cars will be required to have turbo engines. Some are saying that it involves the biggest rule change in the sport's history. Gone will be the current 2.4-litre normally aspirated V8s, which have been in service since the start of 2006, and in their place will be 1.6-litre turbo V6s. Each engine will also be limited to 100 kilograms of fuel per hour, putting an emphasis on performance combined with greater fuel economy. Renault's new turbo engine, dubbed ""Energy F1-2014,"" may have evolved since the early days of turbo technology, but it still owes a debt to the engineers who revolutionized racing with the world's fastest ""teapot.""

"(CNN) -- Pennsylvania's attorney general would not rule out Monday the possibility of additional charges or the discovery of more victims in the case of a former Penn State university football coach accused of sexually abusing boys between 1994 and 2009. Speaking at a news conference, Attorney General Linda Kelly urged anyone with information about the case to come forward, particularly the unidentified boy whom a graduate assistant testified was assaulted by former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky in 2002. She said the alleged failure of two top Penn State university officials to report abuse claims likely perpetuated a nightmarish loop of abuse. ""Their inaction likely allowed a child predator to continue to victimize children for many, many years,"" Kelly said of Penn State Athletic Director Timothy Curley, 57, and Gary Schultz, 62, the university's senior vice president for finance and business. The men, each charged with one count of perjury and one count of failure to report suspected abuse, were released Monday on $75,000 bail each after an arraignment hearing in a small courtroom packed with reporters. They appeared flanked by their attorneys, each of whom said the men were innocent of the charges and they would fight to clear their names. Sandusky is accused of abusing eight boys and is charged with involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and numerous other charges. He was released Saturday on $100,000 bail. His attorney, Joseph Amendola, did not return a message from CNN seeking comment Monday. Amendola earlier told CNN affiliate WJAC that Sandusky has known about the allegations for three years. ""Jerry feels like, because of his background and reputation, it took a long time to reach this conclusion, and he's been ready for it,"" Amendola told the station. While Kelly declined to comment on whether publicity surrounding the case since Sandusky's arrest on Saturday has generated leads, she said that given the lengthy period over which the abuse allegedly occurred, it is not ""beyond the realm of possibility"" that as-yet unknown victims will come forward. Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said the case is one of the more unusual he has investigated during his career because no action was taken against Sandusky despite repeated eyewitness accounts alleging inappropriate activity on his part involving young boys. ""As you go through this case as I have, there aren't many heroes,"" he said. ""These children are scarred for life."" Sandusky, Curley and Schultz were each charged after a multiyear grand jury investigation. Curley and Schultz stepped down late Sunday after an emergency meeting of the university's board of trustees. They ""allegedly failed to report the sexual assault of a young boy after the information was brought to their attention, and later made false statements to a grand jury that was investigating a series of assaults on young boys,"" Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said over the weekend. Read the indictment (PDF) (warning: graphic content) The news sent shock waves through the Penn State community, a university known for the good reputation of its athletic programs. ""I firmly believe that any person is innocent until proven guilty,"" Interfraternity Council President Dan Florencio said, according to the Penn State student newspaper, The Daily Collegian. ""But the damage has already been done to make Penn State look bad."" Earlier, Penn State President Graham Spanier said Curley and Schultz have his ""unconditional support."" ""I have complete confidence in how they have handled the allegations about a former university employee,"" he said, adding that the charges are ""groundless."" On Monday, though, Spanier requested that a fund-raiser for the Renaissance Fund -- one in which he and his wife, Sandra, were set to be honored -- be canceled. Moneys raised would have gone toward scholarships for the school's general population, a drive the president called ""our highest fund-raising priority."" ""President Spanier and his wife asked that it be postponed until spring because their attention is so heavily focused right now on the troubling charges by the attorney general,"" Spanier said in a statement. Curley asked to be placed on administrative leave so he could devote time needed to defend himself, the university said Monday. Schultz will go into retirement, it said. While Kelly said that Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno has cooperated with authorities and is not a target of the investigation, she declined to comment on whether investigators were looking at anyone else for possible charges. Sandusky, 67, served 23 years as defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions football team and also founded a charity to help troubled youth. Many of the boys who testified to the grand jury about their abuse claims were participants in that program, The Second Mile, the grand jury said. Sandusky allegedly engaged in fondling, oral sex and anal sex with young boys over a period of more than 10 years, according to the investigative grand jury's summary of testimony. ""This is a case about a sexual predator who used his position within the university and community to repeatedly prey on young boys,"" Kelly said Saturday. On Sunday, Paterno called the charges ""shocking."" ""If true, the nature and amount of charges made are very shocking to me and all Penn Staters. While I did what I was supposed to with the one charge brought to my attention, like anyone else involved, I can't help but be deeply saddened these matters are alleged to have occurred,"" Paterno said in a statement. Overheard on CNN.com: Penn State head coach should've done more . According to the grand jury, Sandusky in some cases promised the boys gifts or invited them to football games and sleepovers. Some of the incidents allegedly occurred in Penn State athletic facilities. Sandusky, who retired from coaching in 1999, maintains his innocence. Sandusky founded The Second Mile, a charity to help troubled youth, in 1977 and it provided him with ""access to hundreds of boys, many of whom were vulnerable due to their social situations,"" the grand jury said. In a statement Monday, Second Mile said it was never ""aware of the very serious allegations contained in the grand jury report"" and noted that it had removed Sandusky from any programs involving children in 2008, after it had been notified of the allegations against him. The group said it is asking any other potential victims to contact authorities. ""Our highest priority always has been and will continue to be the safety and well-being of the children participating in our program. We encourage program participants to report any allegations of abuse and\or inappropriate sexual activity where ever it has occurred, and we take any such reports directly to Child Protective Services,"" the statement said. ""We have many policies and procedures designed to protect our participants, including employee and volunteer background checks, training and supervision of our activities."" Sandusky, who was arrested and released Saturday on $100,000 unsecured bail, faces seven counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and numerous other charges, including aggravated indecent assault and endangering the welfare of a child. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, but defense attorney Joseph Amendola told WJAC he expects it be postponed in order for attorneys to have enough time to bring in witnesses. The grand jury investigation was initiated by the claims of one boy who alleged that Sandusky had ""indecently assaulted"" him and engaged in sex acts while the boy was a guest at his home, according to the attorney general. The victim met Sandusky through the former coach's Second Mile charity, Kelly said. Sandusky allegedly used expensive gifts such as trips to professional and college games, golf clubs, a computer and money, Kelly said. The relationship, which began in 2005 and lasted into 2008, included overnight stays at Sandusky's home, where touching led to sexual acts, according to Kelly and grand jury testimony. Timeline of abuse claims . ""One of the most compelling and disturbing pieces of testimony in this investigation came from an eyewitness to a late-night sexual assault that allegedly occurred in March of 2002, in the locker room of the Lasch Football Building on the University Park Campus,"" Kelly said. ""Hearing what sounded like sexual activity in the showers of a building that was supposed to be empty, a graduate assistant reportedly observed Sandusky sexually assaulting a naked boy who appeared to be about 10 years old."" The assistant reported the incident to Paterno, who in turn alerted athletic director Curley, Kelly said. ""It was obvious that the witness was distraught over what he saw, but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the grand jury report. Regardless, it was clear that the witness saw something inappropriate involving Mr. Sandusky. As Coach Sandusky was retired from our coaching staff at that time, I referred the matter to university administrators,"" Paterno said. But instead of reporting the incident to authorities, Curley and Schultz banned Sandusky from having children from Second Mile visit the football building, Kelly said. The grand jury found that Curley committed perjury in repeatedly denying that he had ever been told that Sandusky had engaged in sexual misconduct with a child, Kelly said. ""Assertions by Schultz that the allegations concerning Sandusky were 'not that serious' and that he and Curley 'had no indication that a crime had occurred' were in direct contradiction to other testimony and constituted perjury,"" Kelly wrote. In all, the grand jury identified eight boys, ranging in age from about 8 to 14, who were the targets of similar sexual advances or assaults by Sandusky from 1994 to 2009. All of the victims first encountered Sandusky through Second Mile activities, Kelly said. Authorities said they are continuing to search for additional possible victims and that the case remains active.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The man who revealed that Valerie Plame worked for the CIA said that he was ""extraordinarily foolish"" to leak her name. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage was a source of the CIA leak to columnist Robert Novak. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in an interview broadcast Sunday that he did not realize Plame was a covert agent when he discussed her with syndicated columnist Robert Novak. Novak, a former CNN contributor, wrote the July 2003 column in which Plame was named as a CIA employee. He later cited his sources as Armitage and Karl Rove, then President Bush's top political adviser. Armitage said he had seen a memo that said Plame was publicly chairing a meeting, so he assumed her CIA employment was not a secret. ""There was no ill intent on my part, and I had never seen, ever in 43 years of having a security clearance, a covert operative's name in a memo,"" he said.  Watch Armitage explain why he leaked Plame's name » . Blitzer asked Armitage if he ""simply assumed that she was not a clandestine officer of the CIA."" ""Well, even Mr. Novak has said that he used the word 'operative' and misused it,"" Armitage said. ""No one ever said 'operative.' And I not only assumed it, as I say, I have never seen a covert agent's name in a memo. However, that doesn't take away from what Mrs. Plame said. It was foolish, yes."" Rove, who left the White House in August, has denied he was also a source of the leak to Novak. Plame's identity was disclosed shortly after her husband, former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson, challenged one of the chief claims underpinning the Bush administration's case for the U.S. invasion of Iraq -- that Iraq had sought uranium for nuclear weapons from the African country of Niger. In an op-ed piece for The New York Times, Wilson wrote that he had investigated the claim at the request of CIA officials and found it ""highly doubtful"" that any such transaction could have occurred, and he accused the Bush administration of having ""twisted"" the evidence for war. Neither Armitage nor Rove was charged with a crime in the leak. Wilson and Plame have accused Rove and other Bush officials of leaking her identity as a CIA officer in retaliation for her husband's emergence as an administration critic. A federal judge in Washington recently dismissed a lawsuit by the couple against Rove, Armitage, Vice President Dick Cheney and Cheney's former chief of staff, Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby. Libby was convicted of obstructing justice and perjury in the probe and sentenced to 30 months in prison, but Bush commuted his term before he had served any time.

"(CNN) -- Israel began releasing more than two dozen Palestinian prisoners late Tuesday, a goodwill gesture on the eve of new peace talks that have been complicated by Israeli plans for new housing in East Jerusalem. The vans began pulling away from the Israeli prison in Ramla shortly before 10 p.m. (3 p.m. ET), carrying the 26 freed inmates to flag-waving receptions in the West Bank and Gaza. One group was handed over the Palestinian officials at the Israeli prison at Ofer and they were driven to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in nearby Ramallah. As they were driven away, Palestinian youths outside started throwing stones at the prison, where guards responded by firing stun grenades and tear gas. Some of the Palestinians had been held for more than 20 years. But as the vans rolled away, a group of demonstrators waved signs condemning the release, complaining that the prisoners had Israeli blood on their hands. In approving the release, a committee of Israeli Cabinet ministers stressed ""that if any of the released prisoners return to hostile activity against the state of Israel, they will be returned to continue serving their sentences."" Abbas announced the release of the prisoners was just the beginning. ""We say to them and the rest who will follow, this is the beginning and there are other brothers who will be returning and be amongst you soon,"" he said. The prisoner release came after Israel said it would forge ahead with a plan to build 900 housing units in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians hope will be the capital of their future state. The issue of Israeli settlements derailed the last round of direct talks, in 2010, and critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say building on disputed territory could derail the new talks, slated to start Wednesday in Jerusalem. ""Netanyahu has to decide which government he is heading: a government that is trying to reach a peace agreement, or a government that is trying to undermine all possibilities of this agreement,"" said Shelly Yachimovich, head of the Labor Party and the Israeli opposition. In January, the United Nations Human Rights Council said Israeli settlements amount to ""creeping annexation"" of Palestinian territories by Israel and have taken a ""heavy toll"" on the rights and sovereignty of Palestinians. And in Washington, where American leaders have pushed both sides to return to the table, the State Department said it had ""serious concerns"" with the new announcement. ""We've encouraged both sides broadly speaking to refrain from taking steps that could undermine trust. We said that from the beginning,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. But, she added, ""We've also been clear that these are complicated issues, and there will be bumps in the road."" Daoud Kuttab, a columnist for the online Middle Eastern news site Al-Monitor, said the released prisoners are a bargaining chip to make sure the Palestinians don't back out of the talks despite their anger over new settlements. ""They're trapped, and Mahmoud Abbas has egg on his face today because he can't get out of the talks,"" Kuttab told CNN. But Rami Khoury, a veteran Middle East analyst at the American University of Beirut, said both sides agreed to resume talks for nine months under American mediation. ""This is a significant gesture, so therefore you're going to hear a lot of noise from both sides -- complaints, grievances,"" Khoury said. ""But you can pretty much discount most of what you hear in public, because they're both clearly committed to doing this for nine months. And we really need to give it time to see what's going to happen."" Both Abbas and Netanyahu are ""hemmed in by domestic constraints,"" leaving neither side likely to make significant changes on its own, Khoury said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said last week that ""many difficult choices"" lie ahead for both sides, but held out hope that ""reasonable compromises"" could be reached. Khoury called that a ""weak statement"" that downplayed expectations for the talks. As a result, most observers have little hope that the talks will produce a breakthrough in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But he said the U.S. role in the talks is a ""wild card"" that could defy those expectations. ""What is the United States going to do?"" he asked. ""Will it push both sides? Will it pressure them? Will it cajole them? Will it entice them, and will it make serious bridging and endgame proposals? We have no idea about any of that.""

"(CNN) -- The Syrian regime under President Bashar al-Assad approached the outset of the Arab awakening in Tunisia and Egypt in a state of politico-psychological denial. Pronouncing that Syria was immune from the tectonic shifts in the political landscape of the Middle East because of its Pan-Arab credentials and steadfastness against Israel, al-Assad's regime had a rude awakening when the youth of Daraa in southern Syria protested openly in March 2011 for their individual rights and against the systemic corruption of the ruling elite. The regime cynically labeled the protestors as foreign agents and terrorists and opted deliberately for armed repression of its own citizens. The peaceful protests quickly spread to other urban centers, and the tragic pattern of violent repression and loss of life has characterized the now long and painful agony of the Syrian people whose suffering is worsening. It is important to note that in the first instance al-Assad was given a pass and political space to get in front of the reform movement by his own people, the Arab countries and the international community for two basic reasons: First, the prospect of instability and, in the worst case scenario, civil war and sectarian violence in Syria threatens Syria's neighbors, the region and the international community as a whole; second, al-Assad came to power in 2000 with the aura of a young reformist president and the promise of a ""Damascus Spring."" There was the hope that in the wake of the popular uprisings in the Arab world he would translate his perceived reformist tendencies into action, perhaps as King Mohammed VI of Morocco was doing. Al-Assad turned out to be a false reformer. I remember a meeting I had with him in 2003 in Damascus, and I asked him why the reform movement seemed to be stalled in Syria. He answered that the people had to be ready for structural reforms and one had to proceed slowly and deliberately with, first, administrative reforms. I concluded at the time that he was in no hurry to push for reforms, but was struck when I heard this same incremental approach repeated in public statements by the regime in Damascus in the spring and summer of 2011. It was clear that al-Assad and his circle had opted for regime survival at all costs and to try to get away with the minimal reforms possible that they could control and dictate. That approach has led to the deepening crisis in Syria today, with increasing military defections to the Free Syrian Army and growing unrest and clashes in the country that is now spreading to the key cities of Aleppo and Damascus. When these two urban centers become the focal point of struggle, the end of the regime will be at hand. No one can predict when and how the regime will collapse, but its legitimacy has been totally discredited. The closure of the U.S. Embassy in Damascus is another sign of the sharply deteriorating security situation in Syria. Officials said it has become impossible for the embassy to continue operations and for the staff to remain. This decision reflects Washington's assessment of the regime's inability to control Syria fully. With the death toll mounting and the failure of the Arab League initiative, the Syrian issue was referred to the U.N. Security Council in an effort to put international pressure on the Syrian regime to respond positively to the requirements of the Arab League initiative. Basically, the initiative was to have the Syrian regime cease the armed repression of its citizens and have a deputy nominated by al-Assad to engage with the opposition leading toward a political transition. However, the Security Council action was vetoed by China and Russia on Saturday. Both countries have an inherent aversion to Security Council action that ""interferes"" in the internal affairs of other states. Particularly after Western intervention in Libya, Russia and China do not want to establish precedents that one day could be applied to potential problems within their own nations. The Chinese U.N. ambassador's statement that Syria's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence must be respected reflects China's own sensitivities in this regard. In addition, Russia has vested interests in Syria in the form of lucrative arms sales, commercial ties and access by its naval fleet to the Syrian port of Tartus. The draft resolution was considerably watered down to try to persuade Russia and China not to vote against it. There were no references to authorization of military intervention, an arms embargo, regime change or a human rights commission of inquiry. Despite these efforts, Russia and China vetoed the draft resolution, leaving the next steps in question. The Russian foreign minister is to travel to Damascus to meet with al-Assad, but the purpose of that mission is dubious. The stakes are high. Syria is the linchpin of the Levant; any instability there will almost certainly spill beyond its borders to Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. Israel is carefully watching and waiting to see the outcome. Turkey is vulnerable to refugee inflows and internal ethnic tensions given Syria's Kurdish population on Turkey's southern border. Iran has much to lose from the fall of al-Assad's regime. Its strategic alliance with Syria is at great risk now. With a change of regime in Damascus, it is highly unlikely that a new government, one in which the majority Sunni population plays a more important role than that under the current dominant Alawites, will continue the same relationship with the ayatollahs in Tehran. Hezbollah in Lebanon also has a lot to lose if Iranian-Syrian relations no longer allow Syria to be an essential center for funneling arms, money and logistical support to it. The outcome in Syria cannot and should not be dictated from outside, but the international community, despite recent setbacks, should work persistently to end the killing and support a political transition representative of the will of the Syrian people through, ideally, constitutional reforms and elections. The ultimate goal is a democratic and pluralistic Syria that can be at peace with its own people and that of all its neighbors. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter. Join the conversation on Facebook.

"(Mashable) -- We've heard of musicians finding collaborators via Twitter and reporters finding sources, but what about long-lost brothers finding each other? Well, that's what happened to Matthew Keys, online news producer for KTXL FOX40 News in Sacramento, California. ""I have a routine of checking my e-mail, Twitter and Facebook before bed each night, just in case something happened during the evening that I didn't catch, "" Keys told us. Well, at nearly midnight, Keys saw a message that would lead to a pretty big piece of news that he didn't previously ""catch"" -- a message from a man named Adam Smith reading: ""Hey is your mom's name Jackie?"" Obviously, Keys was a bit freaked out. Still, after seeing Smith's picture, which looked familiar, the young man recalled having spoken to his brother before. ""Adam and I actually met in a web forum,"" he explains. ""Neither of us can remember exactly how we came to meet, but we kept in touch off and on over the past year on MSN and Skype."" Determined to solve the mystery, Keys fired up Skype and messaged Smith. ""He started telling me things from my childhood that I had heard bits and pieces of growing up -- things nobody could have possibly known,"" Keys said. ""I gave him my cell phone number and told him to call me. After a few minutes talking on the phone, it became pretty clear to both of us that he and I were related. We wound up speaking on the phone for four hours, so much so to the point that I had to take the next day off from work to sleep!"" How did Smith know that Keys was his bro? Well, a few years ago, his mother told him that his father had other children, and mentioned a few names, including Keys's. ""At some point, Adam started asking his mom and our dad about me and something in him pushed him to ask me on Twitter details about my biological mom,"" Keys says. After reconnecting, the two then went onFOX40 for an interview, and Keys was even able to give Smith a ride to the station, because -- get this -- they live 10 minutes away from each other. According to Smith, the boys have even more siblings out there, waiting to be found. Here's hoping they all have Twitter handles. As an online news producer, Keys knows only too well the power of social media. ""After telling our story on Facebook, we were flooded with people e-mailing and posting to our wall about similar lost and found stories involving biological and adopted siblings and relatives,"" he says. ""It was extremely touching. I use Twitter for much of the same reason. Twitter and Facebook are both extremely powerful tools to reach out to our television audience and to interact and respond to the praise, concerns and personal stories of those who watch our on-air product.""

"(CNN) -- Inspectors overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons have visited 21 of the 23 sites they want to inspect by a Friday deadline, but security concerns have prevented visits to the remaining two, the world's chemical weapons watchdog said Monday. ""Efforts ... to ensure the conditions necessary for safe access to those sites will continue,"" the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said in a statement released Monday. OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan added that the two remaining sites are in areas contested by government forces and opposition militants -- part of a conflict that has raged in the country since 2011. A joint OPCW-United Nations team is overseeing Syria's efforts to destroy its chemical weapons, which the country agreed to do earlier this year under international pressure. The U.N. Security Council resolution gives Syria until mid-2014 to destroy that arsenal, and charges inspectors with completing their initial inspections of all Syrian chemical weapons and storage facilities by November 1. But Syria's civil war presents inspectors with significant challenges, including having to cross front lines and move through areas controlled by rebels. The OPCW previously has said that cooperation by rebels, in the form of temporary cease-fires to allow inspectors safe passage, would be key if deadlines are to be met. Luhan said Monday that the United Nations is negotiating for the inspectors' safe passage to the two remaining sites. The inspectors will be deployed as soon as their safety is guaranteed, he said. Monday's statement by the OPCW came a day after the group said Syria met its Sunday deadline for submitting a plan to get rid of the chemical weapons. Damascus disclosed the 23 sites earlier this year. On August 21 a chemical attack outside Damascus led the United States and its allies to call for military intervention in Syria's civil war -- a situation that was defused in mid-September, when Damascus agreed to a U.S.-Russian plan to give up its chemical weapons stockpile. But the Syrian opposition has protested that the Syrian government has done nothing to stop the killing of civilians using conventional weapons. According to the United Nations, more than 100,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict. It began in March 2011 when government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement and has morphed into a full-blown civil war. A proposed conference in Geneva, Switzerland, between Syrian government officials and opposition leaders, intended to broker an end to the war, has been delayed several times, but is tentatively scheduled for the end of November.","Inspectors were given until Friday to visit 23 chemical weapons sites .

"(CNN) -- The world has an insatiable appetite for innovation. To feed this desire for technologic and scientific breakthroughs, nations invest in our celebrated universities. Tax and tuition dollars go to educate students -- the next generation of open-minded thinkers -- but also toward fostering research. After all, academia is the quintessential innovation incubator. Isn't it? Early in 2012, the eminent magazine ""Science"" invited young scientists worldwide to answer the question: ""How will the practice of science change in your lifetime?"" One particularly pained (and not unrepresentative) reply was: . ""The biggest challenge facing a generation of young scientists is breaking free of the shackles placed on them by their predecessors ... We are expected to fix broken peer-review systems riddled with small insular cliques ... We are expected not only to flourish but to be thankful for a funding structure equipped with scarce resources that are primarily used on contract science for the blessed few rather than discovery based on the merits of ideas ... We are expected to rise to this challenge and we're sure as hell going to give it our all,"" said Jeremy Block from Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina. Consider the following statistics from the U.S., still representing over 40% of OECD (the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents many of the world's developed countries) R&D. Today, only 3% of principal investigators on federal grants are aged less than 36; in 1980 that was 18%. Only 14% of U.S. PhD graduates in biology land an academic position within five years of graduation. Although we know that some of the most novel ideas come from young people, we are not giving our best and brightest their intellectual independence until they are middle aged. Read more: $30 gadget lets you control computer with your eyes . The problem, I believe, is that science has become unbalanced. What should be the ascendant end of the scale, the joy of producing surprising improvements in health and prosperity, has become outweighed by societal caution. That caution embodies the fear that science might not produce the immediate pay-offs that we expect from our investments. Ironically, our desire for instant success is at odds with the reality of achieving transformational breakthroughs. Short-term expenditures that produce creative evolution are a far cry from the long-term investments that generate technical and scientific revolution. As John Gertner noted in his recent book about the innovation powerhouse Bell Laboratories, ""One type of innovation (e.g. smartphone apps) creates a handful of jobs and modest revenues; the other (e.g. the transistor) ...creates millions of jobs and a long-lasting platform for societal wealth and well-being."" Caution has led governmental funding to become risk-averse. OECD countries have seen substantial declines in government sponsorship of R&D in the past generation -- down from 44% in 1981 to 30% in 2000. Long shots such as the NASA manned space flight program have been canceled and agencies have limited backing for anything that may slow economic growth, such as environmental and climate research. At a time when governmental support for science in many OECD countries has not kept up with inflation, caution overrides our craving for originality. In today's funding climate, when 90% of applications requesting financial support for new ideas from most OECD governmental sources are turned down, peer review committees shift their support to work that is safe and incremental. Caution in the garb of regulation and litigiousness has driven almost all of the recent growth in industry R&D to Southeast Asia. There are many approaches to re-tipping the balance toward creation and away from caution. First and foremost, we must be more willing to take risks. Originality must become as highly valued as linear progression. Our scientific portfolio must contain a higher proportion of reasonable long-shots, even while we acknowledge that these may never pay off. Second, we must invest in promising young people as much or more than we invest in productive projects. Third, funding should be directed to prototyping, meaning high-risk projects that when they fail, fail fast and fail smart (we learn from their failure). Finally, we must teach young people to be innovative. Most scientists believe that creativity is innate, yet 30 years of research has demonstrated that novel thinking can be taught. In my recent book, ""Innovation Generation,"" I describe a systematic approach to learning to think ""outside the box."" A central feature is discovering how to frame shift. Normal thinking is constrained by habitual patterns which linguists call ""frames."" Frames are a structure of expectations that we use to interpret new information. For instance, if while sitting in a lecture hall, the person next to you sneezes then grabs your sleeve and wipes their nose on it, would you be shocked? Of course you would. The sneezer just disrupted agreed-upon social assumptions -- they broke your frame. Frame shifting, what Albert Einstein referred to when he said, ""No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it,"" allows for not just steps but leaps in thinking. Shifts in frames or paradigms led scientists in the 1860s to realize that the bacteria that they had been seeing through microscopes for almost 200 years were pathogens that caused specific diseases. Today, another paradigm shift has led us to realize that the millions of bacteria that inhabit our body cavities are not enemies but allies. A shift in our frame about death from ""terrifying and unspeakable"" to ""nothing is sure but death and taxes"" (Benjamin Franklin), for example, might lead us to create bureaucratic systems for ensuring that every American has a living will, an act that would likely reduce the quarter of all Medicare expenditures spent in the last year of life. Academic science remains a driver of societal transformation; with some frame shifting we could unleash even more global innovation.

"(CNN) -- Enough talk about drifting cruise ships with overflowing toilets -- that's cruising's rare dark side. On the other hand, how about a four-story waterslide, lots of kids' programming and a private island? Decked out with these spiffy amenities, Disney's newest cruise ships took top honors at the 2013 Cruise Critic Cruisers' Choice Awards, the website announced Wednesday. ""Disney has done a great job at expanding without losing what makes it unique: characters and Disney-style entertainment,"" says Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor of CruiseCritic.com, a popular website for cruising aficionados. ""You can have multigenerational groups because they're providing something for every generation."" Five things we've learned about cruising . The Disney Fantasy trounced the competition in the best large ship category, winning for best overall ship, best cabins, best entertainment, best public rooms and best service. The Fantasy's maiden voyage was in March of last year. The Disney Dream, which first sailed in 2011, won for best shore excursions in the large ship category. Large ships carry at least 2,000 passengers. Carnival cruise investigation under way . While the Cruise Critic website boasts more than 100,000 reviews, this year's winners are culled from the thousands of reviews posted in 2012. While anyone can join the website to discuss the ins and outs of cruising, Brown promises that staffers vetting the reviews and veteran cruisers can spot phonies or industry plants. It helps that every ship has had a Cruise Critic staffer sailing on it at some point. ""Cruise travel is so much more complicated than a hotel stay and we have (reviewing) guidelines,"" she says. Disney has fine dining and tours for adults . The new Disney ships feature almost Michelin-level fine dining, elegant on-board spa services, and adult-only tours, says Brown. The ""fantastic kids program"" is spread over almost an entire deck of space and includes animation projects, princess and hero dress up, Disney movies, outdoor fun and other activities. The children are divided by age to ensure toddlers and teens have different activities. In other best large ship wins, the Celebrity Reflection won for best dining, and Celebrity Eclipse won for best value for money. The Royal Caribbean's Allure of the Seas won for best for fitness and best for embarkation. ""Celebrity has most the interesting, beautiful and fun ships in cruising for an adult and the Reflection is the newest,"" launching last October, says Brown. The ship is known for its food, the spa has become pretty and there's an actual lawn on the top deck, which attracts birds in the middle of the ocean, she says. A cruise is a safe and healthy vacation . In the midsized ship category (1,200 to 1,999 passengers), Holland America's ms Noordam won for best overall ship while sister ship ms Westerdam won for best for fitness and best shore excursions.

"(CNN) -- A 49-year-old Nevada man grew up believing he was kidnapped from the hospital as a day-old baby and was returned at age 2 to his parents in Chicago, months after being found abandoned in a stroller in New Jersey. The FBI closed the case: The toddler looked like the missing newborn. The audacious kidnapping -- by a woman dressing as nurse who told the mother to hand over her infant because the doctor needed to examine him -- was a sensational crime nearly a half-century ago. But now the life of Paul Joseph Fronczak has taken another extraordinary turn, he told CNN affiliate KLAS. After taking a home DNA test, Fronczak said, he discovered he wasn't the missing baby. The FBI has reopened the case to tackle the questions of what happened to the real kidnapped baby and who Fronczak is, exactly, he told KLAS. ""I don't know how old I am, or who I am, or what nationality, all those things you just take for granted,"" he said. ""The FBI decided that because my ears matched the Fronczak baby that I was probably the Fronczak baby."" On Thursday, Fronczak told CNN he's optimistic about a resolution. Wrote Fronczak: ""I believe that we will solve these 2 tragic mysteries. I feel we are one step closer to solving this, and one step closer to a happy ending!"" He declined to comment further. He told the Las Vegas station the furor surrounding the 1964 investigation ""was huge."" ""My parents had letters from the pope, letters from people all over the country. It was a huge case,"" he said. ""My parents got really frustrated because they had reporters hanging outside their windows, climbing telephone poles, taking pictures of them at church, following them all over the place."" Federal investigators in Chicago hope modern technology will help solve the 1964 case, said FBI special agent Joan Hyde. The FBI has a destruction schedule for old files, and agents were happy that the case file wasn't on that schedule, she said. ""We weren't sure if it was still around, but we were pleased to find it did exist,"" Hyde told CNN. Hyde declined to comment when asked if the agency felt any embarrassment about the reversal in the case. No one was ever charged in the 1964 kidnapping. ""They conducted a thorough and complete investigation when it originally occurred, and we'll do that again,"" Hyde said. ""We now have technology and tests that we didn't have then, and we're hoping this time around we'll get that piece of information that will help us solve this case, either from evidence or witnesses."" Fronczak's parents, who are still alive, are cooperating with the FBI, but agents are concerned whether their DNA would yield any matches in DNA databases, Hyde said. ""If we take hair or fiber or DNA from the victim's side of the crime, we have to get to the other side of it to compare it to -- to find the persons who did the kidnapping,"" Hyde said. Maybe new witnesses will come forward almost a half century later, Hyde added. With the FBI's mandatory retirement age of 57 for agents, the original Chicago FBI investigators would no longer be with the agency, she said. Today's investigators will concentrate on who was the kidnapper -- and not on what is Fronczak's real identity, Hyde said. ""Our focus is on the crime that occurred, the kidnapping,"" Hyde said. ""If in the course of the investigation we have information that will assist him in that, that will be an added benefit."" The reinvestigation of such a crime 49 years later is rare, she conceded. ""There are always cold cases,"" she said. But when talking about reopening a 1964 baby abduction case, she remarked, ""It's unusual. It's certainly unusual."" Fronczak, who lives in Henderson, Nevada, with his wife, Michelle, and daughter, Emma, said his name was Scott McKinley when he was found abandoned in 1965 at age 14 months. The people who became his parents, Dora and Chester Fronczak of the Chicago area, were able to take possession of him in June 1966 under the belief that the boy was indeed their child, KLAS reported. The Fronczaks adopted and renamed the boy, taking him into their Chicago home. But as he grew older, Fronczak developed a hunch he didn't fit into the family. He didn't look like his Polish and Croatian parents, who didn't reveal much about the kidnapping, he said. Last year, Fronczak bought a home DNA kit and took a swabbing from his parents while they were visiting from Chicago. A week later, the results of the test ruled out his being the biological son of Dora and Chester Fronczak, he said. The DNA technician told him that ""there is no remote way that you are the Fronczaks' baby,"" he said. ""I thought, 'Wow.'"" He revealed his story to KLAS just before what was supposed to be his 49th birthday in April. At the time, he said, he didn't even tell his adoptive parents what he learned because it was too agonizing. The Chicago office of the FBI is now investigating the dual mystery of the kidnapped Fronczak baby and the abandoned Scott McKinley, with assistance from the agency's Las Vegas office, the TV station said. The original kidnapper in the Fronczak case was never found. Neither Fronczak nor the FBI returned CNN's calls for comment Thursday. Since obtaining the DNA findings, Fronczak submitted the results to Ancestry.com, a genealogy tracing company. Based on his DNA, Fronczak is discovering blood relatives: he's found a third cousin, KLAS reported. CNN's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I believe that we will solve these 2 tragic mysteries,"" Fronczak texts CNN .

"(CNN) -- A Cirque du Soleil performance left a Beijing audience audibly shocked when a banned image of the iconic Tiananmen ""tank man"" protester was displayed on giant screens in front of 15,000 people. The politically-charged image -- of a sole, unarmed protester blocking a line of tanks during a 1989 government crackdown in Tiananmen Square -- was displayed for about four seconds as part of a montage of protest imagery during a performance of Michael Jackson's ""They Don't Care About Us,"" according to a post on That's Beijing magazine's website. ""The result was an audible collective gasp from the audience,"" wrote That's Beijing's editor, Stephen George, in a post which has since been deleted. ""The very fact it was displayed, so publicly and on such a large movie theater screen in front of so many people -- and in Beijing, of all places -- felt genuinely quite radical,"" he wrote. ""As my friend commented, 'I can't imagine ever being witness to that image being shown in Beijing again, even if I stay here for another 50 years.'"" The image -- and any mention of the massacre itself -- is banned in China, raising questions of how it made it into the show past the attention of government censors. Cirque du Soleil's publicist Laura Silverman said that ""the image was removed immediately and is no longer shown"" in the show, the South China Morning Post reported. It quoted her as saying the Canadian performance troupe had submitted the full show for prior approval by the Chinese Ministry of Culture, as visiting performers are required. ""Our scheduled performances will go on as planned,"" she was quoted as saying. The incident occurred during the first night of a three-night run of the troupe's Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour. Subsequent performances proceeded without the ""tank man"" image. The show continues its China run in Shanghai Friday, before moving to Hong Kong the following week. The incident made barely a ripple on Chinese social media, although one user of the Twitter-like Sina Weibo service took offence at the image's inclusion. ""Why can't you separate politics and art?"" read the comment. ""What would the Americans think if you put a photo of the collapsing World Trade Center in the show? Keep it out of the performance, stupid French Canadians!"" CNN's CY Xu contributed to this report.","Cirque du Soleil shocked a Beijing audience by screening an image of ""tank man""

"(CNN) -- Police in Portugal are reopening the case of Madeleine McCann, a British girl who was 3 years old when she disappeared while on vacation there with her family in 2007, prosecutors in Portugal said Thursday. This follows the discovery of new lines of inquiry after an internal review of the original Portuguese investigation, London's Metropolitan Police said. Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, have been briefed on the decision, the UK police statement said. For parents of the missing, does hope spring eternal? Mystery has surrounded Madeleine's disappearance from her family's holiday villa in the Portuguese resort town of Praia da Luz for the past six years. A unit from the Metropolitan Police has also been working on a new investigation. It issued fresh suspect drawings in the case last week, along with a televised appeal for information, which prompted a flood of calls and e-mails from the public. Neither her parents nor the detectives investigating her case have given up on one day finding the little girl from Leicestershire, England. The two police forces' investigations will run in parallel and at the moment are following separate new leads, the Metropolitan Police said Thursday. The Portuguese and UK police ""have a shared determination to do everything possible to discover what happened to Madeleine,"" said Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley of the Metropolitan Police. 1,000 responses to new police appeal . But, he cautioned, while the latest developments are welcome, the dual investigations are at relatively early stages and much work remains to be done. ""This new momentum is encouraging, but we still have a way to go, and as with all major investigations, not all lines of inquiry that look promising will yield results,"" Rowley said. UK detectives have been trying to reconstruct exactly what happened on the night of May 3, 2007, when Madeleine disappeared from the villa while her parents dined at a nearby restaurant. The girl was just days shy of her fourth birthday. The discovery last week of a blond girl aged 5 or 6 living with a Roma couple in Greece who proved not to be her biological parents thrust the issue of missing children into the spotlight. Kate and Gerry McCann told UK media last week that the news from Greece gave them ""great hope"" that their own daughter, who would now be 10 years old, could be found alive. About 10 cases of missing children around the world are ""being taken very seriously"" in connection with the Greek girl's case, including children from the United States, Canada, Poland and France, a spokesman for a Greek children's charity said.

"(CNN) -- A 50-year-old California woman reported missing more than a week ago -- having last told her teenage daughter she was heading to a nearby drugstore -- was found dead, police said. The Oakland Police Department said Tuesday in an e-mail that the Alameda County coroner's office has identified the remains of a woman found Friday in Solano County, which is between Sacramento and San Francisco, as those of Sandra Coke. Coke, who worked as an investigator in the Federal Public Defender's Office in Sacramento, was reported missing by her family on August 4. ""She was a loving mother, daughter, sister and auntie, and a shining light in our family; her good cheer, easy laugh and generous hugs will be missed,"" her family said Tuesday in a statement. ""Those of us who were privileged to know Sandra will remember her as an unusually kind, generous and big-hearted person."" Reports on a Facebook site tied to the family noted that Coke had gone to an Oakland drugstore intending to meet someone she thought had information about her missing dog. Her 15-year-old daughter called Coke's longtime friend, Wendy Springer, hours later when her mother hadn't returned home. Her car -- a 2007 Mini Cooper convertible -- was found in a parking lot the next day. ""She would never have left her daughter for more than 15 minutes and not checked in,"" Springer told reporters Thursday. That day, family members announced a $100,000 reward for information that would lead to Coke. They also spearheaded efforts to canvass the northern California city that she called home. According to Oakland police, Coke had been in good mental and physical health with no history of being reported missing. News of her death spurred an outpouring of condolences, including from Democratic campaign strategist Christine Pelosi and Natasha Minsker, a local ACLU leader who tweeted that Coke ""will be missed by many."" The grief was palpable in the statement from Coke's family, who hailed her impact professionally and personally on many people. ""She passionately devoted her professional life to helping the poor and those who endured difficult childhoods,"" the family said. ""All of us will miss Sandra's beautiful, giving spirit.""

"(CNN) -- It started with a swim on a sunny afternoon off the Florida coast. Before long, the two men were nursing shark bites. The pair were in knee-deep water when they got nipped a few minutes apart. One in the foot and the other in the shin about 100 yards away, the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said. They then went to nearby Bert Fish Medical Center for treatment of what authorities described as nonlife-threatening injuries. Volusia County tied for most attacks . The incidents occurred Saturday afternoon off New Smyrna Beach, which is 14 miles south of Daytona Beach and about 50 miles northeast of Orlando. One of the victims was in his 20s, while the other was in his mid-40s, according to the sheriff's office. The number of shark bites has gone up and down in recent years in the United States, with 51 attacks in 2001 and 53 last year. In 2009, there were only 29, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. More attacks take place off the Florida coast than in all of the other states combined. However, most shark bites don't end up being fatal. The fatality rate in the United States is just 2%. The last year that someone died in Florida due to a shark bite was 2010, according to the museum.","The bites were within minutes of each other, authorities say .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Three suspected al Qaeda militants were killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen's southern province of Lahj, two local security officials told CNN on Saturday. Two others were injured in the Askariayah district strike, one of whom was critically injured, the officials said. A second vehicle in the same area carrying suspected militants escaped undamaged after a strike missed its target. Residents told CNN that the drone had been flying in low altitude between the two strategic districts of Yafe'e and Radman since the early afternoon. ""The militants were taking a weapons shipment by vehicle to a different location when that strike took place,"" a local security official told CNN on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk due to the sensitivity of the issue. The official said two of the killed were not from Lahj province and that very few strikes occurred in Lahj province over the last two years. ""Pro-government fighters have made it difficult for al Qaeda militants to move around in the province after their defeat last year,"" he added. The strike was the tenth since President Abdurabu Hadi ended his visit to the United States earlier this month. A senior Defense Ministry official told CNN that 34 people have been killed in 12 drone strikes since July 28. The official said that nearly a dozen of the killed over the past two weeks are believed to have been innocent. Four Western embassies have been closed since August 4, after US intelligence intercepted information that al Qaeda would target American interests in the region. Drone strikes against militants in Yemen have been intensifying as the U.S. Embassy there and in other Middle Eastern and African countries have been closed amid terrorism fears. Security presence has decreased over the past two days in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, after hundreds of additional troops were deployed after the terror alert on August 3.

"(HLNtv.com) -- Zach Hodskins is one of the best players on the Milton High varsity basketball team in Milton, Georgia. According to scouting reports, he's an ""excellent shooter"" and ""plays extremely hard."" He is also missing his left arm below the elbow. But to Hodskins, that's really not an issue. Hodskins, 17, recently got the news of his life: The University of Florida offered him a preferred walk-on spot on its basketball team next year. While Hodskins says the offer ""means the world to him,"" what was nearly as exciting was looking over the reports from scouts who attended his games. Their comments? ""Great shooting."" ""Works hard."" His missing arm rarely gets initial mention. ""I love it to see that they've treated me as a player and a kid that can play on the 'next level' first, and then the disability second,"" Hodskins told HLN affiliate WXIA. Of course, his coaches already know he's a winner -- on and off the court. ""Every day we have things we go through and we think it's never going to get any better, or we can't do something,"" Milton coach Van Keys said. ""And you look at Zach and you say, 'Hey, this kid's overcome quite a bit to be at the level he's at.'"" Hodskins has had to deal with missing a portion of his arm since birth. While Hodskins' dream of playing basketball is important to him, he has other goals in mind as well. He said he wants to graduate college and one day be a motivational speaker. He already gets tweets from kids who recognize and identify with him, and they often express their own insecurities about living life with a disability. ""It's just amazing to hear from them, and see that there are other people out there like me who are going through the same thing,"" Hodskins said.

"(CNN) -- North America's tallest mountain has lost some of its stature -- 83 feet of it to be precise. Alaska's lieutenant governor announced Wednesday that new mapping technology puts Mount McKinley at 20,237 feet rather than the 20,320 it was pegged at. ""That's 83 feet shorter than we thought,"" Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell said in a statement. He made the announcement Wednesday at a symposium of the International Map Collectors' Society in Anchorage. The 20,320 height had stood since 1952, when the mountain was measured using a technology called photogrammetry, Treadwell's announcement said. The new height was measured last year with a radar mapping system deployed by the Statewide Digital Mapping Initiative in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey. The project will produce 11,000 new maps of the 49th state by 2016, according to the statement. Alaskans, including two who've climbed Denali, as it is called in Alaska, were unfazed by the news. ""It's hard to climb, and the air is just as thin,"" mountaineer Stan Justice told the Fairbanks News Miner. ""It's still high, it's still hard, it's still cold,"" climber Nick Parker told the Anchorage Daily News. ""As long as it's higher than Texas, I don't care.""

"(CNN) -- Whenever I have to make a tough decision, I look up at the wall of my office, where I have hung the original immigration certificates and pictures of my grandparents. They fled Russia and immigrated to the United States at the turn of the last century. Though I lost them many years ago, they have always been my source of inspiration. I look into those eyes that saw poverty, persecution, anti-Semitism and hatred, and along with fear, I see something else: hope. Their eyes are wide open to the promise and opportunity of America. After the 2012 elections, it seemed there was one issue that could unite Republicans and Democrats: reforming our nation's broken immigration system so that more people like my grandparents could live the American Dream. Fast-forward eight months. In the Senate, the hope for bipartisan cooperation is now reality. By a wide margin -- one that is unheard-of in today's polarized Washington -- the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill that guarantees our nation's borders are secure, protects American workers and offers undocumented immigrants an earned path to citizenship that is tough but fair. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports (PDF) that comprehensive immigration reform will strengthen our economy and reduce the deficit, so not only is reform the right thing to do, it's also fiscally sound policy. The only obstacles to finally fixing our broken immigration system are Speaker John Boehner and House Republicans. If House Republicans fail to act, voters who care about this issue -- especially our growing Hispanic population -- will know they can't count on House Republicans. Instead of moving forward in the weeks since the Senate bill passed, House Republicans have allowed intolerant voices to remain the face of their party on immigration. People like Rep. Steve King, who has compared immigrants to dogs and DREAM Act-eligible children to drug runners, don't deserve a place on the Judiciary Committee that will decide the future of immigration reform. If House Republicans are serious about having a constructive debate, they will remove King from his position of authority. While it is true that Boehner's House has given us little reason to be optimistic and King's rhetoric is contrary to the principles that make this country great, I still have hope for the future of immigration reform. There are several House Republicans whose constituents will demand progress on immigration, and House Democrats want to work with them on finally achieve lasting reform. We can do this, but only if we do it together. We all came to Congress knowing we would face hard choices. For Boehner, that hard choice means abandoning the foolish Hastert Rule, which requires that ""the majority of the majority"" party support legislation before it can be brought to a vote in the whole House, an artificial barrier to bipartisan cooperation. In effect, the rule keeps the speaker in power while preventing Republicans and Democrats from coming together. And most troubling, it thwarts the will of the people, a consequence that is fundamentally at odds with who we are as Americans. I don't think that when my grandparents took those pictures, they ever imagined they would be hanging in the United States Capitol. But I know that if they believed that it was possible anywhere, it was only possible here -- because they had a voice in their government. There are 434 members of the House who could probably tell a similarly inspiring story about their families' immigration journeys. For the good of the country, I hope Boehner draws strength from all of these stories to do what is right for this nation of immigrants. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Israel.","Steve Israel says his grandparents fled persecution in Russia to seek promise of U.S.

"(CNN) -- Late last month, school officials at Deborah Brown Community School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, sent 7-year-old straight-A student Tiana Parker home crying. Her offense? Wearing dreadlocks. The school's policy at the time said ""hairstyles such as dreadlocks, afros, mohawks, and other faddish styles are unacceptable."" Rather than change their daughter's hair to adhere to the school's policies, Tiana's parents, Miranda and Terrance Parker, instead made the brave decision to remove their daughter from the school. The charter school's board decided Monday night to change its dress code, but when I first learned about the story, and saw Tiana in tears, it reminded me of a time in my life when I yearned to have long, straight flowing hair. Hair that looked nothing like the hair that grew naturally out of my head. Hair that my mother would have to pay someone else to create through chemical processing. Hair that, when it was ""done,"" still didn't look ""did"" -- at least not like the tresses that garnished the heads of all the little girls that other children and adults named ""pretty."" Hair that forever escaped me. Hair that, in its absence, made me cry. Whereas I spent most of my youth chasing beauty, at only 7, Tiana and her parents are simply seeking affirmation for a beauty that is the child's own; a beauty that would take me another 17 years to find. Seeing that precious little brown girl break down and cry in front of news cameras, I became instantly focused on her. And her spirit. And her self-reflection. And I wanted to do something for her. So I reached out to other women with dreadlocks -- more positively referred to as ""locs"" -- to create a care package, of sorts, to affirm a little girl's beauty; a digital book of photos and messages from 111 women and girls from all over the country and all over the world, all of whom wear their hair in locs, all of whom want Tiana to know that she and her hair are perfect. When a 7-year-old, straight-A student is removed from class and told that she cannot go to her school any longer simply because she wears her hair in a culturally specific hairstyle, there is a big chance that her reflection on herself, and perhaps even her culture, will be negatively impacted. Rather than run the risk that little Tiana might look in the mirror and see something wrong, I wanted to manually, if not emotionally, insert a positive reflection for her, one that I myself didn't get until I was well into my adult years. It wasn't until I was an adult that I learned about the politics of black beauty. We live in a society in which normative standards tend to reflect those ideals established by the dominant group. And in a racialized society such as our own, one in which the white ideal is constantly pedestaled as the ideal against which all other bodies are measured, black bodies are often regarded substandard -- ""unacceptable"" as is. For black women, our ability to be perceived as beautiful in this society depends upon our ability to emulate a white ideal for feminine beauty. The closer our features are to white ones -- straight hair, light skin and aquiline features -- the more likely it is that we will be regarded as beautiful. So when compared to a white ideal, natural hair is not beautiful, especially not dreadlocks. But the issue here isn't just one of beauty. Tiana was not asked to leave her school because her hair was judged ""ugly."" She was asked to leave because school officials opined that her hair was ""faddish"" and ""unacceptable."" The problem lies in perspective: On what grounds and on whose terms do we determine what is ""acceptable?"" Dreadlocks are rooted in our cultural history and are as old as humanity itself. Yet Tiana's African-American led school, one chartered by Langston University, a historically black university, didn't view her hairstyle in the truth of its own cultural significance. And therein lies the issue. Tiana's story is the one that made the news, but so many young girls question their beauty every single day. Our girls need constant affirmation. Girls need to know they are beautiful, even though there are people in this world that would have us believe that natural hair is ""ugly"" and ""nasty."" If they can't pick up a magazine in the checkout line of the grocery store, turn to any page, and see themselves reflected, then we as adults have to provide them that reflection. And affirmation. ""A Care Package Full of Locs"" is one such reflection -- my attempt to begin to ground Tiana and all the little Tianas in their own culture, and in their own norms, and in their own beauty, lest they be forced to compare themselves to others, lest they look in the mirror and find something wrong. Plus, I just want them all to know that they have an army of sisters, cousins, aunties, mamas, grandmothers and elders all over the world who support them. I sent the care package to Tiana and her family. When I spoke to them Sunday, they were extremely thankful for the outpouring of love and support. And when I asked Tiana how she was feeling, she responded, ""Much better. Thank you."" A few hours later she sent me a text to tell me her message to little girls -- ""Believe in yourself."" As I did back in December, after CNN aired its documentary ""Who is Black in America?"" and as I do often, I'm calling on everyone to join me in ""singing a black girl's song,"" not only for Tiana, but for all the little girls who could benefit from the affirmation of their beauty and their value. An intimate weaving of past and present, memory and contemporary, their stories are our stories. Perhaps if they know that we truly understand, they can be encouraged to see themselves through our eyes; perhaps they will soon be able to see themselves for what they are: Pretty brown girls. No matter her hair texture, length, color or style, please, in some way, tell a little black girl that she is beautiful today. And every day.

"(CNN) -- They've been a couple for two years and are eager to raise two children together. But it wasn't until Thursday that Holli Bartelt and Amy Petrich were allowed to legally wed. They wasted no time. They made plans to tie the knot one minute after a law permitting gay marriage went into effect in their home state of Minnesota. At 12 a.m. Thursday, Minnesota and Rhode Island officially became the latest among 13 states -- plus the District of Columbia -- to allow same-sex marriage. Both states passed applicable laws in May. Seven more states allow civil unions between same-sex couples, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, but six of those have laws against gay marriage. Marriage is defined by law as a ""relationship between a man and a woman"" in 29 states. Only New Mexico has no laws pertaining to same-sex marriage or civil unions on the books, NCSL says. The slow but steady rise in the number of states allowing same-sex couples to wed is a sign that the United States is gradually marching toward the acceptance of these unions. According to a May Gallup Poll, 53% of Americans now think same-sex unions should be legal. In 1996, that number was 27%. In June, the Supreme Court gave proponents of same-sex marriage two major victories. It struck down parts of the Defense of Marriage Act that denied the same benefits provided to heterosexual spouses to legally married same-sex couples, and allowed same-sex marriages to resume in California. Going to the chapel . Bartelt and Petrich exchanged vows at 12:01 a.m. at the wedding chapel in the Mall of America in Bloomington, a particularly romantic spot for the two. They recently got engaged in a photo booth there, a statement from the mall said. They strode to the altar together decked out in white. Petrich wore a pant suit, Bartelt a long gown. Bartelt's two children, ages 9 and 10, joined them, wearing blue and orange colors, which stand for marriage equality. The were pronounced ""wife and wife."" They were among the first same sex couples to marry in the state -- but they had competition. California court denies bid to halt same-sex marriages in state . Midnight matrimony . Right at midnight, Mayor R.T. Rybak of Minneapolis presided over the unions of 42 same-sex couples at city hall, CNN affiliate KARE reported. The couples were scheduled to be at the altar early, so Rybak could move the ceremony along in time for the first wedding vows to be over right when the clock struck 12. The mayor studied up on the couples beforehand to keep things personal during the mass wedding. ""I never want to have a day where it feels like a conveyor belt of love,"" Rybak told CNN affiliate WCCO. In St. Paul, Reid Bordson and Paul Nolle joined the wave of midnight matrimony. They have been a committed couple for 13 years and waited a long time for this moment. But for someone else, the wait may have felt even longer. Bordson and Nolle are raising a 2-year-old daughter together. ""For her to know that we're able to be married like other families is a really big deal,"" Bordson told KARE, choking back tears. Nolle reached for his hand. Island wedding . In Rhode Island, the first marriages were planned for Thursday morning. The sponsor of the state's same-sex marriage law, Sen. Donna Nesselbush, plans to be at Pawtucket City Hall to greet them, she told CNN affiliate WPRI . ""As the only openly gay senator and as the prime sponsor of the bill in the Senate, (Thursday) is a day that I wish to remember both professionally and personally,"" she said. She wants the day to be about love and commitment.","Minnesota and Rhode Island become the latest among 13 states to allow same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- As a cosmetics saleswoman, Shannon Barnes constantly fielded the same question from women looking at mascara ads perched on her department store counter: Are those eyelashes real? Um, no, she told them. Mascara alone would never -- could never -- produce eyelashes as full and thick as those on the models. Armed with the truth, most customers did the natural thing: they bought the mascara anyway, said Barnes, now a pro makeup artist in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. ""Even I can still be sucked in by the hype,"" said Barnes, who knows full well her facial artistry will be airbrushed by photographers until the models she works on barely resemble those she started with. ""I know the extent of the deception. Sometimes I tell young girls, 'It's not a real image.'"" I'm shocked! Beauty ads lie? Do beauty ads tell the truth? Does it matter? The banning this week of two L'Oreal ads featuring Julia Roberts and Christy Turlington in the UK for being so retouched they no longer reflected reality produced a pronounced shrug from across the pond, where psychologists and cosmetics industry gurus posited that American women are in on the game -- and they don't necessarily care. 'Pretty Woman' Julia Roberts too pretty? ""We don't want to see an ordinary person in the ads. We want to see a spectacular person,"" said Nancy Berk, a clinical psychologist in Pittsburgh. ""You underestimate women when you think we can't see beyond the facts. We're aspiring to improve ... we want to feel like we've done what we can."" What is beauty and who has it? The $10 billion cosmetics industry walks a fine line in promising lotions and potions will help consumers turn back the clock, diminish lines, lift eyelids or brighten dull complexions. The Federal Trade Commission, which regulates truth in advertising in nearly every sector, requires companies to be able to substantiate these claims, but creative and conditional words such as ""reduces appearance of,"" ""repairs hair"" and ""skin looks younger"" don't lend themselves to easy or enforceable definitions. ""Doing these ads is not simply careless,"" said Mary Lou Quinlan, CEO of Just Ask a Woman, a New York City marketing agency that's done business with the likes of Maybelline and Estee Lauder. ""They don't just write anything they want. It's creative, but it's accurate."" Just like beauty, however, accuracy and exaggeration are in the eye of the beholder. Paula Begoun, Renton, Washington author known as the ""Cosmetics Cop"" who was fired from her first two jobs for refusing to sell skin care products that didn't work as advertised, said hair care, anti-aging and anti-acne products tend to have the most exaggerated to downright false claims. ""An example of this type of wording is, 'Skin appears more even and looks lifted.' That states what women want to hear but doesn't state skin will be lifted or even,"" said Begoun, who has written 17 controversial books on the cosmetics industry and annually reviews thousands of products from more than 400 skin care companies. ""But there are also many times when the ad or claim is just out and out not telling the truth."" What about women who really believe the hype and then realize they don't still look 25? They tend to be the same people who are dissatisfied with their lives in general and base their self-worth on how they look, experts say. And they do have options, albeit expensive ones. Those inclined to go under the knife can place their hopes in cosmetic surgery, while many will continue to plunk down tens or hundreds of dollars, cruising from brand to brand, on products that may continue to disappoint. ""I don't think this is a conscious thought process, but we want to grab on to something,"" said Brooke Miller, a psychotherapist near San Francisco. ""If women are really trying to figure out how to love themselves, trying to find that self-worth in a product or a cream, then these companies are not really selling a product, they're selling a state of mind."" ""We never really don't have an option ... and that's why these companies are thriving,"" Miller added. ""There's endless possibility. So many people are addicted to the process."" Even industry executives aren't immune. ""I know if I buy a tube of lipstick and put it on, I'm not going to look like Christy Turlington, but an ad with Christy Turlington is going to get my attention,"" said Farah Ahmed, vice president and associate general counsel at the Personal Care Products Council, a national trade association for the cosmetics industry.

"Washington (CNN) -- While House Speaker John Boehner isn't overtly ruling out picking a fight with President Barack Obama over a spending bill, he is laying out an alternative strategy to avoid a government shutdown. During a closed door meeting on Wednesday with House Republicans, Boehner tried to ""gently hold members' hands and walk them away from this,"" said one GOP source who was in the room. The debate is about whether Republicans should attach a measure to defund Obamacare to a must-pass spending bill. The government runs out of money on September 30, the end of the fiscal year. Gamesmanship intensifies ahead of congressional recess . Some conservatives are pushing hard for a confrontation with the Obama administration over the issue, but other GOP members warn it could backfire, and place blame squarely on Republicans if the government shuts down. Boehner and top House Republicans leaders mapped out a plan with their members on Wednesday to spend the five-week August recess touting what they've done to chip away at Obamacare so far and to emphasize the issue will be a major focus this fall. ""We've got a strategy,"" Boehner told House Republicans at their last meeting before the summer break, according to another GOP source in the meeting, adding that the Republican effort over July to delay key provisions of Obamacare has ""arguably been the most important moment in the three years since the law was signed."" A summary of the plan provided by two GOP sources describes following up on earlier votes to delay Obamacare with more votes --""a series of well-placed targeted strikes that will ultimately dissolve the Obamacare coalition and topple the president's train wreck of a law,"" says the plan. Opinion: Explain Obamacare at last . Boehner promised his colleagues more of those votes though he didn't specifically comment on the push to strip Obamacare funding as part of any stopgap spending bill. But he urged members to stick together and said, ""This strategy is achievable. And it's our best shot at actually getting rid of Obamacare. Executing this strategy doesn't mean we can't do other things on Obamacare as well. This is designed to be a strategy we can build on."" House Republican aides recognize that there will be increased pressure on Boehner and other GOP leaders to force a standoff with the president at the end of September over funding for his signature health care law. Several conservative senators popular with the GOP base - including Marco Rubio of Florida,Ted Cruz of Texas, and Rand Paul of Kentucky -- and a bloc of about 71 House Republicans are saying they will refuse to vote for a measure that funds the government if it continues to fund Obamacare. There is little enthusiasm for that approach by other Republican senators. Oklahoma Republican Rep Tom Cole acknowledged there is a division among congressional Republicans on the strategy, but predicted many of his colleagues would ultimately decide that threatening a government shutdown was a bad course of action for the party. ""When people really start to think about the consequences of shutting down the entire federal government and inconveniencing and harming, quite frankly, millions of Americans -- millions out of work, tens of millions denied services they need -- you change the debate from Obamacare to the government shutdown. That's just not a good strategy,"" Cole told reporters after the meeting. Source: Obama was 'rude and dismissive' in exchange with Democrat . Among the party's loyal supporters outside Congress there is still an intense focus on using every means necessary to stop the health care law from going into place. A coalition of 50 outside conservative groups including the Heritage Action Fund, the Club for Growth, and Americans for Tax Reform sent a letter to Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor demanding they pass a bill to fund the government but not allow any money for Obamacare. ""The best and last chance for House Republicans to stand up and thwart this law before its new entitlements kick in is during the upcoming funding debate, and the House should live up to the moment and pass a bill funding the government but denying any funding for Obamacare,"" the letter states. Heritage Action announced Wednesday it is organizing a series of town hall meetings in nine cities across the country to urge the public to pressure lawmakers to support the effort. While these groups ratchet up the pressure, several Republican aides say they don't have a good answer for GOP members on what the next step would be. Even if the House decided to combine an Obamacare defunding provision with a spending bill the Democratic-led Senate won't pass it, so the question remains on what leverage if any House Republicans would have. ""They have no answer -- that's telling,"" one senior GOP aide told CNN, adding what Boehner and others laid out is ""a strategy that's showing results -- getting Democrats to vote for bills."" The skirmish inside the GOP is simmering now, but is sure to heat up as Heritage and other groups press Boehner and other leaders over the August recess. It will hit full boil when the House returns in September and is only scheduled to be in session nine days before government funding runs out at the end of the month. John King: Obama trying to get upper hand in looming showdown . But multiple House Republican aides say they are hopeful that they can move members to support a so-called ""clean"" short-term funding measure -- without any provisions on policy issues -- at a level negotiated in the 2011 budget agreement. Republicans want that bill to come in at a funding level that takes into account the forced spending cuts put in place by the sequester, but Democrats are saying they want the spending level to be higher, at the level without those cuts. GOP aides believe Democrats could be open to signing on so that both sides can punt the debate over how to deal with those across the board spending cuts into the late fall when broader budget negotiations will take place around a vote to raise the nation's debt limit. Boehner's office is sending members home for the recess with talking points on the ""strategy to end Obamacare"" along with a PowerPoint presentation. These describe the plan to hold more Obamacare votes designed to pick off Democratic support for the law, step up oversight about the administration's implementation of the law and ramp up communications efforts around the issue. Mindful of the tense divisions and appetite from the Republican base for a high-profile fight about Obamacare, Boehner will continue to say publicly that all options are on the table. After the meeting he repeated his public position to reporters, saying, ""We've made no decisions about how we're going to proceed"" on the funding bill.

"(CNN) -- The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, UK has acquired two models of the world's first 3D-printed gun. The 'Liberator' pistol is the invention of Cody Wilson, a Texan law student whose company Defense Distributed caused a furore in May when it made blueprints for its firearm freely available on the internet. The distribution of the designs led to Wired magazine naming Wilson as one of the '15 Most dangerous People in the World'. In theory, once downloaded, the designs would allow anyone with access to a 3D printer to make their own gun. Video shows test firing of 3-D printed handgun . A few days after Wilson conducted his first successful test of the pistol, the U.S. government forced Defense Distributed to take the plans down. Wilson complied, but not before the design had been downloaded over 100,000 times. The V&A museum has two copies of the Liberator pistol on display as part of London Design Week. The two prototypes on display -- one extant and one disassembled to show its components -- are part of a new collection of 3D objects. According to the curators, the guns ""represent a turning point in debates around digital manufacturing."" The Science Museum in London also has a Liberator on display. In an interview with CNN, Wilson said that he felt the museum's curators appreciated the Liberator pistol as a design object, but also appreciated the political ideas the weapon conveyed. ""The curators of the museum's digital collection understand Liberator and our other pieces are first and foremost articles of political thought-practice,"" Wilson said. Wilson says that in his view 3D printing is still in its infancy, and that it will become more significant in the future: ""I see digital manufacturing playing a bigger role in our lives."" While he thought that the mainstream firearms industry is no longer as powerful as it once was, Wilson said he thought that the spread of weaponry will gradually increase, and that in future it will be easy for almost anyone to get a gun: ""I think gun-making culture is on an understandable decline, but the barrier to entry to this culture will be lowered."" U.S. requires group to remove 3-D gun instructions from its website . Considering it as a design object, Wilson believes that the Liberator's unusual shape has been part of its success: ""Looking back, I would change nothing of the design. It was curious, boxy, alien. Its strangeness allowed it a better examination -- both as an article of design and as a concept."" Alongside the 3D printed gun, the museum also acquired four other items which point to the future of design, including a homemade toaster constructed from odds and ends for just $6 and a futuristic armchair with elongated ""ears"" to create an artificial private space. 3-D printed guns a boon for criminals? All the items were bought through the Design Fund to Benefit the V&A. Martin Roth, the museum's director, said: ""The generosity of supporters of the Design Fund ensures that the V&A is able to acquire for our permanent collections some of the best and most exciting design projects of our time. ""This year's acquisitions reflect an interesting combination of new technologies working with traditional crafts.""

"(CNN) -- Once in a while, along a steady reach of the wide Missouri River some 70 miles east of Kansas City, the local corn farmers will pause in their labors for a huge rumbling sound, a thunder of jet engines shaking the willows and cottonwoods and the gliding stillness of the stream. Moments later, from behind long razor-wire fences, and rising from an invisible runway folded among the cornfields, a great gray bomber will slowly lumber upwards and hoist itself up into the skies. It is always an awesome sight -- all the more so if other planes follow, and the singleton becomes part of an airborne armada, a squadron of unimaginable power bound on an unannounced mission to a place seldom disclosed, for a purpose rarely to be known. And as the craft vanish into the clouds, and the thunder ebbs away over the woods, so the awestruck locals must wonder: Just what corner of the planet is this day destined to be basking under the unasked-for invigilation of these nuclear-tipped watchers from America's skies. For this, in the trails of burned jet fuel scarring the Midwestern skies, is a closeup of the face of today's American exceptionalism. The bombers come from Whiteman Air Force Base, home to the unit that once bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, an always battle-ready line of B-2 stealth aircraft that its commander proudly says can now deliver massive firepower to bear, in a short time, anywhere on the globe. The crews sent two planes to Korea last spring to warn the saber-rattling North Korea dictator to keep in line. They currently stand armed and ready to deploy a squadron to Syria, should their commander-in-chief issue the order. And should they be told to fly to China, or to Kosovo again, or to Congo, so they will unpack their charts and load their bombs and cannons and rumble off down the Whiteman runways. They are the outward manifestation of the still closely held belief that America, unique in all the world, has a prescriptive right to send weapons of unrivaled might to any place on the surface of the planet, to make sure inhabitants there behave themselves, and march steadily to a tune conducted by the United States. But -- why? This, essentially, was what Vladimir Putin was asking in his now-infamous New York Times op-ed essay. Just why does America still believe that it has a right and a duty to police the world? Why does America consider itself so different -- so sufficiently exceptional as to have a perpetual duty of care for all major happenings around the globe? Without excusing this reality, I would argue that this idea was actually born, two centuries ago, in places just like the far west of Missouri, just where the Whiteman base is hidden. It is a geographical irony based on the existence in such places of a phenomenon long since vanished: the frontier. When Lewis and Clark passed by -- and just near where the base is now, Lewis wrote in 1804 of having seen ""an emence snake...that gobbles like a turkey"" -- this was very much the frontier. Behind the men, back east, were the beginnings of civilization: towns, roads, governments, the law. Ahead was uncharted and untamed wilderness. Behind were traders, farmers, settlers, surveyors; beyond were empty prairies, nomads, lawlessness. And according to some this vague frontier line, shifting ever westward for much of the next century as the nation was opened up, instilled something unique in the American character. A Wisconsin history professor named Frederick Jackson Turner first advanced the idea: that those tested by the frontier experience were a people more violent, more informal, more democratic, more imbued with personal initiative and less hamstrung by tradition, class and elegance. More American, Turner suggested. Strength, power, might -- the ability to tame rather than to persuade, the tendency to demand rather than request, the tendency to shoot rather than to talk -- these were all tendencies compounded by the frontier experience, uniquely different building-blocks employed the making of the modern American. The Western myth, the legends of the cowboy, the cinematic and entertainment park allure of concepts like Frontierland -- all of these were born from this single simple -- some would say simplistic -- thesis offered up by Frederick Jackson Turner. Since then the theory has been much derided -- Turner, it is argued, paid no heed to such matters as race, gender and regionalism. And yet it seems to me much of what he argued still does have a measure of common sense to it. For Americans are different: The notions of Manifest Destiny and the vision of America as the shining city on the hill, surely do owe something at least to the frontier mentality. And I would argue that this mentality, if such a thing exists, still also plays a nourishing role at the intellectual roots of much of today's American foreign policy. There is much more to it, of course. American foreign policy may well be driven nowadays more by corporate greed than by a frontier-tested belief in noble ideals. But Vladimir Putin, by learning a little more about this country's remarkable past, might also come to have a more sympathetic understanding about why it is the nature of Americans to believe they are truly unusual, with a unique role to play in the world, and to have little patience with those who wish it were otherwise. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simon Winchester.","Simon Winchester: America's military patrols the world, unlike that of any other nation .

"(CNN) -- We are in the middle of a fight to preserve the dignity and grace that makes all of us Americans. We have big hearts and great souls. I know. I have seen them, felt them and watched them in wonder when my family was lost and unreachable in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. I cried, worrying for those I loved, heartbroken by what happened to our beloved Louisiana. And in the middle of that tough moment, the decency of people shone through in e-mails, phone calls and in person. Everybody was saying the same thing: ""How can I help?"" This is what we do in times of struggle. We offer our hand and our love to pull someone up who's been knocked down by hard times and despair. It's just a fundamental rule in life and in any fight; you don't kick people when they're down. But for some reason, this principle has been lost on the 217 members of the House of Representatives who decided to lace up some combat boots with rough, crushing soles to kick and kick again the 48 million Americans who count on food stamps. I am not going to mince words. When the House voted to cut $40 billion to the food stamp program over the next 10 years, that wasn't an example of government tightening its belt or making tough choices. That vote wasn't a philosophy or an ideology about governing. Pure and simple, it was a heartless act. It was cruel. It was kicking millions of our families, neighbors and friends when they are down. And the people who work for a living in this country are down. Let's take a walk through the facts of what's happened to them during the Great Recession and this nonrecovery of the economy. The median family net worth dropped from $126,400 in 2007 to $77,300 in 2010, according to the Federal Reserve. It gets worse. Median family income fell from $49,600 in 2007 to $45,800 in 2010. (These are the latest available figures). ""The Fed (Federal Reserve) found that middle-class families had sustained the largest percentage losses in both wealth and income during the crisis, limiting their ability and willingness to spend,"" according to The New York Times. For 30 years, wages have flat-lined or declined for most workers, particularly in the past 10 years, as low-paying jobs replace middle-income paying jobs. In 2009, only half of the country had any assets, and those numbers have gotten worse during the last three years. And here's the kicker. Today -- based on wage levels -- half of Americans live in poverty or near poverty.  The gap between the well-to-do and everybody else is widening alarmingly. Probably everyone reading this knows someone who is striving mightily, working two jobs and cutting expenses to the bone while barely making ends meet. To be considered poor by federal standards, a family of four must make less than $23,550 a year. A person must make less than $11,490. For the unemployed and the millions who have been looking for work for six months or more, the struggle is many times harder and uglier. Ask any worker at Starbucks, Cosi, McDonald's or Walmart, ""How many jobs do you have?"" and likely he or she will tell you: ""Two."" I know colleagues who've had breakfast at one store, and gone to lunch in another, only to find the same person waiting on them. One young woman I heard about gets up at 4 a.m. for her first job and ends her day at 10 p.m. at her second job. The average allotment of food stamps is $133 a person a month. Let me tell you something I can pretty much bet my house on -- that woman is not using her food stamp card to buy lobsters and caviar. She's quietly going to the food pantry, checking the sales in the grocery store, spending some time at the kitchen table clipping coupons and making a serious plan to turn that box of pasta, pound of beef, and if she's lucky, some fresh fruits and vegetables, into a meal plan truly worthy of a Gucci belt. Is there fraud? Yes. Is there some waste? Yes. But today, the food stamp program has an error rate of only 3% -- and those errors were mostly committed by the government in underpayments as well as overpayments and payments to ineligible families. Fraud is a piece of grain compared with the millions of families who manage to put food on the table because of this program. And those few bad apples who do commit fraud are no excuse to kick the unemployed and the poor when they are engaged in a mighty battle to get themselves and their families back on their feet. So shame on this Congress for fighting dirty during working people's hour of struggle. Polls show Americans haven't approved much of Congress lately. But there is a way to gain favor. If this Congress wants to make cuts, why not look at the Pentagon, notorious for waste? Or check out the Department of Agriculture, which made about $28 million in inappropriate farm assistance payments, according to a compilation of government waste reported in Business Insider. Or perhaps lawmakers could start with themselves? Rep. Jackie Speier, D-California, tried to shame her colleagues into cutting less from the food stamp program (called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP). Speaking of representatives who would vote to take food from America's tables, she said, ""Some of these same members travel to foreign countries under the guise of official business. They dine at lavish restaurants, eating steak, vodka and even caviar."" Speier talked about 20 members of Congress who traveled to Ireland and got a daily food allowance of $166. The average amount a family member gets on food stamps is less than $4 a day. And The Des Moines Register reported that Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, received $3,588 in taxpayer funds for both food and lodging during a six-day trip to Russia. The Register urged King to try the ""SNAP Challenge"" and live on $4 a day. He could even try it in Russia. Yet our representatives, one after the other, mostly Republicans, stepped onto the House floor to speak and vote in the name of saving money for the taxpayer.

"(AOL Autos) -- You've probably read articles about fighting traffic tickets -- but the reality is many of us (probably most of us) just don't have the money to hire a lawyer -- or the time/expertise (let alone gumption) to actually challenge a ticket on our own. Avoid a moving violation conviction even if it means paying a bigger fine. There are some alternatives, however. Plead guilty -- with explanation . Sometimes you can get a reduced charge by pleading guilty -- but with an explanation. Provided you have an otherwise clean record -- and the charge itself is relatively minor -- often, this can yield good results. Remember -- what they want most is money. The charge itself is of secondary importance. A great deal depends on the judge, however. Some are hard cases, others more reasonable. Before you decide to go this route, it's smart to get to court early and watch how your judge handles other cases -- especially those similar to your own. If you think, based on his actions, that he's going to throw the book at you -- you can always request a continuance; in many states, these are granted automatically upon request. Simply tell the judge you are not ready to go to trial. A continuance will push your court date off for another few weeks or so and give you time to prepare a defense -- or hire a lawyer. Bargain . Traffic courts are a lot like buying a new car -- because there's lots of haggling involved. You can ask the judge (or the prosecuting/commonwealth's attorney) about the possibility of agreeing to attend driving school and/or pay a fine in return for dropping the charge against you -- or changing the charge to a non-moving violation, which avoids DM ""points"" being assigned to your driving record. That means your insurance company won't have a pretext for a rate hike. In some counties/states, certain charges aren't reported to the DMV at all -- especially if it's an out-of-state ticket. (Mostly, these include non-moving violations such as ""defective equipment"" -- a common ""lesser charge"" that's often assigned in lieu of the original moving violation.) The key thing, however, is to avoid the moving violation conviction -- even if it means paying a larger fine than you'd otherwise have paid for just the ticket/offense you were originally charged with. A one-time hit to your wallet is infinitely preferable to having that ticket held against you for anywhere from three to five years -- the length of time it will be on your DMV record -- and used by your insurance company to justify higher premiums. The total cost of a single moving violation on your DMV record can easily exceed the one-time hit of a fine for ""defective equipment"" (or whatever) many times over. And keep in mind: If you should be unlucky enough to receive another ticket before the old one ""drops off"" -- your jeopardy has just doubled. The points stack up -- and your insurance goes through the roof. How likely is it you can go for another five years without getting nailed again? For many of us, that's a virtual impossibility! It's possible in some states to take the DMV-authorized ""driving school"" online -- and avoid the hassle of spending an entire Saturday reliving high school detention. Bottom line . Either of these alternatives -- pleading guilty with an explanation or bargaining your way to a lesser charge -- can be more cost-effective than hiring a lawyer or spending days/weeks of your own time doing what's necessary to fight the ticket yourself. Most of us have jobs and responsibilities that make that very difficult, if not impossible. And it can be very intimidating for a layman to go up against the system, subpoenaing records, questioning the ticketing officer in open court -- and so on. By challenging the system in this way, one also runs the very real risk of antagonizing the court -- and becoming the target of an angry judge looking to ""teach someone a lesson."" It's true you can always appeal a conviction (in many states, a traffic law case may even entitle you to a jury trial, if you want to take it that far). But that involves yet more time, yet more expense. How much of either can you afford to spend on a traffic ticket beef? Yes, there's the principle involved. If it's a really unjust ticket, you may be motivated to go all the way -- and do whatever it takes to beat the rap. But sometimes, it's smart to pick your battles -- and go for the best outcome you can realistically hope for given time and other constraints.

"(CNN) -- A young Israeli soldier was killed as part of a macabre bargaining ploy, the Israeli military said Sunday. The Palestinian who killed him knew the soldier, and wanted to use the body to secure the release of the Palestinian's brother, who is in prison for involvement in terror attacks, the Israel Defense Forces said. Sgt. Tomer Hazan, 20, went missing Friday. Concerned, his family phoned police. Soon, Israeli authorities brought in Nadal Amer, a 42-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank village of Beit Amin, for questioning, the IDF said. The two men had once worked at the same restaurant. ""Amer confessed to leading the soldier to an open area, where he murdered the soldier and concealed his body in a water well,"" the IDF said in a statement. Amer said he wanted to trade Hazan's body for his brother's freedom, the statement said. In 2003, Amer's brother began serving a lengthy prison sentence for ""involvement in several terror attacks."" Amer led Israeli troops to the body north of the village of Siniria, according to the IDF. ""Additional detentions of individuals suspected for involvement in the incident are anticipated,"" the IDF said. A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted that the prime minister spoke to Hazan's family, saying, ""This crime proves that the fight against terror never stops."" ""This is a horrific terrorist attack carried out by one murderer trying to free another,"" IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said in a statement. ""The IDF will continue to battle the agents of evil wherever they are, to safeguard the Israeli way of life."" But the Israeli paper Ma'ariv quoted Amer's mother as saying, ""I still don't believe he did it. He was a good kid who got mixed up in stupid things."" Ma'ariv also published a statement from the head of Beit Amin, Taki Omar, emphasizing his community's ties with its Jewish neighbors and condemning the killing. ""The village must not be given a bad name because of one crazy person,"" Omar said. In a separate incident, an Israeli soldier died after he was hit by hostile gunfire in Hebron, the IDF said Sunday. The soldier was participating in ""routine activities defending the Jewish Neighborhood of Hebron and approximately 11,000 civilians visiting the area during the holiday of Sukkot"" when he was hit, the IDF said. The wounded soldier later died at a hospital in Israel. The IDF launched a search for the attackers and movement in the vicinity of the shooting was restricted, the IDF said.","A Palestinian lured and killed an Israeli soldier he knew, Israel says .

"Editor's note: The October Issue of Martha Stewart Living and the Martha Stewart Halloween Special Edition are currently available on newsstands. (Martha Stewart Living) -- Host a gathering that kicks off Halloween with a movable feast, friends and family, and a riot of funny faces. Here's your go-to guide for everything including pumpkin picking strategies, carving techniques, and printable templates. We'll even show you what to do with the seeds! Martha Stewart Living: 15 kitchen shortcuts that will change the way you cook . Smashing pumpkin Halloween invitations . Get your party started right with Halloween invitations adorned with a familiar grin. Choose a carving location . If weather permits, consider having a daytime party outside on a picnic table, where it won't matter as much if you make a mess. Keep sharp instruments safely organized in buckets and on trays on the picnic table. Whether you're inside or outdoors, cover your table (or tables) with newsprint or kraft paper for quick, easy cleanup. If inside, you may want to protect the floor, as spilled pumpkin flesh and seeds can be slippery. Martha Stewart Living: 19 tips for perfect laundry every time . How to pick pumpkins . Ask guests to bring their own pumpkins, or plan on providing them for the whole party. Be sure to choose ones that are smooth, firm, and symmetrical. They don't need to be giant -- keep in mind that people will be taking their jack-o'-lanterns home at the end of the party. Have a few extra pumpkins on hand for any late arrivals. What to ponder at the patch . Design dictates shape: If you know what design you want to make, pick a pumpkin accordingly. Tall, oblong ones will work best for vertical designs, whereas short, squat ones are better for horizontals. Flat can be fine. Some pumpkins have a flatter side (where they rested against the ground as they grew). Work it to your advantage, since carving on a flat surface is easier than carving on a rounded one. If you plan to group pumpkins, rotate them to see how your design will continue from one to the next. Also try rotating if you're stacking pumpkins: Some nest better at certain angles. (Leave the bottom pumpkin's stem intact, or just trim it—cutting it off can invite premature rotting.) Martha Stewart Living: 20 super-efficient, super-effective ways to clean all the things . Nature's canvas . This year, try an upgrade on the usual toothy jack-o'-lantern and carve something that looks like art. Find inspiration for a design in the fabric of a favorite dress or a beloved wallpaper pattern from your childhood home. The results are so sophisticated and eye-catching, sometimes they don't even need the help of a candle to shine. Plan the design . Consider how the pattern will fit on the pumpkin and how it will repeat. Tape it to the pumpkin. (You may need to cut slits into the perimeter of the template and overlap it so it conforms to the roundness.) Using an awl, a pushpin, or a T pin, prick every ⅛ to ¼ inch along the outlines of the template. Then remove the template, but keep it for reference. Martha Stewart Living: No-mess one-bowl desserts: 12 recipes for lazy bakers . Create the design . Use linoleum cutters to scrape the pumpkin skin. Start with the outline of the design and work inward. For details, use a No. 1 or No. 2 blade. For larger areas, use a No. 3 or No. 5 blade. Scrape in the same direction in each section to keep the lines unified. Pumpkin-carving tools . Look beyond the knife drawer to implements intended for other uses -- say, a melon baller or a keyhole saw. These pumpkin-carving tools will make carving an easy task for you and your guests. How to carve pumpkins with kids . Try a new approach to pumpkin carving with smaller kids: Have children use their own drawings to create a template. First, sketch a design on a piece of paper and cut out the pieces of the face separately. Next, tape the parts to the hollowed-out pumpkin. (Note that as you're going from paper to pumpkin, you may have to interpret the layout of the face a little differently.) Then trace the lines of the template by pokingholes with a needle tool. Guide your kids if they need help with sharp tools. Last, remove the template and carve along the dotted patterns with a miniature saw. Martha Stewart Living: Instant organization: Get it together in 15 minutes or less . Party menu and favors . When the crew starts feeling as hollow as their creations, let them break for fall fare, including sage popcorn in handheld portions. The trio of cheddar, Gruyere, and fontina gives mac and cheese layers of sophisticated flavor, but it's still informal and delicious for all. The single servings make it easy to hold and carry. Grown-ups can warm up with a hot whiskey sour with Nocello, a walnut-flavored liqueur that adds a nutty twist. Sweet-potato soup gets its smoky essence from chipotle and a bit of crunch from a topping of salted pepitas; served in a mug, it's portable and hand-warming. Make sure to save room for dessert, a tasty sundae with an apple ""bowl"" that's been hollowed out to accommodate a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a drizzle of homemade caramel sauce, and toasted walnuts. Make a classic Bundt cake, baked with caramelized apples, walnuts, and spices, to await the partygoers; the glaze is made with apple cider. For party favors or treats, fill crepe-paper pumpkin pouches with tiny toys and candy eggs. Keep your party treats somewhere special. Transform a few hollowed-out pumpkins into candy jar creatures by sawing open pumpkin tops and placing a bowl inside. Guests will love this witch who thinks she's gourd-geous.

"(CNN) -- Injured New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez and Major League Baseball are negotiating a deal that would result in a lengthy suspension instead of a permanent ban, ESPN reported Wednesday night. According to the ""Outside the Lines"" report, a source familiar with the discussions said representatives for the three-time AL Most Valuable Player and 14-time All-Star are talking with league officials. The ESPN story said some baseball officials want the 38-year-old Rodriguez to be banned for life. Until now, his attorney has said he will fight any suspension or ban. The network also reported that Rodriguez has been shown the evidence against him, including documentation that Rodriguez coerced a witness in MLB's performance-enhancing drugs investigation. Those allegations claim Rodriguez had ties with the now-closed anti-aging Biogenesis clinic in Florida and its founder, Anthony Bosch. Rodriguez or Pujols: Whose contract is worse? In an interview with CNN earlier this month, the player denied any plea negotiations and didn't say whether he would fight an adverse decision . Rodriguez, now recovering from an injury, is considered one of the game's greatest sluggers. He has 647 home runs -- the fifth most-ever -- in 19 seasons. In 2009, he had an outstanding postseason in helping the Yankees win their most recent World Series title. He holds the largest contract ever in American sports, signing with the Yankees in 2007 for $275 million over 10 years. Performance enhancing drugs in sports . He has admitted in the past to using performance-enhancing drugs, but he also has denied taking any after 2003. He has never been suspended by the league for a drug violation. Rodriguez is supposed to take part in a practice game at the Yankees training facility in Tampa, Florida, on Thursday. The Biogenesis scandal has already to have ensnared one star: 2011 National League MVP and Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has passed up a chance to examine how far states can go to restrict unsolicited e-mails in efforts to block spammers from bombarding computer users. A tough anti-spam law will not be reviewed by the Supreme Court, the court said Monday. The high court without comment Monday rejected Virginia's appeal to keep its Computer Crimes Act in place. It was one of the toughest laws of its kind in the nation, the only one to ban noncommercial -- as well as commercial -- spam e-mail to consumers in that state. The justices' refusal to intervene also means the conviction of prolific commercial spammer Jeremy Jaynes will not be reinstated. His 2004 felony conviction was the first in the United States for sending bulk unsolicited electronic messages. A Virginia jury found Jaynes used several computers and servers to send as many as 24,000 spam e-mails in one day to America Online subscribers. He used false ""header"" info and sender domain names, according to court records. A search of his Raleigh, North Carolina, home found CDs with more than 176 million e-mail addresses and 1.3 billion e-mail user names, some of them stolen by a former AOL employee. Jaynes was sentenced to nine years in prison, but the state high court eventually reversed the conviction. The state justices said the law was overbroad because some bulk e-mails might contain political, religious, or other speech that has traditionally been given higher First Amendment protection than typical ""commercial speech."" Such political speech might be a request for support from a candidate for elected office, while commercial speech might be a solicitation for a medical product, like a hair regrowth tonic. The U.S. Supreme Court was asked to weigh whether such anti-spam laws overreach into protected speech. Despite the ruling, Jaynes remains behind bars because of a federal securities fraud conviction unrelated to the state spamming charges. The anti-spam case is Virginia v. Jaynes (08-765).","U.S. Supreme Court declines to hear appeal on Virginia's tough anti-spam law .

"(CNN) -- Police on Friday arrested a second contractor employee in recent dry ice explosions at Los Angeles International Airport. Miguel Angel Iniguez, 41, was a supervisor for 28-year-old baggage handler Dicarlo Bennett, who pleaded not guilty Thursday to two counts of possession of a destructive device in a public place, a Los Angeles Police Department statement said. The statement said Iniguez, of Inglewood, was booked on suspicion of possession of a destructive device near an aircraft. He was being held on $500,000 bail. On Sunday, dry ice in a plastic bottle exploded in an employee restroom, causing a brief shutdown of Terminal 2, the FBI said. No injuries were reported, and the terminal resumed operations after a brief evacuation. The other incident occurred about 8:30 p.m. Monday at the Tom Bradley International Terminal, airport police said. Three plastic bottles containing dry ice were found, but only one had exploded, police said. The explosions didn't cause any injuries. Both Iniguez and Bennett worked for Servisair, a leading global provider of aviation ground services. Bennett continues to be held on $1 million bail, but a bail review hearing will be held October 23. The court entered the not guilty pleas on his behalf. Bennett's defense attorney Ben Wasserman told reporters after the arraignment that Bennett was removing dry ice from a plane's holding area because he was told the vapors were dangerous to an animal being transported in the cargo hold. ""His intent in taking the dry ice from the hold was not the intent to make a destructive device,"" Wasserman said. ""One of the other crew members said take the dry ice out or do something with the dry ice because the carbon dioxide is harmful to the animal, so he took the dry ice out."" Bennett allegedly thought the explosive devices were ""a game"" and ""a funny kind of joke,"" and he had no intent to attack people, police said. Dry ice, which is carbon dioxide in solid form, is used as a refrigerant for meats and ice cream, especially when shipped in a box. When dry ice becomes warm, it transforms into vapor. CNN's Michael Martinez and Traci Tamura contributed to this report.","A second LAX contract workers is arrested in connection with recent blasts .

"(CNN) -- It is a rivalry which can make or break golfers. Europe vs. the United States, whether in the Solheim Cup or its male equivalent the Ryder Cup, is a grudge match as intense as any on the planet. It requires players with nerves of steel, who can handle the weight of a continent's expectations on their shoulders. It requires players like Caroline Hedwall. ""Being out there, the pressure, I get so pumped,"" the 24-year-old Swede told CNN. ""I just find a different focus out there. It's just me and the ball, and the hole ... it's just a cool feeling."" In pictures: What price golfing perfection? Hedwall dazzled as Europe crushed the U.S. in August's Solheim Cup, winning the trophy on American soil for the first time with an emphatic 18-10 victory. It was the biggest winning margin in the 23-year history of the competition, with Hedwall the catalyst the for Europe's dominant display. The world No. 23 made history by becoming the first woman to taste victory in all five of her matches, rounding off a victorious weekend with a singles win over former teen sensation Michelle Wie. As in Europe's 2011 victory, Hedwall did not automatically qualify for the team -- she was one of four captain's picks in the 12-woman lineup. Her place in the record books was in the balance when she and Wie approached the 18th tee at the Colorado Golf Club. The match was level and the winner of the hole would take the point. For Europe, a point for Hedwall would be Europe's 14th, ensuring Liselotte Neumann's charges retained the Solheim Cup. In pictures: The world's most extreme golf courses . ""I was the first to tee off and I had a good long drive in the middle of the fairway,"" recalls Hedwall. ""I remember telling my caddy, that I'm just going to aim a little bit left to the pin. But when I stood up, I said, 'No, I'm just going straight at it.' ""So I hit a really good shot and I heard the crowds. It was close, I could hear that and obviously I put pressure on Michelle. It was just a nice moment."" Hedwall rolled in a four-foot putt for a birdie and the win. Her place in history, and Europe's grip on the Solheim Cup, was secure. It was a moment which saw Hedwall realize the ambitions she had harbored since childhood. ""I remember walking to school and saying, 'Who wants to be a lawyer or a doctor when you can be a professional athlete? Why would you want to do that?' ""So, I always wanted to work within sports and be a professional athlete. I just liked golf the most. When I got picked for the national team I was 14. That was when I realized that maybe this dream could come true."" In order to make her dream a reality, Hedwall headed to the U.S. to play for college golf for Oklahoma State. ""It was just the next step,"" she explained. ""I'd heard that a lot of the older players on the Swedish golf team went over there and liked it. ""I thought it was a good step for me to get experience of not living at home. It was a difficult decision because you are so worried and anxious, is this going to be alright?"" Hedwall could have joined the Ladies European Tour at the age of 17 by virtue of being one of the two top-ranked players on the Swedish circuit. She turned down the chance of a potentially lucrative kickstart to her pro career to play in Oklahoma, a decision she feels has been vindicated. ""I wanted to go to college and it turned out to be a good decision,"" said Hedwall, whose twin sister Jacqueline -- her caddy at the 2011 Solheim -- also played university golf in the U.S. and is now a fledgling pro on the Ladies European Tour. ""I learned a lot, especially grew as a person when I moved in to the States."" Having won five LET events, and three in Australia, Hedwall now is chasing down the big bucks on the money-spinning LPGA Tour. A tournament win on the U.S. circuit is now in her sights. Hedwall has been playing LPGA events since 2008, with a tie for third at this year's Kraft Nabisco Championship -- one of the five majors -- being her best result. She matched that at the Canadian Women's Open a week after the 2013 Solheim. But, just like the girl who achieved her childhood dream of playing professional golf, Hedwall is confident of capturing that elusive first victory. ""I really feel like I'm getting closer and closer,"" she said. ""The Solheim gave me a lot of confidence. ""I think I'm getting closer, hopefully that will happen soon.""","Golfer Caroline Hedwall says she thrived under Solheim Cup pressure .

"(CNN) -- Every politician in America declares concern for the economic crisis of the middle class. But to truly help the middle class, we must take on our nation's exploding economic inequality. Consider two basic facts: Between 1979 and 2007, the top 1% of households captured almost 60% of all income growth in the U.S., yet median wage growth in the 2000s has been flat. In his Kansas speech on the economy this month, President Obama described the growing inequality as the ""defining issue of our time."" He urged America to avoid a race to the bottom and instead to create good, well-paying jobs. The president laid out a series of important steps to restore fairness by repairing the tax and regulatory system, but these strategies are not enough. Nor is improving education; that's obviously important, but it will take many years to have an impact. To make a significant difference for working men and women today and the generations who follow, we must directly take on the unfairness of the job market. The distribution of economic rewards is driven by the jobs people hold, and we have allowed job quality to deteriorate for far too many for far too long. How do we know that a lack of job quality contributes to growing inequality? At the bottom of the labor market, 20% of adults in the U.S. today work in jobs that pay poverty wages, wages that would not raise a family of four above the poverty line, even with full-time, year-round work. Farther up the ladder, jobs have been disassembled. It used to be that a skilled job, either white- or blue-collar, paid decently, provided reasonable benefits and offered security. We left that reality behind long ago. Only about half of jobs in the U.S. today provide pensions. Job security has eroded; many who are laid off face a substantial risk of falling into poverty. Even if laid-off workers are lucky enough to find new jobs, they are forced to take a 20% pay cut, according to my calculations using Census surveys. Being skilled no longer earns decent pay, benefits or security. Any serious effort to address the travails of the middle class must include taking on the challenges of making the job market more fair. But even as politicians lambast Wall Street and propose making taxes more fair, they avoid the challenge of improving job quality. What would that take? For those earning poverty wages, the answer is to raise standards and to enforce them. Today's minimum wage is more than $3 below its value in 1968, after accounting for inflation. Today, too many employers avoid paying overtime to employees who have earned it, and effective enforcement of the law to avoid this wage theft is important. A stronger voice for workers, such as unions, can improve economic outcomes, but the law today is stacked against union organizing. For people still clinging to decent jobs, the challenge is more complicated. We need a new social contract -- between employers and employees. In the past, when many American firms did well, they shared profits and productivity gains with their employees. That is no longer the standard. In the past, CEOs were praised if they showed a commitment to their work forces, if they saw human capital as their key competitive asset. That, too, has changed. We cannot return to the placid labor market of the 1950s and '60s, but we can certainly rekindle a sense of mutual commitment and fairness. What will it take to begin to do all this? Leadership is critical to the solution. Our political and business leaders need to step up. There are plenty of examples of firms that respect their work forces, from Southwest Airlines to SAS software, and their model should be emulated. But it would be naÃ¯ve to think that purely voluntary action and exhortation will turn the tide. For a real shift, we need real policy initiatives. These include increased public support for deepening training, investments in the human capital of the work force, which can come via the tax code and well-designed public-private training programs. Also important are modernized regulations that would make it difficult for employers to use subcontractors in occupations such as building cleaners or security guards and by doing so avoid responsibility for employees who work at their site. Giving employees an even playing field in deciding whether they want to be represented by a union can also make a big difference. In addition, governments can set an example by paying attention to the employment terms of firms that receive government contracts and to which local, state and federal governments contract out services. Even in the current economy, we can afford to make these choices. And if we want to rebuild a strong middle class, we cannot afford to postpone them. The inequality that has steadily grown over the past three decades can't be solved with a quick fix. But until we focus on job quality, we cannot expect any significant progress. Improving the quality of jobs for most Americans over time is the best way to meet the growing popular demand for economic fairness. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of Paul Osterman.","America's exploding economic inequality threatens middle class, says Paul Osterman .

"(CNN) -- The optics, as they say, were good. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov smiled and joked at the Geneva news conference that wrapped up three days of talks on how to dismantle Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. By their own acknowledgment, the framework agreed upon is very ambitious. It will involve ramping up the work of a little-known outfit called the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an organization so little known that Kerry and Lavrov both called it the Organization for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons. The two sides agreed that to keep up the momentum of the process, the normal timetable for the organization's work must be jettisoned. The framework notes that ""the United States and the Russian Federation believe that these extraordinary procedures are necessitated by the prior use of these weapons in Syria,"" carefully not assigning blame for their use. U.S., Russia agree to framework on Syria chemical weapons . So expedited is this process that the Syrian government is expected to provide a full list of its chemical weapons stocks within one week, including their ""location and form of storage, production, and research and development facilities."" Further, ""the elimination process must include the facilities for the development and production of these weapons,"" according to the agreement. The Assad regime may argue that parts of some facilities (such as the Scientific Studies and Research Center in Damascus) have other purposes and would therefore be off-limits to inspectors. That was a regular source of friction between Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq and the UNSCOM inspectors deployed to flush out its weapons of mass destruction. Read the framework of the agreement . One critical part of the deal is that the two sides say they now have a ""shared assessment of the amount and type of chemical weapons involved,"" even though U.S. officials have in recent days given conflicting views on just how much Syria may have and where it may be. For the past few months both Israeli and U.S. sources have indicated that the Assad regime has been dispersing its chemical weapons stocks. But Kerry implied that the regime may have moved its chemical weapons into safer (and therefore more accessible) sites. The two sides also agreed that a U.N. Security Council resolution will be drafted to give international blessing to the OPCW's mission. Kerry said: ""We have committed to impose measures under Chapter VII in the U.N. Security Council."" But no one expects any specific mention in that resolution of the possibility of military action. That option -- at least in a multilateral setting -- is a can being kicked down the road. Russia and the United States have agreed that ""in the event of noncompliance, including unauthorized transfer, or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in Syria, the U.N. Security Council should impose measures under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter."" ""Measures"" can take the form of sanctions as well as military action. The U.S. State Department has used the formula ""consequences for noncompliance,"" and at the news conference Kerry said the response of the international community would have to be commensurate with any violation. Down the track, there may well be heated debate about what is ""commensurate."" Kerry stressed that President Obama still had the right as commander-in-chief to take unilateral action to protect U.S. interests, but said he would not be drawn on what the remedy ""might be for circumstances we don't even know yet."" Keep up with the latest developments in Syria . The agreement insists on ""the immediate and unfettered right to inspect any and all sites in Syria,"" but there are a multitude of ways to obstruct this. What if the regime drew rebel groups into a battle for a critical road artery that then became unusable to the OPCW teams? And who would protect the inspectors? The agreement notes the ""primary responsibility of the Syrian government in this regard."" Other logistical headaches: What sort of transport would be required to move the arsenal out of Syria? Given the regional neighborhood and the fact that the regime is not in control of many border crossings, shipping the agents and equipment out by air may be the preferred option. Interestingly, the agreement specified the possibility ""of consolidation and destruction in the coastal area of Syria,"" an area largely controlled by the government. The greatest obstacle to the process agreed to in Geneva is events on the ground. OPCW inspectors are expected to complete their initial assessment, as well as the destruction of production equipment and mixing and filling equipment, by the end of November. The Kerry-Lavrov agreement aims for ""removal of the largest amounts of weapons feasible, under OPCW supervision, and their destruction outside of Syria, if possible."" The chaotic battle-lines across Syria, and the need for inspectors to visit and secure perhaps as many as 50 sites across the country, may make that task formidable. Still to be established: Who would protect convoys carrying these chemical agents to a central location? Would rebel groups (hardly a coherent force) agree to a ceasefire where chemical weapons are being collected and moved? The rebels' military command has already rejected the idea of a truce. The U.N. inspectors in Iraq spent seven years trying to uncover and destroy its weapons of mass destruction program. There were hundreds of inspectors and technicians on the ground, part of an organization that had backroom staff, the support of the U.N. Security Council and a substantial budget. While Saddam's WMD arsenal was probably much greater than is Syria's, the UNSCOM inspectors were not working in the middle of a civil war. So the Russian-U.S. accord is perhaps understating the magnitude of the task at hand when it talks of ""ambitious goals for the removal and destruction of all categories of chemical weapons-related materials and equipment with the objective of completing such removal and destruction in the first half of 2014."" The glaring ""asterisk"" in the framework agreement is close to the end where both sides ""note that there are details in furtherance of the execution of this framework that need to be addressed on an expedited basis in the coming days."" But the Framework agreement and its annexes represent a remarkable and rapid advance in U.S.-Russian cooperation on Syria. Both Kerry and Lavrov stressed their constant contact on this and many other issues, with the Russian foreign minister pointing out that the agreement showed the United States and Russia could get results. If public appearances are any guide, they have a relaxed and collegial relationship. And both dared to suggest that this agreement might open the window toward an even more ambitious goal, creating the conditions for political negotiations between the Syrian government and opposition. Kerry reiterated in his opening remarks that the Syrian conflict would only be solved by political negotiation. Both he and Lavrov spent time with U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi while in Geneva, the man charged with the hitherto impossible task of bringing the Syrian government and rebels together.

"Tegucigalpa, Honduras (CNN) -- Thousands of black Hondurans paraded through the streets of the capital Friday as the country's president pledged to do more to promote and protect their heritage. About 2,000 Hondurans of African and Caribbean descent -- known as the Garifuna -- came to Tegucigalpa from communities that dot the country's coast for the start of African Heritage Month. They carried 214 drums with them as they marched through the streets -- demanding respect for their rights and honoring the Garifuna's arrival in the Central American country 214 years ago. ""Today we have been here for 214 years making our firm demands, against government repression of the Garifuna communities, against the invasion of our communities' land by landowners and large foreign projects that have sold our property and demanding intercultural, bilingual education,"" said Dr. Luther Castillo, a Garifuna activist. As he kicked off festivities, President Porfirio Lobo announced that he would sign an agreement within six months to give indigenous people and Honduran blacks a preferential right to choose teachers and doctors from their own villages. Garifuna communities have requested such an allowance, which could bring bilingual education into classrooms that once only taught Spanish. ""This should be a reason for us to reflect in order to have a more cohesive society, without any kind of discrimination, with social justice and opportunities for all,"" Lobo said. He predicted that he would be recognized as a defender of the rights of Afro-Hondurans by the end of his term. Government officials said Friday's festivities marked the first time a Honduran president had inaugurated the month. The country's post office also plans to issue stamps commemorating African Heritage Month. Honduras will host a ""World Summit of Afrodescendants"" in August. Ana Pineda, the minister of justice, said the Honduran government is concerned about the rights of the Garifuna and other ethnic groups, pointing to the creation of a government ministry of indigenous and Afro-Honduran people as proof. But activists marching Friday said the government still must do more to recognize their rights. ""The simple act of being this color and speaking the language we speak, we are repressed in this country,"" university student Keldy Bermudez said. ""So we as young Garifuna, we demand our rights to be respected for who we are."" In 2001, the United Nations recognized the language, dance and culture of the Garifuna, who also live in other Central American countries. Journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this report.","NEW: Marchers carry drums and demand government respect for their rights .

"(CNN) -- Li Na made tennis history Friday -- and another entry in the record books is within her reach. Having become the first Chinese player to reach the semifinals of the season-ending WTA Championships, she can become the first Asian to be ranked as high as third in the world if she beats Petra Kvitova on Saturday. Li is currently fifth but has been as high as fourth -- which has only been matched by Japan's Kimiko Date-Krumm, back in the 1990s. Victory over Kvitova will put her above Maria Sharapova, who is absent with a shoulder injury, and Agnieszka Radwanska -- who lost all three matches this week. She ensured there would be no repeat of her two previous disappointments in Istanbul as she defeated injury-hit world No. 2 Victoria Azarenka 6-2 6-1 to win her third successive match in the White Group. ""I know this is not the best way to win the match,"" Li said, referring to the Belorussian's fitness problems. ""I saw her a little bit bothered with her back but she kept playing, so it was very tough for me mentally. ""If she were healthy she would have been a very tough opponent today. Unfortunately she wasn't healthy. I have to enjoy this moment, but I hope the injury isn't too bad and she can come back soon."" Having beaten the 2011 runner-up, Li will next face that year's victor after fourth seed Kvitova battled back to seal her last-four place with a 6-7 (3-7) 6-2 6-3 win over Angelique Kerber. Kvitova finished second in the Red Group behind world No. 1 Serena Williams, who had a rest day after notching up three successive wins in her title defense. The American will face former top-ranked Serbian Jelena Jankovic, whose closing defeat against the already-eliminated Sara Errani of Italy was meaningless following Li's win. Kvitova revealed that she is reaping the benefits of working with a new fitness coach since the U.S. Open, where she exited in the third round. Since then she won the title in Tokyo and lost to Jankovic in the Beijing semis after beating Li in the previous round. ""We had like 14 days of hard work, so I think that it shows on the court,"" the world No. 6 said of her post-New York training regime. ""I felt very confident on the court when I played in Tokyo, which was better, and I played two matches in one day, so I thought that it's going to be tough but I did quite well."" Azarenka, however, has struggled at the tail end of this season -- which she began so brightly at the top of the rankings before beating Li in January's Australian Open final to deny the Chinese player a second grand slam title. ""I served really hard, and I don't know, just really locked my back,"" the U.S. Open finalist said, and then explained why she didn't retire hurt. ""I don't have a tournament next week. The physio told me, 'You're really locked. There is no real structure damage, but you can't fix it that quickly. ""I just wanted to try to do my best for the fans who came and watched our match, for respect for my opponent. It was just about trying to do the most you can out there. ""I think I can learn a lot from these little things to prevent maybe some of the injuries. Some things you cannot, but, you know, for the next year I will be ready, much better, I'm sure about it.""","Li Na to play Petra Kvitova in semifinals of WTA Championships on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Paul Williams, who founded the groundbreaking music magazine Crawdaddy as a 17-year-old student in 1966, has died, according to his wife, singer Cindy Lee Berryhill. ""Rock-writer Paul S Williams, author and creator of CRAWDADDY magazine, (and my husband), passed away last night 10:30 pm PST while his oldest son was holding his hand and by his side,"" Berryhill wrote on Facebook. ""It was a gentle and peaceful passing."" Williams was 64. Williams was a student at Swarthmore College when he put out the first issue of Crawdaddy in January 1966. He was already well-versed in self-publishing, having put out a science fiction fanzine when he was just 14. Crawdaddy was something new in the world of pop music: a magazine that took rock 'n' roll seriously. There had been magazines devoted to folk music -- Broadside and Sing Out!, both of which Williams credited as inspirations -- and there was Downbeat for jazz. But rock 'n' roll was still considered music for kids. The music was less than a decade removed from Frank Sinatra calling it ""sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons."" Williams hadn't been a rock fan long himself, he told rockcritics.com in an interview. ""I was still not taking any of it seriously because I was a folk snob. Then I got really excited about 'Rolling Stones Now!' and the single 'The Last Time,' and the Kinks' 'You Really Got Me' and the Beatles' 'Ticket to Ride,' "" he said. That was 1965. The magazine soon published writers such as Jon Landau, now Bruce Springsteen's manager and confidant; Sandy Pearlman, who produced Blue Oyster Cult; and Richard Meltzer. It also inspired a young man in San Francisco to try his own rock music magazine. His name was Jann Wenner, and his magazine was Rolling Stone. Williams left his magazine at the end of 1968, having grown tired of the business end. He did occasional reviews for Rolling Stone -- he gave the Kinks' ""Village Green Preservation Society"" a rave in 1969 -- as well as an article on science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick. The two became friends, and Williams served as Dick's literary executor when the science-fiction writer died in 1982. He also visited John Lennon and Yoko Ono during their 1969 Montreal bed-in, and sang on ""Give Peace a Chance."" After Dick's death, Williams began the Philip K. Dick Society and edited its newsletter, which became famous as well, according to Williams' website. He continued with music scholarship by writing three books about Bob Dylan and articles on Brian Wilson and Neil Young, the website said. According to the website, Williams suffered a brain injury in a bicycle accident in 1995 and was unable to continue writing.

"(CNN) -- This weekend, Saudi women will once again defy their nation's long-standing driving ban and get behind the wheel, facing harassment, intimidation and arrest. On Saturday, the ""Women2Drive"" campaign will renew Saudi women's demand to exercise their right to drive. In many parts of Saudi Arabia, women are already driving and publishing online videos of themselves in the act. Interestingly, footage has also surfaced of Saudi men driving by and giving the thumbs-up sign to show their support. An informal Saudi ban on driving became official policy in November 1990 during the Gulf War. As female American soldiers based in Saudi Arabia drove freely through military bases, 47 Saudi women organized a convoy to drive the streets of Riyadh in protest against the law that restricted them. Officials arrested them and suspended many from their jobs. The Grand Mufti, the country's most senior religious authority, declared a fatwa, or religious edict, against women driving because driving would expose women ""to temptation"" and lead to ""social chaos."" Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz, then minister of interior, issued a decree on the basis of the fatwa banning driving for women. The Grand Mufti who issued the fatwa died in 1999, as Prince Nayef did in 2012, but the ban has remained. When King Abdullah came to power in 2005, he said he believed that, ""the day will come when women drive."" That day might have arrived. Saudi Arabia issues warning to women drivers, protesters . Saudi women launched the online ""Women2Drive"" campaign in 2011, perhaps inspired by women in Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Libya who stood shoulder to shoulder with men during uprisings to overthrow dictators and fight for freedom. They declared that starting on June 17, 2011, women with international drivers' licenses should take to the roads. Scores drove, and many were stopped by traffic police. Their male guardians were forced to sign pledges that they would not allow the women to drive again. One woman was sentenced to 10 lashes; later an appeals court overturned her sentence. Recently, Saudi Arabia has made several small advances in women's rights. Women can stand as candidates and vote in municipal elections, next due in 2015. They can work in various sectors without approval from their male guardians. The king has appointed 30 women to the Shura Council, his 150-member senior advisory body. Saudi Arabia has also recently passed a law criminalizing domestic violence. Despite these advances, Saudi women continue to face profound discrimination. The guardianship system still treats them as legal minors who cannot conduct official government business, travel abroad, marry, pursue higher education or undergo certain medical procedures without permission from their male guardians -- a husband, father, brother or even a young son. Two leading women's rights activists, Wajeha al-Huwaider and Fawzia al-Oyouni, who have also fought the driving ban, face imprisonment for trying to help a woman who said that her husband had locked her and her children in their home without food or water. Saudi blogger detained, but hopeful about campaign allowing women to drive . The ban on driving may not be the most limiting form of discrimination for some Saudi women, yet it has become symbolic of a much deeper oppression that touches all aspects of women's lives in the kingdom: It has become for Saudi women what a bus seat was to Rosa Parks and other African-Americans in the 1950s. To explain why women cannot drive, Saudi authorities often use the excuse that ""society is not ready."" Yet on occasion, King Abdullah has chosen to ignore such arguments and sidestep the religious establishment. He opened the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology in 2009 as the first mixed-gender university in the kingdom. Then he fired a cleric on the Council of Senior Scholars, the highest state body for the interpretation of Islamic law, when the man spoke out against the mixing of men and women at the university. Recently, a cleric presented a new excuse to prohibit driving for women: he asserted that ""driving affects women's ovaries."" While this absurd contention is unsubstantiated by any medical or scientific evidence, it may be significant in Saudi discourse because it seems to separate the prohibition on driving from Islamic law, or Sharia, claiming women shouldn't drive because of health risks, rather than any religious prohibition. Even the head of the religious police stated in September that Sharia has no text forbidding women from driving. In short, the Saudi government, having ratified the U.N. Convention on All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, is obliged to treat women equally and not enforce a discriminatory policy. As Saudi women take to the roads again, the world should join them in demanding an end to this denial of basic rights. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rothna Begum.","Rothna Begum: Saudi women to renew right-to-drive campaign this weekend .

"(CNN) -- If the reports of a proposed $13 billion settlement between the Justice Department and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are correct, the public and the company's shareholders will not see justice done. While the tentative deal is being portrayed as a larger settlement, it really represents the company coming forward with an additional $9 billion. The other $4 billion represents loan workouts that JPMorgan would do anyway to reduce its losses on mortgages that would otherwise cause it greater losses through foreclosure. From the perspective of the company's shareholders, the problems amount to an even bigger loss because of alleged fraud. The full $13 billion would represent a loss to the shareholders, and JPMorgan estimates its future increased legal and investigative costs for its past scandals at $9.2 billion. And so, it will cost JPMorgan's shareholders heavily to buy what could well be a ""get out of jail free"" card from DOJ for wrongdoers at JPMorgan and the banks it purchased. While the reported settlement wouldn't close down a federal investigation based in California, it remains to be seen whether it will target any current employees of JPMorgan. A settlement of this kind would release JPMorgan and its officers from civil and criminal liability for a wide range of alleged frauds. Many of these alleged frauds added to the profits of JPMorgan and the companies it acquired. The shareholders should not be enriched by fraud. Where officers' frauds created profits that enriched the shareholders, JPMorgan should fire such officers, and the Justice Department should prosecute and recover any fraud proceeds. JPMorgan should pay the damages it caused to others through fraud. In cases where a firm's senior officers engage in a wide range of frauds, the courts should award punitive damages against the officers and the firm. CNN Money: Five things to know about JP Morgan settlement . The problem in terms of justice is when the frauds created fictional profits that enriched corporate officers through unjust bonuses but also created real losses that were booked by the company years later. The shareholders suffer twice from such frauds -- they paid the unjust bonuses and then have to bear the losses. The shareholders' losses are compounded by the legal fees, which are primarily driven by the desire to keep the officers from being prosecuted or their unjust bonuses recovered, and by the fine. The appropriate policy would be for JPMorgan to fire such officers and for DOJ to prosecute them and recover their unjust bonuses. There is a triple failure of accountability for officers of Wall Street companies. DOJ failed to prosecute any elite Wall Street banker for the frauds that drove the financial crisis. The banks have failed to fire and ""claw back"" the compensation of the officers who led these massive frauds. We cannot deter frauds when we do not prosecute them, fire those responsible or recover the wealth they gained through fraud. JPMorgan's supporters argue that the settlement is unjust for two reasons. First, they argue that DOJ is engaged in a ""vendetta"" designed to shrink JPMorgan's size to the point that it no longer poses a ""systemic"" risk to the global economy. Dick Bove, a Wall Street analyst, made the vendetta and shrinkage claims without presenting any supporting evidence. I wish that it were true that the U.S. government was requiring the systemically dangerous institutions (the ""too big to fail"" banks) to shrink to the point that their failures will no longer cause a global financial crisis. The Bush and Obama administrations have refused to require these huge institutions to shrink. The Dodd-Frank Act does not require them to shrink and though it gives the regulators power to require these companies to shrink, they have refused to use the power. No DOJ settlement requires any of these institutions to shrink. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's CEO, was an early and strong supporter of President Barack Obama (though he became critical of the administration subsequently), so he is an unlikely vendetta target. Second, JPMorgan's supporters argue it is unjust for the Justice Department to hold JPMorgan financially liable for the damages caused by the frauds of the two enormous failed banks it acquired: Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. It's true that the Bush administration did encourage JPMorgan to buy Bear Stearns and WaMu. The owners are liable for the liabilities of companies they buy. Any other rule would leave victims of misconduct and fraud unable to recover their losses. Dimon knew that acquirers of failed banks can refuse to buy unless the FDIC agrees to bear the banks' liabilities for fraud. Dimon appeared eager to buy WaMu and Bear Stearns despite their terrible reputations and their collapse. Bear Stearns was notorious in the finance industry, inspiring the phrase: ""Bear Don't Care."" Yet Dimon chose not to insist that the FDIC retain the banks' fraud liabilities or indemnify JPMorgan against losses because of those alleged frauds. First, the purchase price would have increased substantially if the FDIC had to bear the banks' fraud liabilities. Second, Dimon knew that if the FDIC offered broad indemnification, rival banks could outbid JPMorgan and buy the banks. Without doing the due diligence essential to judging the banks' fraud liabilities, Dimon likely decided that the purchase prices were so low that it was better to buy them immediately without indemnification. It would be unjust to allow Dimon to change the deal five years later because his business decision proved disastrous.

"(CNN) -- Newtown, Connecticut, resident David Ackert is worried about the spike in the number of pistol permits sought in his small town after a gunman massacred children and adults at an elementary school there last December. ""I am concerned that it can get out of hand,"" he said. ""You only have two hands. How many guns can you fire at once?"" His concern prompted him to create the Newtown Action Alliance in the wake of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary that claimed the lives of 20 children, all aged 6 or 7, and six adults. Its mission: to reduce gun violence. ""Gun control isn't in the lexicon. What we're about is gun safety and anti-gun violence,"" Ackert, who doesn't own a gun and doesn't intend to, told CNN in a recent interview in Newtown. In the months since Adam Lanza shot through the doors of the elementary school and targeted children in classrooms, the demand for guns in this western Connecticut city has jumped. As recently reported by the Wall Street Journal, the Newtown Police Department issued 171 pistol permits in 2012. As of August 8 this year, it has issued 209 permits, already a 22% increase over last year's total. If applications continue at this rate, Newtown is on track to double the amount of pistol permits it issued last year. Five things to know about guns . And while government data show the number of Americans who own guns has been declining for several decades, experts say we are now seeing more guns in the hands of fewer Americans. ""I think it's a little bit of a reaction to what's going on both here and across America where I think the gun owners are seeing there is this huge outcry in the U.S. to reduce gun violence and there's a perception that the government is going to come and grab all their guns, or is not going to allow them to purchase certain guns,"" said Monte Frank, another Newtown resident who's also a member of the Newtown Action Alliance. That's one reason why Nancy Elis -- a widow, grandmother and former Newtown resident who's never owned a gun -- applied for a permit to buy one in January. She lived in Newtown for 28 years before recently moving to the nearby town of Southbury. ""Fear did not prompt me,"" she said of applying for the permit, which she finally got in May. ""When I started to hear all the gun control talk, that's what prompted me,"" Elis said, adding that she's looking to buy her first firearm now because she wants to be able to protect herself in her home, if needed. It was also a reaction to the tougher gun laws the state of Connecticut passed in April, she explained. ""Our rights are being slowly infringed upon and that this whole idea of controlling guns has come to my backdoor. In other words, there may be a time when I may never be able to get a firearm,"" said Elis. The new gun legislation in Connecticut is among the toughest in the nation. It adds more than 100 guns to its list of banned assault weapons and limits the capacity of magazines to 10 rounds. It also mandates the creation of the nation's first statewide registry of people convicted of crimes involving the use or threat of a dangerous weapon, among other things. Newtown-based firearm trade group sues for repeal of Connecticut gun law . The new laws in Connecticut prompted Ryan Delp to buy another gun this year. ""I thought it was 100% certain they were going to pass more strict gun laws,"" said Delp, a Newtown resident who owns multiple guns but didn't want to discuss what types of firearms he has. For him, it's a matter of protecting his wife and two children. ""I don't criticize police departments, they simply can't be everywhere. Just like Sandy Hook, they couldn't be everywhere,"" he said. ""So I think at the end of the day, an individual has to take responsibility for themselves."" Delp believes Connecticut's new gun laws put residents in danger. ""The restriction on magazines is a real threat to people who are law abiding citizens that just want to protect themselves and their family."" Gilles Rousseau, whose daughter, Lauren, was among the victims at Sandy Hook, said the increase in pistol permits in Newtown is ""sad, it's really sad."" ""It makes me sad to think that people, they think they're protecting themselves, but they're just adding to the problem."" Lauren Rousseau was a substitute teacher at the elementary school. Her family says her lifelong dream was to be a teacher. ""It doesn't compute in my brain that you buy more guns because somebody got shot at the school,"" her father said, adding that he had his first dream about his daughter just last week -- the first since she died. ""That doesn't change anything. It's going to make things worse."" Gun demand surges nationwide . The National Shooting Sports Foundation says there have been 38 straight months of increased gun sales in the United States. In Connecticut, the number of background checks for potential gun purchases rose nearly 53% from the six months before the Newtown mass shooting to the six months after. FBI statistics show the number of background checks it conducts nationwide has also steadily increased over the last three years. In 2012, the FBI conducted 19,592,303 background checks on potential gun buyers, compared with 14,409,616 in 2010. But, the FBI notes, ""a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale"" because of differing state laws. According to the most recent data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, roughly 6.5 million guns were manufactured in the United States in 2011, nearly a million more than in 2010. Has the moment passed? Why gun control push fizzled . Tragedy spurs gun sales . In the year following the January 2011 mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona -- in which 20 people, including congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, were shot and six people were killed -- the number of background checks for potential gun purchases conducted by the FBI in Arizona increased by nearly 50,000 from 2010. There was a similar spike in Colorado following the mass shooting at an Aurora movie theater in July 2012 in which 12 people were killed and 58 were injured. The number of FBI background checks for those attempting to buy a gun in Colorado increased 44% from the year before the Aurora shooting to the year following it. Back in Newtown, Monte Frank says he wants to educate people about gun violence. He doesn't want his city to be remembered only for the senseless shooting that happened there. ""We have a real desire here to be remembered as the place that made a difference in the world. I think we make a difference in the world by transforming our culture and trying to change the gun culture in a positive way so we can reduce the risk of another Sandy Hook occurring,"" Frank explained. ""My heart breaks for them. It truly does,"" says Nancy Elis, referring to the victims of the Newtown shooting and their families. But, she says, ""Did the guns cause the tragedy? No. It is the person behind the gun that caused the tragedy.""

"(CNN) -- Nearly $200 million in federal funding will be awarded to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for repairs after Superstorm Sandy, according to a statement Sunday from U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer's office. Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, both New York Democrats, announced that the Department of Transportation is providing $195.7 million in funds for infrastructure repairs needed after the storm damaged the region's rail systems and infrastructure, according to the statement. An estimated $141.5 million of the money will go to the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation Commuter Rail, and an estimated $54.2 million will go to the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the statement says. Damage from Sandy has cost the Port Authority $2 billion to return the agency's airports, rail system, bridges and tunnels to service. Gillibrand said the devastation to the region's mass transit and infrastructure was ""unprecedented"" and that the funding is critical to help recover and rebuild. The PATH rail system suffered damage from the millions of gallons of saltwater that flooded the tunnels between New York and New Jersey, the statement says. In the storm's aftermath, PATH trains had to operate on a limited basis. The World Trade Center also sustained significant damage. That portion of the funding will go to the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, which is set to open in 2015. It will be home to the PATH system and will connect 13 subway lines and link pedestrians to the World Financial Center. The federal funding is part of the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013, providing relief to communities, families and businesses damaged by Superstorm Sandy. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is critical to the region's trade and transportation network. It includes America's busiest airport system, marine terminals and ports, the PATH rail transit system, six tunnels and bridges between New York and New Jersey, the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan and the World Trace Center, according to its website.","The Department of Transportation to give the Port Authority nearly $200 million .

"(CNN) -- For a century, the bedrock principle of our tax code has been progressivity: The rich pay a larger share of income than the middle class and poor. Yet Mitt Romney's revelation that he paid 14% in federal income taxes on more than $40 million in income in 2010 and 2011 reveals an increasingly open secret: Progressivity is dead for the superrich. It also suggests that the main argument made by Romney and others for this highly unequal state of affairs -- that it's essential to spur job creation and economic growth -- is false. Romney is fabulously wealthy because he is a hard worker and a smart businessman, to be sure. (Being the child of a smart businessman certainly doesn't hurt either.) Yet there's also no question that Romney has benefited enormously from the growing tilt of the tax code toward the nation's highest earners. The code used to impose higher and higher rates all the way up the income ladder. Today, the very richest generally pay no more than the modestly well-to-do. And indeed, many of the superrich are paying lower rates. Warren Buffet has said he pays less in taxes as a share of income than the people who work for him. The issue isn't just declining rates at the top. Just as crucial, politicians have also shifted the code away from taxing income from assets. Payroll taxes are up; capital gains taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, dividend taxes -- all way down. Since the superrich get much of their income this way, federal taxes on the superrich are way down too. From the mid-1990s to the eve of the recession, according to the IRS, the effective federal income tax rate on the richest 400 taxpayers declined from roughly 30% to around 16%, a change worth an average of more than $45 million a year for every taxpayer in the top 400. This is not manna from heaven; it means higher taxes for everyone else, cuts in valued things that government does, or deficits. And while every income group has seen its effective federal taxes go down, the drop has been far steeper at the top, even as the top has pulled dramatically away from the rest of Americans. Romney, like much of America's financial elite, argues that this is just good economics. Tax capital less, the argument goes, and you encourage innovation and investment. The argument sounds reasonable, but the evidence for it is scarce. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has found no significant economic benefits from the favorable tax treatment of capital gains. On the other hand, targeted tax-cutting for the rich has certainly spurred one form of innovation and investment: ever more creative strategies by lawyers and lobbyists to rewire the tax code and reshuffle rich people's incomes so that their earnings show up as lightly taxed capital gains, not the wages and salaries on which the rest of American workers rely. When Romney was at Bain Capital, for example, he and his associates would aggressively load companies up with debt and then reap big short-term gains that depended on tax provisions allowing investors to write off interest on company debt. Even more telling, Romney is taxed so lightly in part because of a longstanding bug in the tax code that deep-pocketed lobbyists have managed to preserve. Unlike most finance professionals, he and other hedge fund and private equity managers get to treat a big part of the fees they earn from managing other people's money as ""carried interest,"" subject to the capital gains rate, not the much higher income rate. This egregious loophole didn't matter when private equity was rare and capital gains were taxed more or less like other income. Now, as Romney can attest, it matters a lot. With carried interest accounting for a quarter of his income over the last two years, Romney saved about $2.5 million from this tax break alone. In short, the tax cuts of the last few decades look less like general economic boosters and more like economic smart bombs delivering payloads of cash to their carefully selected recipients. The big winners have not been the highly educated and skilled in general, but financial and nonfinancial executives who make up six in 10 of the top one-tenth of 1% of earners. Meanwhile, most small businesses, entrepreneurs and self-employed businesspeople have, like Warren Buffet's employees, been left out of the tax-cutting spree. Listening to the apocalyptic rhetoric about small businesses that would be crushed by ending the Bush tax cuts for top earners, for example, one would never know that only about 3% of taxpayers claiming small-business income would be affected by raising the top rate. And many of those that would are hedge funds, law firms and rich individuals filing as corporations -- not your typical image of a small business. Actually, Romney's own business career makes the point better. No one seems to have noticed it, but Romney worked those long hours and made those risky bets mostly during a decade-long period when capital gains were taxed at the same rate as labor income. For a brief shining moment, the 1986 Tax Reform Act that Romney's icon Ronald Reagan supported interrupted the steady decline of capital gains taxes and restored the simple idea that all income should be taxed equally. That is to say, Romney's own success suggests that low capital gains rates aren't necessary to encourage the kind of entrepreneurship that Romney now celebrates. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter .

"Austin, Texas (CNN)  -- Who: William ""whurley"" Hurley of Austin, Texas . What's with the nickname: It's an abbreviation of his name and the title of his personal blog. Why you might know him: He worked in research and development at Apple and IBM, owns a handful of patents and is considered an influential tech thinker. His mobile-app company, Chaotic Moon Studios, built the interactive ""Grover and the Monster at the End of the Book"" for ""Sesame Street"" and recently launched the iPad application for News Corp.'s tablet publication, The Daily. He likes the South by Southwest Interactive festival, where we caught up with him: Chaotic Moon Studios launched last year at SXSW. Hurley, one of its co-founders, has been attending the festival since 1993. How Chaotic Moon develops products: ""We're actually designing the app in our imaginations now and then backing that up and going out to these manufacturers with what we need. We're starting to see things progress at such a fast pace. Literally every year there's a new iPhone, there's a new thing, and that gives us -- with the proper planning -- time to think about the limitations of the device, build out something and know that the devices will eventually catch up. Or possibly we could even influence to catch up to it sooner."" His thoughts on innovation: ""If you think about the progress of technology, at what point do we hit that glass ceiling? There are people I know that would have said 3-D is a wall, and now we've broken past that. It's our job as technologists to drive forward past those walls, and that requires something that is close to me, which is better education of people,"" he said. ""That is what prevents us from hitting that wall."" Why he favors an online resource where app developers could access and share information: ""Why not take and open source some of that and make it a communal process? Instead of rewriting 80% of the software that is the same on all of those applications, why not focus on the 20% that makes it different and really worthwhile to the user?"" Why he thinks mobile computing will be even bigger in 2012: ""When we were here (at SXSW) last year, we heard it was going to be the year of the tablet. You expected to see not just tablets, but customized tablets for verticals, medical and restaurants and all these different things, and that really hasn't happened. ""So next year I think you're going to see yet another increase in mobile, because for computing to become ubiquitous and pervasive, clearly we have to take it with us. And everyone wants to be new and novel by doing mobile stuff, but the reality is that everything will eventually be mobile or at least have a mobile competent."" Hurley also hopes to see more applications that allow you to share information across devices, such as an app for your TV that syncs with your tablet and your phone.","CNN chats with tech innovator William Hurley at the South by Southwest Interactive festival .

"(CNN) -- Salman Rushdie will always be most famous for ""The Satanic Verses,"" the 1988 novel that earned the author a death warrant from the late Ayatollah Khomeini. But for literary merit alone, some rate the earlier ""Midnight's Children"" as Rushdie's greatest work. Now, the classic novel is hitting the movie screen in an adaptation by Rushdie himself. The author's first foray into screenwriting was not an easy assignment, he admits. After all, the book encompasses 30 years of India's history, from independence from Britain in 1947 to the turbulent rule of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. CNN spoke with the renowned writer about the cinematic rendering of his book, directed by Deepa Mehta (out in limited release now). Below is an edited version of the conversation. CNN: ""Midnight's Children"" was published in 1981. It took a long time to become a movie. Had you always wanted it to be made into a film? Salman Rushdie: I never had a real desperate need for it to be a film. I was quite happy for it to just be a book, and actually, I had sort of given up on the idea there would be a film because of how long it had been since the book came out. (I had) this serendipitous conversation with Deepa Mehta where we actually met to talk about other things, and it suddenly popped into her head to ask about ""Midnight's Children."" I had known her for a while, and she had spoken to me very passionately about her feeling for the book and what it had meant to her when she read it and how it connected to her own experiences. I thought, well, that's valuable, because it means that that's not just a gig. It's not just taking the job in order to adapt this film, but it becomes a personal project, and that's what I felt made her the right person to (direct). CNN: How satisfied are you with the translation to this new medium? Rushdie: I'm actually delighted, but on the other hand, I'm scarcely objective, you know, because I wrote the film and I narrate the film, and I was very, very involved at every stage of it. I was involved in the casting. I was even involved in talking to the production designer, showing him photographs of (my) childhood and trying to get him to make the film look right. I was involved in the cutting room. So if the film is no good, it's my fault too, but if it is any good, I can take a bit of the credit. One of the things I like is that young people in the audience have found it easy to connect to their lives. It doesn't feel like a period piece. I worried that this is a story which ends in 1977 and might feel to a lot of people like ancient history. But I just think that there is something about the way in which small individual lives are impacted by the great events of history which is easy for us to connect to now when the great events of history, almost on a daily basis, assault our individual lives. CNN: How challenging did you find it to write the screenplay? Rushdie: Well, of course it's challenging, but, you know, all writing is challenging. Writing is difficult; one should just say that. What I found interesting writing a screenplay as opposed to writing a novel is not the obvious thing, which is having to pare everything down and find the kind of essence, the skeleton if you like, which can then be fleshed out by performance and cinematography. That, of course, you have to do. But I think the thing that's really different and very interesting is that when you're writing for the screen, you have to be hyper-conscious every moment of how the audience is going to react. If you write just one scene where the audience is confused or it breaks their concentration in some way, then you've lost them, and you might never get them back. You're really thinking all the time of what you have to do to make sure that they have the information that they need, that the emotional thread is not snapped, that the story moves at the right speed, to keep the audience hopefully sitting on the edge of their seats or else weeping or laughing. Any of those is good. CNN: You narrate the film. That's interesting, because you haven't chosen to record many of the audio versions of your books. Rushdie: I've done bits -- ""Haroun and the Sea of Stories."" I did my collection of short stories, but it's not the same thing, you know. Reading is a very different thing than performing. In fact, one of the things I think that doesn't work in books on tape is if the person doing the reading ""acts"" too much; it becomes irritating to you listening to it. So reading is a different place, a different voice, and (""Midnight's Children"") after all was not me reading the book; it was me performing the part of the older Saleem looking back at his younger life. It's a first-person narrative, first-person voiceover, and it's his first person, not mine. So this involved a tiny bit of acting. CNN: Most people don't like the sound of their own voice. How was that for you? Rushdie: Well, I was really worried because one of the things I felt is the real strength of the film is that we have a wonderful cast which turns in wonderful performances, and I didn't want to be the one who didn't. I didn't want to be like the amateur amongst a group of great professionals, and that worried me. One of the things I know about Deepa is that she is a great director of non-professional actors. She's really good at guiding you at what to do -- a bit faster, a bit slower, a bit more of this and a bit less of that -- and I think all you have to do is be good at taking the direction and responding to it. I told her that if I was embarrassed by the results, I would want to fire myself and find an actor, but in the end, people seemed to like it, so it stayed in. CNN: The film has played in India. What was the reaction like? Rushie: It was very emotional to take it there, particularly showing it in Bombay, which is where I was born and raised. (It) is the great movie city and, in many ways, is the city out of whose spirit the novel was born. To take the movie back did feel like closing a big circle. I think Indian audiences reacted very emotionally to it. They loved it. There was a moment we showed it at the Kerala Film Festival, and when in the film the emergency rule period -- the authoritarian period of Mrs. Gandhi's sort of semi-dictatorship in the mid-'70s -- comes to an end, there's a line in the voiceover where I say, ""The emergency was over."" People in the theaters jumped to their feet, started applauding, because it meant that much to them, too. CNN: Do you think ""Midnight's Children"" will play in Pakistan? Rushdie: I doubt it, truthfully. It has been invited to the film festival in Dhaka in Bangladesh, so it seems like that's not a problem. And it's already opened in a number of countries with very large Muslim populations: It's been played in Malaysia, and I think it's due to open very soon in Indonesia and Thailand, so it's getting around. Pakistan, I don't know. Pakistan's a mess. CNN: I know you met E.M. Forster late in his life. There have been some wonderful adaptations of his books by the late Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. When you look at films adapted from great novels, do any come to your mind that were particularly successful? Rushdie: I actually have taught a course in that at Emory University, where I have a part-time professorship. I think you could name certainly the ones you mentioned: Ruth Jhabvala's adaptations of Forster. Actually, I thought Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Edith Wharton's ""Age of Innocence"" was really very successful. I really thought it was a wonderful film. I think one of the great examples is Visconti's film of ""The Leopard,"" a great Italian novel, which is actually one of the films we thought a lot about (in making ""Midnight's Children"") because it does something that we were also trying to do, which is to take big historical events -- revolution in Italy -- and against that quite epic background, set the intimate story of a particular family. I think actually Volker SchlÃ¶ndorff's film of Gunter Grass' great novel ""The Tin Drum"" is pretty successful. John Huston's film of James Joyce's story ""The Dead."" I mean, I think you can find a best-case scenario in which the film does just fine compared to the book.","Salman Rushdie adapted his novel ""Midnight's Children""

"Washington (CNN) -- There is little evidence the U.S. government's sweeping collection of phone records, as revealed by admitted intelligence leaker Edward Snowden, has helped prevent terror attacks as national security officials have claimed, a top senator said on Wednesday. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy opened a hearing on the controversial National Security Agency (NSA) program applied under post 9/11 anti-terror legislation and approved by a secret court by questioning if it works or is needed. ""If this program is not effective, it has to end,"" the Vermont Democrat said of the phone record collection program under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. He noted that classified details provided by the NSA on how the initiative had been used do not ""reflect dozens or even several terrorist plots"" that it helped prevent ""let alone 54 as some have suggested."" Despite Leahy's complaint, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander later Wednesday repeated the figure of 54 terrorist events thwarted by the overall surveillance effort, of which the Section 215 program is one component. ""If we tell everyone exactly what we're doing, then the adversaries will know exactly how to get through our defenses,"" he told a conference in warning of the danger caused by Snowden's leaks. Published reports have indicated the NSA received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of so-called metadata from telecommunications giant Verizon and leading Internet companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook. NSA chief: Snooping is crucial to fighting terrorism . This includes ""non-content"" material -- phone numbers called, or e-mail addresses -- rather than the actual substance of the information, which would require a separate search warrant. Senate Intelligence Chairman Dianne Feinstein said her panel was looking at potential changes to the surveillance programs, including a reduction in the five-year limit that the NSA currently can can hold gathered records. Feinstein, a California Democrat, said the Senate also was considering a requirement for the NSA to expedite its review of information it collects under the Section 215 program and another one that gathers Internet use information from abroad. ""These are things that can be done to increase transparency, but not to stop the program,"" she said. ""I believe, based on what I have seen and I read intelligence regularly, that we would place this nation in jeopardy if we eliminated these two programs."" Meanwhile, the Guardian in London published a report on an NSA program that it says mines Internet browsing history and other online data, some of it in real time. The program called XKeyscore, which does not require any type of formal authorization, was detailed in documents leaked to the newspaper by Snowden, the Guardian said Wednesday. Snowden's revelations have triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests, and about the secretive legal process that sets in motion surveillance. With lawmakers sharpening scrutiny of how the law is applied and the House narrowly defeating an amendment to cut surveillance funding last week, the Obama administration is scrambling to demonstrate more transparency and regain congressional support. Earlier this month, it declassified and publicized the NSA program's periodic renewal. On Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper released other previously secret documents, including reports from the 2009 to 2011 period. Report: FBI wanted to fly Snowden's father to Moscow . The Justice Department reports were aimed at helping Congress understand the surveillance as lawmakers debated renewing relevant parts of the Patriot Act. ""The National Security Agency's bulk collection programs provide important tools in the fight against terrorism, especially in identifying terrorist plots against the homeland,"" the 2011 report said. ""These tools are also unique in that they can produce intelligence not otherwise available to NSA."" Snowden's father: My son loves his country . At Wednesday's hearing, Justice Department and security officials conceded the lack of direct causal links between the Section 215 phone record collection and thwarted attacks, but said the program was part of a crucial network for filling information gaps. Opinion: We need transparency on domestic surveillance . They said the network of surveillance programs over the years helped thwart dozens of plots, including those targeting the stock exchange and the subway system in New York. In another apparent bid to demonstrate transparency, the Obama administration now says terror defendants should be informed when the government plans to use as evidence any information from its secret collection of electronic records. The change in legal interpretation this week suggests that criminal defendants subject to certain types of surveillance may be able to challenge the constitutionality of the NSA programs. As recently as this spring, the administration had argued that such disclosure of information from a secret court order was not necessary, even if the information was used to track and capture a suspect. The Supreme Court in its last term limited lawsuits against the government by plaintiffs who were unable to prove they were specific subjects of surveillance. Those plaintiffs had complained of a ""Catch 22"" because the government refused to acknowledge any surveillance for national security reasons. It was not clear if other pending terror prosecutions involving metadata evidence would adopt the new legal interpretation. CNNMoney: NSA chief to hackers: If you don't like what we do, change it . But the latest efforts in transparency were clouded by the Guardian report on XKeyscore, which it said magnified statements by Snowden that he, as a contractor, could easily access an astonishingly broad menu of personal information on just about anyone. Security officials had called Snowden's assertion untrue, and White House spokesman Jay Carney echoed that denial on Wednesday by saying allegations of ""widespread, unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data are false."" Separately, the NSA said in a statement that its tools include stringent checks to limit what an analyst can do. ""Not every analyst can perform every function and no analyst can operate freely,"" the statement said. At the Senate committee hearing, Leahy asked NSA Deputy Director John Inglis whether the agency has held anyone responsible for the Snowden leaks. ""How soon will we know who screwed up?"" Leahy asked, contending that inadequate controls allowed the former NSA contractor to leak surveillance program documents to media outlets. ""I think that we'll know over weeks and months precisely what happened and who should then be hold accountable -- and we will hold them accountable,"" Inglis responded. House rejects effort to curb NSA phone surveillance . Leahy was impatient with the answer and raised the issue in connection with former Army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning, who was convicted on Tuesday of leaking a trove of Iraq war battlefield reports, diplomatic cables and other information. ""We had a huge security breach, I think we'll all agree, committed by Edward Snowden. And a few years ago Bradley Manning downloaded hundreds of thousands of classified and sensitive documents -- passed them on to WikiLeaks,"" Leahy said. ""Now, if two data breaches of this magnitude occurred in the private sector, somebody would have been held accountable by now."" Snowden has fled the country and remains in diplomatic limbo at the Moscow airport. The United States has charged him with espionage. Opinion: NSA secrets kill our trust . CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: NSA director repeats his statement that surveillance network thwarted 54 terror plots .

"(CNN) -- A federal court has sentenced two Minnesota women to lengthy prison sentences for soliciting donations in the name of charity, then funneling the funds to Somali militants. Authorities said the two women went door-to-door in Somali neighborhoods in the U.S. and Canada, seeking contributions. Amina Farah Ali, 36, got two decades in prison on 13 terror-related counts that include providing material support to Al-Shabaab. Hawo Mohamed Hassan, 66, got half of that on one count of conspiracy to support a terror group and lying to authorities. Both women, naturalized U.S. citizens from Somalia, were convicted in October 2011. They were sentenced Thursday in Minneapolis. Evidence presented at their trial showed they supported the terror group between 2008 and 2009, according to B. Todd Jones, a United States Attorney. Teleconference appeal for Al-Shabaab . ""Ali communicated by telephone with Somalia-based members of Al-Shabaab who requested financial assistance on behalf of the group,"" Jones said in a statement. ""Ali often sought the money under false pretenses, contending that it was to help the poor."" In both years, authorities said, she hosted teleconferences and urged listeners to give money to the terror group instead of the poor. In one instance, she recorded $2,100 in pledges at the conclusion of that teleconference, according to officials. She would then funnel the funds to the terror group using various remittance companies under false names. 'Questioned by the enemy' Ali has maintained that the funds were for the poor, but authorities said monitored phone calls reveal otherwise. ""On July 14, 2009, the day after the FBI executed a search warrant at Ali's home, she telephoned her primary Al-Shabaab contact, saying, ""I was questioned by the enemy here . . . they took all my stuff and are investigating it . . . do not accept calls from anyone."" Hassan, on the other hand, made false statements when questioned by federal agents about international terrorism, Jones said. From Minneapolis to Somalia . The sentencing Thursday is the latest in federal investigation in Minneapolis -- home to the nation's largest Somali population. The women were among a group sentenced this week in the federal government's probe focusing on Al-Shabaab, which is believed to recruit young men in the Minneapolis area. The U.S. has designated it a terrorist group, and has said it has ties to al Qaeda. In recent years, about 20 Somali-American men have traveled from the area to Somalia to train with the terror group, and some have gone on to fight with the militants, according to U.S. officials.","Authorities say they went door-to-door in Somali neighborhoods, seeking donations .

"(CNN) -- With the strength of Bashar al-Assad's forces diminishing in Syria's civil war, global fears are mounting that Syria might unleash chemical weapons to quash the country's uprising. The government insists it would never use chemical weapons on its own people. But world leaders say Syria's desperation could lead to even more tragedy in the war-torn country. So what exactly are chemical weapons, and what could they do to the human body? A primer: . --What kinds of weapons are we talking about? Military analysts believe Syria may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world. Specifically, the supply could include sarin, mustard and VX gases. U.S. intelligence indicates Syria has mixed chemical compounds needed to make sarin -- a deadly agent that can quickly kill thousands. Opinion: Don't wait for Syria to cross the 'red line' --How do these chemicals affect the body? Sarin gas is an odorless nerve agent that can cause convulsions, paralysis and respiratory failure. Nerve agents are the most toxic and rapidly acting of the known chemical warfare agents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sarin quickly evaporates from liquid to vapor form and disperse into the environment. It also mixes easily with water and can poison a water supply. VX is another nerve agent that can be lethal when inhaled. It can also be dispersed in a liquid form; even a few small drops on the skin can lead to the same effects as sarin gas. ""Compared with the nerve agent sarin (also known as GB), VX is considered to be much more toxic by entry through the skin and somewhat more toxic by inhalation,"" the CDC said. Mustard gas -- also known as sulfur mustard -- leaves chemical burns on the skin, eyes and even the lungs when inhaled. It was commonly used in World War I. While mustard gas can be fatal, it also can disable victims and can cause cancer or permanent blindness. Syria's endgame in sight as rebels advance . --How are chemical weapons deployed? Syria could deliver chemical agents through a variety of ammunition, such as bombs dropped from aircraft, Scud surface-to-surface missiles, artillery shells or rockets, according to Jeffrey White of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. --How long do the dangers linger? A person's clothing can emit sarin for about 30 minutes after exposure to sarin vapor, which can lead to exposure of other people, the CDC said. Sarin can also be ingested though contaminated food. VX gas evaporates very slowly, at about the same rate as motor oil. As with sarin, it can also be emitted from clothing for up to half an hour after exposure. Sulfur mustard, however, can stay in the environment for a few days under average weather conditions and up to months under very cold conditions, according to the CDC. --How devastating can chemical attacks get? One of the most horrific chemical attacks on a civilian area occurred 25 years ago, when Saddam Hussein unleashed chemical weapons in Iraq's Kurdish city of Halabja. The attack left thousands dead and thousands more wounded. --What's the risk of Syria using chemical weapons on foreigners? While Syria has vowed it would never use ""unconventional weapons"" or weapons of mass destruction against its citizens, it gave a stern warning to other countries who might try to intervene militarily in the Syrian conflict: . ""All the stocks of these weapons that the Syrian Arab Republic possesses are monitored and guarded by the Syrian army. These weapons are meant to be used only and strictly in the event of external aggression against the Syrian Arab Republic,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said in July. But with no end in sight to Syria's 21-month conflict, some aren't so sure Syria will keep its promise. ""For the first time in the history of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which entered into force in April 1997, there are serious concerns that chemical weapons might be used,"" said Ahmet Uzumcu, director-general of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. U.S. President Barack Obama warned Syria that any deployment of chemical agents would be catastrophic. ""The use of chemical weapons is and would be totally unacceptable,"" Obama said this week. ""And if you make the tragic mistake of using these weapons, there will be consequences, and you will be held accountable."" CNN's Tom Foreman, Barbara Starr and Tim Langmaid contributed to this report.","Analysts believe Syria's stockpile may include sarin, mustard and VX gases .

"(CNN) -- One of the most recognizable brands in the world. And the man who made it happen -- Howard Schultz. He took over Starbucks in 1987 with a vision of bringing Italian coffeehouse culture to the U.S. -- The Starbuck Experince, he called it. Today a mass market phenomenon that sells tens of millions of cups of coffee every week. At last count 14,000 stores across more than 40 countries, and 10,000 more planned in the next four years. Schultz attended the first of CNN's Boardroom Masterclasses and spoke to Andrew Stevens about his business strategies. Schultz: I think when you look at Starbucks as a business case what we've done and the way we do business is quite different than a classic consumer brand, and let me be specific. Most consumer brands that have emerged in the last 10-20 years have been built through traditional marketing and traditional advertising. Starbucks is not an advertiser, people think we are a great marketing company but in fact we spend very little money on marketing and more money on training our people than advertising. Stevens Just quickly, was that always the plan? Schultz: Well, when we started we had no money. We had no choice, we had to figure out a different way, but the point I want to make is that we built the brand by the experience and when you look back at history of starbucks we are the quintessential experiential brand built by what happens inside of our stores. The mantra has been this: if you want to exceed the expectations of your customer, you can't do that unless you exceed the expectations of your people first, which means you have to treat people with respect and dignity. People want to be a part of something larger than themselves and at the end of the race there has to be something in it for them. The most fragile asset of any kind of company, and certainly a consumer brand, is whether or not you can build an enduring level of trust with both your customer and your employees. Stevens: What are your ""Golden business rules,"" which don't just apply to Starbucks but apply right across the board? Schultz: I think you have to be 100 percent authentic and true. When you're building a business or joining a company you have to be transparent, you can't have two sets of information for two sets of people. I think a great leader, at times, has to demonstrate a level of vulnerability and share with people how you really feel. In order to achieve success it takes unbridled enthusiasm and passion. You have to find something that you really really love and I think you have to be willing to understand that this is hard to do, to build great enduring success and it takes personal sacrifice. Great businesses succeed at a high level of profitability because they are doing fantastic things for their people, for their customers and their communities. Find that fragile balance and you will build a profitable business. Stevens: I do want to ask you, because it will happen one day, you will step down from Starbucks, the proverbial bus is always out there -- what do you want your legacy to be, how do you want to be remembered for what you've done at Starbucks? Schultz: It's hard to answer that question because I'm a long way from that bus! Stevens: A lot of employees will be happy to hear that. Schultz: But I would say something like this, that the success of the company is linked to the fact that the company really did try to have a conscience and a soul in everything it did and the success of the company was shared with its people, that would be enough for me.

"(CNN) -- ""Yes, but what was the best film for grown-ups?"" a friend asked me when I told him ""Hugo"" was my favorite movie of the year. That took the wind out of my sails. Of course he hadn't seen ""Hugo,"" which is absolutely a film for sensitive, alert, thinking-audiences of all ages. The movie is very much concerned with art, mortality and the passage of time, which some might consider mature and adult themes. But in a more general sense, he had a point. The movies -- and especially Hollywood movies -- have been so thoroughly infantilized over the years that even the New York Film Critics Circle can overlook the few truly grown-up movies out there -- ""Margaret,"" ""The Descendants,"" ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,"" ""J. Edgar"" and ""Tree of Life"" -- to nominate ""The Artist"" as the film of the year. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed this charming, anodyne, affectionate pastiche, not least because it reminded me of many, far better movies such as ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""A Star is Born"" and bits and pieces by Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd. But even though it's calculated to appeal to a middle-class crowd, this is essentially bland, sentimental entertainment. It doesn't challenge the audience, ask questions or provoke. It doesn't stir the emotions, break new ground or grapple with the pressing issues of our time. Does ""Hugo""? I think so. Like ""The Artist,"" ""Hugo"" resurrects a bygone era of cinema. In this case, Frenchman Georges Melies, a pioneer in the techniques of special effects, jump cuts and superimposes live action and animation in a kind of proto-CGI. In evoking this pioneer, veteran director Martin Scorsese means us to reflect on how quickly fame and fortune pass by and on what is important about the past. No coincidence that ""Hugo"" was made in 3-D -- and beautifully, I might add. This was a tectonic year in the movie industry -- the year that 35mm was all but phased out of the exhibition sector in favor of digital projection. The shift does not come at the instigation of filmmakers or the audience, but rather to cut the costs of distribution. Nevertheless it will have considerable effect on the way movies are made, how they look and how they are consumed. In this brave new multiplex world, 3-D is not the only story, but it is a major part of it, and a generation of children are growing up watching stereoscopic animated features and family blockbusters. Will these kids look back on 2-D, ""flat"" movies with the same disinterest the preceding generation feels for anything in black and white? I don't know, but I suspect that's why we've seen such heavyweight filmmakers as Scorsese, Steven Spielberg (""The Adventures of Tintin""), Werner Herzog (""The Cave of Forgotten Dreams"") and Wim Wenders (""Pina"") embracing 3-D this year. And what's more, each of them makes a compelling case for the new form in the very different ways they explore movement. The Best . 1. ""Hugo"" Scorese turns back the clock to celebrate the genesis of cinema even as he fashions perhaps the most beautiful 3-D movie yet. 2. ""Margaret"" Kenneth Lonergan's second film took six years to find even a token release, but it's a masterpiece. Anna Paquin is outstanding in this teeming, devastating movie about connection. 3. ""The Descendants"" There is no sharper comic filmmaker than Alexander Payne, and this poignant Hawaiian family story is astute and perfectly turned. 4. ""Source Code"" A commuter train trip becomes a kind of purgatory for Jake Gyllenhaal, with each journey ending in death. Easily the smartest sci-fi movie of the year. 5. ""Drive"" Pure pop bliss, this chic retro thriller cast Ryan Gosling as an icon of machismo cool and rediscovered the latent noir malignancy in Albert Brooks. 6. ""Melancholia"" Only Lars von Trier would dream of destroying the planet without ever leaving the grounds of a country house -- and get away with it. It's an excessive, frustrating but formidable movie with a remarkable performance by Kirsten Dunst. 7. ""Nostalgia for the Light"" There were several stunning documentaries this year -- I strongly recommend ""The Interrupters,"" ""Project Nim"" and ""Tabloid,"" for starters. But this Chilean nonfiction essay is something apart, a scintillating rumination on humanity and the cosmos. 8. ""Take Shelter"" Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain are the bedrock, blue-collar Christians whose life is torn apart by his visions of a biblical storm on the horizon. 9. ""Poetry"" This South Korean film about a grandmother looking for grace in the midst of a sea of trouble is one of those slow-burners that stays with you. 10. ""Bridesmaids"" Probably the most fun you could have at the movies this year. Kirsten Wiig's raucous anti-chick flick was lewd and crude but a laugh riot. The Worst . 1. ""Sucker Punch"" Zack Snyder strikes again. This inane video game wannabe fetishizes feminism for cheap thrills to deeply dull effect. 2. ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" This misconceived, terminally cute ""prestige picture"" asks all the wrong questions about 9/11 and exploits that tragedy to jerk out easy tears. 3. ""Cowboys and Aliens"" Should have been fun. Wasn't. 4. ""Your Highness"" In which several talented people (including James Franco, Natalie Portman and director David Gordon Green) aim low and wind up looking silly. 5. ""The Beaver"" In which Mel Gibson's convincing portrait of a middle-age breakdown is undermined by an incoherent script and Jodie Foster's hackneyed direction.","Movies have been thoroughly infantilized over the years, Tom Charity says .

"(CNN) -- Drone strikes against militants in Yemen are intensifying as the U.S. Embassy there and in other Middle Eastern and African countries remain closed amid terrorism fears. At least eight suspected U.S. drone strikes have been reported in the past two weeks alone. They have killed at least 34 people, according to a tally by Yemeni officials. Three separate strikes were reported Thursday. In central Yemen's Mareb province, eight people were killed in an early morning drone strike, including four with links to al Qaeda, local security officials said. Two civilians were among those killed in the strike, which targeted two vehicles, the officials said. ""Mareb was a previous stronghold for al Qaeda, and a number of members of the group still live in the province,"" a security official said. Later Thursday, a drone strike killed two al Qaeda fighters in the southern province of Hadramout, security officials said. One of the officials who confirmed the strike said the two militants killed were active members and were recruiting youngsters to fight with them. Residents told CNN that the drone had been roaming the sky over the province since dawn and was flying at a low altitude. ""When we hear it flying above us, we know there will be a strike later in the day,"" said a local in Hadramout who asked not to be named. Three people were killed in the third drone strike, which also took place in Hadramout, two security officials told CNN. One of the officials said one of the three people killed was a suspected al Qaeda militant. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the terror group's Yemeni affiliate, shot down a Yemeni military helicopter in that province Tuesday, a government official said. A day earlier, two drone strikes in Shabwa province killed a total of six militants, according to several official sources in Yemen not authorized to be named. Al Qaeda message . The heightened strikes parallel the temporary closing of U.S. embassies and consulates in the Middle East and Africa over fears of an imminent terrorist strike. The United States on Tuesday urged all Americans to leave Yemen. It was unclear whether this week's strikes were related to the security alert in place in the country since U.S. officials intercepted a message from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to operatives in Yemen telling them to ""do something."" The message was sent to Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the leader of AQAP. U.S. intelligence believes al-Wuhayshi has recently been appointed the overall terror organization's No. 2 leader. Local security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that they do not believe any of those killed Tuesday or Wednesday were senior al Qaeda members. A U.S. official echoed those comments, saying that of those killed in recent drone strikes, none were ""household names."" ""There are no all-stars no longer with us,"" the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Bergen: al Qaeda in Yemen, on the ropes . AQAP recoil . AQAP appears to have lost some of its effectiveness in the past year, while Yemen's military has made gains. Yemen's government foiled an al Qaeda plot to capture oil and gas facilities and to seize two key southern ports early this week, a spokesman for the prime minister said. An official downplayed the terror organization's ability to carry out such an attack. ""AQAP has neither the manpower nor the capabilities to capture ports or seize pipelines,"" the official said. Government forces can handle any assault they may attempt, he said. AQAP has not mounted a large-scale suicide attack on Yemen's security forces since May 2012, when more than 100 soldiers were killed by a suicide bomber as they trained for a parade in Sanaa, the capital. In July, a bomb killed several soldiers there. Many of AQAP's operatives, including its leadership, have retreated into remote areas to regroup after a Yemeni military offensive last year. Yemeni security forces have over the past 18 months recaptured swaths of territory that were briefly held by AQAP, particularly in the south. Local criticism . But the drone strikes are stirring anger among Yemenis. The country's Nobel peace laureate, Tawakkol Karman, condemned Thursday's attack. ""The killing conducted by unmanned planes in Yemen is outside the law and worse than the terrorist activities of individuals and groups,"" she said. She said that the strikes are ""degrading"" to Yemenis and violate their human rights. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Barbara Starr contributed to this report .","At least eight suspected U.S. drone strikes occur in the past two weeks .

"(Mashable)  -- YouTube has officially launched its new TrueView ad format, allowing site visitors to avoid watching ads they're not interested in. Users will now be able to look for a countdown button that will let them skip an ad after it plays for five seconds. In some cases, viewers will be able to select which ad to watch out of three pre-roll options. As we reported back in June, YouTube had been experimenting with the button -- allowing users to stop ads from playing -- for awhile. The other option, allowing users to select which ad to watch, is similar to the one offered on Hulu, where long-form video content has typically had a stronger presence. It looks like some advertisers are reacting positively to the new ad format. Some have said TrueView is a cost-effective advertising option that provides them with a better ability to target their audience. ""Thus far, we've seen about a 40 percent view-through rate and since we only pay when potential customers actually watch a video, we have more control over our budget,"" said Lee Topar, director of online marketing for GoPro, in a statement to Google's Inside AdWords blog. TrueView, which is presently only available to advertisers with managed accounts, isn't all that widespread on YouTube just yet. Advertisers can decide whether they'd like to use TrueView or stick with the usual non-skippable platform. Meanwhile, YouTube says it's working on providing more choice and control in advertising to its users. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Authorities have arrested five additional suspects connected with last week's kidnapping of major league baseball player Wilson Ramos, Venezuelan officials said Monday. The five Colombian citizens are among 11 people detained in connection with the case, Venezuela's justice ministry said in a statement. Investigators released few details about the arrests, but were scheduled to release more information about the case at a press conference Monday morning. Security forces rescued Ramos on Friday in Montalban, a mountainous region about 60 miles from the north central Venezuelan town where gunmen kidnapped him two days earlier, state media reported. Ramos, a rising star for the Washington Nationals as a rookie this past year, was in his native country to play in Venezuela's winter league. But before his first game with the Aragua Tigers, gunmen kidnapped him Wednesday night from his mother's home in Santa Ines, a team spokeswoman said.","Five suspects arrested are Colombian citizens, Venezuela's justice ministry says .

"(CNN) -- A National Guard recruiter who is accused of firing a gun in a suburban Memphis armory -- right after being told he'd lost his position due to alleged misconduct -- was charged Friday with a pair of counts that could land him behind bars for 30 years. Amos Patton, a 42-year-old from Cordova, Tennessee, faces one count of assault and another of carrying and using a firearm in relation to a federal crime of violence, the U.S. Attorney's Office for western Tennessee announced Friday in a press release. Calls by CNN to the federal public defender in Patton's case -- to get his side on the prosecution's case and the charges -- were not immediately returned Friday night. The release also detailed the circumstances surrounding Thursday's shooting, which ended with several Tennessee Army National Guard members wounded and Patton in custody. He had been asked by commanders to go to the National Guard recruiting center located in the armory in Millington, the U.S. Attorney's office said, citing an affidavit filed along with a criminal complaint. Once there, the commanders told Patton he was being relieved of duty and that they were recommending his rank be reduced and he be taken out of the active guard reserve ""because of misconduct."" The prosecutor's office didn't say what that alleged misconduct was. Patton was then told to return government-owned equipment thought to be in his government vehicle, according to officials. A Tennessee National Guard member yelled out ""gun"" when he saw Patton accessing a ""fanny pack"" as he came back from the car, federal prosecutors said . A senior non-commissioned officer then tried to subdue Patton, who managed to get off a few shots -- hitting three National Guard personnel in the room -- according to the prosecutor's office. Millington police Chief Rita Stanbeck had said Thursday that two people were shot, one in the foot and the other in the leg. The suspect got away and ran, but not far. The officer was able to catch and hold him until Millington police arrived. If convicted on the assault charge, Patton could be sentenced to as many as 20 years in federal prison. He could get another 10 years on the firearm charge. The armory north of Memphis is on property leased to the Guard by the U.S. Navy, which has its personnel and recruiting commands across the road. The shooting prompted a temporary lockdown of the Navy compound.","Prosecutor: Amos Patton was relieved of duty for unspecified misconduct .

"(CNN) -- The Syrian government has been mounting a campaign to boost vaccination among children in Syria after at least 20 suspected cases of polio were reported -- from government and opposition sources -- near the eastern city of Deir Ezzor. Though the cases will not be confirmed for about a week, ""as far as everyone is concerned, they're treating this like polio,"" said Dr. Bruce Aylward, the World Health Organization's assistant director-general for polio, emergencies and country collaboration. WHO personnel were working with government health officials in Syria as well as surrounding countries ""to stop what's circulating in Syria and make sure it doesn't spread,"" he told CNN Thursday in a telephone interview. But, given the massive refugee flows, ""it's going to be a tough one,"" he said. Wild poliovirus was last reported in Syria in 1999. The highly infectious viral disease primarily affects young children. Initial symptoms can include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, limb pain and, in a small number of cases, paralysis. It can be prevented through immunization, but there is no cure. The incidence of the disease has dropped by more than 99% since 1988. It remains endemic in three countries, Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan, down from more than 125 countries in 1988. The director of the National Immunization Program at the Ministry of Health, Dr. Nidal Abu Rashid, said the campaign also seeks to prevent measles cases, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. Public health can be among the first casualties of war, as resources can be diverted away from ensuring clean water supplies and intact sewer lines. WHO said last week that it had received the reports of a cluster of cases of acute flaccid paralysis, which is defined as sudden onset of weakness and floppiness in any part of a child's body or paralysis in any person in whom polio is suspected as the cause. Despite the challenges posed by the ongoing civil war, the polio vaccination effort will be helped by the fact that Syria had high rates of vaccination coverage among its populace prior to the current conflict, Aylward predicted. In an address Friday to the U.N. Security Council, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief cited the outbreak as an example of the privations endured by the Syrians and the risks they face. Diseases, including those easily preventable by basic hygiene and vaccination, are spreading ""at an alarming rate,"" said Valerie Amos. In addition, reports of malnutrition have soared, and people suffering from chronic illnesses, such as cancer and diabetes, are dying for lack of access to treatment, she said. She credited the U.N.'s World Food Programme with scaling up its operations with the goal of reaching 4 million people per month -- half of them in opposition-held or contested areas of Syria. Still, she said, ""the humanitarian response in Syria remains severely insufficient compared to growing needs."" Aid workers cannot reach some 2.5 million people in the country, she added. ""All humanitarian staff missions and convoys continue to require written approval,"" she said, citing as ""unacceptable"" and ""unpredictable"" the government's processing of visas for U.N. and non-governmental staff members. More than 100 such visas are pending, many are limited to a single entry and many of those that are issued are for insufficient durations, she said. ""There is simply no reason why humanitarian staff, whose only interest is to help those in desperate need, have not been granted visas to scale up our operations,"" she said. In response, Syria's permanent representative to the United Nations acknowledged to reporters in New York that the country is facing grave humanitarian problems, but accused Amos of having failed to properly apportion blame. ""She should know and say what are the root causes,"" Bashar Jaafari told reporters, citing neighborhoods that are ""under siege by the Syrian Army because there are armed groups in these neighborhoods taking civilians as human shields."" Jaafari said his country is ""a victim of interference by some member states into its domestic affairs."" Regarding the issuance of visas, he said, ""We are issuing too many visas to too many people; we are a sovereign nation, like any other nation; we have our own reasons sometimes to deny a visa to this or that individual."" Jaafari said Damascus has extended visas to hundreds of people working for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which is led by Amos. ""Any minimal cases here and there"" of problems ""wouldn't affect the overall picture of our cooperation with OCHA,"" he said. In Syria, opposition activists blamed the war for more than 100 deaths Friday in a series of incidents. A car bomb erupted in front of a mosque in the Damascus suburb of Wadi Barada, killing at least 44 people and wounding more than 200, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Other attacks resulted in 33 deaths in Daraa; 11 in Hama; 11 in Deir Ezzor; five in Latakia; three in Homs; three in Aleppo; and three in Idlib, the LCC said. Syrian state television reported that the military ambushed and killed more than 50 ""terrorists"" in al-Otaiba, a town in the suburbs of Damascus. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the number of rebel dead at 20. Amid accusations by government and opposition forces that each side has used chemical weapons, the Syrian government continued this week to comply with its agreement to rid the country of its stores of such arms, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Police erred by not obtaining an extended search warrant before attaching a tracking device to a drug suspect's car, the Supreme Court said in a unanimous ruling Monday. A majority of justices said that secretly placing the device and monitoring the man's movements for several weeks constituted a government ""search,"" and therefore, the man's constitutional rights were violated. Four other justices also concluded that the search was improper but said it was because the monthlong monitoring violated the suspect's expectation of privacy. U.S. Supreme Court rules on health care challenge | On humane treatment of downed livestock . That difference of legal analysis may create further confusion among law enforcement over when and for how long such high-tech operations can be used, on both criminal suspects and the general public. At issue was whether movement in a private vehicle on city streets is ""public"" in nature. Growing sophistication of electronic devices to monitor the movements of suspects made this issue ripe for review, since lower courts had disagreed on when such surveillance is permissible without a warrant. The devices send an electronic signal to a satellite, allowing real-time plotting of someone's whereabouts. Antoine Jones was a co-owner of Levels, a Washington nightclub, when he was suspected of trafficking cocaine on the side. A joint FBI-D.C. police team covertly attached a GPS device to his Jeep outside the terms of a warrant. A warrant had been granted, but installation of the GPS device was authorized by a judge only within 10 days and only in the District of Columbia. Agents waited until the 11th day to secretly place it on the vehicle, and they did so in neighboring Maryland. Jones was then monitored for 28 days as he drove around the area. He was eventually tracked to a house where law enforcement officers discovered nearly 100 kilograms of the illegal narcotic, along with about $850,000 in cash. Jones was sentenced to life in prison. The court was being asked to decide whether such covert surveillance violated the Fourth Amendment and whether in this case it should be considered a ""search,"" a ""seizure"" or both. The justices agreed police violated Jones' rights but disagreed on just why. The Constitution's Fourth Amendment says, ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated."" Antonin Scalia wrote for a five-vote majority that a person's property is legally sacred, and the government had to justify placing a GPS device on the vehicle. Scalia said the electronic age does not change a centuries-old concept. ""The government physically occupied private property for the purpose of obtaining information,"" said the ruling. ""We have no doubt that such a physical intrusion would have been considered a 'search' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when it was adopted."" Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor agreed with the conclusions. But a group of four justices led by Samuel Alito concluded that the majority's reasoning was ""artificial"" and did not address larger legal concerns of searches in the digital age, including GPS. He said the court should have used this case to clarify the limits of police monitoring of wireless personal communication devices like mobile phones and Internet use. ""The availability and use of these and other devices will continue to shape the average person's expectations about the privacy of his or her daily movements,"" Alito wrote. ""In circumstances involving dramatic technological change, the best solution to privacy concerns may be legislative."" But the U.S. Congress and most states have not kept up with the times, Alito said, leaving courts to sort out what level of privacy a citizen can expect. He said that in this case, four weeks of tracking was more than enough to justify police getting a search warrant. Alito was backed by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. The justices have another pending case they may decide to tackle, from an Oregon inmate who faced similar circumstances. Police there had attached a GPS device to Juan Pineda-Moreno's car while it was parked on his property. Officers then tracked him to a remote marijuana field he was cultivating. He was convicted and sentenced to more than four years behind bars. Unlike in the Jones case, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that this was not a ""search,"" so no warrant was required to place the device on Pineda-Moreno's Jeep Cherokee. His conviction was upheld. The justices have not taken any action on the Oregon appeal, perhaps waiting to resolve the issue with Jones' appeal from Washington. The current case is U.S. v. Jones (10-1259).","Following a car for weeks via a tracking device requires a search warrant, justices say .
The justices are divided on what they say makes the action unconstitutional .
Justice Alito, for the majority, cites the ""physical intrusion"" of placing the device .
Four others say the lengthy monitoring violated the suspect's expectation of privacy ."
"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Troubled singer Amy Winehouse has been admitted to a London hospital after suffering a bad reaction to medication, her representative said Tuesday. Amy Winehouse has undeniable talent, but has become better known for her wild behavior. Winehouse, 25, went to the private London Clinic on Sunday, said her spokesman, Chris Goodman. He said Winehouse's medication made her ill and her doctors asked her to come in so they could investigate. Goodman did not disclose what type of medication was involved, saying only it is part of her ""ongoing treatment."" It was not clear Tuesday whether she had been discharged. Yesterday Winehouse's husband Blake Fielder-Civil lost his appeal against his 27-month jail term for assault and perverting the course of justice. Earlier this month he was moved from prison to a drug rehabilitation unit. The Grammy-winning Winehouse has suffered a string of health problems in recent years, many related to her battles with drug addiction.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Leaders of oil-rich eastern Libya declared it Tuesday to be a semi-autonomous region and voted for a 79-year-old former military man to lead it. ""We're talking about the whole eastern region of the country,"" said Ahmed Zubair al-Senussi, a member of the ruling National Transitional Council, in a telephone interview with CNN from Benghazi. Speaking through an interpreter, he said he wanted the central government in Tripoli to continue to run such matters as defense and the treasury, but to leave health, education and ""social things"" to be managed by local governance in the region, once called Cyrenaica. ""We are not looking to split the country,"" said al-Senussi, 79, who said he was jailed for 31 years during the regime of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi for leading a failed coup d'etat in 1970. ""We are not looking for division at all. Our target is to keep Libya united. We are hoping to run our region. ... We have the federal government, and we have the local government."" Al-Senussi said he was elected by 4,000 to 5,000 tribal leaders, politicians, activists and academics who met Tuesday in Benghazi. ""All of them agreed on my leadership to lead the region for the time being,"" he said. But a video posted Monday on YouTube indicated his support was less than unanimous. In it, scores of demonstrators chant, ""Federalism is the path to divisions,"" ""Oh, great, Libyan, do not accept divisions!"" and ""Tripoli is the capital!"" Al-Senussi added that he had no interest in grabbing the oil wealth for the region's residents at the expense of the rest of the country. ""The oil is for all Libyan people,"" he said. ""It would be written into the constitution."" He added that his first priority would be to stabilize the region. ""Security is a priority now,"" he said. Al-Senussi said he had no immediate plan to resign from the National Transitional Council. ""I was thinking of resigning, but I got advice from some people that I should take some time to see the reactions of the NTC first."" That reaction came quickly. In a news conference Tuesday in Tripoli, NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil denounced the declaration as a move to divide Libya, ""a danger that threatens national unity."" He called on all Libyans ""to rally around the NTC that has international legitimacy."" He said the government and NTC are working to establish a decentralized state with more than 50 local councils. Tuesday's move in Benghazi ""puts the country in danger because the international community will not allow Libya to be divided, unsafe and undemocratic,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Juan Martin Del Potro put on hold Roger Federer's hopes of qualifying for the ATP World Tour Finals by inflicting a second straight defeat on the Swiss maestro in the final of his hometown tournament in Basel. Third seed Federer needed to win Sunday's showdown to seal his place in the end of season showpiece in London next month for the 12th consecutive time, but came up short in a three set encounter. Top seed Del Potro, who will be a dangerous outsider in the British capital, won 7-6 2-6 6-4 in two hours 20 minutes, denying former World No.1 Federer his sixth title in the event and repeating his 2012 victory over him in the title match. The Argentine won a tight first set which saw them exchange breaks before it went to a tiebreaker which Del Potro took 7-3. Federer, who recently parted with coach Paul Annacone after a disappointing 2013, hit back to level the match as two breaks of service gave him the second set. But he fell an early break down in the decider -- serving up two double faults in the same game -- and was unable to retrieve the situation as former U.S. Open champion Del Potro took his fourth title of the season. ""I'm sorry again to beat you here,"" he said apologetically at the trophy presentation. ""He's the hero here and for me my biggest inspiration. ""You make history at every tournament you play. I'm proud to be playing at the same time as you."" The 32-year-old Federer must now beat South Africa's Kevin Anderson or Russian Mikhail Youzhny in his second round match at the Paris Masters next week to reach the finals. It would enable him to tie Ivan Lendl's record for successive appearances in the finale of the men's season where he would be bidding for his seventh victory in the event, his last in 2011 with a final loss to Novak Djokovic in 2012. Meanwhile, Zouzhny showed he is in fine form heading into Paris with a 6-3 7-5 victory over top seed and three time defending champion David Ferrer of Spain in the final of the ATP tournament in Valencia.","Juan Martin Del Potro wins ATP tournament in Basel .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Iran hanged 16 ""anti-Iran"" rebels Saturday in response to deadly overnight clashes between bandits and border guards in southeast Iran, the country's Fars news agency reported. Local attorney-general Mohammad Marzieh said the 16 were hanged Saturday morning in the city of Zahedan, in Sistan and Baluchestan province, the semi-official news agency said. ""We had issued warnings previously that bandits and anti-Iran group members who commit acts causing damage to innocent people or security and military personnel will face reciprocal action by us,"" he is quoted as saying. ""This morning, in retaliation for the martyrdom of border guards at the town of Saravan, we hanged 16 members of of these anti-Iran groups. The judiciary will absolutely not tolerate such actions by these groups."" Official news agency IRNA said 14 Iranian border guards were killed in the clashes in the Saravan city area, near Iran's border with Pakistan's Balochistan province. Six more were injured and three taken hostage, the news agency said. It earlier said as many as 17 security personnel had died. Ali Abdollahi, Iran's deputy interior minister, told IRNA that the provincial governor had sent a team to investigate the incident. He told the news agency that only authorized reports by the interior ministry regarding the killing of the soldiers and border guards should be trusted. Abdollahi said the ""terrorist activities"" in Saravan appeared to have initiated over the border in Pakistan. Iran expects Pakistan to do more to secure its borders in line with mutual agreements, he said. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani urged the interior ministry to take strong measures to deal with terrorism, IRNA said. He also called on the foreign ministry to work out a deal with Pakistan to avoid this kind of incident happening again, the news agency said. Rouhani also expressed his condolences to the families of the border guards killed in the incident. Additional security and military forces from elsewhere in the province have been sent to the border area, the news agency said.

"(CNN) -- France's controversial 75% tax for high earners drove award-winning actor Gerard Depardieu to take Russian citizenship. Now, French football clubs are going on strike to protest the legislation's planned implementation next year, claiming it will make them less competitive against European rivals and cause further financial hardship. The Professional Union of Football Clubs (UCPF) announced Thursday that they will boycott all matches in the top two divisions scheduled between November 29-December 2. It will be the first such strike in France since 1972, when players protested about their salaries, and will be the first in a major European league since the start of the 2010-11 Italian season was disrupted. ""This unprecedented day must be the occasion for the silent majority of French football to express its opposition,"" UCPF president Jean-Pierre Louvel said in a statement Thursday. The 75% tax will apply to players who earn more than €1 million ($1.38 million) a year. Under the law's initial wording the earners themselves would have had to pay it, but after protests Francois Hollande's Socialist Party government moved the responsibility to their employers. However, the UCPF claims this is unfair as its clubs are losing money anyway -- racking up a combined deficit of €108 million ($149 million) at the end of the 2011-12 season. Their total debt for the last three season amounts to €303 million ($418 million). ""This tax, unfair and discriminatory, is estimated by the professional football industry at €44m ($60m) per year,"" the UCPF said. ""The economic crisis has not spared these clubs, who have seen their income from ticketing and TV rights decreased for the last three years in a row."" The UCPF claims the tax will make French clubs less competitive against European rivals in countries which have lower taxes. ""In a context of a deregulated European competition where players have the ability to go and play everywhere they want, the French clubs -- if they want to stay competitive -- cannot massively decrease their remunerations,"" it said. ""For similar salaries, a player in France is costing the clubs 33% more than a player would in Germany, England, Spain or Italy."" The UCPF, which says it pays €130 million ($179.5 million) to amateur sports each year as an act of ""solidarity,"" claims the tax will cost jobs in the French football industry -- which employs 25,000 people. 'We wish to open all the stadiums to all the fans, football lovers, those people who make French football on a daily basis,"" Louvel said of the strike. ""The supporters, amateur players, associations, volunteers, coaches, agents and employees. All of those who will suffer from the consequences of this unfair tax. The social role of football will be impacted by the consequences of this measure."" The tax will hit clubs to varying degrees. Big-spending champion Paris Saint-Germain, which has invested more than €200 million ($276 million) in players since being bought by a Qatari consortium in 2011, may have to pay just under half the clubs' €44 million bill according to reports estimating its salary bills. Monaco, backed by a Russian billionaire, would next season be exempt as it does not fall under French tax laws -- and the principality club says it will fight the league's plans to change its status in future.","French football clubs to go on strike next month for the first time since 1972 .

"(CNN) -- High-Speed Rail (HSR) has been around been around for decades, but it's back in the transport spotlight amid a surge of interest from the United States and China. Despite cuts to President Obama's original plan to spend $53 billion on HSR over the next 25 years, an ambitious scheme for HSR to connect U.S. cities is still on the agenda. China has built more than 8,000 kilometers of high-speed rail lines in recent years and plans to spend over $400 billion on its program in the next five years, while the United Kingdom is contemplating plans to extend its more modest HSR network. Supporters of HSR often list environmental sustainability among its virtues. Some argue it's a greener alternative to car and air travel and see it as an easy win in weaning people of fossil fuels. But just how green is HSR? Two experts with different views give their opinions. Dr. Anthony Perl is Professor of Urban Studies and Political Science at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he directs the Urban Studies Program. His latest book, co-authored with Richard Gilbert, is ""Transport Revolutions: Moving People and Freight Without Oil."" Any debate about the future of high-speed rail must consider where this mobility option fits into the 'big picture' of how transportation systems meet looming economic, energy and environmental challenges. In a world where 95% of motorized mobility is currently fueled by oil, high-speed rail offers a proven means of reducing dependence on this increasingly problematic energy source. This value of using proven electric propulsion technology should not be underestimated when both the time and money to deploy energy alternatives are in short supply. In our recent book Transport Revolutions, Richard Gilbert and I documented the economic, environmental and political dividends to be gained from replacing the internal combustion engines powering today's aircraft, cars, and motor vehicles with traction motors that can be powered by multiple energy sources delivered through the electric grid. Since electricity is an energy carrier, it can be generated from a mix of sources that incorporate the growing share of geothermal, hydro, solar, and wind energy that will be produced in the years ahead. And because electric motors are three to four times more efficient than internal combustion engines, an immediate improvement will precede introducing renewable energy into transportation. Grid-connected traction offers the only realistic option for significantly reducing oil use in transportation over the next 10 years. If such a shift does not begin during this decade, the risk of a global economic collapse and/or geo-political conflict over the world's remaining oil reserves would become dangerously elevated. Making a significant dent in transportation's oil addiction within 10 years is sooner than fuel cells, biofuels, battery-electric vehicles and other alternative energy technologies will be ready to deliver change. Biofuels that could power aircraft now cost hundreds of dollars per gallon to produce. Batteries that a big enough charge to power vehicles between cities are still too big and expensive to make electric cars and buses affordable. But grid-connected electric trains have been operating at scale and across continents for over a century. And when the Japanese introduced modern high-speed trains through their Shinkansen, in 1964, the utility of electric trains was greatly extended. Since the 1980s, countries across Asia and Europe have been building new high-speed rail infrastructure to deploy electric mobility between major cities up to 1,000 kilometers apart. For intercity trips between 200 and 1,000 kilometers, high-speed trains have proven their success in drawing passengers out of both cars and planes, as well as meeting new travel demand with a much lower carbon footprint than driving or flying could have done. If we are serious about reducing oil's considerable risks to global prosperity and sustainability, we will not miss the opportunity offered by high-speed rail to decrease transportation's oil consumption sooner, rather than later. Tony Bosworth is a campaigner for Friends of the Earth, in its energy and climate team. He has a long track record of working on environmental issues, including a spell as transport campaigner for the environmental campaigning charity. Across the world governments are looking to high speed rail to provide fast, modern transport systems fit for the 21st century. By the end of 2012 China is expected to have more high speed rail lines than the rest of the world combined, while President Obama aims to give 80 per cent of Americans access to fast rail travel within 25 years. But if governments want high speed rail to spearhead the drive towards a cleaner transport system they must look further than simply providing faster trains. The UK is currently mulling over a high speed rail link between London and Birmingham, a city about 160 kilometers north-west of the capital. But according to official estimates, it's unlikely to lead to significant carbon dioxide cuts -- and may even increase climate-changing emissions. So what's stopping high speed rail being a major part of a greener transport future in Britain? First there's the electricity to power the trains. Over two thirds of the world's electricity comes from fossil fuels so until (or unless) power stations are weaned off fossil fuels, electric trains will still have a significant climate impact -- although rail travel is still better than flying or driving. Secondly, will high speed rail entice people off the roads and short-haul flights? French TGVs and the Channel Tunnel rail link have succeeded, but official calculations estimate that only 16 per cent of anticipated passengers for the London to Birmingham line will have swapped from planes or cars. One of the main factors is cost. Despite soaring fuel prices, motoring and flying are still expected to be cheaper than high speed rail. If faster rail travel is to become a realistic alternative it must be affordable too. The UK's high speed rail link is expected to cost a whopping $54 billion. But living as we do in cash-strapped times there's surely a strong case for investing some of that that money in less grandiose, but more effective, projects. Perhaps some high speed rail money could be diverted to upgrade commuter and longer-distance services, making life easier and cheaper for ordinary passengers -- and making a bigger and fast contribution to cutting emissions. High speed rail can play a major role in tackling climate change around the world -- if it's affordable, powered by clean energy and gets people out of their cars and off planes, we really will be speeding in the right direction.","HSR can significantly cut oil use in transport in next 10 years, says Anthony Perl .

"(CNN) -- Stretching some 7,000 kilometers along the West African coastline, a submarine fiber-optic cable emerges off the coast of Nigeria to help bridge the digital divide in the continent. Dubbed Main One Cable, the system links West Africa with Europe, bringing ultra-fast broadband in the region. It runs from Seixal in Portugal through Accra in Ghana to Lagos in Nigeria and branches out in Morocco, Canary Islands, Senegal, and Ivory Coast. The cable, which has a capacity of 1.92 terabits a second, first went live in July 2010, becoming the first subsea cable to bring open-access, broadband capacity in West Africa, according to Funke Opeke, chief executive of Nigeria's Main One Cable Company. She says high-speed, low-priced, reliable broadband is key in transforming African economies and creating job opportunities. ""When you think of Africa coming into the information age, you think of educational institutions, you think of business opportunities, you think of social awareness, better communication, transparency in government,"" says Opeke, a former executive at U.S. telecoms giant Verizon. ""In order to make Africa (and) Nigeria competitive again and in order to make our schools competitive, to make businesses here competitive and ... to give young people access to opportunities, access to markets, access to ideas ... we need a society, as a population to be better connected to the internet,"" she adds. Web savvy Africans fuel growth in online shopping . After the launch of Main Cable One, more undersea fiber-optic projects have been rolled out in the region, including Glo 1 by Nigerian telecoms group Globacom. Similarly, several other efforts have been deployed in eastern and southern Africa in recent years. Yet, slow connectivity and high internet costs are still major problems -- according to figures by the International Telecommunication Union, Internet-user penetration in sub-Saharan Africa was 10.6% in 2010, far behind the world average of about 30%. ""Even in the countries in which we're already in-land, broadband penetration is still under 10% rate, so there's a lot of road for growth and improvement,"" says Opeke. Born in Nigeria, Opeke moved to the United States in 1984 to study at Columbia University. After a 20-year-old career in the U.S. telecommunications industry she returned to Nigeria in 2005, where she saw ""first-hand"" the country's absence of internet infrastructure and the need for better web connectivity. ""I just felt personally the need was so glaring and that was what motivated me to start trying to solve the problem,"" says Opeke. ""The more I looked at it on my kitchen table the more visible it became to put a business together and that's what I did."" Starting all by herself, Opeke managed to raise $240 million after securing the support of various investors from the continent. ""It's all African financing,"" she explains, ""I look at those people who wrote checks ... the angel investors when I had no license, it was a business sheet on a piece of paper and it really wasn't about making money, it was really about a deep understanding and desire to transform a society and to say that we could address some of these problems Africa had. ""That we understood the challenges, there was a lot of work to be done and that we wanted to pull people on board, pull ourselves together to address those problems,"" she adds. Today, Opeke says, the system has helped improve the availability of internet services, especially in Lagos and Accra, as well as lowering wholesale prices significantly, by up to 80 per cent. Africa's emerging leaders launch 2020 growth vision . But despite the big decrease in wholesale cost, Opeke notes that consumers have still not seen a difference in the price they pay -- she says that all of Nigeria's infrastructure is self-provisioned by different retail operators, which keep charging the same prices for the domestic part of the services. ""The people who own the distribution networks are not passing on the saving, there's no open-access distribution or common carriers like you would have in a developed market,"" says Opeke. The lack of a national backbone infrastructure on an open-access basis is also making expensive to move capacity within Nigeria, according to Opeke. As a result, she says, connecting people from the company's landing point in Nigeria to London costs less than connecting people across Lagos. ""You have to buy that infrastructure from people who own it for their own proprietary use, so it's a cartel-like situation,"" she says. Therefore, Main One Cable, which does not sell its capacity directly to homes or small and medium-size businesses, has also started investing in distribution infrastructure, building its own networks when it can't find ""commercially reasonable rates,"" as Opeke explains. ""The biggest challenge that we see is getting the capacity we have in this big pipe that we brought into Nigeria and Ghana across the region to reach the people and businesses where they need the service,"" she says. There are also plans to extend the cable down the coast to South Africa and connect it with Seacom, the underwater East African fiber-optic cable that became fully operational in 2009. Despite the challenges, Opeke says the high demand she had hoped for when she first started sketching out her business plan on her kitchen table back in 2007 is still there. ""People know they want better access to the internet, they want faster, cheaper, they want to be able to drive new kinds of applications, access different types of content,"" she says.","Funke Opeke is the chief executive of Nigeria's Main One Cable Company .

"(CNN) -- At least five people were killed Sunday in a string of blasts before the start of a political rally in eastern India, authorities said. The explosions occurred in Patna, in Bihar state, ahead of an appearance by opposition politician Narendra Modi, the Bharatiya Janta party's prime ministerial candidate for next year's national elections. Along with the dead, 83 people were injured, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar confirmed. One person has been taken into custody and is being questioned, and law enforcement is developing important leads in the strikes, he said. Kumar said there was no intelligence information before the blasts to indicate a threat. He said that next of kin of those slain will be compensated. Authorities in Bihar have not yet determined whether the bombings were politically motivated or whether Modi himself was targeted. But Modi has his share of detractors -- particularly in the state of Bihar, which has a significant Muslim population -- and many citizens think he could have been targeted. Modi, who is the chief minister of Gujarat state, is a powerful but controversial Hindu nationalist leader. He has been accused of turning a blind eye to the killings of hundreds of Muslims in the wake of the burning of a train carrying Hindu pilgrims in 2002 in Gujarat. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh issued a statement condemning Sunday's blasts and called for ""urgent steps to identify and take action against those responsible."" Modi, on his Facebook page, called the explosions ""deeply saddening."" Both he and Singh appealed for calm. The blasts did not prevent the rally from occurring. Modi made no mention of the blasts at the rally but called for peace. Journalist Neha Sharma in New Delhi and CNN's Jessica King in Atlanta reported .","Blasts occurred before event began .

"(CNN) -- A new Louisiana law requires sex offenders and child predators to state their criminal status on their Facebook or other social networking page, with the law's author saying the bill is the first of its kind in the nation. State Rep. Jeff Thompson, a Republican from Bossier City, Louisiana, says his new law, effective August 1, will stand up to constitutional challenge because it expands sex offender registration requirements, common in many states, to include a disclosure on the convicted criminal's social networking sites as well. Thompson, an attorney and a father of a 13-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son, said he hopes other states will follow Louisiana. Social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace have been removing sex offenders from their web pages for years, but Thompson said the law is designed to cover any possible lapses by social networking sites. ""I don't want to leave in the hands of social network or Facebook administrators, 'Gee, I hope someone is telling the truth,'"" Thompson said Tuesday. ""This is another tool for prosecutors."" The new law, signed by Gov. Bobby Jindal earlier this month, builds upon existing sex offender registration laws, in which the offender must notify immediate neighbors and a school district of his or her residency near them, Thompson said. The law states that sex offenders and child predators ""shall include in his profile for the networking website an indication that he is a sex offender or child predator and shall include notice of the crime for which he was convicted, the jurisdiction of conviction, a description of his physical characteristics... and his residential address."" I don't own my child's body . Several states now require sex offenders and child predators to register with authorities their e-mail accounts, Internet addresses or profile names to social network and other web sites, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A few states such as Illinois and Texas even outright prohibit sex offenders, as a condition of parole, from accessing social networking websites, the group said. The Louisiana law is the latest addition to statutes requiring public notice and registrations by sex offenders, Thompson said. ""It provides the same notice to persons in whose home you are injecting yourself via the Internet,"" Thompson said. ""I challenge you today to walk down the street to see how many people and children are checking Pinterest, Instagram and other social networking sites. If you look at how common it is, that's 24 hour a day, seven days a week for somebody to interact with your children and your grandchildren."" At least according to Facebook's policies, the law would have no real impact. The site's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities already bars sex offenders from using it. ""You will not use Facebook if you are a convicted sex offender,"" the policy reads, in a section that also prohibits children under 13 and multiple accounts on the site. In the past, Facebook has worked with various states on legislation to help law enforcement find, prosecute and convict sexual predators attempting to use the site. Violators of the new law could face imprisonment with hard labor for a term between two and 10 years without parole and a fine up to $1,000. A second conviction carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment with hard labor for a term between five and 20 years without parole and a fine up to $3,000. Thompson consulted prosecutors and the attorney general in Louisiana when drafting the law because last year, a federal court struck down a Louisiana law that outright banned sex offenders and child predators from using Internet. The court found the law too broad, Thompson said. Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana sought to block the enforcement of that state law that tried to limit sex offenders' use of the Internet, arguing that it infringes on constitutional rights. The law had targeted registered sex offenders convicted in crimes involving children and prohibited the ""using or accessing of social networking websites, chat rooms and peer-to-peer networks,"" according to the legislation that was signed into law in June 2011. Today, sex abuse victims are less alone . Louisiana lawmakers, however, have not given up on that stricter law. In fact, a revised version was passed by the Louisiana legislature and signed into law in May, but Thompson is skeptical that latest version can survive a court challenge. The revised, new ban prohibits certain registered sex offenders from intentionally using a social networking website, Gov. Jindal said in a statement. Said Thompson about that new law: ""It may very well fall under scrutiny and attack. That's one of the reasons that I created the bill I did. I'm not trying to create a ban. I'm just trying to create an expansion of the existing notice requirements."" Force your child to hug? Readers strong reactions .","New law says sex offenders, child predators must reveal convictions on sites .

"(CNN) -- It's a sad day for Britain's panda lovers. After weeks of waiting, experts announced Tuesday that they no longer believe Edinburgh Zoo's female giant panda, Tian Tian, is pregnant. Hopes had been high that Tian Tian, who has been on loan to the zoo for less than two years, might produce a panda cub to wow the crowds and help boost panda numbers. But experts at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland now think Britain's only female giant panda conceived and carried a fetus to late term but then lost it. Chris West, chief executive officer for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said officials were saddened by the turn of events. ""Timings are difficult to pinpoint at this moment, but we had a meeting this morning where Tian Tian's behavior and hormone results were reviewed and have come to the conclusion that it is very likely she has lost the pregnancy,"" he said in a statement. Tian Tian has returned to normal eating and behavior patterns, he said. The creature's enclosure, which was closed to visitors to give privacy during the pregnancy, will remain shut to the end of the week. ""Such a loss has always been in our minds as a very real possibility as it occurs in giant pandas as well as many other animals, including humans,"" West said. The zoo's scientists will review the data gathered, he said, but added that he is ""totally confident that we did everything it was possible to do."" The cub was conceived by artificial insemination. Panda cubs in Atlanta, Washington . Although the bad news for Tian Tian is a blow for conservationists and panda fans, it's been a good summer for the black-and-white stars at zoos across the pond. In August, a female giant panda cub was born to mother panda Mei Xiang at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, conceived through artificial insemination. Panda twins born at Zoo Atlanta . That birth came only a month after twin cubs were born at Zoo Atlanta -- the first set of panda twins born in the United States in 26 years. The twins were the first for Lun Lun, who has two other offspring at that zoo, and were the product of artificial insemination as well. Their father is Yang Yang, also a resident at Atlanta's zoo. The cubs have still to be named, following Chinese tradition. CNN's Susannah Palk contributed to this report.","Edinburgh Zoo's Tian Tian is the only female giant panda in Britain .

"(CNET) -- Google Wave and Google Buzz may have had troubles attracting usage, but the new ability to place calls from Gmail appears to have caught on quickly. ""Over 1,000,000 calls placed from Gmail in just 24 hours!"" Google tweeted Thursday, evidently pleased with the number. For comparison, there are somewhat more than 300 million people in the United States. If the average person makes 10 calls per day--research in 2008 put the number at 208 calls per month--that means about one out of every 3,000 calls in the U.S. went through the service on its first day. The service lets Gmail users make free calls to U.S. and Canada and inexpensive calls to phones in other countries. It uses Gmail as an interface and optionally can integrate with Google Voice to receive calls as well. To be sure, a lot of calls are placed daily in the United States, where the new Gmail feature was activated initially. But the figure indicates that a sizable number of the millions of Gmail users at least gave it a whirl even if they didn't decide it was time to stop paying for their other phones. I had two successes with the service the day it launched, both unplanned. First, somebody called my mobile phone and my computer ""rang"" as well. I had the pleasure of conducting an interview via headphones and my computer's microphone rather than trying to squeeze my mobile phone between my shoulder and ear for an hour. I've done plenty of interviews over Skype, but this time the call came in from the phone system without my having to get somebody to sign up for Skype or for me to pay for a SkypeIn phone number. Second, I came back to my desk to see a missed call announced on my Gmail screen. I clicked the phone number to call back and had a quick chat through my computer. Nothing fancy, but no mobile phone minutes were consumed in this process, and I didn't have to tell anybody anything except my Google Voice phone number. Given the vast number of phone calls made daily, I'm reluctant to draw any grand conclusions. But the fact is that I used the service twice yesterday without actively seeking to do so (granted, I already signed up for Google Voice and installed the required chat plug-in). That indicates to me that it's a matter those in the voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) realm or more traditional telephony will need to take seriously. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

"(CNN) -- Ukrainian club Metalist Kharkiv have been thrown out of UEFA competitions for a year after European soccer's governing body found them guilty on match-fixing charges. Metalist, who finished runners up in the Ukrainian Premier League, had been drawn to play German side Schalke in the final qualifying stage of the European Champions League. But after hearing their case on Tuesday, UEFA's Appeals Body has decided to disqualify them from all European competitions for the 2013/14 seasons. A statement on UEFA's website said the club were in breach of several regulations, one of which precludes ""any activity aimed at arranging or influencing the outcome of a match at national or international level."" ""FC Metalist Kharkiv have been disqualified from UEFA competitions for the 2013/14 season following the conclusion of disciplinary proceedings against the Ukrainian club,"" the statement read. ""The club has the opportunity to appeal the decision of the UEFA Appeals Body to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). ""In the meantime, the UEFA Emergency Panel -- which is composed of five members of the UEFA Executive Committee -- will hold a meeting later today to consider the consequences of the decision on the competition."" Earlier this month the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld a decision by the Football Federation of Ukraine (FFU) to ban Yevhen Krasnikov -- Metalist's sports director -- from the game for five years in relation to allegations he helped to fix a Ukrainian league game against Karpaty Lviv in 2008. CAS also backed the FFU's decision to strip Metalist of their third-placed finish in 2008 and the decision to fine the club and FC Karpaty $25,000 each over a disputed fixture played in April 2008. One of Metalist's players, Serhiy Lashchenkov, was banned for five years and another five players in their squad were handed three-year bans.

"London (CNN) -- ""You know, Bernie (Ecclestone) is a good friend of mine and I have tried to persuade him that India has a market that should not be ignored. I would be very, very disappointed if India fell into the category of being in the F1 calendar and then being permanently out of the calendar."" So says Dr. Vijay Mallya -- wealthy industrialist, parliamentarian, Force India co-owner, force of nature and motorsport nut -- from the comfort of an antique chair in the office of his plush Regent's Park, London residence. The 57-year-old has always gone about business in his own way. Dubbed the ""King of Good Times"" for the playboy style of his younger days and his ownership of Kingfisher breweries, it is maybe fitting that one of the subcontinent's most powerful men (Forbes suggests he has a personal wealth of $800 million) dresses in what seem to be pajama bottoms and a polo shirt for CNN's visit to his stately and opulent home. Interactive: Inside the Indian Grand Prix . His clothing style might be eclectic and his style relaxed, but his passion for F1 in India is resolute. ""From what I understand, we are going to give 2014 a skip because of scheduling issues -- there are three new grands prix scheduled next year -- and I am hoping that we will be back with an Indian GP in 2015,"" Mallya states between draws on his cigarillo. ""It's large -- yes, India has its problems and some frustrations that go with it ... but the market is just too big and far too important for F1 to ignore."" It's the kind of demographic that makes taking Formula One to emerging markets and away from its traditional European heartland -- a bold and controversial policy of the sport's ever-entrepreneurial supremo Bernie Ecclestone -- seem like a logical step. There have been perceived successes, such as the night race of Singapore, Austin's bridgehead to the American market and the purpose-built Yaz Marina venue that showcases Abu Dhabi. But this has come at the expense of others. Interactive: How does an F1 steering wheel work? Fans of the French, Turkish and South African Grands Prix (to mention a few) fear that the road to reinstate their races to the F1 calendar, after they made way for the newcomers, remains as long and challenging as Shanghai's back straight on blistered tires. Put simply: if you're dropped from the schedule it's hard to bounce back. Which might explain anxieties being felt at the Buddh International Circuit ahead of this weekend's race in Greater Noida, near New Delhi. It has been shelved for 2014 due to Ecclestone's desire to move its place to March because of increasing costs due to rupee depreciation and tax issues faced by the teams. The race organizers were unable to stage two races within five months to accommodate Ecclestone's wishes. Vicky Chandhok, president of the Federation of Motor Sport Clubs of India, this week told British newspaper The Guardian he feared the race may never return despite promises to the contrary for 2015. Mallya remains bullish but admits there may be need of a new approach from the state to secure the event's future. ""F1 needs India because of the economic opportunities in the country going forward, given its size and scale. But you know, the Delhi Grand Prix is actually staged by the track owners,"" he says. ""There is no government involvement -- the government only gives the necessary permissions and government doesn't have any financial exposure whatsoever to the F1 event. ""I wish that the government would actually force some support to F1 -- it's good for tourism, it's good for the country's image, and other governments across the world believe in it, and I hope the Indian government will one day believe in it."" Critics argue that F1 faces stiff competition for the attention of sport fans in India, with the cost of tickets being out of reach for the bulk of the population -- and with cricket, hockey and the English Premier League laying claims to the hearts of the population's affinities. A fear some argued was borne out when attendance at the 2012 race dropped from over 90,000 in its first year to around 65,000 in its second. But Mallya, whose love of motorsport started when racing single-seaters in the 1970s and moved to F1 with sponsorship of the Benetton team in 1995, feels there is good reason to be hopeful. ""India is a very prosperous country in the overall sense. It also has its fair share of challenges, a lot of underprivileged people in poverty and so on. So, it has to be viewed in that context,"" he says. ""Over the last 20 years, while I have always dreamed of hosting an F1 race or participating in an F1 race, economically it seemed like Mount Everest -- a challenge that many times was sort of insurmountable. ""And so when the grand prix group actually invested in the new track in Noida, outside Delhi, and F1 in India became reality, I mean, it was almost miraculous, it was like a lifelong dream come true. ""There is no drought of potential fans. You know, we have more than 500 million young Indians below the age of 18, and that's a lot. Cricket is number one in India and has been there for decades. So, one shouldn't try to change that at all. ""But you know, modern racing ... is glamorous, it's exciting and that is attractive enough. Yes, football is popular in India, but only in five states, it's not a pan-Indian game. Hockey is our national sport, but sadly over the years it sort of lost its mass popularity. ""So yes, I mean, there are hundreds of millions of Indians who are there and are potential fans for each sport. There's space enough for everyone."" The ambition to act as a catalyst for F1 fanaticism in India has become a personal crusade for Mallya. When he bought the Spyker team in 2007 he renamed it ""Force India"" and made its colors orange, white and green to evoke national pride rather than promote the brands he owns, as with Red Bull Racing for example. He'd also cite the money he's plowed into the Force India Drivers' Academy, which has unearthed the Indian driver Jehan Daruvala, on whom many hopes are being pinned for the future. But Mallya -- a man whose yacht dwarfs all others in harbor of Monaco come GP time -- knows nothing inspires like victory. In this regard, he knows his team is still battling the odds this weekend: ""We came very close to a few podiums in 2013, for some reason it didn't happen. I would be absolutely over the moon if we got a podium this year before the season ended!"" Force India's drivers, Adrian Sutil and Paul di Resta, will also be hoping for a good result -- so Mallya is inclined to delve into his wallet to renew their contracts for next year.","Businessman Vijay Mallya is living his dream as a Formula One team boss .

"New York (CNN) -- The tragic death of President Lech Kaczynski and Poland's political and military elite among the trees of the Katyn Forest is surreal, given that in those same woods, thousands of Polish prisoners of war were murdered by Joseph Stalin's secret police. The delegation was headed for the Katyn Forest near Smolensk, Russia, to honor the 22,000 Polish prisoners of war killed 70 years ago by the Soviet Union's NKVD, forerunner of the KGB. In 1940, Stalin ordered the assassination of Poland's military and political leaders in order to create a leadership vacuum so he could prop up a Communist puppet state in Warsaw. Many of those killed in Saturday's plane crash helped to overturn Soviet Communism in Poland in 1990. They included Poland's top generals, several bishops, the head of the national bank and several deputy government ministers. During the five decades of Soviet occupation of Poland in the Cold War, the Russians covered up the Katyn Massacre, claiming that Nazi Germany had murdered these officers. But forensic evidence found in mass graves proved that the Polish prisoners were taken into the woods, with their hands tied behind their backs, and one by one, they were shot dead in the back of the head by the Russians. The mass graves were discovered by German soldiers in 1943 when they saw pawprints of wolves that had been digging up the bones. In 1990, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the truth began to slowly emerge with revelations by Russian leaders Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. It's no secret that Moscow was not excited about Kaczynski's visit to Katyn, because he demanded to know the full truth about the murders. For the Kremlin, the official commemoration took place last Wednesday when Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Kaczynski's political rival, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, took part in ceremonies at the same gravesite where Kaczynski was heading. But Kaczynski's delegation included family members of murdered officers who wanted the Russian government to open all of the remaining archives concerning the massacre. For decades, the cries of Polish families who want to know what happened to their loved ones have fallen on deaf ears. Kaczynski was their voice. Many will no doubt compare this crash to the 1943 death of Polish Prime Minister Gen. Wladyslaw Sikorski, who died mysteriously when his plane crashed into the sea near Gibraltar after he asked the International Red Cross to investigate the Katyn Massacre. At the time, the American and British governments were not willing to address the massacre because they were trying to help the Soviet Union fight Nazi Germany on the Eastern front. Let us hope the flight data recordings from Kaczynski's downed plane will provide enough evidence to dissuade conspiracy theorists. Ironically, because of Kaczynski's death, more people have already heard about the Katyn Massacre than would have heard about it had he simply placed a wreath at the gravesite. For those Polish officers in the mass graves at Katyn, Lech Kaczynski's death was not in vain. Many Russian government officials appeared on Polish television after the disaster expressing sincere regrets over the death of Kaczynski and his delegation. Putin has flown to Smolensk, where he said that he would oversee the investigation into the crash. Hopefully, these are signs that this tragedy will somehow lead to the full truth about Katyn and reconciliation between Poland and Russia. For decades, Katyn has been the symbol of the worst in Polish-Russian relations. That is why several months ago, the Kosciuszko Foundation began working on a conference about the Katyn Massacre to be held at the Library of Congress on May 5. The goal is to provide a forum for political leaders, scholars, authors and human rights advocates from Poland, Russia and the United States to discuss new details on the massacre, and the possibility of finding a path toward reconciliation between Poland and Russia. There will also be a display of rare Katyn photographs and documents on loan from The Council to Protect the Memory of Struggle and Martyrdom. Andrzej Przewoznik, secretary-general of the Council, was to be one of the speakers. He died in Saturday's crash. Now, this conference and exhibit will be a tribute to him, as well as to the other Polish leaders killed in Katyn during the 1940s, and in 2010. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Storozynski.","Plane crash killed many Polish leaders headed to commemorate Katyn Massacre .

"(CNN) -- Gunmen who arrived by boats launched attacks on at least seven locations in Mumbai, India, on Wednesday night, killing more than 120 people, authorities say. Indian soldiers take position outside Chabad House, the scene of one the Mumbai attacks. By Friday morning, authorities believed militants still were in two luxury hotels and a Jewish center in the city. The following is what is known about the attacks: . • Gunmen arrived by boats at the Mumbai waterfront near the Gateway of India monument on Wednesday night, police said. The gunmen hijacked cars, including a police van, and split into at least three groups to carry out the attacks, according to police. • One group headed toward the Cafe Leopold, a popular hangout for Western tourists, firing indiscriminately at passers-by on the street. The group then opened fire and lobbed grenades at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, authorities said. • As police rushed to the scene of the attacks, gunmen attacked the Cama Hospital for women and infants. Several people were killed at the hospital, and a standoff there lasted until Thursday morning.   • Two other groups attacked the Oberoi and Taj Mahal hotels, taking hostages there, police said.   • Gunmen also took hostages at the Chabad House, where several Jewish families live, police said. Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, the city's envoy for the community, was being held inside with his wife, a member of the Hasidic Jewish movement said. Gunmen and hostages still were believed to be in the house Friday morning. • Police said gunmen fired indiscriminately from the Chabad House. Stray bullets killed a couple in their home and a 16-year-old boy who stepped outside, police said. Two women and a child escaped from the building Thursday, a government official says.   • At the hotels, hostages or people who were trapped left at various times Thursday and Friday. Commandos entered both hotels, trying to flush out militants and rescue others. • By 12:30 a.m. IT on Friday, two gunmen remained at the Oberoi hotel, the director-general of the National Security Guards said. At 1 a.m., one gunman was killed at the Oberoi hotel, the official said. He said he couldn't say for sure how many gunmen were still at the Oberoi.  • Early Friday, an Indian general told reporters that two or three gunmen, one of whom was wounded, remained inside the Taj hotel. • An undetermined number of nonmilitants remained inside the hotels Friday morning, NSG director-general J.K. Dutt said. ""There are some of them inside the rooms, and they are not prepared to open the doors,"" he said. ""Probably they are fearing that it might not be an innocent.""   • Fire brigades battled fires at both hotels. By early Friday, it appeared what had been a major fire at the Oberoi had been extinguished.   • By Friday morning, 125 had been killed in the attacks, including at least six foreigners, authorities said. An Italian and a Briton were among the confirmed dead. Another 327 people were wounded, including seven Britons, three Americans and two Australians.  Watch theories on who may have carried out the attacks » . • At least nine gunmen were killed in fighting with police by Friday morning. Also among the dead were 14 police officers and the chief of the Mumbai police anti-terror squad.  • CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN, quoted police sources as saying there were about 26 gunmen. • Authorities found 8 kilograms (17 pounds) of RDX, one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives, at a restaurant near the Taj, indicating that the attackers may have been planning more violence.   • The Indian navy, stepping up patrols on the country's western coast after the attack, was questioning the crew of the MV Alpha, a ship detained with the help of the Indian coast guard, British authorities said. The authorities said they believe the attackers' boats came from this ship, and that they believe the ship is from Karachi, Pakistan.  • Karachi police say they have no evidence the attackers departed from their city. • Several Indian news outlets report a group called the Deccan Mujahideen e-mailed them to claim responsibility. Intelligence officials say little is known about the group. U.S. officials and security analysts say the sophistication of the attacks may indicate a more-established group is responsible.  • State media Press Trust of India, citing Union Cabinet Minister Kapil Sibal, reported the gunmen had worked for months to prepare, even setting up ""control rooms"" in the two luxury hotels that were targeted.","Gunmen arrived by boats, split into at least three groups, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded on October 11 to The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the body overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical arsenal. Since its creation in 1993, OPCW has helped eliminate roughly 80% of world's declared chemical stockpile -- a remarkable achievement. The spotlight on OPCW underlines the role that science and technology can play in driving groundbreaking diplomatic breakthroughs. To be sure, this is not a fundamentally new idea. For instance, the European Union, last year's winner of the Nobel Prize, has used energy research to promote peace and prosperity on the continent since at least 1957 when the EURATOM Treaty was signed. What is changing rapidly, however, is the potential for scientific diplomacy to move beyond state-to-state contact to a much broader array of actors. This is especially true of the science education community, including higher education and research. Science, in terms of research output and quality of higher education, is becoming an increasingly key factor in international relations. It is now playing a major role in tackling key global challenges, from climate change to conflict resolution. Indeed, in the case of Syria, science will not only help destroy the country's stockpile of chemical weapons, but also played a major role in providing irrefutable evidence that they were used in the first place. Remarkably, technology now allows us to detect complex chemicals through satellite measurements in areas where conflict is taking place, in addition to computing the gases that enable these chemicals to be dispersed in the first place. To further catalyze the potential of science diplomacy, states should consider endorsing the idea of ""science immunity,"" an analogy with diplomatic immunity which I know has so much value from my time as an ambassador. Taking this bold move could lead to the creation of ""science diplomatic passports."" This would allow properly accredited researchers to circulate more freely, and without political interference, than is often the case due to restrictive work and travel visa regimes. This is important for at least two reasons. Firstly, the decisive breakthroughs in science are increasingly being achieved through international partnership and funding, and we must embrace this. Take the example of the landmark discovery last year by Delft University of the Majorana particle. This groundbreaking research, which heralds major progress toward the development of the world's first quantum computer, was the result of a collaborative effort by a Dutch PhD student and a Chinese colleague. In today's world, national borders are becoming irrelevant. Such partnerships are the norm. The second inter-related reason why the scientific passport could be so important is the sea-change in the geographical map of science. The pioneering work of the Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge Research Project underlines this vividly. In 1973, about two thirds of the nearly 400,000 academic research publications indexed by Thomson Reuters came from the G7 countries. Today, four times as many documents (around 1.75 million journal publications) are being indexed, and half originate from outside the G7. What this underlines is the growing diffusion of knowledge which could be a massive driver of global economic prosperity in coming decades. In classical economic growth theory, factors such as population growth and age composition, alongside presence of arable land and raw materials, are long term determinants of economic growth patterns. Recent economic history, however, shows that investment levels in science, through research and development and higher education, are highly relevant in explaining emerging growth patterns -- and, therefore, influential in shaping patterns of international relations too. Somewhat provocatively the argument could be developed further by the following: whereas Von Clausewitz stated that war is the continuation of politics/diplomacy with military means, one could say that science is continuation of politics/diplomacy with (often) more academic intellect. Therefore science is, or at least should be, increasingly at the center of diplomacy as an objective as well as an instrument. In practice, science can help diplomacy through the establishment of working relations and exchanges between states, and development of the growing global store of knowledge, with a continuous quest for research breakthroughs. Equally, diplomacy can help science in connecting people, creating access and promoting big science infrastructure. Taken overall, it is clear that science, research and higher education are key to our shared future and prosperity. We must now unleash its full potential to address the growing range of global challenges humanity will face in the coming decades.

"(EW.com) -- Well, that worked. Produced for only $5 million, Paramount's ""Paranormal Activity 3"" surpassed everyone's expectations and opened to a staggering $54 million, according to studio estimates. That's the biggest October debut ever, beating the $50.4 million opening of last year's equally scary ""Jackass 3-D."" Paramount is also claiming that ""PA3"" clinched the best horror opening ever, topping ""Paranormal Activity 2""'s $40.7 million. But that record depends on how strictly one defines the horror genre. For instance, is ""I Am Legend"" more of a sci-fi or horror film? If you consider it to be the latter, then ""I Am Legend"" holds the horror record with its $77.2 million debut. Regardless, no matter how you look at it, ""PA3"" posted some huge numbers this weekend. The R-rated horror prequel secured the best opening since ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" premiered to $54.8 million in early August, and it essentially gave the box office a shot of adrenaline after two months of lackluster results. The series continued to attract a large proportion of younger moviegoers, with 53 percent of the audience under the age of 25. However, ""PA3"" skewed slightly older than ""PA2,"" which drew an audience that was 60 percent under age 25. Surprisingly, ""PA3"" received a poor ""C+"" rating from CinemaScore graders. Horror films are frequently saddled with underwhelming grades from the market research firm, but by comparison, ""PA2"" earned a more respectable ""B"" rating. Normally, ""PA3""'s low CinemaScore mark would foreshadow a significant drop next week. But considering that next weekend is Halloween weekend, and there won't be a ""Saw"" movie (or any other horror film) to compete with it, ""PA3"" may actually hold up fairly well. Like the house that always handed out raisins for Halloween, the weekend's two other new releases -- ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""Johnny English Reborn"" -- attracted very few visitors. ""The Three Musketeers,"" helmed by ""Resident Evil"" director Paul W.S. Anderson, had to settle for fourth place with just $8.8 million. The PG-13 steampunk action film joined ""What's Your Number?,"" ""Mars Needs Moms,"" ""Fright Night,"" and ""Apollo 18"" to become the fifth movie this year to open to less than $10 million while playing in at least 3,000 theaters. The movie failed to entice younger moviegoers, as only 36 percent of its audience was under the age of 25. Milla Jovovich, who stars in ""Musketeers"" and is married to Anderson, took to Twitter to accuse distributor Summit Entertainment of not properly marketing the film as a ""fun family adventure."" The poorly reviewed movie garnered an okay ""B"" rating from CinemaScore graders. Even before reaching American shores, the British spy comedy sequel ""Johnny English Reborn"" had already surpassed its $45 million budget by grossing $85.1 million overseas. Still, its $3.8 million opening (and eighth-place finish) this weekend is a disappointment, especially considering that the original ""Johnny English"" debuted to $9.1 million back in 2003. CinemaScore participants gave the PG-rated flick a ""B"" grade. Second and third place went to holdovers ""Real Steel"" and ""Footloose,"" which tallied $11.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively. Both movies, along with ""The Ides of March"" in fifth place, dropped only about 30 percent from last week -- an indication of strong word of mouth. In semi-wide release, the G-rated basketball drama ""The Mighty Macs"" opened to $1.1 million at 975 theaters, for a paltry per-location average of $1,090. Among limited releases, two new movies stood out. The Wall Street thriller ""Margin Call"" collected a solid $582,000 from 56 locations. And the Sundance drama ""Martha Marcy May Marlene,"" featuring a breakout performance by Elizabeth Olsen, grossed $138,000 from four theaters for a superb $34,500 per-location average. 1.

"(CNN) -- The arrest of R&B singer Mario for allegedly assaulting his mother was ""an unfortunate incident between a loving son and a mother who continues to struggle with a devastating addiction,"" his lawyer said Saturday. Mario, 24, was charged with second degree assault after police were called to a Baltimore, Maryland high-rise apartment complex with a report of ""a mental case breaking up property inside"" an apartment early Friday. Shawntia Hardaway, who was waiting in theground-floor lobby, told authorities that her 24-year-old son was in the apartment ""throwing and damaging property,"" the police report said. ""Anyone who has waged the battle to save loved ones from the forces of drugs knows the irrational behavior that almost always accompanies their actions,"" said Hassan Murphy, Mario's Baltimore attorney, on Saturday. ""Despite the allegations, Mario remains committed to supporting his mother."" On Friday, Hardaway said her son ""started yelling at her and he used his hands and forearms and pushed her in the chest and shoulder area causing minor pain and discomfort,"" according to police. Police found a ""severely damaged"" china cabinet, a broken mirror, a busted door and ""a lot of glass lying on the floor"" when they entered the apartment, the report said. After his mother told police she feared for her life, they arrested Mario and booked him on a second degree assault charge, police said. Mario's troubled relationship with his mother was the subject of an award-winning TV documentary in 2007.

"(CNN) -- The European Court of Human Rights declined Monday to rule on the key points of a claim against Russia by relatives of victims of the 1940 Katyn massacre, but did rebuke Russia for refusing to hand over all of its files on the incident. The court said it did not have the authority to rule on whether Russia had deprived the victims of their right to life because the World War II massacre happened before Russia joined the European Convention on Human Rights. Russian lawmakers say Stalin ordered massacre of Polish soldiers . It also said the facts of the massacre were well established as a matter of historical record.

In 1990, Russia finally admitted to what many in Poland had long suspected: The Soviet Union secretly murdered as many as 22,000 Polish soldiers and civilians in the early days of World War II in an attempt to pre-emptively suppress a Polish rebellion against communist rule. That year, Russian prosecutors also launched a criminal case into the killings, but that case was closed in 2004.

"The Hague, Netherlands (CNN) -- Ratko Mladic, who is accused of orchestrating a horrific campaign of ethnic cleansing during the bloody civil war that ripped apart Yugoslavia, showed no remorse as his war crimes trial opened Wednesday, at one point even appearing to threaten victims in the court. The former general drew his hand across his neck as if cutting a throat while staring at victims of the war that introduced the phrase ""ethnic cleansing."" At other times, the man accused of being ""the Butcher of Bosnia"" stared at them, fire in his eyes, and he once growled at the survivors. The 70-year-old former Bosnian Serb general has been indicted on 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1992-95 war. His trial is taking place at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, Netherlands, a special court established to try those responsible for atrocities during the war. Prosecutors say Mladic's campaign included the massacre of 8,000 Muslims in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. On Wednesday, prosecutor Dermot Groome laid out details of the case against Mladic, saying that ethnic cleansing was not a byproduct of the war, but a specific aim of the Bosnian Serb leadership. He will set out to show that Mladic was directly responsible for atrocities carried out by his forces, who were fighting for control of land in ethnically mixed Bosnia. Sexual violence was a weapon of war, Groome said, describing a woman who said she had been raped more than 50 times, and women who were forced by Bosnian Serb forces to perform sex acts on members of their own families. Prosecutors will use survivor testimonies and video clips to make their case at a trial that is likely to last for months or years. Among those in the courtroom were the families of Srebrenica victims. ""Victims have waited nearly two decades to see Ratko Mladic in the dock,"" Param-Preet Singh, senior counsel in the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch, said ahead of the trial. ""His trial should lay to rest the notion that those accused of atrocity crimes can run out the clock on justice."" 2011: Ratko Mladic captured . Mladic's trial begins after a landmark war crimes ruling last month, when another international tribunal found former Liberian President Charles Taylor guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone's notoriously brutal civil war. Taylor got a final chance to address his court Wednesday as Mladic's trial opened, and he said he was ""saddened"" by a verdict that he portrayed as unfair. ""Both trials are evidence of the growing international trend to hold perpetrators of atrocities to account, no matter how senior their position,"" Human Rights Watch said. Mladic eluded authorities for nearly 16 years until his capture in May 2011, when police burst into the garden of a small house in northern Serbia. Europe's highest-ranking war crimes suspect was discovered standing against a wall in a utility room normally used for storing farm equipment, according to a government minister. Though he was carrying two handguns, he surrendered without a fight. He was extradited for trial in the Netherlands. But from day one in custody, he has exhibited defiance and appears not to have relinquished his visceral antagonism toward his enemies. Before the trial that started Wednesday, he also drew a finger across his throat in court, a gesture aimed at some of the Srebrenica widows. At other times, he disrupted proceedings by putting on a hat in the courtroom and refusing to enter a plea. He has sought delays in his trial and said he is in failing health. In July 1995, Mladic was in command of the Bosnian Serb army and led his soldiers into the town of Srebrenica. In the days that followed, the soldiers systematically slaughtered nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys. Bosnia peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke once described Mladic as ""one of those lethal combinations that history thrusts up occasionally -- a charismatic murderer."" In the three decades leading up to the violent splintering of Yugoslavia, Mladic rose rapidly through the ranks of the Yugoslav army. In 1991, he served as a front-line commander spearheading Serb forces in a yearlong war with Croatia. By the time he took to Bosnia's battlefields, he had become a hero to many Serbs, seen as a defender of their dwindling fortunes. In May 1992, Bosnia's Serbian political leaders picked him to lead the assault on their Muslim enemies who clamored for independence. Robertson: Bosnia's future is tied to justice . Mladic wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces in a siege of Sarajevo, cutting the city off from the outside world. Serb forces pounded the city every day from higher ground positions, trapping Sarajevo's ill-prepared residents in the valley below. More than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, perished. Some observers conjured images of Sarajevo in describing Syrian attacks on the besieged city of Homs earlier this year. As the war ended in the fall of 1995, Mladic went on the run. Shortly after Mladic was sent to The Hague last year, authorities nabbed former Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic. He was the last Yugoslav war crimes suspect at large. Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested in 2008. And Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001 but died before his trial could be completed.","NEW: Alleged war criminal Ratko Mladic gestures an apparent threat to victims in court .

"(CNN) -- The voice on telephone messages left for Manti Te'o matches that of the 22-year-old man who says he posed as a woman in carrying on a relationship -- by e-mail and over the phone -- with the Notre Dame linebacker, according to the ""Dr. Phil"" show. ""They all say, with scientific certainty, that Ronaiah Tuiasosopo is the female voice in those recordings,"" host Phil McGraw said, citing conclusions by forensic voice analysts with three independent contractors. That conclusion supports Tuiasosopo's assertion that, posing as a woman, he was involved in a relationship with Te'o, who had not known that his love interest was a man. Te'o rose to prominence while leading Notre Dame's Fighting Irish to an undefeated regular season. This year's Heisman Trophy runner-up, he told interviewers in September and October that his grandmother and girlfriend, whom he described as a 22-year-old Stanford University student, had died within hours of each other. The sports website Deadspin broke the story last month that the girlfriend Te'o talked about wasn't real. McGraw reported in the first part of the two-part interview, which aired Thursday, that the voice analysts had concluded that the voice used by Tuiasosopo in the interview was likely not that of the person who had left the voice mail messages on the gridiron star's answering machine. McGraw asked the confessed hoaxer repeatedly to adopt the female voice he said he had used with Te'o in order to prove that it was he, but Tuiasosopo refused, saying he was not comfortable appearing on camera sounding like a woman. Te'o to Couric: My emotions were real . A first attempt at overcoming his objection -- putting Tuiasosopo behind a screen in McGraw's home, where the interview took place -- resulted in equivocal findings from the voice analysts. But when the venue was switched to Tuiasosopo's house, where he said he had made the calls to Te'o, the results were uniformly in agreement, McGraw said. Tuiasosopo told McGraw that the ruse had its roots in sexual abuse he endured from someone close to his family that began when he was 12 years of age. ""It started off with a hand and then touching and stuff like that,"" he told the talk show host in the segment that aired Friday. ""I didn't know what was going on."" Tuiasosopo said he kept to himself knowledge of the abuse, which escalated to rape, out of fear that his parents would become angry if they were to find out and that it might drive his father -- who was already out of town much of the time -- to leave. ""I knew that I could not go forward with that,"" he said. Tuiasosopo said he went on to create an alter persona -- the fictional Lennay Kekua. ""I felt that I couldn't do things, accomplish things, pursue things, live out as Ronaiah,"" Tuiasosopo said to McGraw. ""And I felt the need to create this. It has everything to do with what I went through as a child and my experience with child molestation and abuse."" Asked why he had not created a fictional man instead, he said that it was because he had been ""abused as if I was a girl."" In the initial segment, which aired Thursday, Tuiasosopo said the athlete knew nothing about the ruse. ""He had no idea,"" he said. Te'o has said he was not a part of the hoax. Asked whether he was in love with Te'o, Tuiasosopo said: ""I mean, yeah ... as twisted and confusing as it may be, yeah, I cared for this person. I did all that I could to help this person become a better person, even though I wasn't getting nothing out of it. Of course, it's very shameful and it's very painful to even talk about. Even now, it's hard to talk about. But, you know, the truth of it is that that happened. I grew feelings. I grew emotions that, sooner or later, I couldn't control any more."" Asked whether he is gay, Tuiasosopo said, ""I would say, yeah, I am gay, but honestly, I am so confused, I'm so lost."" Bleacher Report: Twitter Erupts as Hoaxer Tells Story to Dr. Phil . Tuiasosopo said the relationship began after he started a Facebook page under the name Lennay Kekua, the first name an elision of his mother's and grandmother's first names and the last name one he had heard ""thrown around in the neighborhood."" He said he ""randomly added different people"" as Facebook friends with the persona he had created. ""One of the people I happened to add was his cousin,"" he said, referring to Te'o's cousin. ""Shortly after, I got a friend request, and it was from Manti."" They began speaking nightly, and Te'o seemed to have been smitten, too, Tuiasosopo said. ""He really had fallen in love with this, we'll say, character."" A love story unravels . Tuiasosopo said his motives were pure; he never tried to make money off their relationship. ""I just wanted to help him become better,"" he said. The charade became difficult to maintain, and he tried to end it several times. ""There are many times where Manti and Lennay had broken up. But something would bring them back together, whether it was something going on in his life or Lennay's life, in this case in my life,"" Tuiasosopo said. He added: ""I wanted to end it because after everything I had gone through I wanted to move on with my life. Me, Ronaiah, I had to just start living and let this go."" Finally, after learning that Te'o had Skyped with four women -- including two of his former girlfriends -- Tuiasosopo said he essentially killed off Lennay, having her die of leukemia. ""I was just trying to do everything to end it because I knew that, no matter what, you know, it just wasn't right -- and it was never going to be."" Who's who on the Internet? Who knows . In Friday's segment, Tuiasosopo apologized to all those he hurt, including Te'o, Teo's family and his own family. ""I can't express how sorry I am,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A day after he won a new trial in the murder of a 15-year-old girl, Michael Skakel, the nephew of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, filed a bond motion Thursday asking he be released from prison pending a second trial's outcome. The motion asks the court to set a bond in an amount ""no greater than $500,000 cash or surety."" Skakel, 53, who has spent more than a decade behind bars, is accused of killing Martha Moxley with a golf club in 1975. Twenty-seven years after her death, he was convicted and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. For years, Skakel fought unsuccessfully for his conviction to be overturned. On Wednesday, a Connecticut judge ordered Skakel's conviction to be set aside, ruling that the defense in the 2002 trial had been inadequate. Timeline: Michael Skakel . State's Attorney John Smriga said prosecutors planned to appeal the ruling. Skakel poses no flight risk and has maintained strong ties to the community throughout his imprisonment, his motion argued. Skakel has a 14-year-old son ""with whom he maintains close contact and has remained actively involved in his rearing, to the extent possible from prison,"" the motion said. His continued incarceration isn't ""necessary to protect"" the public or the Moxley family, which now resides outside of Connecticut, court papers said. Skakel would agree to electronic monitoring upon release from prison, the motion said. Prior to his trial, Skakel voluntarily surrendered to authorities in January 2000, and when he was released on bond after that arrest, ""he never failed to attend court,"" the motion said. John Moxley, Martha Moxley's brother, told CNN Thursday that he still believes that Skakel is guilty and would be opposed to his release from prison. ""My mother and I wouldn't be in favor of bail, but you know, the reality is, we have no control over it,"" Moxley told CNN's ""AC360."" ""And I can't let myself get consumed, and my mother's not going to get consumed, by stuff that's out of our control. ... If it comes to a trial, we'll be there supporting the state of Connecticut."" Moxley's body was found in 1975 after a night of partying with Skakel, his older brother Tommy and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. Authorities said she was bludgeoned and stabbed to death; a broken golf club was found near her body. The case languished for more than two decades. A series of books on the high-profile crime renewed interest, leading to new tips and a new suspect in January 2000: Skakel, who was 15 at the time of the killing. Skakel has always proclaimed his innocence. But a jury convicted Skakel of murder on June 7, 2002. He is behind bars at the MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield, Connecticut.

"Editor's note: Ken Ballen is president of Terror Free Tomorrow: The Center for Public Opinion, a nonprofit institute that researches attitudes toward extremism. Patrick Doherty is deputy director of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation, a think tank that promotes ideas across the ideological spectrum. Kenneth Ballen says whoever won the election, Iranians strongly favor free elections and a free press. (CNN) -- In a poll conducted three weeks before Iran's June 12 vote, our nonprofit organizations found a consensus among Iranians, including almost all of those who told us they would vote for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. And that consensus is that Iranians want a truly democratic system. Given Iranians' own priorities for their government, the events of the past few days may ultimately weaken President Ahmadinejad's standing -- even among those who did vote to re-elect him. In fact, our survey found that more than 86 percent of Iranians who said they would vote for Ahmadinejad also chose ensuring free elections and a free press as among the most important priorities they have for the Iranian government. The recent events -- the early announcements of election returns, the shutting down of communications networks, the massive protests and now the bloodshed -- have the potential to change what was once an electoral contest into a broader struggle for the soul of the Islamic Republic and the future of Iran itself. Let us be clear: Our polling indicates that the government's actions run counter to the priorities of almost all Iranians, including its own supporters. And our survey shows beyond dispute that Iranians of all political persuasions want more democratic freedoms, not less. Our op-ed published on Monday has drawn much attention -- and misunderstanding. Our nonprofit organizations conducted the only independent and transparent nationwide public opinion survey in Iran before the June 12 vote. The poll found that Ahmadinejad was leading his nearest opponent, the more reform-minded candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, by a more than 2-to-1 margin, with almost a third undecided. Our poll concluded three weeks before the election. It does not predict the final vote, nor does it measure a possible surge for Moussavi, which many believe occurred in the final weeks. Instead, as we wrote on Monday, our survey indicates ""the possibility that the vote is not the product of widespread fraud"" because of Ahmadinejad's formidable early lead. This single finding, however, has obscured our most important findings, and their significance to what is now enfolding in Iran. Nearly 80 percent want the right to vote for all their leaders, including the all-powerful supreme leader, while nearly 90 percent chose free elections and a free press as the most important goals they have for their government -- virtually tied with the top priority of improving the Iranian economy. And here is the most important fact of all: More than 86 percent of those who told us they support Ahmadinejad also choose free elections and a free press as their most important priorities for their leaders. In other words, in our survey, Ahmadinejad supporters back real democratic reforms in Iran as much as supporters of the more avowedly reform candidate Moussavi. Put all together, our polling shows that Ahmadinejad, running a competent campaign, may have had enough support three weeks before the vote to possibly win the election under the electoral rules as they stood. With Ahmadinejad's early lead, it is possible that the vote reported did actually reflect the will of the Iranian people, though now, it is impossible to know. Analysts pore over ""ambiguous"" election results . Yet the government's actions since the election may have changed the debate in Iran from being about candidates to being about democracy. While we do not know whether the election results were rigged, the government's handling of the election itself runs counter to principles of democracy, free press and free elections -- goals our polling shows almost all Iranians, whether or not they support Ahmadinejad, strongly support. Moussavi appears to understand this. Yesterday in a massive rally in Tehran, Moussavi stated as much, saying ""The vote of the people is more important than Moussavi or any other person."" Meanwhile, the subsequent killing of protesters by government security forces will likely only work against Ahmadinejad and by extension now, the supreme leader, even among more than 86 percent of their supporters. While our poll showed Ahmadinejad with an early commanding lead, by the government's post-election response, the irony is that Ahmadinejad may indeed end up stealing the election -- from himself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ken Ballen and Patrick Doherty.","Ballen, Doherty: Iranians, including Ahmadinejad backers, want more democracy .
They say their poll can't determine whether Moussavi had a late surge .
They say government actions have shifted debate to democracy not to who won ."
"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A bomb planted on a bicycle at a political rally in southwestern Pakistan's volatile Balochistan province killed seven people and wounded 12 on Friday, a senior police official said.

The provincial leader, Aurangzaib Kasi, was among the wounded, he said. While there was no immediate claim of responsibility, authorities believe Kasi was targeted because of his party's platform opposing extremism in Pakistan.

"Dongguan, China (CNN) -- They built it, but the shoppers didn't come. New South China Mall in Guangdong Province opened in 2005. With 5 million square feet of shopping area, the mall can accommodate 2,350 stores, making it the largest shopping center in the world in terms of leasable space -- more than twice the size of Mall of America, the biggest shopping center in the United States. At the outdoor plaza, hundreds of palm-trees blend with a replica Arc de Triomphe, a giant Egyptian sphinx, fountains and long-stretching canals with gondolas. Only problem is, the mall is virtually deserted. Despite the bombastic design and grand plans, only a handful of stores are occupied. ""Most of it empty, with little consumer traffic and a high vacancy rate,"" according to a report last year by Emporis, a global building data firm. ""It has been classified as a 'dead mall.'"" Walking among shattered shops -- its dusty corridors and escalators covered in soiled sheets -- is a walk through a ghost mall. Rubbish piles up along the sides, paint is coming off the walls and store signs and advertisements have faded. The mall's indoor amusement park, staff lay half asleep over counters or kill time chatting with each other while the 1,814-foot rollercoaster roars above. Opened for the public in 2005, developers expected to attract some 100,000 visitors a day. But eight years later, the few people that visit the mall today typically hang out at the American fast food restaurants near the entrance or at the IMAX cinema outside the mall. Some parents bring their children to the Teletubbies Edutainment Center. Part of the problem is location. Dongguan is a factory town and most of its almost 10 million inhabitants are migrant workers struggling to make ends meet. ""People coming here to work in factories don't have the time or the money for shopping or the rollercoaster,"" said a migrant worker in his 20s, surnamed Xiao, who works at the mall. The deserted mall is also a symbol of China's rapid urbanization and runaway investment in real estate projects, where massive development projects have been given the go ahead without proper marketing and business research. ""To me, many of these projects are a result of easy access to capital and a combination of wishful thinking and speculative behavior rather than rational business calculations,"" said Victor Teo, assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong. ""This mall is not the only one that is like that. Elsewhere in China there is the phenomenon of 'Ghost Towns', that is to say infrastructure projects, both residential and commercial, with no takers."" The credit boom of post-financial crisis stimulus has resulted in a proliferation of empty commercial developments and apartments built on rampant speculation. Yet why is the Chinese economy still moving at a brisk 7% to 8% growth rate? ""What China did in the stimulus credit boom is create a lot of `ghost cities': projects without a strong commercial foundation, and projects that didn't get done,"" wrote Jonathan Anderson in a research note entitled ""Hurray for Ghost Cities"" from Emerging Advisors Group last month. ""What happens next? ""In most of the economy ... nothing. You haven't created a lot of new productive capacity; you're not driving down profits and returns in manufacturing and services, and you've left plenty of room for a rebound in the market-oriented property space. ""Rather, for all intents and purposes you just took the money and poured it down a black hole,"" Anderson wrote. And the Chinese banking system ""has surprisingly little trouble absorbing that bad debt."" But while the macroeconomic juggernaut of China marches on, there remain regional areas of woe. Dongguan is facing mounting problems as factories close down and manufacturing moves to other cities in China and abroad which offer cheaper labor. Still, the mall has plans to boost the number of tenants, said Ye Ji Ning, head of New South China Mall's investment unit. He claims the mall has a 20% occupancy rate measured by commercial area, although Ye declined to give specifics when challenged on that number. The company's goal is to increase occupancy to 80% in 2013, he said. ""From March onwards we will have big promotional activities in order to reach our new leasing targets,"" Ye said. It's not the first time the owners try to blow life into the sleeping giant. The mall was initially headed by Dongguan native Alex Hu Guirong, who became a billionaire in the instant noodle business, and later sold to the Founders Group, a conglomerate set up by Peking University. In a 2007 relaunch, the mall changed name from ""South China Mall"" to ""New South China Mall, Living City"" and a revitalization plan was drawn up. But after the relaunch, neither shoppers nor tenants came.","The New South China Mall in Guangdong Province is the world's largest mall .

"(CNN) -- Among the entertainers who have donated their energies to the USO in recent years are Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, Scarlett Johansson, Kid Rock, Queensryche, Toby Keith, Lewis Black and Robin Williams. Stephen Colbert's trip to Iraq, facilitated by the USO, was six months in the planning. But when the USO conducts a public opinion survey asking people who they think of when the military service organization is mentioned, one name always comes up. ""The first thing out of their mouths is 'Bob Hope,' "" said Mark Phillips, the USO's vice president for communications, with an audible shrug. ""And if they're not part of the military, the list stops there."" As the country celebrates Independence Day and pays tribute to the men and women who serve in its armed forces, the USO is trying to change that mindset. The organization, which was founded in 1941 to bring comfort and entertainment to America's men and women in uniform, has been focusing its support on American troops stationed around the world, particularly those in the military theaters of Iraq and Afghanistan, said Phillips. As part of that initiative, it's paying a great deal of attention to the troops' desires, whether they be for high technology -- the USO recently brought video game/HDTV entertainment centers and satellite-based telephone systems to some areas -- or a diversity of entertainers, including rappers and NFL players. The Colbert trip was a meeting of the minds between the Comedy Central star and the military, said Rachel Tischler, the USO's vice president for entertainment operations. The ""Colbert Report"" host, who has attested to his interest in Iraq in such venues as Newsweek magazine (he was a guest editor last month), expressed interest in going, a request that made its way up the chain of command to Gen. David Petraeus, the former leader of coalition forces in Iraq. Petraeus liked the idea, said Tischler, and the principals were put in touch with the USO. Colbert's excursion, which the comedian called ""Operation Iraqi Stephen,"" was unusual for the USO, she added. ""We try to keep our footprint small,"" she said, noting that the organization is reliant on the military to feed and house its guests. In ""Colbert's"" case, the footprint was considerably larger: Colbert's staff and several USO employees -- not to mention 150 volunteers. The trip required six months of planning. But the broadcasts went well, with Colbert paying tribute to the military and the USO's volunteers (as well as his own staff) on the ""Report."" He also put in a plug for USO donations: ""The USO does more than bring my show to Baghdad,"" Colbert said on the show. ""They also deliver much-needed care packages to the troops."" (Whereupon, in a care-package primer, Colbert and Tom Hanks filled a box with shaving gel, Tang and a demolished ice sculpture.) The group remains greatly dependent on the kindness of strangers, said Phillips. ""We're primarily a volunteer organization,"" he said, noting the USO has fewer than 400 paid employees and 25,000 volunteers. Though the USO does receive a small congressional appropriation -- $20 million in 2008 -- much of its funding comes from individuals, corporations and in the form of in-kind services. Jamie Masada, the owner of Los Angeles' Laugh Factory comedy club, said the organization is close to his heart. He followed a tour of Laugh Factory comedians with an invitation to service members to visit his club. ""What we try to do is give the soldiers -- the people that are out there putting their lives on the line for our country ... we try to say, one day if you come to Los Angeles, if you want to be a comedian, our door is open to you. We want you to send us some material, some jokes,"" he said. At a recent USO fundraiser, five service members were given the opportunity to compete for the title of ""funniest service member."" The group was given advice from several notable comedians, including Tom Dreesen and Paul Rodriguez, and the winner received cash, gift certificates and a performance at the club, complete with name on the marquee. A number of performers return again and again. Toby Keith has gone on at least seven USO tours; ""He insists on going to the smallest, most remote places,"" said Phillips. Actor Gary Sinise and his Lt. Dan Band are also frequent participants. ""There aren't enough words to describe just how grateful I am to our nation's troops,"" said Keith in a press release before this year's tour. ""I've participated in several USO tours over the years and I've seen firsthand their sacrifice. And I will not stop doing all I can to show my support and lift their spirits."" Many entertainers shy away from publicity, particularly on the home front. ""We have celebrities come to Bethesda Naval Hospital, Walter Reed ... and they almost always insist we don't talk about [the visits],"" said Tischler. At its core, Phillips said, the USO remains dedicated to the needs of U.S. service members. ""Service members in Iraq and Afghanistan are frequently at small, remote bases,"" said Phillips. ""There's little in the way of creature comforts. Those are the things we try to deliver.""","USO often brings thoughts of Bob Hope, but organization well beyond that .

"(CNN) -- ""Harry Potter"" creator J.K. Rowling donned an invisibility cloak of her own for her new novel. In top-secret fashion, she published ""The Cuckoo's Calling"" under the name Robert Galbraith. Her publisher, Mulholland Books -- an imprint of Little, Brown and Company -- described the author as a former member of the Special Investigative Branch of the Royal Military Police. ""He left the military in 2003 and has been working since then in the civilian security industry,"" the publisher's website said. ""The idea for (protagonist) Cormoran Strike grew directly out of his own experiences and those of his military friends who returned to the civilian world. 'Robert Galbraith' is a pseudonym."" The Sunday Times, curious about who this mystery novelist really was, connected the dots -- noting that ""he"" used an agent, editor and publisher who had worked with Rowling. ""I hoped to keep this secret a little longer, because being Robert Galbraith has been such a liberating experience!"" Rowling said in a statement. ""It has been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation and pure pleasure to get feedback from publishers and readers under a different name. Social class, swearing and sex permeate Rowling's 'Casual Vacancy' ""The upside of being rumbled is that I can publicly thank my editor David Shelley, who has been a true partner in crime, all those people at Little, Brown who have been working so hard on 'The Cuckoo's Calling' without realizing that I wrote it, and the writers and reviewers, both in the newspapers and online, who have been so generous to the novel. ""And to those who have asked for a sequel, Robert fully intends to keep writing the series, although he will probably continue to turn down personal appearances."" Rowling's daring leap . While the novel received praise before the secret was out, the disclosure that Rowling was the author -- to little surprise -- skyrocketed the book's sales. Reagan Arthur, publisher of Little, Brown and Company. said a reprint of the book is underway and will carry a revised author biography that reads 'Robert Galbraith is a pseudonym for J. K. Rowling.'

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A Georgia man was alone before his fatal fall from an upper level of Atlanta's Turner Field, police said Tuesday, as they continue to investigate his death. Ronald L. Homer, 30, was attending Monday night's Braves game against the Phillies. The Braves said they planned to observe a moment of silence for Homer before Tuesday's game. Four witnesses told officers that they saw Homer fall from the fourth level of the stadium during a rain delay in the game, the Atlanta Police Department said. ""All the witnesses stated that there was (sic) no other people around Mr. Homer when he fell,"" police said, adding there were no surveillance cameras at the scene. Police said the fall appeared to be accidental but that it was too early to tell if alcohol was a factor. Homer, of nearby Conyers, fell 65 feet into the players' parking lot. He was unconscious when emergency responders found him, but he died later at the hospital, police said. An autopsy on Homer is complete, but authorities are not releasing details, citing pending toxicology results, Tami Sedivy-Schroder, an investigator with the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office, said Tuesday. Results can take up to eight weeks, she said. Homer's mother, Connie Homer, told CNN affiliate WXIA that he was a big Braves fan who was attending the game with a friend. ""I'm just sick,"" she said. ""We're a very close family. He was big-hearted."" The game was scheduled to start at 7:10 p.m. but heavy rains pushed back the start time nearly two hours. His family said Homer went to the platform to smoke and may have lost his footing on the wet pavement, according to WXIA. Homer was 6 feet, 6 inches tall; the guard rail where he fell is 42 inches high, the industry standard and state code, WXIA reported. In a statement released Tuesday, the Atlanta Braves extended condolences to Homer's family. ""We are saddened by this tragic incident and will continue our investigation along with the Atlanta Police Department. We will have no further comment until the investigation is complete."" It's the second such death at an Atlanta sporting venue in the last year. On August 31, a Tennessee fan died after falling about 45 feet at the Georgia Dome during a college football game between North Carolina State and the University of Tennessee. In July 2011, a Texas fan died after falling 20 feet at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas, while trying to catch a ball thrown to him by outfielder Josh Hamilton.

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. As social media becomes the latest branding strategy, networking technique, job seeking tool and recruitment vehicle, it's also becoming the latest way for people to get job offers rescinded, reprimanded at work and even fired. Everyone has ""my-job-sucks"" moments, but it's probably best for your career not to have them online. It's happened so many times -- publicized and not -- that one would think we could learn from others' mistakes. (But, if that were the case, I wouldn't have anything to write about, now would I?) A recent Tweet by a potential Cisco employee, for example, turned ugly when he decided to tout a recent job offer: . ""Cisco just offered me a job! Now I have to weigh the utility of a fatty paycheck against the daily commute to San Jose and hating the work."" Unfortunately for ""theconnor"" (the handle for the would-be employee), Tim Levad, a ""channel partner advocate"" for Cisco, saw the tweet and responded with this: . ""Who is the hiring manger, I'm sure they would love to know that you will hate the work. We here at Cisco are versed in the Web."" Terrible tweets . Everyone has their ""My-job-sucks,"" ""I-hate-my-co-workers,"" or ""Give-me-more-money"" moments. But, they seem to forget that as employers increase their online presence using social networking sites as recruitment and branding strategies, it might be best for their career not to have these moments on the Internet. Paul Wilson, a freelance/corporate Web marketer and blogger, found several of such moments on Twitter, a social networking and micro-blogging site, and posted these ""Top 10 Tweets to Get You Fired"" [sic'd]: . 1. ""hate my job!! i want to tell my bosses how dumb they are and how meaningless this job is, then quit, and be happy!"" 2. ""So my job was to test all the food at the new resturant, can I just say, ughew. I'm going to taco bell then twistee treat."" 3. ""Workin... This job sucks worse then the economy!"" 4. ""I'm going to work! Walmart! Must find better job! I hate it when chicks there have a deeper voice than me and refer to me as foo!"" 5. ""Also I'm really bummed that I'm working today, i asked off so i could study but my boss is a ******* **** ***** ***** who can't read."" 6. ""Coworker smuggled out a chair for me. Currently being paid to SIT around and listen to John Barrowman on my iPod. I don't hate my job today!"" 7. ""having sex dreams of people you work with makes for an awkward day."" 8. ""smoking weed at work is so [EDITED] great :)"" 9. ""It's bad when you overhear the n00b programmer say ""I used to work at McDonalds with him"" and you wonder if he is talking about the CEO..."" 10. ""Huh, with my boss on twitter, maaaybe I should take down that sexy picture of her... but her reaction will be priceless!"" Facebook fired . Twitter is not the only culprit in career self-destruction. Facebook, a popular social networking site, has housed its fair share of user firings: . Kimberly Swann, a former employee for Ivell Marketing and Logistics of Clacton, U.K., thought her job was boring -- and she said so on her Facebook page, according to an article in The Daily Telegraph. Swann was called into her manager's office and handed a letter that cited her Facebook comments as the reason for dismissal: . ""Following your comments made on Facebook about your job and the company we feel it is better that, as you are not happy and do not enjoy your work we end your employment with Ivell Marketing & Logistics with immediate effect."" An MSNBC article remembers Kevin Colvin, the legendary young intern who e-mailed his boss, claiming a ""family emergency"" would keep him out of the office around Halloween. His co-workers (and Facebook friends), however, saw a photo of Colvin dressed as a fairy at a Halloween party time-stamped on the same day of the ""emergency."" Colvin's boss responded to him with an e-mail CC'd to the entire company, firing him and including the incriminating fairy picture. In March 2009, the same MSNBC article cites Dan Leone, a Philadelphia Eagles stadium employee, who was fired after slamming the football organization for trading a player in this status update: . ""Dan is [expletive] devastated about Dawkins signing with Denver. . .Dam Eagles R Retarted!![Sic]"" Two days later, the head of event operations said they needed to talk about his Facebook status; instead, he got the boot. Social networking don'ts . If you want to use your profile to get hired or -- or at least not get fired -- here are three basic rules to keep in mind: . 1. Don't announce interviews, raises or new jobs . As exemplified by ""theconnor,"" how you talk about any of these sensitive topics on your social networking site is key. If you're unemployed, writing ""Interview today -- wish me luck!"" would be OK, or if you got a job, something along the lines of ""So excited about my new job!"" is totally acceptable. If you're currently employed, however, I don't think your boss would be too happy to see something like, ""Trying to con my boss into giving me a $5K raise. SUCKA!"" 2. Don't badmouth your current or previous employer . Just like in an interview, keep your rants about your boss or company to yourself. If hiring managers see that you're willing to trash a colleague online they assume you'll do it to them, too. Plus, there's always the possibility of getting fired if someone sees your negative comments. 3. Don't mention your job search if you're still employed . If your boss knows you're on the lookout for a new job, feel free to advertise it in your status. If you're keeping your search below the radar, however, don't publish anything, anywhere. Even if you aren't connected to your boss online, somebody can get the information back to him or her. Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Russia's lower house of parliament has approved a resolution recognizing that Josef Stalin's regime was responsible for the 1940 massacre of more than 20,000 Polish officers, signaling a thawing of relations between Poland and Russia, state media reported. In a written statement, Poland's Foreign Ministry said it welcomed the resolution titled ""Katyn Tragedy and Its Victims,""  adopted by the State Duma of the Russian Federation on Saturday. ""Acknowledging the Stalinist totalitarian regime's accountability for this unprecedented massacre is the Russian Parliament's important gesture, signifying that we are making progress on the way to reconciliation between our countries and peoples,"" said the statement. ""This gesture proves that there is no turning back from the truth-based dialogue between Poland and Russia,"" the statement said. Documents that had been stored in secret archives for years show that the ""massacre was committed on the direct orders of Stalin,"" a draft of the declaration says, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. The masterminding of the Katyn Massacre has been a lingering, contentious issue between the two former communist nations. The World War II massacre, in which an estimated 20,000 Polish officers were murdered at point blank in the village of Katyn, has tainted Russian-Polish relations. The Duma's Friday vote comes as Russian President Dmitry Medvedev prepares to travel to Poland in December. For decades, the Soviet government blamed the killings on Nazi Germany. In 1990, Russia finally admitted to what many in Poland had long suspected: The Soviet Union secretly murdered as many as 22,000 Polish soldiers and civilians in the early days of World War II in an attempt to pre-emptively suppress a Polish rebellion against communist rule. That year, Russian prosecutors also launched a criminal case into the killings, but that case was closed in 2004. Since then, the country has handed over some investigation files to Polish officials. This year, a 2007 film about the massacre aired on Russian television for the first time. But some Russian lawmakers say the issue is still in dispute. Communists, who opposed the declaration, claim German authorities actually executed the Polish soldiers. The party's leader has dubbed attempts to blame Stalin part of ""Soviet history falsification"" as part of an ""ideological war,"" RIA Novosti reported. Former Polish President Lech Kaczynski was killed in a plane crash earlier this year when he was headed to a memorial at the massacre site. Kaczynski, 60, had been traveling with a Polish delegation to Russia to commemorate the massacre's 70th anniversary. His wife and several top military officials were also killed in the crash.","NEW: Poland welcomes the resolution, foreign ministry says .

"(CNN) -- Can killer whales sue SeaWorld for enslavement? A lawsuit filed Wednesday by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and other ""next friends"" of five SeaWorld killer whales takes that novel legal approach. The 20-page complaint asks the U.S. District Court in Southern California to declare that the five whales -- Tilikum, Katina, Corky, Kasatka, and Ulises -- are being held in slavery or involuntary servitude in violation of the 13th Amendment. A PETA statement said the lawsuit is the first of its kind in contending that constitutional protections against slavery are not limited to humans. ""Plaintiffs were forcibly taken from their families and natural habitats, are held captive at SeaWorld San Diego and SeaWorld Orlando, denied everything that is natural to them, subjected to artificial insemination or sperm collection to breed performers for defendants' shows, and forced to perform, all for defendants' profit,"" the lawsuit says, arguing that those conditions amount to enslavement and/or forced servitude. A SeaWorld statement called the lawsuit a baseless publicity stunt by PETA, which is known for provocative advertisements and public demonstrations on behalf of animal rights. At the heart of the lawsuit is the question of whether a non-human entity can sue for a violation of constitutional rights. The 13th Amendment outlaws slavery and ""involuntary servitude"" in the United States without any specific mention that it applies only to people. ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction,"" says the amendment's first section. In its statement, PETA called the lawsuit ""the first ever seeking to apply the Thirteenth Amendment to non-human animals."" The lawsuit seeks an order for the release of the whales ""from bondage"" and a permanent order against holding them in slavery, as well as appointment of a legal guardian to carry out the transfer of the whales to a suitable habitat. In addition, it seeks attorneys' fees and costs. The ""next friends"" joining PETA in representing the killer whales are three marine mammal experts, including Ric O'Barry, who was featured in the Academy Award-winning documentary ""The Cove"" about dolphin-hunting in Japan, and two former Sea World trainers. Their lawsuit contends killer whales -- Orcinus orca, the largest species of the dolphin family -- ""possess sophisticated learning, problem solving, and communicative abilities,"" as well as ""distinctive cultural traits."" In a statement responding to the lawsuit, SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment said the court case challenges ""the public's right to enjoy and learn more about marine mammals."" ""This effort to extend the Thirteenth Amendment's solemn protections beyond human beings is baseless and in many ways offensive,"" the statement says. SeaWorld is ""among the world's most respected zoological institutions,"" it continues, adding that SeaWorld parks ""are fully accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums"" with legal permission to display marine mammals. ""PETA has once again showed that it prefers publicity stunts to the hard work of caring for, rescuing and helping animals,"" the SeaWorld statement said. State and federal courts have traditionally understood laws dealing with animal ownership and cruelty as applying only to human actions, meaning the animals themselves could neither be prosecuted nor act as plaintiffs or defendants. That would include litigation and legislation involving hunting and breeding of animals and plants, as well as zoo and circus displays.","PETA: This is the first lawsuit seeking constitutional protection against slavery for non-humans .

"(CNN) -- A pair of suspected U.S. drone strikes killed four al Qaeda militants in Yemen as the United States maintained a heightened security alert in the country and urged all Americans to leave immediately. Security sources told CNN about the strikes but didn't offer additional details. A Yemeni official said four drone strikes have been carried out in the past 10 days. None of those killed on Tuesday were among the 25 names on the country's most-wanted list, security officials said. It is unclear whether the strikes were related to the added security alert in the country after U.S. officials intercepted a message from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to operatives in Yemen telling them to ""do something."" The message was sent to Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terror group's Yemeni affiliate. U.S. intelligence believes al-Wuhayshi has recently been appointed the overall terror organization's No. 2 leader. Also Tuesday, the State Department urged Americans in Yemen to leave immediately, citing terrorist activities and civil unrest. All non-emergency U.S. government personnel were also told to leave. Two U.S. military transport aircraft landed in Yemen on Tuesday to evacuate American citizens. ""In response to a request from the U.S. State Department, early this morning the U.S. Air Force transported personnel out of Sana'a, Yemen, as part of a reduction in emergency personnel,"" Pentagon press secretary George Little said in a statement. Little also said, ""The U.S. Department of Defense continues to have personnel on the ground in Yemen to support the U.S. State Department and monitor the security situation."" The UK Foreign Office also announced it had temporarily withdrawn all staff from the British embassy and would keep the facility shut until employees are able to return. Washington takes precautions . Acting on the intelligence information, the United States heightened its security stance, issuing a worldwide travel alert and closing a number of embassies and consulates over large areas of the Middle East and Africa this week. List of U.S. embassies and consulates closed this week . The State Department said the substantial security steps reflect an ""abundance of caution"" over intelligence information that indicated final planning by al Qaeda in Yemen for possible terrorist attacks on Western targets to coincide with the end of Ramadan this week. Three sources told CNN that the United States has information that members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack. Recent jailbreaks in Pakistan, Iraq and Libya all have the fingerprints of al Qaeda operations. Prison breaks are among reasons for heightened security . On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that U.S. anti-terrorism efforts had decimated al Qaeda's global leadership and greatly diminished its core in Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying the threat had ""shifted to some of these affiliates, in particular AQAP."" Separately, American special forces units overseas have been on alert for the past several days awaiting a mission to attack potential al Qaeda targets if those behind the most recent terror threats against U.S. interests can be identified, a senior Obama administration official told CNN. The official declined to identify the units or their locations because of the sensitive nature of the information. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel put the units on alert last week, the official said.

"(CNN) -- Hurt. Devastated. Crushed. Those are words an African-American couple used to describe how they felt when they were forced to change the venue of their wedding because of their race. ""Because of the fact that we were black, some of the members of the congregation had got upset and decided that no black couple would ever be married at that church,"" Charles Wilson told CNN on Sunday night. ""All we wanted to do in the eyes of God was to be man and wife in a church that we thought we felt loved. What was wrong with that?"" Charles and Te'Andrea Wilson had planned to marry this month at the First Baptist Church of Crystal Springs in Mississippi, but were asked at the last minute to move. Southern Baptists elect first black president . Their pastor, Stan Weatherford, made the request on behalf of some congregants who didn't want to see the couple married there, according to CNN affiliate WLBT. He performed the ceremony at a nearby church. ""This was, had not, had never been done here before so it was setting a new (precedent) and there were those who reacted to that,"" Weatherford told WLBT. ""I didn't want to have a controversy within the church, and I didn't want a controversy to affect the wedding of Charles and Te' Andrea. I wanted to make sure their wedding day was a special day,"" he reportedly said. On Sunday, some church members reacted to news of the wedding with surprise, many hadn't known what happened to the Wilsons until they heard about it on the news, and offered apologies. ""I would say I'm sorry this happened and would you forgive the people who caused it? Because we're gonna try to,"" Bob Mack told WLBT. Talking about the group that opposed the wedding he said: ""We hope we can straighten them out, you know, get them to understand what Christianity is all about because they have some misconceptions about it."" But for Charles and Te'Andrea Wilson, support from the church now might be too little, too late. ""I had dreams of having my wedding the way I wanted it, and I also dreamed of having it at the church and unfortunately, it didn't happen,"" Te'Andrea Wilson told CNN. Her husband said if there was a time to ""step up and be Christ-like,"" it was before their wedding. Hindsight is 20/20. ""If it was such a minority of people, why didn't the majority stand up and say, 'in God's house we don't do this?'"" said Charles Wilson.

"Yakutat, Alaska (CNN) -- Residents of towns in the Alaska Panhandle have begun picking up plastic bottles, chunks of foam insulation and floating buoys from Japan's 2011 tsunami. ""This is urethane spray building foam,"" Chris Pallister, president of the conservation group Gulf of Alaska Keeper, said as he picked through trash on Montague Island, about 200 miles north of Juneau. ""We just never got much of that before. But if you walk up and down this beach, you see big chunks."" Hi-res photo gallery: Japan tsunami debris reaches Alaska . The foam comes from the walls of buildings that were smashed to splinters by the wall of water that slammed into Japan's northeastern coast after the March 2011 earthquake that left nearly 16,000 known dead. The wreckage was swept out to sea when the wave receded and has drifted 4,000 miles across the northern Pacific in the 14 months since then. Japanese man claims motorcycle that washed up in Canada .

But they're worried they'll be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of wreckage -- estimated at 1.5 million tons -- believed to be headed toward North American shores. Japanese officials estimate up to 70% of the tsunami wreckage has sunk. But the rest, ranging in size from children's toys to a squid trawler sunk by the U.S. Coast Guard off Alaska in April, has been turning up off the United States and Canada for more than a month.

But the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration said last week it doesn't have the budget to clean up remote areas.

Research ship finds the world's oceans are 'plasticized' At a Senate hearing last week, the head of NOAA's Ocean Service, David Kennedy, said the bulk of the debris wasn't expected to hit until 2013. But he said it was ""incredibly expensive"" to clean up. ""You got to have ships to get out there,"" Kennedy said. ""You got to have people, then you got to have some place to do away with it ... We can't begin to touch, especially in remote areas, if there is substantial new amounts of debris, what's going to be required to remove it."" Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, the chairman of the Senate Commerce subcommittee that held the hearing, said NOAA's position was ""somewhat frustrating."" ""The role of the federal government in emergencies is to assist states, not just say, 'It's your responsibility, good luck,' because that's not acceptable,"" Begich, a Democrat, told Kennedy.

"(CNN) -- ""That's the second unmanly thing you've done today,"" is the punch line of the most frequently played Miller Lite ad during NFL games. It ends with the ultimatum, ""Man up."" In a new McDonald's commercial, two newlyweds delay their honeymoon after the man hears that McDonald's is featuring the McRib sandwich again. The woman says in disbelief, ""I married a 14-year-old."" If popular culture is any indicator, manliness is on our minds. Six new TV shows this fall focus on man's role in society and the family, according to the Wall Street Journal. Three are appropriately titled, ""Last Man Standing,"" ""How To Be A Gentleman,"" and ""Man Up!"" Something is going on here. In all these shows, men have become the butt of the jokes. From weakness to irresponsibility to immaturity, the modern idea of manhood is in doubt. A shift in cultural norms, a changing workforce and the rise of women have left many men in an identity crisis. It makes for good comedy, but bad families. Although men remain at the top of the heap in terms of compensation and job status, particularly in fields like science, business, and politics, things are changing. This year there will be more women CEOs of Fortune 500 companies than ever before. And for the first time, American women now gain more advanced college degrees, as well as bachelor's degrees, than American men. My first CNN column on this subject identified what I think are the common problems with some men today: deficiencies in work, marriage and faith. The overwhelming response I received, from men and women alike, worries me. Many women told me the problems are much worse than I described. They explained to me how they have to lower their standards to find a man. Young women, in particular, complained that men are dragging them down and holding them back. As one woman told me, if 60 is the new 40 for men, then 25 is the new 13. Most feminists are not celebrating the decline of men and shouting it from the rooftops. Certainly, the far-left feminist movement has sought to diminish the role of men, but a majority of women want able, competent men of their equal. Strong men make stronger women (and vice versa) and stronger families, and women want that. Many men today aren't sure what they want. In developed Western countries, man has unprecedented freedom to chose, to a degree heretofore unknown, a life of his own wanting and design. A mere hundred years ago, man couldn't afford to dawdle in limbo between adolescence and manhood; manhood was thrust upon him for survival. Today, more opportunity lies at his feet than ever. Yet with this increased opportunity comes increased confusion, and the response on the part of some men has not been encouraging. Take the Occupy Wall Street movement, for instance. While diverse and scattered, some of the mottos and slogans on display are in stark contrast to the traditional and time-tested ideas of manliness. Instead of industriousness, responsibility and entrepreneurship, these men demand free college education, required living wages and greater distribution of someone else's wealth. Rather than look inward and rely on their own self-sufficiency, they look for a handout. A man's livelihood once depended on his hands, back and brain. Today, the government can do all that for him, if he lets it. The struggle between dependency and freedom has provoked many to ask the question: How does one be a man today? Boys become men through mimesis -- the Greek word for imitation. Boys look to role models, from parents to coaches to teachers to fictional characters, for actions they should imitate. The forces of imitation can be either constructive or destructive, making it essential that boys imitate the right kind of men. My brother and I were raised by a single mother, but she went through any pains necessary to put good men in our lives -- good priests, teachers and coaches. As a child, I had many heroes. I was drawn to Gary Cooper as Marshal Will Kane in ""High Noon."" He wasn't the toughest and coolest guy, but his compassion and strength were inspiring. Through the instruction of my family and teachers I was exposed to other heroes and heroines, like Lou Gehrig, Abraham Lincoln, King David, Esther, Mother Courage, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and so on. Today, heroes like these are in shorter supply. Ask a boy today who his hero or heroine is. The answer, or lack thereof, will speak volumes. We must teach our boys what is to be loved and imitated. As the writer Tom Wolfe said, we must engage in a great relearning. It is our generation's task to instruct and train our boys to be men. As Proverbs says, train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: Ads, TV shows focus on the changing role of men .

"Yosemite National Park, California (CNN) -- Bone-dry grass and brush Saturday fed flames as more than 2,600 crew members struggled to corral a still-growing wildfire in California's Sierra foothills. ""This fire is very dynamic,"" said Tina Rose, spokeswoman for the multiagency incident command. ""The access to the fire has been hampering us. It is so difficult to get into those canyons."" Firefighters were buoyed by the fact that winds appeared to have died down a bit and the massive Rim Fire's rate of growth has slowed. The fire had doubled in size from Thursday to Friday, and the total loss stood at nearly 130,000 acres early Saturday evening, much of it in Stanislaus National Forest. The blaze, which remained 7% contained, was spreading primarily to the east. While the Rim Fire has consumed 12,000 acres in the northwest section of Yosemite National Park, so far it has had little or no direct impact on Yosemite Valley, a popular spot for tourists and home to many of the famous cliffs and waterfalls in the park. ""Skies are beautiful,"" park spokesman Scott Gediman told CNN at midday. ""It is a crystal clear blue sky in Yosemite Valley."" Still, the park has seen a few cancellations and one western entrance was closed. Gov. Jerry Brown on Friday issued a state of emergency in the San Francisco area because of threats to utilities. ""The San Francisco Public Utilities has been forced to shut down transmission lines,"" he said in a statement. Yosemite fire: Blaze spreads to national park . Much of San Francisco's water comes from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, which lies within Yosemite and is just east of the fire. There was good news on that front Saturday, as officials said there was no effect on the water quality and delivery. About 4,500 structures, many of them vacation homes, were under threat, according to InciWeb, a federal website that collects information from agencies like the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. Firefighters have been hampered by a lack of moisture from the sky and on the ground. ""The wind today is going to be better for firefighting, but we are still dealing with bone dry grass and brush,"" Rose said Saturday. Lee Bentley of the U.S. Forest Service said crews were making progress, but ""it is going to be awhile."" Eight fixed-wing aircraft and 10 helicopters were aiding the effort. ""We are the No. 1 priority in the country,"" said Bentley. ""We are getting what we need."" The command center said a major effort was aimed at holding the fire east of the north fork of the Tuolumne River. ""Additional efforts are focused on the eastern edge of the fire in Yosemite National Park to minimize impacts to our national treasure,"" it said in a statement. What you need to know about wildfires . In a tinder box, but scenery is wonderful . The inferno threatened the Yosemite gateway communities of Groveland and Pine Mountain Lake just outside the Stanislaus Forest. ""It's crazy, and it has been for five days,"" Kirsten Lennon, whose home is threatened, told CNN affiliate KCRA on Friday. ""Your heart's racing a little faster."" Joe Riley, co-owner of the log-construction Cub Inn in Groveland, has canceled tourist reservations until next weekend. The last remaining guest leaves Sunday. ""We are on a voluntary evacuation order,"" Riley told CNN on Saturday afternoon. ""If things get bad or we get a direct order, we have everything packed, all the pictures off the wall, and all the documents and business records."" The loss of business at the height of the season, and possible cancellations into September, may cost the inn between $10,000 and $20,000, he said. The closure of the Yosemite entrance on U.S. Highway 120 West means tourists coming through the community must drive an extra hour to get into the park. People in the community generally are handling the situation pretty well, though many have evacuated, Riley said. ""I understand we are in a tinder box and it is risky,"" he said. ""But it is beautiful."" The Tuolumne County Sheriff's Department, meanwhile, issued evacuation advisories for the town of Tuolumne and nearby Ponderosa Hill, according to InciWeb. It was not clear how many residents were covered by the evacuation advisory. Residents of Pine Mountain Lake and another area were to be allowed to return home beginning Saturday evening. Fire crews strengthened lines above Pine Mountain Lake, a resort neighborhood. ""Be advised that areas burned by the Rim Fire may still pose hazards,"" an advisory said. ""Fire-weakened trees, burning stump holes and large fire apparatus may be present. Entry into the burned areas is strongly discouraged."" Authorities say the Rim Fire started on August 17. The cause is under investigation. Gediman, of Yosemite National Park, said the Rim Fire's impact was restricted to the entrance closure at Highway 120 West and a backcountry section used by hikers. Temperatures were a little cooler Saturday than on Friday, he said. The park typically has 15,000 visitors on a busy summer weekend. August sees an influx of visitors from other countries, a few of whom have called to check on conditions. Still, there's little indication so far it's keeping many people away. Ranger programs went on as normal Saturday and campgrounds were full. ""If somebody cancels, there are 10 people that will take their spot,"" said Gediman. Yosemite, with hundreds of campground sites and lodging units, had nearly 4 million visitors last year, according to the National Park Service. CNN's Nick Valencia reported from Yosemite National Park and Phil Gast reported and wrote in Atlanta. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","B&B owners prepare for possible evacuation .

"Montgomery, Alabama (CNN) -- I'm an attorney and I represent incarcerated people, both in my home state of Alabama and across the United States. I spend every day with people who are poor, disadvantaged, condemned and marginalized. I am persuaded that we can and should do better to create more hopeful and encouraging solutions to poverty, crime and inequality in this country. In the last 40 years, our society has witnessed unprecedented technological change, incredible innovation and a great deal of promise and success in many areas. Watch Bryan Stevenson's TED Talk . We have also seen growing inequality, increased levels of poverty and unprecedented rates of imprisonment. I have come to believe that, for all the things we have accomplished, injustice, poverty and mass incarceration are stains on our society. They cannot be ignored. In 1970 there were roughly 350,000 people in our jails and prisons. Today there are more than 2.2 million. That's not counting the nearly 5 million people who are on probation or parole. One in every 31 Americans is subject to some form of correctional control. This policy of mass incarceration did not come out of nowhere. It was born out of a politics of fear and anger based on now discredited theories. It was our response to problems in our society that we were not creative enough -- or perhaps not courageous enough -- to solve. Public safety is a legitimate priority for any nation, but it does not explain the fact that the United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world. TED.com: America's native prisoners of war . Mass incarceration has been our response to poverty. The boom in imprisonment coincided with a retraction of programs intended to pull Americans out of poverty. And incarceration itself has a lasting impact, not just on the economic mobility of former prisoners, but on the mobility of their children and families. There are now more than 46 million people living below the federal poverty line in the United States. Mass incarceration has been our response to mental illness. More than half the people in our jails and prisons have mental health problems and most are not receiving treatment. Many of these individuals also have substance abuse disorders. Veterans, suffering from PTSD from their combat experience, are at increased risk of suicide in prison. Mass incarceration has been our response to the oldest and most enduring problem of our nation: the problem of race. While more than one in 100 adults in America are behind bars, that number is one in 15 for African-American men. We frequently target communities of color with unequal enforcement of the law and subject too many young black and brown people to a presumption of guilt that results in disproportionate sentences and mistreatment. But the numbers alone don't tell the full story. Our sentencing practices in individual cases reveal the gross excesses of our system. TED.com: Hans Rosling's new insights on poverty . As we've locked up more and more people, sentences have gotten harsher. Misguided three-strikes laws have had the perverse result of sending people to prison for the rest of their lives for petty crimes like stealing a set of golf clubs. We are the only nation in the world that sentences children as young as 13 to die in prison. And we continue to have a death penalty that not only costs billions, but also produces unfair and unreliable results. For every nine people we have executed in the last 40 years, we have found one person on death row who was innocent. This error rate would be intolerable in any industry, yet where the difference is that of life or death, we are unwilling to speak up. Why? How has a problem that affects one in 31 Americans (not to speak of their children, families, and communities) been ignored for so long? The answer is that mass incarceration impacts mostly the poor, the historically disfavored, the racial minority: those whose voices are rarely heard. Spending on jails and prisons has required taking money away from education, public benefits and social welfare in too many states. Some conservatives and progressives have begun to recognize that it's time to dismantle the policies of mass incarceration. More of us must speak up. We must take responsibility for human suffering and despair even when we are conditioned not to see it. We need to challenge ourselves to work toward meaningful solutions, like rehabilitation and reform. We need to talk about the ugliest chapters of our history; we need to talk about race and poverty. Most of all we need to talk about injustice. Because until we confront injustice, I believe its stain will shadow all of our accomplishments. We need to talk about injustice, because who we are as a society cannot be accurately defined by our wealth, our technology, or our celebrities. We will be ultimately defined instead by our treatment of the poor, our compassion for the condemned, our commitment to our own humanity. We need to talk about injustice, so that we can create justice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bryan Stevenson.","Bryan Stevenson: The number of Americans in prisons has grown tremendously .

"(CNN) -- Afghan schoolgirls sit in the spotlight as their classrooms face alleged poison attacks in the north and threats from insurgents in the south. Questions surround the shadowy incidents, which come at a fragile time in the country's transition. And in many ways, as goes girls' education, so goes the country's procession toward progress. ""Instead of increasing the enrollment of girls in school and establishing more schools, gradually girls' schools are being closed and shut down,"" said Selay Ghaffar, executive director of the Humanitarian Assistance for the Women and Children of Afghanistan. ""Some schools have been put on fire, and we are repeatedly witnessing that girls' schools have been poisoned. Acid has been thrown on the faces of girls in Kandahar."" For several weeks, alleged poisonings have been reported in northern Afghan provinces of Balkh and Takhar. The latest came Tuesday, when 160 girls from a school in Takhar province were admitted to a hospital after complaining of headaches and vomiting. On Sunday, according to Afghanistan's TOLO News, illness sent 40 female students to seek medical care. So far, investigators have found no traces of poison, but evidence is still being examined. The country's deputy education minister told TOLO that ""the enemies of Afghanistan and education are behind such incidents."" Regardless of what is found, what is certain is that threats confront a slew of classrooms across the country. Although some schools have reopened since 2009 after the Taliban's revision of its code of conduct and the reopening of government talks with the Taliban, girls' schools remain in the crosshairs. The Ministry of Education has said that as many as 500 schools have been shuttered out of fear of attack from Taliban or other anti-government forces. But the issue seems to be as much about political power as ideology and security. And Afghan girls are not the only ones to pay the price while their education becomes a political football. ""Education is the backbone of a country,"" Ghaffar said. ""If half of the population are not educated and are not part of the economic sector, the education sector, then how can we manage to have a peaceful, democratic society?"" Taliban leaders have denied responsibility for sickening the schoolgirls in the north, maintaining that accusations they are behind the alleged attacks are ""baseless and not true."" But local Taliban told The Wall Street Journal that they stood behind a recent spate of warnings to parents and teachers in southern Ghazni province to stay away from school. Taliban tightens grip on Afghan schools . Said one local Talib to the Journal: ""We aren't against education ... the reason is that schools, especially girls' schools, are the only tool that attracts swift government attention."" Certainly one of the most frequent signs of progress policymakers have pointed to in recent years is the return of girls to school. From fewer than 5,000 girls who managed to get educated despite being banned from schools by the Taliban, an estimated 3 million-plus girls are said to be studying today. Women now make up a quarter of the Afghan parliament and more than 3,000 midwives fan out over the country each day to save women's lives -- in a nation that studies find the world's deadliest for expectant mothers. And yet when it comes to Afghanistan's future, women's rights to work and education loom as the boldest question marks. The Strategic Partnership Agreement signed by the U.S. and Afghanistan earlier this month emphasized a ""shared determination"" to an Afghanistan governed on values including the ""fundamental rights and freedoms of all men and women."" Yet the agreement goes into no specifics about what would happen if a new Afghan government revoked those same rights and freedoms. And when this month's NATO summit in Chicago focused on the transition from international to Afghan responsibility for the country's security forces, women's rights had no place on the agenda. ""Still the discussion of women's issues and women's protection within the international system somehow always seems to be an afterthought, when the bottom line is that the way women are treated is central to American foreign policy,"" said former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at a ""shadow summit"" panel on women's rights hosted by Amnesty International, which I moderated in Chicago. ""The difficulty is men -- and the bottom line is that in fact we have to figure out why and to persuade everybody that having women's rights and women being on various groups is the best way to ensure a better life for everybody, not just for women, but for everybody,"" Albright said. Afghan women leaders say they are not seeking the world's pity, but its attention. ""I have one message from Afghan women. 'Don't look at us as victims, we are very active,' "" said Afifa Azim, executive director of the Afghan Women's Network. ""We need all of you to support us by supporting women and human rights organizations and to put pressure on your policymakers to support the rights of Afghan women."" Chief among those is the right to attend school in safety. And only the coming months will tell whether threats and attacks will keep girls away from classrooms or whether girls will indeed get the opportunity they seek to contribute to their own societies. ""Women are the canary in the coal mine, "" Albright said. ""It is just a fact that when women are treated badly in a society, it is a sign of what goes on in the society."" The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Gayle Lemmon.","Gayle Lemmon: Afghan schoolgirls face alleged poison attacks and other threats .
Lemmon: Reports of poisonings vary, but it's certain classrooms across the nation are at risk .

"(CNN) -- Airbus test pilots and managers celebrated Friday after the long-awaited inaugural flight of the Airbus A350 XWB went off without a hitch. Aviation enthusiasts around the world had their eyes on France as the aircraft took off from Toulouse-Blagnac airport around 10 a.m. local time and landed safely about four hours later. The test crew waved an Airbus flag from a hatch above the cockpit as the aircraft taxied after its successful maiden journey. The crew, who emerged to applause from waiting friends and family, said the aircraft proved easy to handle and performed well throughout the test program. ""After the first few minutes, it didn't feel like we were doing a first test flight,"" said Peter Chandler, chief test pilot for Airbus. ""It was so relaxed and so predictable."" ""It's a great day for all people who have a passion for aerospace,"" said Airbus Chief Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier. Airbus hopes to have the new aircraft fully certified for commercial flight within 12 to 13 months, he said. ""This is about going fast but never rushing, and I am very confident that after this first flight ... we will deliver this aircraft by 2014 to our first customers,"" he said. Airbus hopes to capture more than half the global market of 6,000 long-range aircraft over the next 20 years, he added. ""I knew it was going to be impressive, but I was blown away,"" Airbus Chief Operating Officer John Leahy said immediately after the A350 XWB takeoff. ""Did you hear how quiet it was? Did you hear what you didn't hear? We're going to set new standards. Not just for comfort, not just for performance. But for environmental friendliness. People living around airports won't even know we're taking off,"" he said to the attending press. The flight followed many hours of training in a simulator for the six international test flight crew members. Bregier said he had set a target nine months ago of completing the first test flight before the upcoming Paris Air Show. However, the company has not confirmed speculation that Airbus is planning to show off its new plane to aviation enthusiasts at the show, which runs June 17 to 23. Frank Chapman, an Airbus test pilot who watched from the ground, said the decision had not yet been made but would depend on the data from the test flight and safety checks over the next few days. Paris Air Show 2013: On your marks, jet set, go! The A350 XWB is the first in a family of super-efficient passenger planes Airbus designed to go head-to-head with rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 777s. ""XWB"" means ""extra wide body."" There are three members in the A350 family: the A350-800, the A350-900 and the A350-1000, which seat 270, 314 and 350 passengers, respectively, in three-class seating. The first test plane, ""MSN1,"" was unveiled on May 13 at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France. Turbulent production history . Friday's first test flight was the latest achievement in what has been a turbulent production history for the A350 program since it was first announced in 2006. ""Airbus's initial A350 design wasn't an entirely new aircraft, but a knee-jerk reaction to the 787,"" aviation journalist David Kaminski-Morrow, air transport editor of Flightglobal.com, told CNN in an earlier report. ""The company, which was hip-deep in sorting out A380 development, simply hadn't foreseen the huge pent-up demand for a more efficient 250-seat airliner, and tried to take the easy way out by offering a re-engined version of its A330."" While the A330 is incredibly popular, the airlines were more interested in the potential efficiency offered by a clean-sheet design, he added. Airbus rolls out new A350 XWB . Being publicly lambasted by some of its largest customers -- one aviation executive called it a Band-Aid reaction to the 787 Dreamliner, while the CEO of Singapore Airlines said the plane just didn't go far enough -- the pressure was on for Airbus to come up with a plane that would genuinely advance the global aviation scene. This year, there were cancellations. Abu Dhabi-based airline Etihad Airways axed seven orders for A350-1000s, saying they still weren't happy with the design, criticizing its range, performance and fuel burn. ""Airbus belatedly woke up and countered with a completely new version of the A350, and managed to tap into the market,"" said Kaminski-Morrow. On the technical side, the big appeal for airlines is that over 70% of the A350 XWB's airframe is made from advanced materials that combine composites (53%), titanium and advanced aluminum alloys. The A350 XWB is the first Airbus passenger jet to use both fuselage and wing structures made primarily of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, resulting in lower fuel burn as well as easier maintenance, according to the company. Its rival, the 787, is one of the most advanced airliners launched in recent years, and is made up of 50% composites and uses 20% less fuel than other aircraft in the same category. Airbus A350 time crunch . Paris Air Show hopes . Industry experts said ahead of the test flight that there was an outside chance the A350 XWB might be spotted in the skies at the air show, even though Airbus had said the plane would be too busy carrying out flight tests to attend. ""We're still waiting to find out whether the A350 will put in an appearance,"" said Murdo Morrison, editor of aerospace industry magazine Flight International. ""That certainly would be a highlight -- it's one of the newest and most exciting aircraft, but it and Bombardier's C-Series are at a critical point in their development. ""It becomes a bit of a fight between the marketing people, the publicists, who want the company to get all the best headlines, and the engineers who are working to critical deadlines to get the plane ready to fly as soon as possible,"" he explained. ""What may happen is they pop in for one day -- fly in and then fly out again -- or even, in the case of the A350, that they do a flypast, without even landing.""

"(CNN) -- Dutch Prince Johan Friso died Monday, more than 17 months after he suffered a severe brain injury in an avalanche, the Dutch royal family announced on its website. Prince Friso, 44, was in what the family called ""a state of minimal consciousness"" after he was caught in an avalanche at an Austrian ski resort in February 2012. He was skiing with friends outside the bounds of the Lech am Arlberg ski resort when the avalanche hit him, and he suffered a lack of oxygen while he was under the snow before being rescued, officials said. His doctor at the time said he had suffered brain damage. After receiving treatment in Austria, he was transferred to a London hospital, where he stayed for more than a year. He was discharged last month and was sent to The Hague, where he continued to receive medical care at home. His brother, Willem-Alexander, is king of the Netherlands.

"(CNN) -- President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan will attend the NATO summit meeting about Afghanistan in Chicago this weekend, his office said in a statement Thursday. NATO had invited Zardari to the conference on Tuesday, just days after the organization's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, had suggested that the neighbor of Afghanistan would not be included because of the continued closure of Pakistan's border with Afghanistan to war supplies. The decision to attend the meeting was made in consultation with Pakistan's top military and civilian leaders, the statement from Zardari's office said. Tensions between Pakistan and Western forces operating in Afghanistan have been high since NATO airstrikes killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers in November. The closure of the border with Afghanistan to NATO supply routes was one of the measures Islamabad employed to show its displeasure over the airstrikes. Talks to reopen the border have intensified ahead of the Chicago meetings. U.S. negotiators have been in Pakistan since late April, and this past weekend, Gen. John Allen, who oversees all U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, and his Afghan counterpart were in Pakistan for discussions that included talks about the border situation. Analysts have described the NATO summit invitation as an incentive for Zardari to reopen the routes. But Farhatullah Babar, a spokesman for Zardari, said Tuesday that the invitation to the meeting was unconditional and was not linked to the opening of ground lines of communication for NATO or to any other issue. Senior Pakistani military and civilian officials met in Islamabad Tuesday evening but did not come up with a recommendation on lifting the blockade on the two NATO supply routes through Pakistan. The summit meeting will include Afghan President Hamid Karzai, along with NATO allies and International Security Assistance Force contributors. There also will be representatives from Russia, Japan and key international organizations including the United Nations and European Union. Zardari will make a speech in Chicago and also meet with various international leaders on the margins of the summit, his office said Thursday. A senior official with the Obama administration had stressed earlier in the week that the invitation to Pakistan was from NATO and that it was not clear if President Obama would meet with Zardari. ""It doesn't necessarily impact what we do with the Pakistanis"" at the summit, the official said. Obama met with Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani in March during a nuclear security summit in Seoul, South Korea. Husain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the United States and now residing in America, told CNN Thursday that the two countries have ""parallel narratives."" ""Pakistanis think that the United States is an untrustworthy ally; the Americans think that Pakistani's don't always fulfill their end of the bargain, especially when it comes to terrorism,"" Haqqani said. Ending the deadlock won't be easy, he said. ""Remember, we need to crack down on these extremists for Pakistan's sake. More Pakistanis have been killed by them than they have killed Americans. ... America will leave Afghanistan someday. But we will still be haunted by the remnants,"" he said. Hampering any honest discussion between Pakistan and the United States, he said, is ""a small group of people ideologically motivated and seeking essentially the domination of an Islamist ideology within Pakistan, but unable to get votes.""

"(CNN) -- A North Carolina middle school teacher was suspended for three days for showing students the rap video ""Same Love,"" Macklemore's song promoting equal rights for gays. ""The issue in this matter was one of whether the video was curriculum-based, educationally-related, and age-appropriate for a class of prepubescent 13-year-olds,"" Alexander County school board attorney Joel Harbinson told CNN on Thursday. The seven-minute video includes a kiss between two men at a wedding altar and ends with an elderly gay couple holding hands in a hospital room. ""The right-wing conservatives think that it's a decision and you can be cured with some treatment and religion, man-made rewiring of a predisposition,"" Macklemore raps. The school board lawyer would not identify the teacher, describe the class subject or give details about the disciplinary action taken. ""The administration and the teacher reached an understanding based solely on these factors that was mutually agreeable to all parties,"" Harbinson said. ""We look forward to the teacher being a valuable member of our school system for years to come as we continue our commitment to provide the best possible education to all of our students as well as to treat each of them with compassion and understanding."" The incident occurred last week and the teacher is back on the job at West Alexander Middle School, Harbinson told CNN. Macklemore, who did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment this week, did publish a response last November when a Michigan middle school teacher was suspended for the same offense. That suspension was lifted after a protest by the American Civil Liberties Union. ""This level of intolerance and fear is still very active in America, but at times is not completely visible,"" Macklemore wrote on his website. ""This incident is just one of tens of thousands that have happened across the country where schools have exposed a latent homophobia, preventing safe space for all young people to feel confident in being themselves."" He said he wrote the song ""not with the expectation that it would cure homophobia and lead to marriage equality across the US (although that'd be awesome).Â  It was written with the hope that it would facilitate dialogue and through those conversations understanding and empathy would emerge."" ""Same Love"" won the 2013 MTV Video Music Award for best hip-hop video with a social message last month.","NEW: Teacher back on job .

"(CNN) -- Police spotted a man in the gardens of Buckingham Palace and stopped him, concerned he might be an intruder. The man in question: Prince Andrew, Duke of York. He was out for a stroll through the manicured gardens in the early evening. Andrew, the son of Queen Elizabeth II, was born in the palace in 1960, has offices there, and spends much of his time there. Oops. Two uniformed officers spotted him at 6 p.m. Wednesday, and approached him ""to verify his identity,"" the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement. ""The man was satisfactorily identified."" ""The police have a difficult job to do balancing security for the royal family and deterring intruders and sometimes they get it wrong,"" Prince Andrew -- brother of Prince Charles and former husband of Sarah ""Fergie"" Ferguson -- said in a statement. ""I am grateful for their apology and look forward to a safe walk in the gardens in the future."" The British press reacted with predictable excitement. A few accounts, apparently incorrectly, reported that the officers had their guns drawn. One outlet wrote that the prince was ""held at gunpoint."" According to the authorities, no force was used, and no weapons were drawn. Guards were already on higher alert when the incident took place. Two days earlier, it was the real deal: a security breach at Buckingham Palace. A man scaled a security fence and entered the building before being detained. Authorities arrested him for burglary, trespass and criminal damage. Another man was arrested later for alleged conspiracy to commit burglary. The incident drew headlines around the world. It was the latest in a series of security lapses over the years, a few quite colorful. In 2004 ""Batman"" scaled a fence and stood on a ledge to make a point about paternal rights. A year earlier, another royal residence, Windsor Castle, had an uninvited guest: someone dressed as Osama bin Laden showed up at Prince William's birthday party. It turned out both incidents had more to do with publicity for the perpetrators than safety of the royal residents. ""Batman"" was merely a dad with a cause; ""bin Laden,"" a comedian. But Monday's alleged burglar seemed different, a more serious matter. Comparisons were drawn to the time in 1982 that a man made it all the way to the bedside of Queen Elizabeth. The queen talked to that intruder until help arrived. As for Prince Andrew, the garden incident wasn't his first brush with security gone wrong. In 2003 a bodyguard accidentally fired a shot while unloading his weapon at the prince's mansion.","Prince Andrew was mistaken for an intruder on Buckingham Palace grounds .

"(CNN) -- Police in China have rescued twin baby girls allegedly sold by a maternity doctor, bringing the number of infants recovered from the suspected trafficking ring to three, state media reported. They are to return them to their parents Saturday. The provincial government in Shaanxi, northwest China, announced the twin's rescue Thursday, the state-run China Daily reported. The parents, mother Wang Yanyan and father Qi Kunfeng, of Dongcheng village, Fuping County, were scheduled to reunite with their children Saturday. Police had earlier recovered a baby boy allegedly sold by the same obstetrician to traffickers, and reunited him with his parents Monday. Chinese newborn, allegedly sold by doctor, is returned to parents . The doctor allegedly at the center of the scandal is Zhang Shuxia, deputy director of the maternity department of the Fuping County Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital, reported state-run CCTV. Since news of the scandal broke, police have received reports of 55 similar cases from local residents, including 26 cases pointing to Zhang, China Daily reported. Police launched investigations into five of the reported cases, and Zhang was detained on suspicion of human trafficking. The parents of the allegedly trafficked twins told CNN that after Wang gave birth at the hospital on May 29, Zhang convinced them to give up the children, telling them that the girls had serious health issues. ""The doctor was pretending to be very anxious, telling me that my babies have congenital problems. She said the twins would be brain damaged or paralyzed,"" Wang said. The couple never saw their children after the birth, they said. ""I insisted on seeing the babies, but she wouldn't let me,"" said Wang. They trusted Zhang. ""I never suspected that she was selling my babies, because she was a family friend,"" she said. The twins' father, Qi, told CNN that the loss of the children had a profound impact on the couple. ""Every night for two months my wife would cry, and she couldn't eat from worry."" Of Zhang, his former friend, he said: ""I think she is evil. She is a terrible person."" ""We trusted her so much. How could she be so cruel to sell our babies?"" First baby returned . Authorities returned the first rescued baby Monday to his parents, who were overcome by emotion. Its identity was confirmed through DNA testing. As family members wept, the parents knelt to thank police for recovering their son, the state-run China Daily reported. Fuping County authorities said Zhang sold the baby boy for 21,600 yuan ($3,527) on July 17, the day after he was born. The baby was then sold two more times in ten days' time. Police said Zhang told the child's parents, Dong Shanshan and Lai Guofeng, that their son had contracted syphilis through the mother, and convinced them to surrender the boy into her care, reported the state-run People's Daily. But the mother subsequently tested negative for syphilis and grew suspicious. She went to the police. The infant was found Sunday in a good condition in a town in neighboring Henan Province. Most of the affected families hailed from the same village as Zhang and her mother, CCTV reported. Zhang made false claims that the children had serious ailments, from heart problems and cerebral palsy to missing genitals, to convince parents to part with their babies. Officials sacked . Another couple from the area told CCTV Zhang had convinced them to give up their baby son at the hospital in 2008, after telling them shortly after the birth that the infant had stopped breathing. ""The whole delivery was around 10 minutes, natural birth. And then she came out and told me that the baby wasn't breathing,"" recalled Dong Pengfei, the father. ""I was overwhelmed by that time, and I didn't have second thoughts. But after that I've been thinking why she would refer to it as a 'kid' if it wasn't breathing."" ""I couldn't stop crying ever since I gave birth to my boy,"" his wife told CCTV. ""I feel like crying when I see kids from other families."" Two government officials and three hospital officials have sacked over the scandal, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. China's state health commission has called for severe punishment for those involved. A CNN crew was tailed by officials and told to stay away from local residents while reporting the story.","Twin baby girls are the latest to be rescued from a Chinese trafficking ring .

"(CNN) -- An undercover sting operation nabbed an Atlanta-area sheriff's deputy who was selling marijuana out of his patrol car and in uniform, federal authorities say. Newton County Deputy Darrell Mathis told an informant that he could sell pot without fear because ""he drives safely and flashes police credentials to get out of tickets if stopped,"" according to court papers. Mathis, a five-year veteran deputy, was freed on bond after his arrest last week, the FBI said. ""This defendant used his position as a police officer to openly violate the very laws that he was sworn to uphold,"" U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said in a written statement. ""Selling marijuana out of his police car while wearing a badge and uniform is outrageous. This case is a reminder that no one is above the law."" Mathis has been charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and with carrying a firearm during a drug offense -- a charge that could bring a possible life sentence if convicted. He did not immediately return messages seeking comment Sunday. Newton County is about 30 miles east of Atlanta. Sheriff Ezell Brown said Mathis has been placed on administrative leave, and his office is cooperating with the investigation. Doritos on menu at Seattle Hempfest, courtesy of local police . ""This is an embarrassment to the Newton County Sheriff's Office, as well as law enforcement in general,"" Brown said in a joint statement with Yates. According to the charges against him, Mathis attracted the attention of the FBI in April after what officials called a ""social visit"" by a person who went on to become a confidential informant. The informant visited Mathis at his apartment and saw large bags of what was ""believed to be marijuana"" on the living room table. The complaint states that Mathis told the informant that he wasn't concerned about getting caught, because of his safe driving and police credentials. Apparently unnerved by the exchange, the informant went to the authorities and offered to help with an investigation. The FBI then set up a half dozen meetings among Mathis, the informant and eventually two undercover agents, court papers recount. Mathis and the informant discussed a drug sale during their next meeting, the charges state. Mathis sold the informant an ounce of marijuana later that day, showing up for the deal in his cruiser, in uniform and carrying his service pistol. After that, an undercover agent got involved -- and the amounts of marijuana increased. In June, as the agent bought a pound of pot, Mathis boasted, ""I do my little 10 to 15 a week"" -- a phrase the agent ""understood to mean selling 10 to 15 pounds a week,"" the arrest affidavit states. Then in early August, according to the complaint, Mathis met with another undercover agent, a supposed cocaine dealer. The two agents and Mathis sat down at a restaurant to discuss buying and transporting marijuana and cocaine, according to the complaint. While the three spoke, Mathis allegedly pulled out his badge and told the undercover agent, ""Don't worry, I'm on your side."" By the end of the meeting, the complaint alleges, Mathis had agreed to run marijuana and cocaine from Alabama to North Carolina at the behest of the undercover agent. Federal agents found a pound of pot on Mathis when he was arrested last week, the FBI said. CNN's Kevin Wang contributed to this report.","The FBI says Darrell Mathis sold marijuana to federal agents during a 4-month probe .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- There he stands, Mount Kilimanjaro in the background, striking a pose on a purple mat, bathed in the light of dawn. Breathing. Stretching. Opening up his mind -- a group of young children following and copying his every move. Watching a Maasai warrior practice yoga is a rare sight, but Jacob Parit is not only a warrior in one of Africa's best-known tribes, he's also an instructor with the Africa Yoga Project. ""Yoga will be part of Maasai tradition because the young need to be strong warriors,"" Parit says. ""It is a peaceful thing and it brings people together."" Originating in India, yoga is practiced globally, and is now spreading across Kenya. And it's not only about the practice -- here, yoga is transforming lives, contributing positively to communities and creating jobs. The catalyst for this yoga boom in Kenya is the Africa Yoga Project. Started in 2007, the non-profit organization is the brainchild of American Paige Elenson. ""I have been teaching Baptiste Power Yoga for about 15 years and I was on a family vacation here in Kenya in 2006. I saw a group of youth doing handstands. I got out of the car and did handstands with them. That day changed my life,"" explains Elenson, who saw yoga as a way to create jobs for young people in Kenya. Read this: Maasai Cricket Warriors . It started as an experiment, mainly in the city slums, to see if it could bring about positive changes and help people to cope with their lives. Today, the Africa Yoga Projects says it has 71 educated and employed yoga teachers, who earn a living wage. It offers more than 300 free classes every week that are serving around 5,000 people. The project is funded by volunteers and donors and is bringing together people from all walks of life. Relaxing future warriors . Parit is from the Alasiti village, the first Maasai community to combine their traditional lifestyle with yoga. ""(For a) Long time we believed it is like a magic. But after we do it, we realize this is something anyone can do,"" he says. Parit and the other Maasai yoga instructors believe that the combination of yoga and their lifestyle can bring mental and physical benefits to their community. ""Yoga helps me knowing who I am,"" Parit says. ""Every morning when you get out of your bed your body will ask for yoga."" In the early mornings and evenings, members of his community wait for his instructions. At night, they are eager to stretch their bodies after a long day of work looking after the livestock, taking care of their houses, cooking and cleaning.

Even in the city, the instructors with the Africa Yoga Project are not limited to yoga studios. Many of the free classes take place in Kibera, Nairobi's biggest slum, where most people live under the poverty line. Rufus Ngugi is one of the deaf instructors working with the project. He teaches yoga to a group of orphans in a Kibera center called Fruitful. ""Whatever I do, I start by demonstrating,"" he explains. ""I show them how to breathe, I show them the different postures, and in this case I don't even involve a hearing person."" Ngugi has been with the Africa Yoga Project for a year now. He thinks the children feel connected to him because of his disability. ""These are children who don't have parents, children who have been neglected by their parents,"" he says.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Supreme Court is investigating allegations that a tribal council in a restive province ordered that about a dozen girls aged between 4 and 16 be handed over from one tribe to another to settle a feud, a provincial official said Tuesday. The girls are at risk because under ""vani,"" the tradition invoked by the council to resolve the dispute, they will be forced to marry members of the tribe to which they are given. Vani is illegal under Pakistani law. Following local news reports on the tribal council's decision, the Supreme Court has requested that the provincial authorities present the 13 girls and their parents Wednesday at its building in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, said Babar Yaqoub, the chief secretary of the province. More on Pakistan: Taliban shoots teen activist blogger . Balochistan is the western Pakistani province where the meeting of tribal elders, known as a jirga, is reported to have been held recently. It was unclear Tuesday whether the girls had been handed over yet. The Supreme Court judges have also requested the attendance Wednesday of a provincial lawmaker accused of presiding over the tribal meeting in the district of Dera Bugti. The lawmaker, Tariq Masoori Bugti, has denied he was present at the jirga. The tribal council decided that one tribe should give the other the 13 girls and the sum of about $32,000 as restitution for the killing of a member of the second tribe about five months ago, according to two local government officials. The officials said they were not present at the tribal meeting but had been briefed on its proceedings by representatives of the village where it is alleged to have taken place. The two local officials declined to be identified, saying they feared they could lose their jobs if the influential tribal elders knew they were speaking to the news media about the matter.

Syed Faisal Shah, the top government official of Dera Bugti, confirmed that the jirga had taken place but declined to comment further, saying he couldn't afford conflict with the jirga members. Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, the popular chief justice of the Supreme Court, has decided to investigate by issuing a ""suo moto"" notice, which allows him to initiate any case of alleged human rights violation even if the victim hasn't filed a petition. Chaudhry is in Quetta at the moment to hear other cases and held a hearing on the ""suo moto"" notice Tuesday. Tariq, the provincial lawmaker who the court has requested to appear before it Wednesday, denied he had presided over the tribal meeting. ""I played no role in the jirga,"" he said by phone Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- In 1519, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan launched the expedition that completed the first circumnavigation of the globe. And so humanity learned the full extent of its world. This week, we learned from Science magazine that NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft -- currently the man-made object farthest from Earth -- crossed a boundary of the solar system and entered interstellar space sometime last summer. Like Magellan's voyage, Voyager's achievement is a major milestone in human exploration. In a remarkably short time by cosmic standards (the universe being 13.7 billion years old), humans have evolved to the point of sending robotic diplomatic missions to other planets and stars. This particular emissary from the human race carries a recording of greetings in 55 languages as well as images explaining who we are. Although the Voyager scientists had no particular expectation of encountering other civilizations, they knew the mission would go forth unimpeded for millenniums. So they prepared a message for any distant future being who might stumble across this man-made artifact. If ""E.T."" finds Voyager 1, will it phone home? We know that planets around other stars (""exoplanets"") are abundant, and that when liquid water and carbon-based compounds and an energy source are present even in the most inhospitable zones on the Earth, life arises easily. But the kind of intelligent life that can build and launch a pioneering spacecraft is surely much more rare. And if someone answers the call, it will be sufficiently far in the future that the Earth-bound world as we know it will have changed beyond recognition. Unlike missions to nearby Mars or Venus, Voyager 1 and 2 (both spacecraft were launched in 1977) and their older siblings, Pioneer 10 and 11 (launched in 1972 and 1973, respectively) headed for outer space from the beginning. They visited Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, taking photographs of unprecedented clarity and making complex measurements of the particles and magnetic fields around the planets. Voyager 1 is the fastest-moving and most distant of the four spacecraft. Data collected by its remaining instruments have been interpreted by scientists as indicating a crossing of the boundary between our solar system and interstellar (""between the stars"") space. It's not a sharp boundary, and there are definitely no signposts, so there has been some debate about the exact moment of transition. In fact, the exact date doesn't matter. Whether it was July 2012 or August 2012 or even months earlier or later, humans have unquestionably projected their presence well beyond any previous location. It's a bit different from Magellan's voyage, however. In those ancient days, travel was the only way to investigate the world. Today we survey our world -- and a large fraction of the observable universe -- using powerful telescopes, on the ground and in space. Very deep exposures taken with the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed that the Milky Way galaxy is but one of a trillion galaxies in the observable universe. There are hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy alone, each of which could have a system of planets orbiting around it. Some of these are likely to harbor life, albeit of a primitive form. In terms of knowing our 21st-century world, NASA's robotic scientific satellites have made huge advances. And from the ground, telescopes study exoplanets and the SETI Institute searches for extraterrestrial intelligence using a large radio telescope array in California. In terms of receiving signals, Earth-bound and near-Earth telescopes are unsurpassed. In terms of outward communication, TV signals created decades ago have long since announced our presence -- in fact, because such signals travel at the speed of light, they left the solar system only days after the initial broadcast. But in terms of pieces of metal human hands have touched, Voyager 1 is unique. Now some 36 years and a few days after it was launched into space, more than 11 billion miles from the sun, traveling at 38,000 mph, Voyager 1 will doubtless travel onward for tens of thousands of years to come. Its power source won't last nearly that long. Voyager 1 has sufficient power for remaining instruments through at least 2020, and if some are turned off to conserve power, a single instrument could last another five years afterward. But then the ""little spacecraft that could"" will go silent. Forty thousand years from now, after traversing 10 trillion miles or so of interstellar space, Voyager 1 will approach the then-closest star, AC +79 3888. At that point it will be a ghost ship, representing an old civilization, gone but enshrined forever in the golden record. As John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science in Washington, said, ""Perhaps some future deep space explorers will catch up with Voyager, our first interstellar envoy, and reflect on how this intrepid spacecraft helped enable their journey."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft left the solar system and entered interstellar space .

She says the mission, launched 36 years ago, will go forth unimpeded for millenniums .

"New York (CNN) -- Two men are in custody in connection with the death of a 16-month-old boy shot while his father pushed his stroller across a Brooklyn street, authorities said Friday. The father, Anthony Hennis, 21, was pushing Antiq Hennis in his stroller near their home on Sunday evening. The child was shot in the left side of his head, according to police. New York detectives and U.S. marshals apprehended the two men Friday morning at a Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, apartment according to NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly. Daquan Breland, 23, and Daquan Wright, 19, are awaiting extradition back to New York. Because they have not been charged, police said they don't know whether they have attorneys. Both men have some kind of relationship with the young boy's father, who has declined to be interviewed, according to Kelly. Breland is on parole for a felony assault in upstate New York, according to police. An eyewitness said Breland opened fire after Wright handed him a gun, according to Kelly, who did not cite a possible motive. The shooting came two days after a Georgia jury convicted an 18-year-old man of murder in the shooting of a 1-year-old baby in a stroller in the coastal city of Brunswick. De'Marquise Elkins faces a mandatory life sentence in the March 21 killing of Antonio Santiago.

"(CNN) -- How can it be that the number of vulnerable and abandoned children is increasing and the numbers of children finding their ""forever families"" through adoption is decreasing? I cannot get my head around this shocking fact. What happens to all these kids who desperately need someone to advocate for their very existence? Where do they go? Who do they turn to? How do they survive? There are an estimated 151 million orphans in the world, which UNICEF defines as a child that's lost one or more parent. If they were a country, they would together form the 10th largest nation in the world. An estimated 18 million of those have lost both parents -- a figure which would represent 80% of the population of my home country, Australia. I try to imagine what that visual looks like, if one were to Google Map it and hone in on one face staring back at you, wondering if there is anyone out there that cares about them and their circumstance. I am not a learned scholar or professional worker in international adoption. I am not even an adoption advocate -- I am a child advocate. I am an individual who has witnessed what life is like for children who don't have anyone to watch their back, or teach them right from wrong, to care about what they think or feel, or the basic human need to feel loved, to feel safe and secure and to feel that they actually matter. I believe everyone deserves be the object of someone's affection. This journey for me began six years ago when I addressed an article I read in my local newspaper in Australia about adoption. After speaking with the paper and getting the headline the next day, I realized this issue needed a voice in Australia. Many people from the community implored me to keep speaking as there was so much frustration surrounding adoption. The main grievance for families was the difficultly to adopt in Australia, where couples could wait as long as 10 years. I am still talking six years on, having established Adoption Awareness Week Australia. It's a no brainer for me: You have loving families wanting to care for these kids and kids that desperately need a loving home. We just have to work out a way to put these two together. In my mind one of the greatest crimes of humanity is to take away the innocence of a child, and this is in essence what we are doing if we do not step up and take a look at what is happening to abandoned children all over the world. These kids have literally no self-esteem, they are depressed and without hope and often in extreme danger of exploitation and abuse. If they are not able to be placed with a permanent family, they are either on the streets and prey to abusive predators or being institutionalized and therefore subject to serious mental health and developmental issues. Many are caught in the foster care system, whereby they are always vulnerable to being moved from family to family and never have a sense of belonging. The lack of permanency for these kids has a huge effect on their safety and security. Sadly, the trajectory for many kids who age out of the foster care system is homelessness, crime, drugs and incarceration, to name a few of the horrors. These kids are stuck, because governments cannot work out how to parent them. Intercountry adoption is vulnerable because of corruption of the system. Profiteering and child trafficking has understandably caused great concern and is the reason why The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption was created to combat such abuse. But it should not be the reason to close down programs that serve so many children. Greater measures of accountability need to be in place to combat the rotten part of the system, but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. What needs to be addressed is the systemic core of the sending countries. We need to assist countries that have been rife with poverty and war and lack of education for decades. Until we can get at the core of why there are so many young women and unborn/newborn babies with no real support, they will always be vulnerable. By getting to the root of the problems, there is the possibility of creating an environment that will serve families and there will be fewer abandoned children that need to find another family. My dream would be that there would be no need for adoption and that every child could remain with birth families. When adoption is the best option for these kids, I totally advocate for a well-run system that serves these children and families . I believe the biggest reason that intercountry adoption does not work at an optimum is because we have not put in the mind power and energy and resources needed to create a system that works ethically and expediently. Some governments don't rate abandoned childrens' issues high on their agenda, unless children are being used as a political pawn, as we witnessed late last year when Russia closed down their program with the U.S. Even the Russian Children's Rights Commissioner made a statement saying ""I think any foreign adoption is bad for the country."" Bad for the ""country,"" not specifically bad for the ""children."" Thousands of children will have to pay the hefty price of that decision, as they will be institutionalized for the remainder of their childhood, never finding a family of their own. I implore everyone to speak up on this matter. You don't have to adopt a child to show that you care. Just by acknowledging their existence and maybe doing something as simple as taking a minute to think about their plight may lead to a movement, a change, a chance for a better life.","Furness: Number of children globally who have lost both parents nearly equals population of Australia .

"(CNN) -- No American family embodies mainstream Republicanism more than the Bushes, noted a New York Times article this year. For three generations, Bush men have occupied towering positions in the party pantheon, and the party's demographic and ideological shifts can be traced through the branches of the Bush family tree: from Prescott, the blue-blooded Eisenhower Republican, and George H.W. Bush, the transitional figure who tried and failed to emulate the approach of the New Right, to George W. Bush, who embodied the new breed of tax-cutting, evangelical conservatism. Indeed, the Bushes' metamorphosis from genial centrism to deep-fried conservatism has both anticipated and reflected the party's trajectory. But now, Jeb Bush, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, seems to be bucking the trend. He is seeking to return the party to its ideological moorings -- toward the centrism of his grandfather. Even before the GOP's ignominious defeat in November, Jeb was offering tough love to his party, suggesting that Republicans stand up to Grover Norquist and craft a bipartisan compromise to reduce the deficit significantly. But will Republicans listen? There are many reasons to believe they won't. Prescott was a Manhattan investment banker who called himself a ""moderate progressive."" In the 1952 primary between conservative presidential candidate Sen. Robert Taft and moderate Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Prescott chose Eisenhower -- and became the president's favorite golf partner. Prescott rode Eisenhower's coattails into the Senate, where he focused on urban renewal, spearheading the 1954 Housing Act. An early proponent of the line-item veto, he received national recognition as an advocate of fiscal responsibility. Prescott's son George H.W. left for West Texas in 1948 when Texas was still a one-party state. But change was afoot in the South, and by the time H.W. ran for U.S. Senate in 1964, he encountered a flourishing Texas Republican Party that had recently elected its first U.S. senator by attracting hordes of conservative Democrats. But the new rank-and-file Republicans were nothing like the Connecticut Republicans he knew -- or even like those in the Houston suburbs. Biographer Richard Ben Cramer imagined H.W.'s vexation at this new breed of Texas Republican: . ""These ... these nuts! They were coming out of the woodwork! They talked about blowing up the U.N., about armed revolt against the income tax. ...The nuts hated him. They could smell Yale on him."" Recognizing that his 1964 primary campaign would need to be more Goldwater than Rockefeller, he ignored the social problems Prescott had addressed. ""Only unbridled free enterprise can cure unemployment,"" H.W. asserted, contending that government bore no responsibility for alleviating poverty. Though he lost, he began the transition to Sunbelt conservatism that would make him (barely) acceptable to Ronald Reagan as a running mate. But he never fully evolved: He famously reneged on his ""no new taxes"" pledge. His son George W. would complete the transition. George W.'s first major legislative accomplishment as president was the enactment of a massive $1.6 trillion tax cut. He rode roughshod over the green-eyeshade types to pass a massive tax cut. When it produced runaway deficits, he accepted Dick Cheney's argument: ""Reagan taught us that deficits don't matter."" In adopting Sun Belt conservatism -- sometimes clumsily -- George H.W. and George W. anticipated the Republican Party's ideological shift. Hence, in evaluating Jeb's prescriptions for fiscal responsibility, today's Republicans should recall the Bushes' past political palm reading. Politics is about addition, not subtraction. Every year, as Republicans maintain the electoral coalition that responds to their platform, they face an inevitable subtraction from their base. That's because unyielding stances on taxes and deficits practically guarantee that young voters will continue opposing them, and the (older and whiter) constituencies who favor them shrink as a percentage of the electorate. Republicans who believe they can continue to win with their current coalition are like rats who believe they can outrun a treadmill. As the nation approaches $16 trillion of debt and grapples with the baby boomer retirement, young voters will grasp that every dollar spent on entitlement programs is a dollar paid by already-strapped young workers. That may well push young voters to support the party with the most credible deficit-reduction plan. According to 2012 exit polls, 60% of young voters (aged 18-29) supported President Barack Obama. Young voters also made up a slightly larger share of the electorate than they had in 2008. This is a huge problem for Republicans for three reasons. One, people tend to vote with higher frequencies once they hit their 30s. Two, generational cohorts tend to stick with the party they supported in their formative years. And most obviously, young voters are more likely to be around to vote in the future. If it were just about math, Jeb could convince the party to adopt what polling shows are clearly winning positions. But as the work of scholars Gary Miller and Norman Schofield suggests, it's not a linear equation: It's about momentum and intensity within the Republican coalition. That's because the newest entrants to a party's electoral coalition are usually its most robust -- and the hardest to roll in intraparty skirmishes. For Republicans, it is the mostly white and older tea partiers, who block electorally beneficial positions on taxes. The next newest entrants to the coalition are Christian conservatives, many of whom also strongly oppose tax increases. Fiscally conservative and socially progressive Rockefeller types are the oldest group, but they've been leaving the Republican Party for decades. Whereas many of them supported Republican congressional candidates in the 1970s, far less did by the 2000s. So while this group is the easiest to persuade of the need for adjustments (indeed, many already share Jeb's views), they hold the least sway in the party. What does all this mean? American parties since the Civil War have periodically shed the coalition elements that are most distant from their activist base. While Jeb's prescriptions are in the party's long-term interest, they will be difficult to execute, given the strength of the party's coalition members. Can Jeb sway a resistant party base? It's quite possible: His family's odyssey has reflected the party's shifts for 50 years, and he's uniquely positioned to convince his peers. If Republicans listen, it will constitute a return to their roots -- and a reckoning with demographic reality. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Smith.","Jeff Smith: No American family embodies Republicanism more than the Bushes .

"(CNN) -- A Catholic priest in Pennsylvania has been charged with molesting a teenage boy after police said he was found in a car on a college campus with a 15-year-old who was wearing no pants, according to a police criminal complaint filed Friday in Lackawanna County. The Rev. W. Jeffrey Paulish was charged with one felony count of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and one felony count of unlawful contact with a minor after Dunmore police say they found him and the boy on Thursday in a car on the Worthington Scranton campus of Penn State University, according to the complaint. Paulish, 56, of Scranton, was also charged with three misdemeanor counts -- indecent contact with a person under 16, indecent exposure and corruption of a minor. He is being held at the Lackawanna County jail on $50,000 bail. Dunmore police officers say they discovered Paulish and the boy after responding to a call of a suspicious vehicle, according to an arrest warrant affidavit filed with the court. Allegedly Paulish told police he was at the campus working on his homily when he met the teen, who he said was in emotional distress, and began counseling him. According to the affidavit, he later admitted to police that he had arranged the meeting with the teen through the ""casual encounters"" section of Craigslist. Paulish told investigators that he had asked the boy three times if he was over the age of 18, the affidavit said. A telephone message left by CNN for Paulish's attorney, Bernard J. Brown, was not immediately returned Friday. Paulish has been removed from his post at the Prince of Peace parish and has been suspended from acting in the capacity of a priest, according to a statement released by the Diocese of Scranton. The diocese pledged its cooperation with the investigation, and it called on anyone who ""may have been sexually abused by Father Paulish or any member of the clergy"" to notify the district attorney's office. ""I wish to acknowledge how unsettling this is to me personally and to countless others, that yet again a priest has been involved in such inappropriate, immoral and illegal behavior,"" the Bishop of Scranton, the Rev. Joseph Bambera, said in the statement.","The Rev. W. Jeffrey Paulish, 56, was arrested Thursday .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama on Tuesday nominated federal appellate Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court. President Obama on Tuesday introduces Judge Sonia Sotomayor as his choice for the U.S. Supreme Court. If confirmed, Sotomayor, 54, would be the first Hispanic U.S. Supreme Court justice and the third woman to serve on the high court. Sotomayor ""is an inspiring woman who I believe will make a great justice,"" Obama said at a White House announcement. She ""has worked at almost every level of our judicial system, providing her with a depth of experience and a breadth of perspective that will be invaluable as a Supreme Court justice,"" he added. Obama said Sotomayor would bring more experience on the bench than anyone currently serving on the Supreme Court when appointed. ""Thank you, Mr. President, for the most humbling honor of my life,"" Sotomayor said. She thanked family members and mentors who helped her throughout her life and career. ""My heart is bursting with gratitude,"" she said. She gave special recognition to her mother, who was sitting in the audience.  Watch Sotomayor's emotional tribute to her mother » . ""I am an ordinary person who has been blessed with extraordinary opportunities and experiences,"" Sotomayor said. Sotomayor, a judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, was named a U.S. District Court judge by President George H.W. Bush in 1992, and was elevated to her current seat by President Bill Clinton. She has minimal personal assets compared with many of her judicial colleagues; a 2007 financial disclosure form showed her with a checking and savings account valued between $50,000 and $115,000. Sotomayor, who is of Puerto Rican descent, rose from humble beginnings at a housing project in the South Bronx and went on to attend Princeton University and Yale Law School.  Watch more about Sotomayor's personal history » . The president met with Sotomayor at the White House for an hour last Thursday, according to a senior administration official, and came away impressed with her personal story and professional qualifications. Solicitor General Elana Kagan, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and federal appeals court Judge Diane Wood were among the candidates who also received serious consideration, the official said.  Watch CNN's Jim Acosta break the news of Sotomayor's nomination » . The president made his final decision after the weekend and called Sotomayor around 9 p.m. ET Monday, a senior administration official added. Obama ""was looking for someone with a balance of skills: very, very smart; independent thinker; highly regarded for integrity and commitment to the law,"" another senior administration official said. ""He found all of those things with her, including his goal of selecting someone with the empathy factor -- real-world, practical experience and understanding of how the law affects real people.""  Watch as Obama cites Sotomayor's three decades of experience » . Supporters say her appointment history, along with what they call her moderate-liberal views, would give her some bipartisan backing in the Senate. However, Sotomayor has endured recent criticism in the media and blogs from both the left and right over perceived -- some defenders say invented -- concerns about her temperament and intellect. ""Judge Sotomayor is a liberal judicial activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is more important that the law as written,"" said Wendy Long, counsel to the conservative Judicial Confirmation Network. ""She thinks that judges should dictate policy, and that one's sex, race, and ethnicity ought to affect the decisions one renders from the bench."" As she has risen through the judicial ranks, Sotomayor increasingly has drawn the ire and opposition of conservatives. A majority of Republican senators opposed her elevation to the appellate court in 1998.  Read about Sotomayor's record » . Conservatives point to, among other things, her authoring of a 2008 opinion supporting a decision by the city of New Haven, Connecticut, to throw out the results of a firefighter promotion exam because almost no minorities qualified for promotions. The Supreme Court heard an appeal of the case in April; a final opinion is pending. Her critics also highlight comments she made during a panel discussion at Duke University in 2005, where she told students that the federal Court of Appeals is where ""policy is made."" ""I know that this is on tape,"" she then immediately said. ""I should never say that. Because we don't 'make law'... I'm not promoting it, and I'm not advocating it. Having said that, the Court of Appeals is where ... the law is percolating."" Watch how conservatives are gearing up for a fight » . However, an official with the Republican National Committee promised that the GOP will be equitable toward Sotomayor. ""The Republicans are going to strike a tone that's fair, that allows the vetting process to happen like it should, and that's in stark contrast to how the Democrats dealt with Judge [John] Roberts when you look back a couple years ago,"" the official said. Senate Republicans ""will thoroughly examine [Sotomayor's] record to ensure she understands that the role of a jurist in our democracy is to apply the law even-handedly, despite their own feelings or personal or political preferences,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. The hot-button social issue of abortion also promises to play a contentious role in Sotomayor's confirmation process.  Learn about the other Supreme Court justices » . Charmaine Yoest, head of Americans United for Life, ripped Obama's choice of Sotomayor, calling it ""a radical pick that divides America."" Sotomayor's appointment ""would provide a pedestal for an avowed judicial activist ... at a time when the Courts are at a crossroads and critical abortion regulations -- supported by the vast majority of Americans -- like partial-birth abortion and informed consent laws lie in the balance,"" Yoest said. Sotomayor ""will serve the nation with distinction,"" countered Kim Gandy, head of the National Organization for Women. ""She brings a lifelong commitment to equality, justice and opportunity, as well as the respect of her peers, unassailable integrity, and a keen intellect informed by experience."" Obama's nominee will replace retiring Justice David Souter, who announced this month he would step down when the court's current session ends this summer.  Watch why Democrats want the process to go quickly » . Sotomayor's nomination will go before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the full Senate. The president said he hopes to have hearings in July, with the confirmation completed before Congress leaves for the summer. Obama's Democratic party controls the Senate, so Sotomayor is not expected to have difficulty being confirmed in time to start the new court session in October. There had been widespread speculation that Obama would name a woman to the court, which has only one female justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Obama was also under pressure to nominate a Hispanic justice to the court. ""Republicans have to be very careful and not oppose this nomination just for the sake of it,"" warned Brent Wilkes, executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens. The Latino community's ""hopes and aspirations are all tied up in this nominee,"" he said. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said he didn't think any particular gender or ethnic group was ""entitled to representation"" on the court, but acknowledged that Sotomayor's appointment would send a ""powerful message"" to the Latino community and Americans. ""It says a lot about opportunities in our country,"" Gonzales told CNN's Wolf Blizter. ""This is a powerful message, a powerful message of hope and opportunity through this appointment, just like there's a powerful message sent when an African-American is elected president."" CNN's Peter Hamby, Ed Henry, Suzanne Malveaux and Bill Mears contributed to this report.","NEW: Former AG Alberto Gonzales says nomination sends ""powerful message""
