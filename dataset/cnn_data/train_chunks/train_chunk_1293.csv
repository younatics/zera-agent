"Shocking photographs have emerged of a cannibal by the name of Mad Dog eating the flesh of a lynched Muslim man for the second time in as many weeks. In one, 'Mad Dog' - real name Ouandja Magloire - cuts a portion of meat from the body of a murdered Muslim lying burning on a roundabout in the capital of the Central African Republic, with the body of another a few yards away. Another photograph shows him licking a . bloodied knife as he stands over a body, wearing the same T-shirt he . was pictured in during the previous act of cannibalism. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A man who goes by the name of Mad Dog cuts off a portion of a burning body to eat, as the bodies of two lynched Muslim men are burned in a street in Bangui, Central African Republic . 'Mad Dog' licks blood off a knife, as a crowd prepares to burn the body of a lynched Muslim man in Bangui . The horrific images were taken in Bangui on Sunday. According to The Associated Press, . the men were killed by residents of the Sango neighbourhood in revenge . for the lynching of a taxi driver from Sango a day earlier. Two other Muslim passers-by escaped to the protection of French and African peacekeeping forces. The agency understands that Magloire didn't take part in the killings, but turned up in the aftermath. According to its source, he is the only person in the Central African Republic known to be carrying out acts of cannibalism. Meanwhile . Catherine Samba-Panza, 59, was elected mayor of the Central African Republic and used her first speech to appeal to both Christians and . Muslims to stop the fighting. Speaking to the Christian self-defence militia known as 'anti-balaka' (anti-machete), Samba-Panza said: 'Show your support for my nomination by giving the strong signal of laying down your weapons. She . issued a similar appeal to the members of mostly Muslim rebel group . Seleka, telling them: 'Stop the suffering of the people. 'Starting today, I am the president of all Central Africans, without exclusion. Men carry the body of a lynched Muslim man through a street in Bangui, Central African Republic, on Sunday . A French soldier looks on as the body of one of the lynched Muslim men burns . 'The top priority is to stop people's suffering, to restore security and the authority of the state across the country.' Samba-Panza, who is the former mayor Bangui - where Mad Dog's attacks have taken place - is a Christian but did not campaign on religious grounds. In another development the European Union today agreed to send up to 1,000 troops to the region to help restore order. The mission, which will deploy in and around the capital and last up to six months, is expected to involve a force numbering between 400 and 1,000. The troops will help back 1,600 French soldiers and the African Union's MISCA force, which currently has 4,400 troops on the ground. International donors also pledged $496 million (£302 million) in aid to the country this year. Earlier in the month horrific footage emerged from Bangui of Magloire eating the leg of a Muslim who, according to the BBC, was hauled from a bus, battered and then stabbed before being set on fire. Horrific: Ouandja Magloire - who also calls himself 'Mad Dog' -  is seen eating the leg of a Muslim slaughtered by a rampaging Christian mob in the Central African Republic . In the aftermath of the incident, Magloire grabbed hold of his leg and then began to devour it. Magloire told a BBC reporter at the time that his action was . revenge for the murders of his pregnant wife, his sister-in-law and her . baby. He claimed that Muslims were responsible and he was angry with them. 'They broke down the door and cut my baby in half. I promised I would get my revenge,' he said. ‘Mad Dog’ spotted his victim on a minibus and followed him after deciding he looked Muslim. He gathered a crowd of about 20 Christian youths who forced the bus driver to stop and dragged him from the bus. Without emotion he told the BBC: 'I poured petrol over him. I burned him. I ate his leg, right down the white bone.' Witnesses did not intervene but recorded the footage on mobile phones, including the act of cannibalism. A video shows his cheeks bulging as he consumes the flesh. Witness . Jean-Sylvestre Tchya told news agency AFP: 'One of the individuals took . hold of an arm and went and bought some bread and starting chewing on . the flesh, along with his bread. 'The scene made many people vomit, and some cried out in horror.' Another witness, Alain Gbabobou, said he watched a man wrap the head up and proclaim that he would 'feast on it'. Violence: People throw stones at a car transporting two children of an ex-Seleka colonel at the 'UN crossroad' on Sunday in Bangui . Men brandish machets and knives to threaten Muslim people in Bangui . According . to The Sunday Telegraph, this may not have been an isolated incident, . with a source speaking of more than one person being eaten. An aid worker told the paper: 'They were taking machetes to people and burning the bodies and eating . them.' Samba-Panza's election comes 10 . months after the Seleka rebels overthrew the country's government and . installed their leader, Michel Djotodia, as the majority-Christian . country's first Muslim president. But . Djotodia proved powerless to control his fighters, and many went on a . rampage of killing, rape and looting targeting the Christian majority. Some . Christian communities responded by forming self-defence militias and . attacking Muslims. Both sides are accused by rights watchdogs of major . abuses, and the United Nations has warned of a potential inter-religious . genocide. Djotodia stood down under international pressure on January 10. Shocking: A man ate the leg of a Muslim in the Central African Republic's capital, Bengui (pictured), in revenge for the murders of his pregnant wife, his sister-in-law and her baby . So far it has claimed around 1,000 lives, with the reports of cannibalism bringing to mind the macabre tales associated with Jean Bedel Bokassa, who ruled the CAR with an iron fist between 1966 and 1979. He was regarded by many as a brutal dictator and was accused of eating human flesh, incorporating it in meals for visiting officials and feeding slain opponents to animals. He died in 1996 and received a posthumous pardon in 2010. Some Christian fighters believe that human flesh makes them invincible and put chunks inside amulets that they wear.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"An Orthodox Jew was beaten up by a gang of teenagers who said the attack was a protest ‘about the Palestinians and the Jewish community’, a court has heard. Balawal Sultan, 18, Kesa Malik, 19, Hassnain Aliamin, 18, all from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and a 17-year-old boy have all admitted attacked the 41-year-old victim in nearby Gateshead. Sultan, who had hours earlier sent a text message saying he was ‘going Jew bashing’, lay in wait with the other three behind a van before pouncing on the victim as he walked home to his family. Admitted racially-aggravated common assault: Balawal Sultan (left), 18, and Hassnain Aliamin (right), 18, all from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, were involved in the attack of a 41-year-old victim in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear . The victim screamed in fear as the pack chased him down the street, throwing wood at him, before tripping as he fled and being surrounded by the teenagers while stricken on the ground. One of the thugs was threatening to kick him in the head when the victim was saved by a friend. The attackers claimed they were only in the area looking for a new mosque but one of them admitted the planned attack was motivated by the dispute between Israel and Palestine. After all four teenagers pleaded guilty to racially-aggravated common assault, the victim said he has been left feeling unsafe. In a statement to Newcastle Crown Court, he said: ‘I feel shaken and unsafe to walk the streets in my own community. I have never experienced fear and terror like it and I have no doubt I was attacked for being Jewish. ‘I was targeted because of my religion and I’m now scared to walk past members of the Asian community with whom otherwise I have no problem. When I come across a person from the Middle East I feel scared and petrified. In the gang: The group had set about looking for a victim, with Kesa Malik (pictured), 19, driving . ‘I’m part of a very close community and this has had a far-reaching impact, word having spread and fear having also spread. I think this was because of the coverage of the ongoing conflict in the media, even though that had nothing to do with my community. ‘I’m a peaceful person from a quiet and peaceful community and I’ve never been in that position before. I have been greatly affected by it and but for the intervention of my friend the consequences could have been far worse.’ The man said he has suffered nightmares about the attack and has been left living in fear. He added: ‘Now, coming home at night fills me with fear. The incident has left me annoyed and angry because I used to be able to walk around the area I live without any fear. These men have changed my life and I only hope I’m able to get over this very difficult period.’ The night before the attack, Sultan sent a text message saying ‘I’m going to go Jew bashing. Haha’. Hours later, just after midnight on July 18, he and the others set about carrying out the threat. With Malik driving, they started looking for a victim. The man they attacked had been at a Jewish study room nearby and was on his way home. Bridie Smurthwaite, prosecuting, said: ‘The defendants had deliberately travelled to the area in Gateshead where there were members of the Jewish community with the particular intention of targeting someone from that community. ‘The Crown say the victim was targeted because he was wearing traditional Jewish attire, a black suit and white shirt and a black hat. ‘As he walked along (a road) he saw a man standing by a parked van and he felt slightly nervous because he appeared to be looking at him. The man disappeared behind the van and the complainant continued along the street. Attack location: The victim screamed in fear as the pack chased him down the street in this area of Gateshead (above), throwing wood at him, before tripping as he fled and being surrounded by the teenagers . ‘He thought the man had gone but as he reached the van, the four defendants ran out from behind the van charging towards him. He was petrified and started to run and was screaming ""Help me, help me"". ‘He ran away and a piece of wood was thrown at him and landed at his feet. Terrified and running, he lost his balance and tripped. He thinks he fell because of the piece of wood.’ As he lay injured on the ground, he was surrounded by Sultan, Malik, Aliamin and the youth. The victim screamed ‘I have done nothing to you’, and one of the men pulled his foot back as if he was about to kick him in the head. Miss Smurthwaite said: ‘He continued screaming for help and fortunately for him the screams were heard by a family friend of his, whose doorway this was happening in. ‘The witness saw two men kneeling on top of his friend and two men watching. It was his intervention which caused the attack to come to an end.’ They ran off and the victim was ushered inside by his friend, who said he was dishevelled, unsteady, confused and in shock. His clothes were dirty and his palms, forearm and elbow were grazed and bleeding. When police caught up with the attackers they claimed they were just looking for a new mosque. But Sultan admitted when they saw the victim they chased him and threw a stick as a ‘protest about the Palestinians and about the Jewish community’ but denied making any contact with him. Sultan, Malik, Aliamin, and the 17-year-old – who was aged 16 at the time of the attack - all admitted racially-aggravated common assault. Aliamin’s barrister said he accepted the attack was racially motivated and apologised. He said Aliamin, who is a delivery driver and college student, had brought shame on his family. Joe Hedworth, for the youth, said: ‘He understands this kind of behaviour is utterly unacceptable.’ Barristers for the other two will mitigate when they are sentenced.","Orthodox Jew, 41, beaten up by teenage gang on street in Gateshead .

"Blundering builders mistakenly bulldozed an 18th-century chateau in the heart of France's picturesque wine country - when they were only supposed to knock down an outhouse on its estate. Chateau de Bellevue, 12km to the east of Bordeaux, once boasted 140,000-square-feet of grand reception rooms, ornate fireplaces, winding marble staircases and imposing granite balconies. Then its new owner, a Russian millionaire businessman, employed a team of Polish builders to renovate the manor to its former baroque glory, including the removal of one small building. But the workers apparently misunderstood the instructions and pulled down the castle instead, leaving the outhouse completely untouched. No you see it: The Chateau de Bellevue was considered a local treasure boasting a grand hall that could host some 200 people, as well as a sweeping stone staircase . Now you don't: Workers who were hired to renovate the grand 140,000-square-foot manor and raze a small building on the same estate in southwest France mixed them up . 'The Chateau de Bellevue was Yvrac's . pride and joy,' said former owner Juliette Marmie. 'The whole village is . in shock. How can this construction firm make such a mistake?' Local media reported that the construction company misunderstood the renovation plans of the current owner, Russian businessman Dmitry Stroskin, to clean up and renovate the manor. Stroskin was away when the calamity occurred and returned home to discover his chateau, a local treasure whose grand hall could host some 200 people, was nothing but rubble. 'We're in shock': The outhouse that the builders were supposed to destroy is now the only part of the once lavish property still standing . Piles of rubble: The Polish builders misunderstood the instructions to clean up the building and restore it to its former glory . Task ahead: The castle's Russian millionaire owner Dmitry Stroskin has vowed to rebuild it stone by stone into an exact replica .

"Civil rights pioneer Ruby Bridges says America today looks a lot like the world she helped break apart 54 years ago: A nation with segregated schools and racial tension. 'You almost feel like you're back in the '60s,' said Bridges, who is now 60 years old. 'The conversation across the country, and it doesn't leave out New Orleans, is that schools are reverting back' to being segregated along racial lines, she said. 'We all know that there are schools being segregated again.' On Nov. 14, 1960, Bridges — then six years old — became the first black student to attend a previously all-white elementary school in New Orleans. U.S. Deputy Marshals seen escorting the then six-year-old Ruby Bridges from William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans in November 1960 . On Friday — 54 years later to the day when she first walked up the steps to William Frantz Elementary School — she commemorates that event with the unveiling of a statue in her likeness at her old school. Also, she is reuniting with the white teacher who taught her and with the sole-surviving U.S. marshal who walked her to school. Her mother, who was adamant about sending her daughter to the all-white school, will be at the reunion too. Bridges said racism remains painfully real today. She pointed to the tense events in Ferguson, Missouri, after a police officer shot and killed an unarmed black man, revelations about racist comments made by owners in the National Basketball Association and how so many American schools have failed to become racially mixed. Back in 1960, Bridges, flanked by U.S. marshals, had to walk past a mob of jeering segregationist protesters and Confederate flags to enter her school. One woman shouted threats to poison her. Another woman showed up at protests with a coffin with a black baby doll in it. All the white students at the school were pulled from classes and teachers quit — leaving Bridges as the school's only student. Bridges said racism was a problem before President Barack Obama's election but that his presidency has fueled racism. Ruby Bridges (pictured today) who integrated Louisiana schools in 1960 under escort from U.S. Marshals, meets with Charles Burks, who was one of those marshals, at the Indianapolis Children's Museum . 'Race is a very hot topic right now,' she said. She looks at her own experiences as evidence of a new segregation. For example, white students returned to William Frantz and the school became integrated, she said. She added that she went to integrated middle and high schools in New Orleans. Fast forward to today: The school now occupying the William Frantz building is 97 percent black, according to school data. In New Orleans, after integration, whites generally sent their children to private or parochial schools — and that preference continues today. Blacks today make up 86 percent of the public school enrolment, according to 2013 data from the Cowen Institute for Public Education Initiatives at Tulane University. She called demographic shifts since Hurricane Katrina — whites now make up a higher percentage of the city than before the 2005 flooding of the city — as evidence of gentrification rather than integration of schools and neighborhoods. She wondered why lawmakers and school officials can't do more to make schools more racially mixed. 'How did we integrate schools back in the 1960s? If those people did it back then, I can't understand why we can't do it today for the betterment of a community or for a society.' She said the key to a more integrated society lies with children. 'Kids really don't care about what their friends look like. Kids come into the world with clean hearts, fresh starts,' she said. 'If we are going to get through our differences, it's going to come through them.' Since the mid-1990s, Bridges has become a speaker at schools across the nation, telling her story and talking out against bullying.","Ruby Bridges first attended an all-white elementary school in New Orleans 54 years ago today .

"The families who lost relatives on the Malaysian airlines flight MH17 in July are fuming after what they believe to be an insufficient offer of compensation made by the airline. The Sun Herald reported that families have been angered by the airline's offer of initial $US50,000 ($57,1116) compensation accepted by 15 families. The passenger jet was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 passengers, including 38 Australian citizens and residents. Families of those lost in the MH17 disaster are fuming after Malaysian airlines made an offer of $57,000 compensation . Tom and Angela Mahady (pictured), parents of Edel Mahady, pray during a memorial service for victims of the MH17 disaster at St Mary's Cathedral . The aviation lawyer who helped negotiate $10 million in compensation from Libya for families of the Lockerbie disaster said the offer was an 'insult'. Jerry Skinner, a US attorney who is also co-associate of Sydney form LHD, is an expert in the law around aviation disasters and has been working with a number of grieving families to get suitable compensation following the disaster. 'Families from my experience usually file a suit not because of the loss alone but because of the loss of respect they feel from the carrier after the accident occurs, and that's what's going to happen here,' he told the Sun Herald. Mr Skinner believes there isn't a case on the MH17 flight that's worth anything less than  $US180,000, which is more than $AU200,000. The aviation lawyer has also praised Prime Minister Tony Abbott for speaking out on justice for all those killed in the flight and his stance against Russian president Vladimir Putin. Mr Abbott said he would confront the president over the MH17 tragedy, promising to 'shirt front' him when they next met at the G20 summit in Brisbane next month.

But the Australian foreign affairs minister was able to talk with the Russian president first. In a one on one chat with the president on Friday, Julie Bishop pushed the issue that access needed to be regained to the MH17 crash site . Mr Putin agreed to use his influence on the rebels in eastern Ukraine, to help experts return to the crash site.","MH17 Families fuming over $57,000 offer of compensation by Malaysian airlines .

"An American woman has leaped overboard from a Hawaii-bound cruise ship in a bid to kill herself - sparking a massive search by the Coast Guard. Another traveler saw the 54-year-old woman, who has not been identified, jumping from the Grand Princess cruise liner into the Pacific Ocean about 650 miles northeast of Hilo at 2pm on Wednesday. The traveler notified staff who confirmed the incident was also captured on a security camera. A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises said that they launched a search for the woman and the Coast Guard sent a C-130 plane to assist at 4pm - but she is presumed dead. Overboard: An American woman jumped from a Grand Princess cruise liner (file picture) on Wednesday . 'This is very sad,' spokeswoman Julie Benson said. 'This was not an accident.

"Former Defence Force chief, Angus Houston, and the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, have been named as Australia's next knights. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the Queen accepted his recommendation that the Duke of Edinburgh and Air Chief Marshal Houston 'be awarded Australia's highest honour as Knights of the Order of Australia'. Mr Abbott said Prince Philip was receiving the honour to recognise his contribution to Australia over the course of the Queen's 62-year reign. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott recommended former Defence Chief Angus Houston for a knighthood . Sir Houston (left) led the investigation into missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 . 'Prince Philip's long life of service and dedication should be honoured by Australia,' Mr Abbott said. 'For three quarters of a century, Prince Philip has served the Crown, and the wider Commonwealth. 'He has served Australia with distinction and is patron of over 800 organisations.' He said the The Duke of Edinburgh's Award in Australia had 'supported the development of young Australians for more than fifty years'. Mr Abbott said Air Chief Marshal Houston's knighthood was to recognise his 'extraordinary and pre-eminent achievement and merit in service to Australia over many years'. Mr Abbott praised Air Chief Marshal Houston, who served in the armed forces for more than forty years, rising to become Chief of Air Force in 2001 and Chief of the Defence Force in 2005. Prince Philip (right) was also put forward by Mr Abbott for Australia's highest honour . Prince Philip's (seen here in Perth in 2011) long life of service and dedication 'should be honoured by Australia,' Mr Abbott said . He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2003 and made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2008. Since retiring from the military in 2011, he has worked as Chairman of the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board, Chairman of Airservices Australia and Chairman of the Council for the Order of Australia. 'Successive governments have relied on Sir Angus' wisdom, judgment and character,' Mr Abbott said. 'Throughout his life, Sir Angus has put Australia first. 'He immigrated to Australia as an adult, he chose Australia and we are much the better for it.' This year's knighthoods follow last year's appointments, which were the first since the system of knights and dames was reinstated by Mr Abbott. The Duke of Edinburgh's Award has helped young Australians for more than fifty years . The first dame under the changes was the former governor-general Quentin Bryce and the first knight was her replacement, Governor-General Peter Cosgrove. Up to four knights or dames can be appointed in any year. The British system was reintroduced in March 2014 after Gough Whitlam in 1976 won the approval of the Queen for an Australian system of honours and awards. Before then, prominent and deserving Australians were included in the Order of the British Empire.","Former Defence Force chief Angus Houston has been given a knighthood .

"A Django Unchained actress who allegedly had sex with her boyfriend in a car has blamed society and the shooting of teenager Michael Brown for why she accused police of 'racially profiling' her. Daniele Watts claimed she was harassed by Los Angeles Police Department officers after they arrested her as she straddled her boyfriend Brian James Lucas in a silver Mercedes in Studio City. Watts, who is black, and her white partner were having sex in the vehicle near the CBS TV studios at the time, according to witnesses. However, the actress has maintained they were only kissing. Now, she has blamed the killing of 18-year-old Brown in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson - as well as her own history of allegedly racial profiling - for why she 'exploded' at police. Scroll down for video . Couple: Daniele Watts claimed she was harassed by officers of the Los Angeles Police Department, who arrested her as she embraced her boyfriend Brian James Lucas (both pictured) in a car in Studio City. 'Lewd conduct': Watts, who is black, and her white partner were having sex in the vehicle near the CBS TV studios at the time, according to witnesses. However, the actress has maintained they were only kissing . Speaking at a panel discussion at USC's School of Law on Monday, Watts said: 'If we're going to condemn me, then we also have to look at the entire society that I am a product of.' Referring to Brown's death at the hands of officer Darren Wilson on August 9, she added: 'At a certain point, enough is enough and somebody has to say something.' Watts also told listeners that witnessing her black father being profiled by a white policeman when she was 16 had influenced her to pull the race card on officers on September 11, according to the Los Angeles Times. The actress was detained by LAPD Sargaent Jim Parker after he responded to complaints that a couple was engaging in a 'lewd sex act' and she refused to provide identification when asked. Arrest: Now, Watts (pictured crying during her arrest) has blamed the killing of Michael Brown in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson - as well as her own history of allegedly racial profiling - for why she 'exploded' at police . Shooting: Referring to Brown's (left) death at the hands of officer Darren Wilson (right) on August 9, she told listeners at USC's School of Law: 'At a certain point, enough is enough and somebody has to say something' Although Watts was released with no charges at the time, a subsequent investigation 'revealed witnesses who were willing to provide evidence of a criminal act,' said a department spokesman. Two weeks ago, the star and Lucas were charged with misdemeanor lewd conduct by the Los Angeles city attorney's office. The couple have said they are 'appalled' by the charges. As the case hit the headlines in September, Watts was lambasted for 'crying wolf' by numerous civil rights activists, including Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable President, Earl Ofari Hutchinson. Hutchinson, who initially supported Watts's racial profiling allegations but later changed his tune, told reporters: 'We take racial profiling very seriously. It's not a play thing. It's not trivial.' In an audio recording, Watts could be confronting police in a heated exchange during which she used the N-word, and claimed legal expertise from her experience playing a cop on TV. 'You're not the one in handcuffs, you're not the one who's spent your life being called a n*****, and growing up in the South and now I get the cops called on me,' she told officers through tears. 'I'm an actress at this studio! I'm in a major sitcom and I'm still being put in handcuffs because I'm making out with my boyfriend.' The release of the audio file came shortly after still images showed Watts - who played Coco in the 2012 film Django Unchained - straddling Lucas in a parked car in public. Allegations: Watts is perhaps best known for her small role in Django Unchained, playing a slave called Coco (left). She posted the picture on the right to Facebook, claiming she was injured in the September 11 arrest . Sgt Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, later said he was offended by claims that Watts was harassed because she is a black woman with a white boyfriend. He said he feared that if he and other officers had not recorded their run-in with Watts, her allegations would have ruined their careers. Watts was joined at the panel discussion by USC professors Camille Gear Rich, Michelle Gordon, Shana Redmond and Diana Williams.

"James May has defended himself and the rest of the Top Gear team over a controversial numberplate which allegedly poked fun at the Falklands War.

"The family of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen shot dead by a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri in August, have called for their neighbors and supporters to keep calm whether or not a grand jury chooses to indict Officer Darren Wilson. Brown's father Michael Sr. made the call for peace as he and Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden visited Geneva to ask for continued U.N. pressure on the United States government over the affair. Back in Missouri, meanwhile, Governor Jay Nixon said on Tuesday the National Guard would be on standby to respond to any violence after the grand jury decision.

Nixon said 1,000 police officers had undergone more than 5,000 hours of specialized training ahead of the grand jury decision. Hoping such training and force would not be necessary, Brown Sr. said Wednesday: . 'Me and his mother have come to the U.N. to get redress for our son,' Brown Sr. told a news conference after a session of the U.N. Committee on Torture which held a regular review of the U.S. record. 'There couldn't be a better place to do that.' 'The Brown family continue to call for non-violence. They continue to feel the Grand Jury will do the right thing,' Parks told reporters in Geneva. In addition to the National Guard, police officers from across the state could be called on to restore order if protests get out of hand, Nixon told a news conference. A decision by the grand jury is expected in mid-to-late November. The August shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by Darren Wilson sparked a national debate on race relations and led to weeks of street demonstrations. Some groups have threatened extensive protests if the officer is not charged with a crime. 'That ugliness was not representative of Missouri and it cannot be repeated,' Nixon said.

The New York Times cited Baden as saying that Brown was shot at least six times, twice in the head. Missouri officials did a separate autopsy. In addition to the St. Louis grand jury investigation, there are two federal investigations under way, one into the shooting and one into wider policing practices in Ferguson.

"Former two-time World Player of the Year Ronaldinho sold himself short by lacking professionalism, according to the manager who offloaded him to Mexican side Queretaro last month. Levir Culpi suggested that although the playmaker helped Atletico Mineiro to their first Copa Libertadores title last year, the Braizilian star could have done more. 'It's a shame he doesn't want to pay the price of being a professional athlete because he has done it all,' Culpi said in an interview with local newspaper Estado de Minas on Monday.

He sparkled there at first but was disappointing this year. Ronaldinho has 'has done it all' says Culpi, including winning the Ballon D'or and Champions League . Ronaldinho helped Culpi to Atletico's first Copa Libertadores win in 2013, and 'should be well remembered' Culpi, who took over earlier this year, balanced his comments with some praise for the former Gremio and Flamengo playmaker.

"Memories can be a dark reminder of a life spent fighting for freedom, but they can also tell a story of survival, perseverance and resilience. Sylvia McNeall was only a child when she lived through some of the 20th century's most historic and horrific times. The Russian revolution in Moscow, World War II, the angst of her family being forced to move from place to place to escape concentration camps, living as a refugee and migrating to Australia. Sylvia with her mother and father in 1940s . Sylvia's mother on the Kurfürstendam Berlin, 1941-42 . The Sydney author has told her story of three generations of the Zinoffsky and Parret family, her book 'Foresight and Perseverance' a compelling memoir of historical importance. Sylvia's grandfather in Moscow . But while a past of battle and struggle haunts so many, Sylvia has concentrated her extraordinary life of survival on the good times, praising her beloved father who kept her family going. 'My father kept his humanity through all difficulties, he was in Berlin with all the bombing and sent us to an area, a lovely town, to escape the bombing, a Red Cross town,' said Sylvia. 'I understood (about the hard times etc.) we had family stories from grandparents, other members of the family, I was very aware of what was happening.' Her book, primarily told through the eyes of a young girl, provides an insight into Sylvia's Estonian family and their struggle to fight for a better life. 'We lived in Berlin World war 2, father had a job as an architect.' 'The bombing became horrific, he had to stay for his job, accommodation bombed out twice, lost a lot of things, family photographs but he survived. 'It was scary but I only had memories of good times, times were exciting when both Russians and Americans used to try and stop the huge exodus from the east to west.'

Life in Estonia : Sylvia's cousin Ly, another cousin, her mother, sister Esther and herslef, Talinn 1942 . 'Occasionally we were caught but we would escape and go again, it was a traumatic time but my father drew attention to the beautiful things.' Sylvia told of how she was mostly affected as a child by becoming a refugee. '625 kilometres mostly walking for several months during summer from Karlsvad to Heidleberg, we lived there for four years, it was a deprived time in Germany.' She also tells the fascinating tale of immigrating to Australia in 1949 in search of a safer place to raise a family and a better life. 'It was very well known about, Australia, father was always interested in topical events and he really researched.' The family had an option of migrating to America, Canada or Australia but the plentiful land down under seemed the more attractive option. 'America had no support, he wasn't interested in Canada, father liked Australia,' she said. 'He realised you had to sign a two year contract to work, you had accommodation in a migrant hostel which was free until you were working.' Sylvia's father (pictured right) and mother (pictured left) Sylvia's father and mother and Esther (her sister), in Tallinn 1938 . But the trip to begin their new life in Australia was a long and arduous affair, it took three weeks by ship in conditions that were not so favourable. 'We moved such a lot it was a normal thing for me.' 'The ship voyage was pretty awful, men slept downstairs next to the engines, it was very hot and I got pretty sea sick but the food wasn't too bad.' Sylvia described her families start in Australia, although exciting, as pretty mundune. 'The food was ordinary, the hostel was primitive but my sister and I had learnt English in Germany so I went to school, I fit in ok, there was also another Latvian girl there.' 'My grandmother came with us, she was 68, but she got a job in the clothing industry because she didn't like the hostels.' Her love and her families love for Australia soon grew, Sylvia thankful her father made that decision to migrant to a land so far away. 'It brang a lot of opportunities, a new life for us, Germany held no future, well in 49' things were so deprived,' she said. 'Australia offered a future and I was very happy to come.' Moscow days :Sylvia's mother and her siblings (left to right) Hans, Martha and Linda Leoff-Lohse . Birthday party with family,Tallinn 1933 . Out of the hostels Sylvia's family then moved to Kings Cross where they got a flat, which started the beginning of their integration into Australian society. 'Started going to Double Bay primary school, Randwick high.' 'Father learnt english and got a better job but our upbringing continued to be Estonian, celebrating in our heritage.' 'When I finished high school I got a scholarship to Sydney college, the national arts school, did five years. My friends were mostly people from Australia.' Sylvia said she had two motivators to writing the book, she was interested in finding out all she could on her family history, while she also wanted to expose what communism did in Estonia. 'You don't hear much about Estonia, Lithuania, Poland as a result of communism.' 'The most intriguing simularity to what happened in Estonia is what is happening in Ukraine now,' said Sylvia.

"Kabir Ahmed, from Derby, has 'blown himself up on an ISIS suicide mission, according to reports on social media . A British ISIS suicide bomber who has killed eight people was previously jailed for saying gay people should be stoned and burned to death. Former care worker and father-of-three Kabir Ahmed, 30, said he was prepared to sacrifice his own children 'a hundred times for Allah' in his last known interview before driving an explosives-laden truck into an Iraqi police convoy. He reportedly killed eight people and injured 15 others after blowing himself up in Iraq on Friday. Just two and a half years earlier, he was the first person to be prosecuted in Britain under laws introduced in March 2010 that ban stirring up hatred due to sexual orientation. Ahmed, who was allegedly brainwashed while studying at the University of East London, had been caught with two friends outside a mosque in Derby handing out leaflets that called for homosexuals to face the death penalty. The police received hundreds of complaints about the leaflets which locals described as ‘terrifying’. Ahmed was jailed for 15 months, during which time he was given a further conviction for targeting gay people during a pride procession in Derby. After serving his sentence, Ahmed abandoned his wife Nashira Arif, 28, and their three children 16 months ago to join Islamic group Jund al-Sham in Syria before switching his allegiance to IS. It was also well known before he left the country that Ahmed had links to Anjem Choudary and the banned British terrorist organisation al-Muhajiroun. In one interview available online, the jihadi said he was ‘craving martyrdom’. ‘This is more important that my family. I would sacrifice my children 100 times for the sake of Allah,' he said. Yesterday, Ahmed’s family told the Mail that authorities in the UK could have stopped him murdering innocents by arresting him at the airport as he left for Syria 16 months ago. Despite being known to the authorities as an extremist, he had been allowed through airport security last year to join jihadis. Ahmed, who was known to have links to hate preacher Anjem Choudary,  had been calling for terrorist atrocities against the West on Twitter and was being monitored by the US government. Speaking from his brother Saghir Admed’s terraced house in Derby, one female family member said: ‘He died the day he left us. ‘We are very, very sad that we lost him. But if they had stopped him at the airport he would never have gone in the first place.’ His family are said to be moderate Muslims who were ‘heartbroken’ when he left. A woman at his brother’s house yesterday said they had no idea where he went. Ahmed, pictured with Iraqi children, was jailed in 2012 for handing out homophobic leaflets in Derby . ‘He just left us and everybody knows we don’t have contact with him and we haven’t tried to contact him,’ she said. Ahmed’s mother Nasreen Akhtar, 53, is said to have ‘suffered a huge loss’. Friends said she ‘had nothing to do with how Kabir turned out’. Speaking in an online interview, Ahmed said it was British and American foreign policy in the Islamic world that had led him to extremism. 'It wasn't the videos, it wasn't the lectures, it wasn't the books that I was reading. What radicalised me was the Government. 'The American government, the British government ... and what they were doing to our people in Iraq and Afghanistan.' On Friday, Ahmed – also known as Abu Sumayyah al-Britani – killed eight people in an IS suicide bomb attack. He is one of an estimated 500 British jihadis who have travelled to the Middle East to fight for the barbaric terror group. The group said he drove eight tons of explosives into a group of Shi’ite Muslims in Baiji, northern Iraq. Those murdered included a senior military commander. Ahmed changed his name to Abu Sumayah al-Britani and fights with ISIS (file picture  of ISIS fighters in Syria) An internet message board shows Ahmed and Choudary had communicated online as recently as March, with Ahmed referring to the hate preacher as ‘my brother’. Speaking from an internet cafe near his terror training camp in Idlib, North West Syria, this summer, he told an online radio show: ‘It’s really, really fun. It’s better than that game Call of Duty. It’s like that but it’s in 3D where everything is happening in front of you.’ A spokesman for the University of East London said it was unlikely that Ahmed had been radicalised while there, since he had only studied there for four months. 'We can confirm that a Kabir Ahmed studied at UEL between September 2003 and February 2004. He spent barely four months here and that was a decade ago,' the spokesman said. 'If this were the same person as is being reported in the media, then we believe it highly improbable that he was either radicalised or brainwashed while at UEL, as has been suggested. 'Considering the very short time that Mr Ahmed was with us, and that he was convicted of a hate crime almost a decade after leaving UEL, it would suggest that he chose his path away from our university. 'Here at UEL, we have an excellent record of multi-faith and multi-cultural harmony and equality and diversity. We continue to work closely with the authorities to make sure that radicalisation is neither tolerated nor allowed any room at UEL. 'If this were the same student, we would, nonetheless, extend our thoughts and condolences to his family at what for them will be a very difficult time.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Iraq and are looking into them.’ The Home Office said it would not comment on why Ahmed was allowed out of the country. Returning Islamist fighters are being offered ‘jihadi rehab’ instead of prosecution. Many of the 300 young men who have arrived back from Syria and Iraq have been offered places on the Government’s counter-radicalisation scheme, known as the Channel programme. The scheme has seen a 58 per cent rise – from 748 to 1,281 – in the number of referrals in the past year as the crisis in the Middle East has grown. Evidence of the softer approach comes despite assurances from Home Secretary Theresa May that terrorist sympathisers will face the full force of the law. She said new legislation should be ready by the end of this month as David Cameron insisted returning jihadis should face ‘criminal investigations and prosecution’. But Whitehall sources say securing evidence of terrorist activities committed 2,000 miles away in Syria is proving difficult.","Kabir Ahmed, 30, was first to be jailed under anti-discrimination law in 2012 .

"There was not a hairdryer in sight but there was plenty of hair standing on the backs of necks. ‘I went into a sort of trance listening to him,’ said Rory McIlroy, perhaps explaining what happened to certain referees at Old Trafford over the years. McIlroy was speaking on the morning after the highlight of his Ryder Cup week so far, the presence in the European team room at Gleneagles of Britain’s finest-ever football manager, Sir Alex Ferguson. Rory McIlroy has admitted he was 'in a trance' during Sir Alex Ferguson's motivational speech . World No 1 McIlroy is preparing for the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles with the European team . Sir Alex Ferguson has been used to be giving motivational speeches during his time at Old Trafford . The great man went into fine detail about how to deal with the mantle of favouritism, and how he made Old Trafford a fortress. ‘He talked about how when teams went there it was very hard for them to compete and how we’re slight favourites for a reason and we should embrace it,’ said McIlroy. ‘I was looking up at him and I couldn’t take my eyes off him. I’m just listening and thinking this is all the stuff he’s probably said to all the great Man United teams over the years. ‘He told us a couple of stories about his experience in big matches, and we got to ask him questions about what he thought was a key element to being successful as a team. ‘He’s just a very inspirational man when he talks. He’s got a lot of authority and the room just goes quiet and everyone listens.’ Not everyone was quite as rapt as the big United fan, of course. Not with fans of Liverpool, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich represented among the other 11 team members. ‘Believe me, they let it be known that not everyone in the room was a Manchester United fan,’ said McIlroy. Real Madrid fan Sergio Garcia probably spoke for the rest. ‘Given who I support you’ll appreciate I’m probably not his biggest fan in the world, but I think when you have the chance to listen to somebody who has been up there in sports, it’s always interesting to pick their brain,’ he said. ‘He was fascinating and I think I speak for everyone when I say we’re glad we got to know him a little better.’ It wasn’t just the players Ferguson addressed. He had a little banter with the caddies as well. ‘As you can imagine, he enjoyed all that,’ said Europe captain Paul McGinley, who hatched the idea some months ago. ‘I was upstairs at the time having a rules meeting and even though it was one floor down and five rooms across, I could hear the laughter coming up. It went very well.’ McIlroy is a huge Man United fan and said the former manager's speech was inspirational . McIlroy takes part in a practice session at Gleneagles Golf Course on Tuesday . Ferguson's entrance at Gleneagles was supposed to be a surprise, according to captain Paul McGinley . Day two of official practice and plenty of pairings that will see service during the Ryder Cup itself were in action on both sides. Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson were in tandem, as were Thomas Bjorn and Stephen Gallacher. Graeme McDowell and Victor Dubuisson got another trial runout together, while Henrik Stenson played with Justin Rose. It is what will happen with the other four players that is particularly interesting — McIlroy, Garcia, Ian Poulter and Martin Kaymer. All four will surely see action on the first morning but who will be paired with whom? Will McGinley take the high-profile option and go for McIlroy and Poulter, with the former playing with Kaymer in the foursomes after lunch? Just as he has all week, McIlroy had a new driver in the bag yesterday and was quick to allay any fears that it represented a gamble. ‘This is a driver that I have been actually using and practising with since June, and I wouldn’t be putting it in the bag if I didn’t feel it was better,’ he said. ‘It’s the only driver I have been practising with, so I think that probably gives a clear idea of what is going to happen.’ As for the Americans, captain Tom Watson’s selections appear cast in stone. For the second day running he sent them out in the same order. You’ve got the A team of Keegan Bradley (left) and Phil Mickelson. Masters champion Bubba Watson will partner Webb Simpson and Rickie Fowler will team up with rookie Jimmy Walker. Veteran Jim Furyk has been paired with another debutant, Patrick Reid. Zach Johnson and Hunter Mahan will see action together, as will Matt Kuchar and Jordan Spieth. To be fair to Watson, all make perfect sense, but it does lead to the question of where’s the Plan B if things are not going to plan. The action unfolded on a sublime autumn day and was played out before a vast crowd. Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond turned up, looking none too bruised from last week’s experience. What Salmond and the organisers would give for three days of such weather come tomorrow. This particular course at Gleneagles might be far from a masterpiece but it is clear it is going to be a great Ryder Cup course, with fabulous viewing spots for spectators and sumptuous glimpses of the amazing scenery. Only one day to go now, and Mickelson has raised the stakes deliciously with his tasty, barbed attack on McIlroy and Graeme McDowell, while poking fun at Europe’s supposedly superior team spirit. All we need now to complete the scene is for Rory and Phil to be drawn to play against one another tomorrow morning. Wouldn’t that set the Ryder Cup alight?

"Hot yoga has become the one of the most fashionable forms of exercise, with a celebrity following including Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Coleen Rooney. Pouring with sweat from contorting their bodies into difficult positions in sweltering heat, it's devotees swear it improves flexibility, aids weight loss and can even relieve the symptoms of common ailments like depression and arthritis. But now, one doctor warns it could have an ugly side effect: thread veins. Madonna (left) and Gwyneth Paltrow (right) are both known to be fans of hot yoga, which doctors now say could cause thread veins . Coleen Rooney used hot yoga to get back in shape after her second child (she is  pictured left leaving a hot yoga class in Liverpool) and Andy Murray (right) started hot yoga six years ago to improve his flexibility . The news comes after U.S. research dispelled one myth about hot yoga, finding people who practiced the craze didn't burn any more calories or work harder than than in regular yoga. Dr Peter Finigan, Medical Director at Dr Newmans Clinic and a specialist in thread vein removal, says the number of patients he has treated for thread veins whose hobby is hot yoga has gone up by 25 per cent year on year. He said: 'Hot yoga is definitely an exacerbating factor in making facial thread veins more obvious. As the body temperature rises, blood vessels dilate allowing blood to flow near the surface of the skin to help cool it down.' He added: 'Two years ago, we didn’t treat any patients who did hot yoga. One patient had recently qualified as a hot yoga instructor and had developed more facial thread veins over the 18 months that she had been teaching.' He advised hot yoga fans to limit the number of sessions they do per week. And it's not only hot yoga that can bring about thread veins, the unsigthly red or purple wiggly lines that develop as we age and our skin and blood vessels become less elastic. They can come about from washing in either very hot or cold water. This causes the blood vessels in the skin to dilate or clamp shut – which over time can trigger thread veins – as the skin flushes as it reacts to cope with the extremes in temperature. Dr Finigan said: 'I would advise patients against washing in extremely hot or cold water for a prolonged period of time, which I would say is about 15-20 minutes, on a regular basis.' Hot yoga . Washing in very hot or cold water . Facelifts . Fillers and rhinoplasty . Hormonal changes due to pregnancy, or liver disease . They are also a common side effect of facial fillers and rhinoplasty - or nose reshaping – as the skin reacts to the 'trauma' of the injection or the procedure. Dr Finigan said: 'We have a key number of patients who regularly have fillers, who come and see us to have their thread veins removed – usually once a year – as they reappear when the fillers are injected.' 'It's a vicious circle because they want to have the fillers to plump out the creases in their face but then they get thread veins.' Much of the increase has been parallel to the general rise in people having fillers. According to Whatclinic.com, demand for dermal fillers in 2013 increased by 93 per cent in the UK. As a direct consequence, Dr Newmans Clinic has seen a rise of 15 per cent amongst patients, usually women aged 35 or older, seeking treatment for thread veins after having dermal fillers. Procedures such as facelifts can result in thread veins - and as they tend to appear around the temples and in front of the ears - they are a clear giveaway that the person has had the procedure. In this instance, the thread veins are caused by a reaction or irritation of the skin. Dr Finigan added: 'Thread veins are a recognised side effect of facelifts, and they can reoccur due to the traction of the skin over time.' While the majority of patients Dr Finigan treats are women, he is now seeing some children in the clinics who want to get rid of a specific type of thread vein called a 'spider naevi'. Thread veins are unsightly red or purple wiggly lines that develop as we age and our skin and blood vessels become less elastic . Hot yoga is the new fashionable exercise - but sweltering in a room heated up to 43°C could cause thread veins, as heat causes blood vessels to dilate which allows blood to flow near the surface of the skin . This is a red dot with tiny thread veins coming out of it, usually found on the the face, hands and shoulders. 'We see a handful of children at each clinic throughout the year, who have spider naevi treated' he said. 'However, the majority of patients are adults. Some patients have an underlying cause such as hormonal changes due to pregnancy, or liver disease – but some people just get them.' 'We tend to treat more women than men, but this is probably due to women exposing these areas more than men.' Dr Finigan treats thread veins and spider naevi using 'thermocoagulation'. This uses microwave technology to heat fine blood vessels and destroy them quickly, without scarring. They can also be treated using laser treatment or sclerotherapy. This treatment uses a tiny needle (smaller than a sewing needle) to inject a solution (scelerosant) that causes microscopic damage to the cells lining the vein. The vein gradually shrinks and disappears over a period of about eight weeks.","Gwyneth Paltrow, Coleen Rooney and Andy Murray swear by hot yoga .

"Michael Schumacher is making progress but still faces a 'difficult and long process' to recover from the brain injuries he suffered in a freak ski accident, his manager has admitted. Sabine Kehm also said there is still no clear timeframe for his recovery due to the severity of the damage done in a crash in the French Alps almost a year ago. She said that it was 'not possible' to say how long it would take for Schumacher to recover fully. Michael Schumacher's manager, Sabine Kehm (right) has said there is still no clear timeframe for his recovery . Schumacher suffered severe head injuries while skiing with his family on December 29, 2013. The accident left him with brain damage and he was in a coma for six months. He has been recovering at his home in Gland, Switzerland, since June. The Local reports Ms Kehm as saying: 'Michael is making progress appropriate to the severity of his situation, but it will be a difficult and long process.' Ms Kehm said Schumacher's family are grateful for the constant flood of well wishes from fans of the seven-time world champion. She said: 'I can only say again that the family is very happy and touched by the sympathetic messages. 'I believe that positive energy does them good. We appreciate the condolences from around the world.' Last month, a French doctor treating Schumacher said that the 45-year-old was making progress, but will need years to fully recover. Schumacher is said to be paralysed and in a wheelchair. He cannot speak and has memory problems, according to former racing driver Philippe Streiff, who has visited him. Schumacher with his wife Corinna Schumacher in Madonna di Campiglio in January 2005 . The Frenchman said: 'He is getting better but everything is relative.' Streiff, 59, was seen visiting Schumacher when the German was in intensive care in Grenoble Hospital, France. Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, where he owns a chalet when the accident happened. He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. But shortly after 11am he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates. Schumacher (left) is a seven-time world champion and is widely regarded as the greatest F1 driver of all time . It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock. He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. The footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged. The film, which included audio, captured the crash in full horror and was analysed by police who investigated the accident. Two months later, on February 17, the head of the inquiry Prosecutor Patrick Quincy closed the case. He announced that any criminal wrongdoing had been ruled out. He cleared the ski resort, stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that Schumacher 'deliberately' left the ski run. Schumacher (second right) celebrates on the podium after his 2012 Formula One Grand Prix win in Valencia . Corinna Schumacher (left), with brain specialist Gerard Saillant, now cares for her husband in their home . Schumacher suffered brain damage after a freak ski accident in Meribel in the French Alps on December 29 . Schumacher was airlifted from the slopes minutes after the accident to Moutiers Hospital and was then transferred 80 miles west to CHU Grenoble, a larger hospital that specializes in head injuries. He arrived at 12.40pm and had been placed in an artificial coma. He was immediately operated on to relieve pressure on his brain. At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma. On April 4 Kehm revealed that he was showing 'moments of consciousness and awakening'. He had opened his eyes and had interaction, albeit minimal, with his environment. It was the first piece of positive news for months. Former racing driver Philippe Streiff commented on Schumacher's condition to a French radio station . Ms Kehm has said it was 'very hard' for his loved ones to comprehend how the racing car driver could have been so catastrophically injured in such a 'banal situation'. Schumacher's wife Corinna was a constant presence at his bedside. She and Schumacher met in 1991 on the F1 circuit after she was previously married to racing driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen. With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years. This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.","Michael Schumacher suffered brain injury during freak ski crash last year .

"Male nurse Victorino Chua, 47, has been dramatically rearrested on suspicion of murder by detectives investigating the Stepping Hill hospital poisonings . A male nurse was yesterday charged with three murders after detectives uncovered new evidence about a series of hospital poisonings. Married father of two Victorino Chua, 48, was also accused of 31 other offences – including GBH and attempted poisoning – in connection with deaths at Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester police said. The decision to charge Chua, who emigrated to the UK from the Philippines more than a decade ago, follows a major review of the case spanning two and a half years. Sources described yesterday’s arrest as ‘a significant development’ in the long-running inquiry. It is understood police have been liaising closely with the Crown Prosecution Service about the evidence against Chua for months. In the summer of 2011, a woman nurse at Stepping Hill called Rebecca Leighton was arrested and charged in connection with the poisonings. She was sensationally exonerated after spending six weeks in custody for crimes she did not commit. Since then, a new squad of detectives from Greater Manchester Police – which was greatly embarrassed over the bungled pursuit of Miss Leighton – has carried out painstaking analysis of medical samples, post mortem reports and work records. It culminated in pint-sized Chua, first arrested on suspicion of murder and related offences in January 2012, being re-arrested in a dawn swoop at his home near Stockport, at 6.30am yesterday – three days before he was due to answer police bail. Whitehall sources said the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and his advisers have been briefed on issues relating to the Stepping Hill poisonings. Critics say there should be a public inquiry into the case. ‘A man has been arrested in connection with the investigation into the deliberate contamination of products and tampering of medical records at Stepping Hill Hospital,’ said Greater Manchester Police shortly before Chua was charged. Arrest: Chua was arrested by police in body armour at his home Heaton Chapel, Stockport, at 6.30am . The father of two was first arrested in January 2012 in connection with the poisoning of 22 hospital patients . ‘Today, a 48-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of three counts of murder, 18 counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and offences of poisoning under Section 24 of the Offences Against the Person Act. He remains in police custody.’ The alleged poisoning offences relate to the alleged tampering of medical records and the contamination of intravenous medicines at the hospital. Eight patients who were poisoned by contaminated products later died. They were Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, Derek Weaver, 83, William Dickson, 82, Linda McDonagh, 60, John Beeley, 73, Beryl Hope, 70, and Mary Cartwright, 89. The deaths of Miss Arden, Mr Lancaster and Mr Weaver are being treated as murders. A total of 22 people were believed to have been poisoned when products were contaminated at the hospital in the summer of 2011. Staff at Stepping Hill raised the alarm after noticing ‘unexplained’ low blood sugar levels in patients. Police later found a number of saline drips had been contaminated. Van: Chua was driven off for questioning in connection with the poison probe yesterday . Taken for questioning: Chua is now in police custody again, more than two years after he was first arrested . Stepping Hill: Eight patients at the hospital died after insulin was injected into their saline drips at the hospital . Detectives have reviewed and analysed the hundreds of interactions those patients had with staff or visitors during their time at Stepping Hill. The alleged tampering affected patients on wards A1, A2 and A3 – acute care wards of seriously  ill patients. Miss Leighton, 30, from Heaviley, Stockport, spent six weeks in jail after being charged with causing criminal damage intending to endanger life, criminal damage being reckless as to whether life would be endangered, and theft of medicine. She was released and the charges against her dropped in September 2011 when prosecutors said there was not enough evidence against her, but she was subsequently sacked for theft by  hospital bosses. Until he was re-arrested yesterday, devout Roman Catholic Chua was due to answer police bail  on Monday. Chua, a registered nurse since 2003, had been barred from approaching any witnesses or attending any medical sites. Chua is now being questioned by murder squad detectives over the deaths at Stepping Hill hospital . Chua has been on bail since January 2012, and was having to report regularly to police in Stockport .

"To say David Moyes has taken his time deciding to become the new manager of Real Sociedad would be something of an understatement. But the idea that he has been like a kid standing at the side of a swimming pool, keen to take the plunge but terrified of the potential consequences, would also be rather unfair. Because this is a bit more serious than the mere shock of freezing water. This is a decision that could tarnish an already damaged reputation, and Moyes needed to be as sure as he possibly could be that taking charge of a Spanish club languishing towards the bottom of La Liga with only limited financial resources was the right move. He has been desperate to return to football from the moment he was sacked by Manchester United back in April. Desperate, after a torrid 10 months at Old Trafford, to remind us why Sir Alex Ferguson saw him as his ideal replacement in the first place. La Liga strugglers Real Sociedad have announced David Moyes as their new manager . The Scot follows in the footsteps of John Toshack (above) and Chris Coleman in taking charge of Sociedad . Moyes (pictured after his last game in charge of Everton) built a formidable reputation at Goodison Park . Sociedad posted this welcome banner to Moyes on their Twitter page on Monday evening . Saturday November 22 - Deportivo La Coruna (A) (17th in La Liga) Sunday November 30 - Elche (H) (18th in La Liga) Thursday December 4 - Real Oviedo (A) (3rd in Segunda B) Sunday December 7 - Villarreal (A) (8th in La Liga) Sunday December 14 - Athletic Bilbao (H) (11th in La Liga) The success Moyes enjoyed at Everton, and even Preston before that, has too quickly been forgotten and a man who will always favour a training ground ahead of a golf course, a man who is so defined by his work, needs to demonstrate that he remains skilled in the business of building fine football teams. But the next job always needed to be the right job and it has taken him eight or nine days to say yes to the Spanish club with good reason. Especially when other opportunities could have soon been presenting themselves. There was talk of Inter Milan. Possibly even openings in the Barclays Premier League. But there was also the distinct possibility, because of the difficulties he endured at United, that he might not get offered such a position anytime soon, and Moyes is enough of a realist to know that. Who’s to say a better offer would have come along? Newcastle might have appeared to be a possibility a month ago but look at Alan Pardew now. Ditto Sam Allardyce at West Ham. Would Aston Villa be a better option if Paul Lambert suddenly vacated his office? Not when Randy Lerner is intent on selling the club. Is QPR, were Harry Redknapp to lose his job, bigger than a Spanish club that was playing Champions League football only last season and even finished seventh in the last La Liga campaign? Throw in the fact that working abroad has long appealed to Moyes and the chance to manage in La Liga, at a time when Spanish football boasts many of the world’s finest players, was hard to ignore. The week or so Moyes has spent deliberating over the offer was not without its complications, of course. Moyes will stand in the dugout at the impressive Anoeta Stadium in the picturesque San Sebastian . Real Sociedad were looking for a new manager after Jagoba Arrasate was relieved of his duties . Carlos Vela (centre) scored in Sociedad's shock 2-1 win over champions Atletico Madrid on Sunday . Wales boss Coleman (pictured in 2007) was the last British manager to have been in charge of Real Sociedad . Manchester United (2013-14) P 51 W 27 D 9 L 15 WP 53% . Everton (2002-13) P 516 W 217 D 139 L 160 WP 42% . Preston North End (1998-2002) P 234 W 113 D58 L 63 WP 48% . He was in Qatar, where he was doing some television work, when it became clear the Sociedad job was his to turn down. The club have now announced that Moyes will take training on Wednesday morning, although they did this before he had even seen a copy of his new contract. But certain negotiations clearly had to take place before he even arrived in San Sebastian last Friday for a tour of the stadium and the club’s training facilities. His own salary for a start. Moyes remained in Spain until Saturday, impressed but still apparently concerned by certain issues beyond a league position that did improve with a victory on Saturday night. They rose to 15th. Perhaps more of a worry was a wage structure that might make it difficult to recruit players and a lack of cash to strengthen the team in the areas Moyes feels demand surgery. The wage structure could prove a particular problem if Moyes had his eye on players he might have worked with back in England. But that would not be a challenge alien to Moyes when he proved so adept at hunting for bargains during his time at Everton. Seamus Coleman, as Moyes said in a recent column in the Mail on Sunday, was £60,000, while players like Joleon Lescott, Phil Jagielka and Tim Cahill were recruited from the lower leagues at a relatively low cost. Moyes had to pick the right job after his reputation became tarnished as manager of Manchester United . Moyes is disappointed that his former United coach Phil Neville (left) wasn't keen on a move to Spain . Moyes won't have much money to spend but is an expert at finding gems like Seamus Coleman (above) Moyes enjoyed contrasting fortunes with Everton chairman Bill Kenwright (left) and United's Ed Woodward . Sociedad president Jokin Aperribay (pictured in August 2013) is a man to have impressed Moyes thus far . VIDEO Moyes returns to management . Crucial to any manager is a good No 2, and Moyes will be disappointed that Phil Neville has declined the opportunity to join him in Spain. Neville was a fine captain for Moyes at Goodison Park and a valued assistant at Old Trafford, but the former England full-back may have concluded it was not the right time to uproot his family when he has a wife with her own business interests and a son at Manchester City’s academy. It leaves Moyes searching for a new deputy but that was never going to be enough to stop him taking a job. Especially when he was so impressed with club president Jokin Aperribay. After the problems he endured with United’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, it was important for Moyes to find an employer he felt comfortable with and Aperribay seems to be such a man. As Moyes said in an interview with the Daily Mail back in August, he had a terrific relationship with Bill Kenwright at Everton and he rather hopes this will be the same. Even if he was a little surprised to see Sociedad announce his appointment late on Monday night when certain issues still needed to be resolved. That said, Moyes was full of enthusiasm and optimism in the briefest of conversations. He very much sees this as a chance to rise back to the top. To take a club struggling towards the bottom of the table and turn them into a team that can punch well above its weight. He’s done it before, after all. But to do it in another country would certainly enhance a reputation that requires attention, and he knows that only too well.","Manchester United sacked David Moyes after 10 months in April .

"Roy Keane's second autobiography was always going to be a read that opened up old wounds, unsettling former team-mates and managers alike. It didn't disappoint.

Scholesy was a top top player but I still don’t fall for the boy next door image. Or that he’s dead humble. He has more of an edge to him. Everyone thinks he lives in a council flat. Fighting Peter Schmeichel . I had a bust-up with Peter when we were on a preseason tour of Asia, in 1998, just after I came back from my cruciate injury. I think we were in Hong Kong. There was drink involved. There'd been a little bit of tension between us over the years, for football reasons. There was a lot of noise - Peter's a big lad. I woke up the next morning. I kind of vaguely remembered the fight. My hand was really sore and one of my fingers was bent backwards. Peter had grabbed me, I'd headbutted him. We'd been fighting for ages.

I knew there’d be clubs in for me when the news got out. I said, “Yeah - I think we have come to the end”. I just thought, “F****** p****” and I stood up and went “Yeah. I’m off”. That MUTV interview . It was getting a bit silly so I got the players together in the dressing room and told them it was f*****g nonsense. 'They were all going: ‘Yeah, Yeah’. Not one of them had an issue. Not one. Sir Alex Ferguson vs Brian Clough . I put Brian Clough ahead of Alex Ferguson. I think with Sir Alex Ferguson it was pure business - everything is business. If he was being nice I would think: “This is business, this”. He was driven and ruthless. That lack of warmth was his strength. Carlos Quieroz questioning his loyalty . Don’t you f****** talk to me about loyalty, Carlos. You left this club after 12 months a few years ago for the Real Madrid job. Manchester United's downturn . I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best.

"A lawyer for the family of the black 18-year-old shot dead by white officer Darren Wilson has slammed the grand jury process as 'unfair' just hours before the anticipated verdict. Seven men and five women have spent three months deliberating over evidence to decide whether to charge Wilson with the August 9 shooting that sparked violent protests across Ferugson, Missouri, and nationwide. The conflicted suburb of St Louis, Missouri, is now bracing itself for outcry, with the deployment of the National Guard, grenade-armed police officers, and almost 100 FBI agents. 'Unfair': Benjamin Crump, attorney for Michael Brown's family, said the case should have gone straight to trial . And despite calls for calm from Michael Brown's mother and President Barack Obama, attorney Benjamin Crump has revealed the family does not trust the procedure, which could see Officer Wilson avoid trial. 'The process is completely unfair,' Crump told ABC News. He added: 'I have no doubt if they were to indict the police officer, he would be guaranteed his full constitutional rights of innocent until proven guilty. 'He would get every benefit of the doubt. 'I don't worry about the due process for officer Wilson. I worry about the due process for the little black boy dead on the ground.' His words come as authorities in Ferguson erect barricades around Buzz Westfall Justice Center, where the jury is expected to announce its verdict on Monday morning. St Louis County prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch called for a jury - made up of nine white and three black people to reflect the racial make up of the county - to decide whether Officer Wilson should be charged. Anger: Crumps words came hours before the jury is expected to decide whether Wilson should be indicted . Outrage: The August 9 shooting of Michael Brown, 18, has sparked outrage across Ferguson and the nation . Tributes: Mourners paid tribute in the streets on Sunday during the tense wait for the jury to conclude . Following evidence from Officer Wilson, forensic pathologists and witnesses, the panel will have to decide whether Wilson intentionally violated Brown's civil rights by fatally shooting him. Crump said: 'I just think this is process is unlike anything I've ever seen in my 20 years of practice. We don't think it's fair. 'If this prosecutor says ... we're not going to recommend any charges, that's different from anything he's done in his past 28 years with grand juries.' He added: 'Why can't it be equal justice? Why can't we have the same process?' Last month, legal experts told MailOnline the charge is more complex and difficult to prove than a murder or manslaughter charge. Peter Joy, a professor at the Washington University of Law in St Louis, told MailOnline the charge of civil rights abuse is a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter, as the 12 jury members will have to be certain Wilson intended to violate Brown's civil rights by shooting him dead. Protests: Grenade-armed police have been deployed for fear of violent reactions to the jury's verdict . Conflict: Hundreds of people have been arrested since the unrest began almost four months ago . Racial divides: Demonstrators have accused the county police force of racism in the majority black district . 'The civil rights abuses are even harder to prove than an underlying criminal conviction. The federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse. 'There are some criminal charges that don't involve that kind of mental state, like murder. 'For example anger. They can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly, but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right.' As a result, he said, they will need forensic evidence of damage to the car to disprove Wilson's account if they are to find him guilty. Duke University law professor James Coleman Jr told MailOnline an innocent verdict would 'totally undermine the St Louis criminal justice system'. 'If a grand jury accepts that every shot he fired at that kid was in self-defense that simply is not plausible,' he said. Michael Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden has urged protesters to refrain from violence, and President Obama has called for calm. Obama added that he has not ruled out a trip to Ferguson following the announcement of the jury's verdict.","Benjamin Crump questions why the prosecutor didn't take case to trial .

"A plane which crashed during an attempted landing in a tropical storm, killing 49 people, is believed to have been due to pilot error. The official report on the October 2013 crash of Lao Airlines flight QV301, which had six Australians on board, was released on Friday and presented to the friends and family of the victims. The crash has raised further questions about the safety of airlines operating out of Southeast Asia, with a 20% increase reported in people flying in the region. Gavin's father, Geoff Rhodes, 71 (right), said after some hesitation about travelling to Laos, he and Gavin's sister, Melissa Rhodes-Smith (left), flew to the hear the report delivered . Along with the Australian nationals, seven French, five Thai, three South Koreans, two Vietnamese, as well as individuals from China, Myanmar, Taiwan and the US died in the crash. The Lao Airlines flight tried to land at Pakse International Airport in Laos in the middle of a heavy storm, but pilot Yong Sam was forced to ascend again after failing the attempt. The 56-year-old Cambodian had more than 30 years flying experience, with the report noting that he was a skilled pilot used to flying the aircraft. Despite a recommended height of 990 feet, Yong Sam reached an altitude of only 600 feet before attempting to execute another landing, hitting an island in the Mekong River and killing all those on baord. The official report on the October 2013 crash of Lao Airlines flight QV301, which had six Australians on board, was released on Friday and presented to the friends and family of the victims . The victims bodies were recovered from the water over several weeks, with some victims found almost 20 kilometers downstream from the crash site . Locals gather at the scene of the Lao Airlines crash in the Mekong River . 'It was raining but the pilot continued the approach and lastly decided to go around at an altitude below (recommended levels) in a steep right turn,' the report said. 'It impacted the trees on an island in the Mekong, the fuselage struck the bank and plunged into the river.' The victims bodies were recovered from the water over several weeks, with some victims found almost 20 kilometers  downstream from the crash site. The document states that the probable cause of the crash included sudden changes in weather conditions and the airline crew's failure to 'properly execute the published instrument approach'. While Pakse airport is not equipped with radar control, the report notes that there were 'no anomalies' concerning ground equipment. Lao Airlines is not a member of the International Air Transport Association, which requires safety checks. Relatives from the 10 countries of those who perished, along with diplomats and representatives of the French-made ATR 72-212A aircraft, were at the briefing on Friday. Sydney man Gavin Rhodes, his wife Phoumalaysy (Lea), their daughter and baby boy died in the crash. Gavin's father, Geoff Rhodes, 71, said after some hesitation about travelling to Laos, he and Gavin's sister, Melissa Rhodes-Smith, flew to the hear the report delivered and 'to have my son represented'. Other Australian victims included 42-year-old Michael Creighton (above) and his father, Gordon, 71 . Mr Creighton was an aid worker in Laos, and his father (not pictured) was visiting him . Sydney man Gavin Rhodes, his wife Phoumalaysy (Lea), their daughter and baby boy died in the crash . 'I'd like to come and bring the photograph to show what I have lost,' Mr Rhodes said. In 2014 so far there have been five major plane crashes in Southeast Asia, including the doomed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 en route to Kuala Lumpur, and the disappearance of MH370 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. The Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation recorded a 20% increase in seat volume between 2012 and 2013, totalling 5.6 million passengers on flights in the region. The figures are expected to increase, with 70% of the world's busiest routes travelling through Southeast Asia, and 30% of the world's aircraft passengers expected to travel to the region in 2014, reported Orient Aviation Journal. Willem Niemeijer, co-founder of Khiri Travel Group, told Quartz that 'Increasing air traffic means crashes will increase as well.' The company operates throughout Southeast Asia, a region which 'needs to look at improving air infrastructure and pursue an open skies policy,' Mr Niemeijer said. While more than 30% of plane crashes around the world occur as a result of weather conditions, ground-based wind-shear detection systems introduced to notify plane crews to issues, are absent in airports around Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. Mr Rhodes said that the conclusion of the pilot's responsibility made little difference to the reality of losing his son. 'Does it make any difference to how I feel? No,' he said. Gavin Rhodes sister, Ms Rhodes-Smith said that attending the reading of the report was important to her and her family. 'Just being here as well, being in Vientiane where they spent their last few days and being with Lea's family, it's probably the stuff that makes us feel better,' she said. The Rhodes have set up a fund to support a preschool in northern Laos in memory of Mr Rhodes and his family. 'Just having that purpose - it's one of the things that helped us the most - is being able to do something in memory of them,' Ms Rhodes said. Other Australian victims included 42-year-old Michael Creighton, who was an aid worker in Laos, and his father, Gordon, 71, who was visiting his son. Both black box data recorders had been analysed by air safety experts in France.","Lao Airlines flight crashed into the Mekong River in October last year .

"More money does make you happier, with people from rich countries like Britain saying they are happier than citizens of poorer nations. Nearly 60 per cent of people living in the UK rate their happiness as at least a seven out of 10, higher than most other rich countries. However, some wealthy nations, including France and Japan, are still miserable, with barely half of their citizens happy with their lives. Scroll down for video and a table of results . Satisfaction in the UK and other wealthy nations is relatively high, but the likes of France and Japan are still miserable, despite the countries' wealth . Morale has dropped slightly in the UK, the report by the Pew Research Center, in Washington, found. The number of people saying they were satisfied with their life dropped from one per cent, from 59 per cent to 58 per cent, in the last seven years. Germany saw a rise of 13 per cent in the same time, possibly because Germans were less affected by the economic downturn than other Western nations. Meanwhile only 43 per cent of people surveyed in Japan said they were satisfied with their lives, while slightly more than half of the French said they were happy. The only developed nations to have higher satisfaction levels than the UK were the U.S. and Israel, while the lowest ratings were found in Egypt, Kenya and Tanzania. Emerging markets in Asia saw the biggest rise in citizens' satisfaction over the seven-year period, the global survey suggested. Levels of self-reported well-being in fast-growing nations like Indonesia, China and Malaysia now rival those in the U.S. and Europe, who traditionally topped the happiness charts. And women in particular are growing more satisfied with their lifestyles as a result, the research found. This table shows the per cent saying that they were 7,8,9 or 10 in the 'ladder of life'. Over half of the UK is slightly less happier than it was in 2002, while 13 per cent of Germans are happier than they were 12 years ago . Indonesia, China, Pakistan, Malaysia, Russia, Turkey, Chile and Peru are all happier now than 12 years ago . Eighteen per cent of Ugandans are happier now than 12 years ago, and eight per cent are happier in Tanzania . The study confirmed that rises in national income are closely linked to personal satisfaction. The pollsters asked people in 43 countries to place themselves on a 'ladder of life,' with a scale from 0 to 10 and the top rung representing the best possible life and the bottom the worst. Pew carried out the same survey in 2002 and 2005 in most of those countries, enabling researchers to look at trends over time. But the data also suggested that there is a limit to how much happiness money can buy. For example, 56 per cent of Malaysians rated their life a 'seven' or higher on the ladder, significantly more than the 36 per cent in Bangladesh, a poor country. Yet the public in Germany, which has far higher gross domestic product per capita than Malaysia, expressed a life satisfaction level of 60 per cent, just four per cent more than Malaysia. While wealth appears to contribute to happiness, other research has indicated it is far from the only factor. Women tend to be happier than men, for example, and unmarried and middle-aged people tend to report lower levels of well-being than married and younger people, respectively . The study, by the Pew Research Center in Washington, confirmed that rises in national income in emerging markets such as China are closely linked to personal satisfaction . Money can buy you happiness, the study found, with people living in wealthy countries likely to be more satisfied with their lives . Emerging Asian nations are finding out what developed ones did years ago: Money does buy happiness - or at least satisfaction. Pictured are a couple in Beijing, China . The Pew survey were based on 47,643 interviews in 43 countries with adults 18 and older between March and June. The pollsters asked people in 43 countries to place themselves on a 'ladder of life,' with the top rung (10) representing the best possible life and the bottom the worst. Fifty six per cent of Malaysians rated their life a 'seven' or higher on the ladder, significantly more than the 36 per cent in Bangladesh, a poor country. The survey saw significant gains in personal satisfaction in Indonesia, where 58 per cent of those polled placed themselves on the seventh-highest rung of the 'ladder of life' or above, up from 23 per cent in 2007. Women tend to be happier than men, for example, and unmarried and middle-aged people tend to report lower levels of well-being than married and younger people, respectively. In Vietnam, which wasn't included in the 2007 survey, 64 per cent said they were on the seventh-highest rung or above. This means levels of self-reported well-being in fast-growing nations like Indonesia, China and Malaysia now rival those in the U.S., Germany and the United Kingdom, who traditionally topped the happiness charts. It found that people in emerging and developing economies prioritise a few essentials in life, including their health, their children's education and safety from crime. Fewer people in those economies said internet access, car ownership, free time or the ability to travel is very important in their lives. The survey saw significant gains in personal satisfaction in Indonesia, where 58 per cent of those polled placed themselves on the seventh-highest rung of the 'ladder of life' or above, up from 23 per cent in 2007. In Malaysia, where 56 per cent put themselves in that same upper range, up from 36 per cent seven years ago. In Vietnam, which wasn't included in the 2007 survey, 64 per cent said they were on the seventh-highest rung or above. The Associated Press asked people in those three nations what they thought of the findings. 'Money can't secure happiness,' said Nguyen Thi Mai, 66-year-old retired teacher from Vietnam. 'There are people who don't have any money but they lead a happy life because family members love and respect each other. 'But there are rich families where husbands and wives often quarrel and children are addicted to drugs.' 'Money can buy lots of happiness for me because I am very materialistic,' said businessman Tony Wong in Malaysia. 'But that's not the only thing that makes me happy. Money is number one on my top five list, followed by health, family, dogs and friends.'","Money can buy you happiness, a report on life satisfaction has shown .

"A new study claims to define what exactly is classed as sexually deviant . Do you ever worry if what floats your boat sexually might be a little unusual? Or even downright bizarre? If so, a new study claims to set everything straight - and define the demure from the deviant. Its conclusion? Men hoping for sex with two women is 'normal' - for women, the general theme is more 50 Shades of Grey. These were just two of the findings of a research project that claims to scientifically define sexual deviation for the first time ever. Conducted in Montreal, Canada, the research was published today in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. The idea behind the research was that while 'deviant sexual fantasises' often conjure up images of being very unusual, . In a press statement, the authors said: 'Many theories about deviant sexual fantasies incorporate the concept of atypical fantasies, or paraphilias.' Paraphilia is defined as the the experience of intense sexual arousal to atypical objects, situations, or individuals. However the authors argue that 'scientific literature does not describe what these types of fantasies actually are'. In the U.S., the psychiatric bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), mentions, 'anomalous' fantasies. Even the World Health Organisation talks about 'unusual' fantasies in defining paraphilias. But, the Canadian study authors questioned, what is an unusual sexual fantasy exactly? Christian Joyal, lead author of the study, said: 'Clinically, we know what pathological sexual fantasies are. 'They involve non-consenting partners, they induce pain, or they are absolutely necessary in deriving satisfaction. * The nature of sexual fantasies varies among the general population - meaning few can be considered statistically rare, unusual, or typical. * Men have more fantasies and describe them more vividly than women . * Between 30 and 60 per cent of women - think of themes associated with submission (e.g. being tied up). * Unlike men, 'women in general clearly distinguish between fantasy and desire' * The majority of men would love their fantasies to come true . * Women tend to fantasise about their partner, while men generally fantasise more about extramarital relationships . *Men are more likely to think about watching their partner being with someone else or being with someone of the same sex themselves . 'But apart from that, what exactly are abnormal or atypical fantasies?' 'Our main objective was to specify norms in sexual fantasies, an essential step in defining pathologies,' he explained. 'And as we suspected, there are a lot more common fantasies than atypical fantasies.' To find out, they asked members of the general population - 'as simple as that,' said Professor Joyal. Because most studies of this nature are conducted with university students, the researchers wanted to find adults willing to describe their sexual fantasies. For the study, just over 1,500 adults in Quebec (a 50/50 split of men and women) completed a questionnaire describing their sexual fantasies. They were also asked to describe their favourite fantasy in detail. 'The results were more than interesting,' said Professor Joyal. ' What surprised the researchers was that the nature of sexual fantasies varies among the general population - meaning few can be considered statistically rare, unusual, or typical. 'But not surprisingly, the study confirms that men have more fantasies and describe them more vividly than women,' he added. The study also found that a significant proportion of women - between 30 and 60 per cent - think of themes associated with submission (e.g. being tied up). Researchers men hoping for sex with two women is 'normal' - and they were more likely to think about to think about extramarital affairs than their female partner . 'Importantly, unlike men, women in general clearly distinguish between fantasy and desire,' Professor Joyal said. 'Therefore, many women who express more extreme fantasies of submission (e.g. domination by a stranger) specify that they never want these fantasies to come true. 'The majority of men, however, would love their fantasies to come true', e.g. sex with more than one other person. And while women tend to fantasise about their partner, men generally fantasise more about extramarital relationships compared to women. Swingers on the hunt for excitement are spreading sexually transmitted infections by taking part in drug-fuelled orgies, research claimed earlier this month. A Dutch study found almost half of older swingers admitted taking illegal substances to boost their prowess in the bedroom and keep multiple partners satisfied. As well as erectile dysfunction drugs such as Viagra, they are also using cocaine, ecstasy (MDMA), GHB, laughing gas, cannabis, poppers, speed, LSD and lysergic acid to help them perform - at levels similar to gay men. However, their unsafe sexual practices are putting them at increasing risk of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B, experts warn. The researchers, writing in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, say swingers should be targeted with the same health advice as other at-risk groups. The study also noted: 'One of the most intriguing findings has to do with the significant number of unique male fantasies.' By this, it was referring to watching their partner being with someone else, for example, or being with someone of the same sex. 'Evolutionary biological theories cannot explain these fantasies, which, among males, are typically desires,' said Professor Joyal. 'Overall, these findings allow us to shed light on certain social phenomena, such as the popularity of the book 'Fifty Shades of Grey' with women.' He and his colleagues are now looking at whether people who like one thing - say, have submission fantasies - also like play the opposite role. 'These two themes are therefore not exclusive, quite the contrary - they also seem associated with a higher level of satisfaction,' he explained. The study was undertaken by researchers at Institut universitaire en santé mentale de Montréal and Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montréal, affiliated with University of Montreal.","Study claims to scientifically define sexual deviation for the first time ever .

"Neymar claims he is reproducing his Brazil form for Barcelona now that he is feeling more relaxed at the Nou Camp. The Brazilian had a difficult debut season in Spain due to injuries and turmoil over his transfer fee, which was initially said to be worth around £45.2million  but later turned out to be closer to £80million. The Catalans failed to win any silverware last season but  they are top of La Liga after eight games and are yet to concede a goal under new coach Luis Enrique this term. However, defeat in their last Champions League outing against Paris St Germain has given Tuesday's clash with Ajax Amsterdam added importance.

"Rarely has cricket faced a tragedy quite like this. Rarely can such a freak accident have devastated a whole sport and its followers worldwide. No-one should die playing a game of cricket. The passing of Phillip Hughes is utterly devastating. The dangers of facing a hard ball propelled at anything up to 90 miles per hour are obvious, of course they are. We have all seen batsmen hit, most recently at Old Trafford last summer when Stuart Broad took that nasty blow on the face from Varun Aaron that broke his nose. Yet nobody can ever expect this. Not the sight of a talented, highly popular international batsman receiving a blow from which he never recovered in the middle of an innings that was set to propel him back to the Australian Test team. WARNING Some pictures and video in this story may be distressing . A tribute to Phillip Hughes which circulated on Twitter following his death at the age of 25 . Hughes has died aged 25 at St Vincent's Hospital on Thursday on cricket's darkest day . Hughes signs autographs for young fans during a Test match in Hobart three years ago . Hughes hits the ball to the boundary on his way to a hundred against South Africa in Durban back in 2009 . Hughes enjoys victory over South Africa with his father Greg following his 2009 Test debut at The Wanderers . Hughes collapsed and hit the ground face first after being struck in the head by the bouncer . Australia cricket captain Michael Clarke pauses before delivering a statement on Thursday morning . Clarke was visibly upset during the press conference on Thursday morning following the tragic news . Tests . Matches: 26 Runs: 1,535 . Highest score: 160 Average: 32.65 . Centuries: 3 Half-centuries: 7 . One-day internationals . Matches: 25 Runs: 826 Highest score: 138* . Average: 35.91 Hundreds: 2 Fifties: 4. Twenty20 . Matches: 1 Runs: 6 Average: 6. First-class . Matches: 114 Runs: 9,023 . Highest score: 243* Average: 46.51 . Hundreds: 26 Fifties: 46 . It is nobody’s fault. Certainly not poor young bowler Sean Abbott who, at 22, had made his Australian Twenty20 debut alongside Hughes in Dubai against Pakistan just a few short weeks ago. The bouncer he delivered to Hughes was a routine delivery, a ball that 99 times out of 100 would either have been despatched to the boundary or avoided with ease by a player of the Australian’s ability. The tragedy is that on the 100th occasion Hughes was through with his shot too quickly and the ball hit him on an unprotected area at the back of his head. Nor can any blame be attached to the manufacturer of the helmet Hughes was wearing when he played his final innings in the fabled surroundings of the Sydney Cricket Ground, where so many legends of the game have performed. Helmets will be improved, more protection will be given to the back of the head, but there is only so much safety equipment can do to lessen the risk of something as inconceivable as this happening. Hughes' tragic death was announced on Thursday morning following his accident at the SCG . Hughes was a keen cricketer, even as a youngster in Macksville (left) and as a professional sportsman . The left hander celebrates reaching his century in a one-day international against Sri Lanka last year . Hughes (second right) celebrates with Steve Smith after the leg-spinner took the wicket of England's Matt Prior during the second Ashes Test at Lord's in 2013 . Hughes and Ashton Agar are applauded off the pitch at Trent Bridge by England during the Ashes last year . And cricket should not blame itself. There will be considerable soul searching, questions as to what changes can be made to make the game safer. Is the ball too hard? Is there enough medical assistance provided at any cricket ground? Improvements can and will undoubtedly be made but the fact is, as Nasser Hussain said here after the incident, it is 99.9 per cent certain nothing like this will ever happen again to any cricketer. This was a freak, an extremely rare occurrence according to the doctors of the St Vincent's Hospital where Hughes spent his last hours after being hit in a Sheffield Shield match on Tuesday plying his trade for his adopted state South Australia against his old one in New South Wales. It will take a long time for world cricket to recover from this. The game will go on, of course it will, but for the moment it is hard to see how Australia can play India in the first Test in Brisbane next week. Not when Hughes was expected to replace the injured Michael Clarke and make his Test comeback. The Indians have cancelled  their two-day tour match against a Cricket Australia XI. Hughes carves James Anderson through the covers during the first Test of last summer's Ashes series . Hughes guides the ball through the off-side (left) and salutes a hundred against South Africa in 2009 . There will be an enormous shadow over next year’s World Cup in Australia too and an Ashes series next summer that Hughes would have been expected to play in. He had appeared in three of the greatest series of them all and seemed to have his best cricket ahead of him as he approached his 26th birthday. Phillip Hughes was unquestionably a talent. A country boy from the part of Australia where New South Wales meets Queensland, his unorthodox technique was honed in the backyard of the family home where any legside shots would have flown into the kitchen and incurred the wrath of his mother. So everything went through the offside and he initially took that somewhat rustic game into the Test arena. But it worked. What an impact he made too when he famously made 115 and 160 in only his second Test against South Africa in Johannesburg. A star was born and Australian cricket could look forward to enjoying a rare and exciting talent. Hughes (left), Marcus North (centre) and Ben Hilfenhaus celebrate beating the Proteas in 2009 . VIDEO Phil Hughes dies from head injuries . There were ups and downs after that, there had to be with the way he played. He arrived in England for the 2009 Ashes via a spell at Middlesex in a blaze of publicity but had his troubles against the short ball and had to work on his technique if he was to stay at the highest level of the game. He did so and was continuing to do so right up until the last. Hughes went on to play 26 Tests, earning a reputation as a fighter to overcome the games’s ups and downs, and would have played his 27th at the Gabba next week, probably after making a century in the innings that was devastatingly cut short when he moved on to an unbeaten 63 for South Australia at the SCG. Hughes was rushed to St Vincent's Hospital in the Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst for surgery . Brad Haddin, Steve Smith and Moises Henriques arrived at St Vincent's  to visit Hughes on Wednesday . Smith, David Warner and Henriques leave St Vincent's hospital after visiting  Hughes on Wednesday . But more importantly than that he was, as Shane Warne described him on Thursday, ‘one of the good guys.’ Cricket is known for its companionship irrespective of nationality and Hughes had many friends in England, not least from his spells in county cricket at Middlesex, Hampshire and Worcestershire. Traditional Ashes rivalry invariably begins and ends on the field. They will all be sharing the pain of the Hughes family. As will anybody who has ever stepped on to a cricket field. Hughes mother and sister went to watch him play a game of cricket on a lovely Sydney day at a lovely ground on Tuesday and saw their loved one taken from them in the cruellest way imaginable playing the game he loved far too prematurely.

According to local daily Okaz, the bride immediately collapsed in a fit of tears as panicked wedding guests stepped in to try to resolve the dispute. A Saudi husband has divorced his wife after she failed to reply to a WhatsApp text message. The man, who got married two years ago, sent the message from his office and waited for a response from his wife. But none came. Thinking something must be wrong, reported Emirates 24/7, he rushed home to find her watching television. When he asked her why she did not respond, she said she was busy chatting with friends on WhatsApp and wanted to reply later. He divorced her instantly, the report added. 'I sent her messages on Whatsapp and knew she had read them because of the latest update on the application but still she didn't answer me or acknowledged my messages,' he was quoted as saying by the Gulf News. The husband, in his 30s, said he was frustrated by his wife's seemingly endless interest in using her phone for chatting with friends and family. But their efforts were to no avail. 'The groom said he had not been able to see his bride's face before marriage,' Okaz reported. 'When he divorced her, the bride collapsed and the wedding turned into a night of tears.' News of the jilting was met with anger on social media. Afra wrote on one social media network: 'He caused her great pain through his irresponsible attitude, and he deserves to suffer. 'He should appreciate that beauty is in the character, not the face. 'Unfortunately, many young people today are interested only in looks and ignore values and morals. 'May God give her a better husband who will appreciate her for who and what she is.' Abu Nass added: 'He is not man enough to assume his responsibilities. He is totally, completely insensitive. 'Nobody has forced him to marry her. He should have insisted on seeing her before the wedding and the engagement, and not wait until the wedding night. 'May he always be a loser and may he be deprived of getting married at all. He is not a man and he lacks basic feelings.'","The wedding was taking place in the Western Saudi town of Medinah .

The Asian Cup game between Iraq and Jordan, which took place in Brisbane, Australia last Monday, saw Swindon Town midfielder Yaser Kasim give Iraq a 1-0 win. The boys' 'crime' - breaking religious laws by watching football - was read out on a loudspeaker before their executions. The news of the horrifying execution of the teenagers comes just days after ISIS released a video showing two men being thrown off the top of a tower block in Mosul. Charges found against the accused were announced by a masked Islamic State fighter, using a small handheld radio. Reading from a list, he declares the men are guilty of engaging in homosexual activities and should be punished by death, in accordance with Islamic State's radical interpretation of Sharia law.","ISIS soldiers executed 13 teenage boys for watching Asian Cup match .

"British jihadis fighting in Syria and Iraq will have their passports cancelled for at least two years to prevent them returning to wreak terror in the UK, David Cameron announced on Thursday evening. Downing Street said the plans would give Britain the toughest anti-jihadi powers in the Western world outside the US, and would ensure fighters were only let back in to the UK ‘on our terms’. However, they will place ministers on collision course with judges and human rights lawyers. And they risk infuriating allies such as Turkey and Germany, which could find themselves having to deal with British extremists stranded abroad. David Cameron's plans would see Aine Davis (crouching, second from right) have his passport cancelled for two years after he fled to Syria to fight for Islamic State . The Prime Minister’s announcement came as he outlined a raft of new measures to counter the threat posed by Islamist fanatics in a speech to the Australian parliament in Canberra. He is about to embark on talks with world leaders at the G20 summit in Australia on tackling so-called foreign fighters. The measures also include plans to streamline existing powers to confiscate the passports of Britons thought to be planning to travel to Syria. They will also be extended to under-18s for the first time to combat the threat posed by teenage jihadis. And airlines will be warned that they could be fined or have their licences to operate in the UK revoked unless they co-operate fully with the security services to identify and prevent banned suspects from boarding flights home. But it is the introduction of ‘temporary exclusion orders’ that will prove the most controversial. On the orders of Home Secretary Theresa May, legal papers will be served to a suspect’s last-known address in the UK and they will be placed immediately on international ‘no-fly’ lists. Any airline that allows a suspect to board a plane to the UK could find its aircraft turned back. And any banned individuals who manage to sneak back into Britain would commit an offence carrying a five-year jail term. David Cameron made the announcement in Australia, where he has met the country's prime minister Tony Abbott . The order could also be extended indefinitely if they are still deemed a threat after two years. Individuals who insist on returning to Britain will be permitted to do so without a passport – but only under strict police supervision. Detectives will be sent to accompany them home, where they could face prosecution or surveillance. Those who refuse these terms will be effectively marooned abroad without a passport – probably in a so-called transit country, such as Turkey or Germany. Downing Street last night said diplomatic talks were continuing with these countries about how these individuals should then be dealt with. The plan is designed to get round international laws that prevent the UK stripping the citizenship of British subjects and rendering them stateless, which had been Mr Cameron’s initial plan. It will be included in a new Counter Terrorism Bill, which will be published this month and rushed through Parliament by the end of January. A spokesman said that Attorney General Jeremy Wright had signed off the measures as being consistent with international law. But they risk being caught up in a legal minefield. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has warned that removing passports from British citizens abroad is ‘likely to be a non-starter’. The woman dubbed the ‘Jihottie’ in a landmark terrorism case has claimed the public think she was cleared because of her looks. Nawal Msaad, 27, earned her nickname after she posted photos online of the glamorous outfits she would be wearing to her trial. The university student even decorated the electronic tag on her ankle with jewels. She was eventually acquitted of trying to smuggle £16,500 in her underwear to a jihadi fighter. Nawal Msaad (right), dubbed the 'Jihottie', spoke for the first time since she was acquitted of smuggling £16,500 in cash to a jihadi fighter, but her friend Amal El-Wahabi (left) was jailed . Yesterday, as Miss Msaad spoke out for the first time since her acquittal, her friend Amal El-Wahabi was jailed for two years and four months for arranging to transport cash to her 30-year-old husband Aine Davis, a Muslim convert fighting with IS. It is the first prosecution in Britain of funding terrorism in Syria. Miss Msaad, a Muslim, complained of sexist treatment in the media and said she has received abuse from the Muslim community and threats of sexual violence on social networking sites for the way she dressed during her trial. ‘A lot of people think that I’m the smuggler who got away with it, that the jury only let me off because of my looks,’ she told Channel 4 News. ‘I was supposed to be a jihadi, but there I was dressed in skirts and matching blazers. Many people couldn’t handle this. ‘I was getting stick from the Muslim community, from people really bothered by the way I dress, sending me messages that I should cover up.’","David Cameron's plan will strengthen Britain's anti-jihadi powers .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has vowed to 'shirtfront' Russian leader Vladimir Putin over the MH17 disaster when he attends the G20 summit in Brisbane. His comments, which revealed his anger over Russia's support for separatists who shot down the Malaysia Airlines flight which led to the deaths of 298 people including 38 Australians, have also prompted a barrage of insults back from a Russian news site. After consulting with other G20 members, Mr Abbott confirmed Mr Putin would not be banned from the economic leaders' summit next month. Scroll down for video . Senator Lambie has called for MASH style units to fight the Ebola threat . Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he will question Russian leader Vladimir Putin face to face at the G20 summit . As the G20 is an international organisation which works on consensus, Australia does not have the right to bar any member from attending, Mr Abbott said. Labor leader Bill Shorten said he would not give the time of day to Mr Putin. Australia has imposed trade bans on Russia and expressed his anger over Russia's support for separatists who shot down the Malaysia Airlines flight where 38 Australians were killed . But Mr Abbott, who will host the summit, says it is better to engage his Russian counterpart. 'I'm going to shirtfront Mr Putin,' the prime minister said on Monday. 'I'm going to be saying to Mr Putin, Australians were murdered. They were murdered by Russian-backed rebels using Russian-supplied equipment.' Speculation over the exact meaning of 'shirtfront' soon ensued on social media following the Prime Minister's comments, but was soon revealed to be a slang word for an aggressive and now illegal 'front on bump' in Australian Rules Football. Mr Abbott also said he would  demand that Russia co-operate with the criminal investigation into the MH17 disaster and if evidence is required from the nation, it should be provided. The world was shocked when Malaysian Airwatys flight  MH17 was shot down by Russian separatists . Mr Shorten said there was plenty of evidence pointing to Russian involvement in the July 17 downing of MH17 over eastern Ukraine. 'It was an act of murder,' Mr Shorten told reporters in Melbourne. 'How is it that the President of the Russian Federation, Putin, can thumb his nose at the rest of the world, go wherever he wants, without there being any repercussions or any co-operation with the independent investigation as to how this happened?' Mr Putin knew more about the plane tragedy than he had let on so far, he said. 'I happen to think that when you deal with an international bully, the way you do it isn't by laying out the red carpet. So no, I don't think he's welcome, I don't think most Australians want him here.' Asked whether Mr Abbott should meet with Mr Putin, the Labor leader said: 'No.' 'I wouldn't give him the time of day,' Mr Shorten said. Labor leader Bill Shorten says the MH17 tragedy was 'an act of murder' and he would not give Putin the 'light of day' Treasurer Joe Hockey had confirmed Mr Putin's attendance at the weekend when speaking with Russia's finance minister. He said that while the consensus among G20 members was that the Russian President should attend, he expected there to be 'full and frank dialogue'. The G20 is an economic forum but previous summits have discussed global security issues such as Syria. Mr Abbott's comments have sparked an angry response on the Russian online news site Pravda. 'I would advise Russia's President Vladimir Putin to wash his hands carefully and sterilize them after shaking the paw offered to him by Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott at the forthcoming G20 Summit in Brisbane,' a Pravda columnist says. 'When Australia isn't busy crawling around the legs of its colonial master, England or trying to crawl up the anatomy of London's master, Washington, participating in their wars to pick up a few crumbs thrown Canberra's way, its politicians are busy kowtowing to Europe and the USA making stupid and unfounded remarks about Russia,' the opinion column continues. Mr Abbott saying Russia needed to co-operate on the plane disaster was another example of 'crass stupidity', the column says. 'The answer to that bulls*** is that the atrocity happened on Ukrainian soil and it is not yet clear whether the aircraft was downed by a missile possibly fired from a position behind rebel lines, possibly not, possibly fired by rebels.'","Prime Minister Tony Abbott has vowed to question Putin face to face about the MH17 disaster .

"A passenger plane has been forced to divert after another bomb threat was made on Twitter, just 24 hours after similar messages forced fighter jets to escort two flights. The Delta Air Lines flight from Los Angeles to Orlando landed in Dallas on Sunday afternoon because of a 'security concern'. However reports from passengers on board the flight suggest the pilot told them because it was of concerning posts on social media. Scroll down for video . Bomb threat: The Delta Air Lines flight from Los Angeles to Orlando landed in Dallas on Sunday afternoon because of a 'security concern'. Passengers have said the threat was made on Twitter. One of them (above) was directed at the airline . Concerning: Another message from the account claimed there were 'soldiers' on the flight . A tweet was sent out from the twitter handle @AllahuAhkbar911, which is now a suspended account, to various groups including @FoxNews and @DeltaAssist. One of the tweets stated in all caps: @FOXNEWS WE HAVE PLANTED EXPLOSIVES ON DELTA FLIGHT #1061 FROM LA TO ORLANDO, WE ARE ISIS, WE ARE HERE, YOU WONT BE.' The account uses a picture of Junaid Hussain, the man believed to be behind the hacking of the Pentagon's Twitter account earlier this month. He is a 20-year-old British man who allegedly moved to Syria to help jumpstart ISIS’s hacking efforts. Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said passengers on Flight 1061 got off the Boeing 737-900 so authorities could search the aircraft. The airline continued the flight when authorities determined it was safe to do so. A tweet from a Los Angeles NBC affiliate said that a sports producer on board the plane at the time had been told he was disembarking because of a bomb threat. Two planes were also evacuated upon arrival at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Sunday due to what a spokesman called a 'security concern', however the details of these are unknown. Airport spokesman Perry Cooper says a JetBlue flight from Long Beach, California, and a regional SkyWest jet from Phoenix were the planes involved. The flights arrived late Sunday afternoon.

"Luiz Adriano wrote himself into the Champions League record books on Tuesday night by scoring five goals in Shakhtar Donetsk's 7-0 victory away to BATE Borisov. Even on such a free-scoring night of European action, the Brazilian's feat was exceptional and he became only the second player to score five goals in a Champions League game. The other was Lionel Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. Luiz Adriano blows a kiss to the crowd after scoring Shakhtar's seventh and final goal in the thrashing of BATE Borisov in which he scored five - equalling the Champions League record for goals in a game . Adriano drills home a penalty to complete the Ukrainian club's emphatic victory in Belarus . Luiz Adriano, 27, hails from Porto Alegre and started his career at hometown club Internacional, for whom he made 12 league appearances and scored three goals during the 2006-2007 campaign. The highlight of his short career at the club came against European champions Barcelona in the final of the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup. Having scored the winner against Al-Ahly in the semi-finals, the striker came on as a late substitute in the final and assisted Adriano Gabiru in scoring the winner. Around this time, he was involved in the Brazil Under 20 squad, making 11 appearances and scoring twice, but he never made the step-up to the Selecao's first team. In March 2007, Luiz Adriano followed in the footsteps of many other Brazilian players by moving to the Ukrainian league with Shakhtar for a fee of about £2.5m.

By 2009-2010 he was fully settled in Donetsk and his goalscoring ratios steadily climbed - in 2009-10 he scored 17 goals in 36 games and the following year got 20 in 37. His goals helped Shakhtar to an outstanding period of success as they won the title five seasons in a row and became a dangerous opponent to face in Europe. In February 2011, he scored the decisive goal in their 3-2 away win over Roma in the first leg of a last 16 tie.

Shakhtar backed UEFA's sanctions and said they were deeply disappointed by Adriano's actions. Across all competitions, he has 115 goals in 246 appearances for the club and his fourth goal against BATE meant he overtook Andriy Vorobey to become their all-time leading goalscorer.","Luiz Adriano scored five goals in Shakhtar Donetsk's 7-0 win away to BATE Borisov in the Champions League on Tuesday night .

"The Northwest Airlines notorious skyjacking saga that has baffled authorities for 40 years may have finally been solved. An Oregon woman who claims her uncle was the elusive criminal known only as DB Cooper says she has been told by the FBI that her evidence is enough for them to close the file on the case. Burdened by guilt over her knowledge surrounding the case, Marla Cooper came forward earlier this year, claiming she had a 40-year-old family secret protecting her uncle, a man named Lynn Doyle Cooper. Scroll down for video . Is it the same man? Maria claims her uncle Lynne Doyle Cooper, left, was the infamous hijacker, right . Niece: Marla Cooper says her family's 40-year-old secret reveals that her uncle, Lynn Doyle Cooper, was the notorious skyjacker . Marla Cooper said she was eight years old when her uncle, whom she called LD Cooper, came to her home, badly injured, for Thanksgiving in 1971 - the day after the infamous incident. He claimed his injuries were the result of a car crash. Later, she said, her parents came to believe that L.D. Cooper was the hijacker. Mrs Cooper never saw her uncle again after that day and was told he died in 1999. It was the FBI's most promising lead for the mystery of who was behind the hijacking of Northwest Airlines flight from Portland to Seattle following a bomb threat on the night of November 24, 1971. Imitating art: Marla Cooper says her uncle was fascinated with comic book character Dan Cooper, the same name as the one given to Northwest Airlines on that night in 1971 . Marla Cooper also provided investigators with a photograph of LD and a guitar strap that he owned for fingerprint testing. While the results of the fingerprint test have not yet been determined, authorities seem eager to end the investigation. Miss Cooper told NBC affiliate WFIE: 'Regardless of the findings of the fingerprints, they would be closing the case after this. He said, ""I am certain your uncle did it. I feel certain that your uncle did it. And that, what's the point in continuing the investigation?""' In addition, Marla Cooper said that her uncle was fixated on a comic book character named 'Dan Cooper,' the name the skyjacker gave the airline before boarding. FBI officials told the station that they are conducting the tests, but would not comment on their next move in the case. As for the $200,000 ransom, she believed Lynne Cooper lost it all as he parachuted to earth. The mysterious hijacking has intrigued everyone from federal agents to amateur sleuths. On that day in 1971, the suspect, who . was wearing a suit and sunglasses, boarded the flight after buying a . $20 one-way ticket to Seattle. Cool culprit: Impressions of Cooper as a smartly-dressed man have added to the fascination nature of the mystery . Map: Locations in Washington where Cooper was originally thought to have landed and where some of the ransom money was found in 1980 . After getting on the plane, he ordered whisky and lit a cigarette before passing a . flight attendant a note that read: 'I HAVE A BOMB IN MY BRIEFCASE. I . WILL USE IT IF NECESSARY. I WANT YOU TO SIT NEXT TO ME. YOU ARE BING (sic) HIJACKED.' Cooper told the captain that in . return for $200,000 and four parachutes, he would allow 36 people to . leave the plane when it landed in Seattle. Vital clue: Cooper's cheap clip-on tie was one of the items recovered after the skyjack . The FBI agreed to the swap and the . plane took off again under Cooper's orders to fly towards Mexico at an . altitude of under 10,000 feet. Somewhere over the lower Cascade . mountains in southwestern Washington, Cooper stepped out of the plane . with a parachute strapped to his back. He was never seen again. There were more than 1,000 possible suspects considered over the past four decades. Several people even claimed to be . Cooper at times, but were dismissed on the basis of physical . descriptions, parachuting experience and, later, by DNA evidence . recovered in 2001 from the cheap, clip-on tie the skyjacker left on the plane. Items recovered from the skyjack include $5,800 of the stolen money, in tattered $20 bills and Cooper's tie. Many . believe that Cooper was Richard McCoy, a Vietnam War veteran, . experienced parachutist and BYU political science student who staged a . similar hijacking several months later. But . the FBI has said that McCoy - who was killed in a shoot-out with law . enforcement officers after a prison break in 1974 - simply didn't fit . the description of Cooper provided by two flight attendants.

"Frozen Snow Glow Elsa toys are going for as much as £79.99 online, a 130 per cent markup on their original price of £34.99 after selling out in stores . A nightmare looms for parents this Christmas with evidence there is a desperate shortage of Britain’s best-selling doll. Stores are unable to keep up with demand for Frozen Snow Glow Elsa, an interactive doll who sings, speaks and lights up, with an official price of £34.99. Many household chains and websites, such as Tesco, Toys r Us and Argos, list it as being ‘unavailable’, while any new stock is being snapped up as soon as it arrives on shelves. Such is demand from parents desperate to avoid tears on Christmas morning that eBay entrepreneurs are cashing in by charging as much as £79.99 – a mark-up of almost 130per cent. Elsa, the lead character from Disney’s Frozen film, is driving a phenomenal surge in sales in a wide range of merchandise linked to the inspirational animated fairytale. Sales of dolls and merchandise linked to the Disney film are on course to hit all-time high for any movie franchise – overtaking the phenomenally successful Toy Story. While Toy Story sales were driven by versions of Buzz Lightyear and Woody, it is the Frozen Snow Glow Elsa which is number one on wish lists this year. Elsa’s dress lights up and she will sing and speak phrases from the film when owners touch her magical snowflake necklace. The current top five toy best-selling toys also includes a Frozen Ice Skating Elsa Doll, which is £29.99, and an interactive Frozen Toddler Doll for younger children at £39.99. UK sales of all Frozen merchandise, from dressing up outfits to dolls and jigsaws, are put at £31m up until the week ending November 8, according to retail experts at The NPD Group. Global toys industry analyst for NPD, Frederique Tutt, said: ‘New items have been launched, production has been increased to meet demand, and sales are getting stronger. ‘We counted three Frozen dolls in the five best-selling toys last week alone. ‘If Frozen continues at this level until Christmas, not only will the license keep top spot and get the license of the year accolade but it will also beat the all-time record of Toy Story 3 – in 2010 - in terms of toy sales.’ Sales of Frozen toys are set to hit an all-time high, outstripping the Buzz Lightyear dolls that set a record after Toy Story was released. Frozen has already beaten Toy Story 3 to the top grossing animated movie spot . While Toy Story merchandise was most popular with boys, Frozen is clearly a favourite for girls. The storyline is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale The Snow Queen and tells how a fearless princess sets off on an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer and a snowman to find her sister, Anna, who has become trapped in a land of eternal winter. The film overtook Toy Story 3 to become the biggest grossing animated film of all time earlier this year with ticket sales of more than £1billion, while the song ‘Let it Go’ won an Oscar and became a social media phenomenon. Such is the demand for themed merchandise that there were reports of fights among women shoppers at the opening of a new Poundworld in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. Just last week, police were called to a toy store in Dublin to calm shoppers who battling to get hold of a Snow Glow Elsa doll. Gary Grant, the boss of The Entertainer toy chain, said: ‘Demand is just unbelievable. The film launched last year, but this is the year that sales of themed products have really caught on. ‘We have major stock issues in terms of keeping up with demand. The numbers are just vast. ‘We sell more jigsaw puzzles based on Frozen than all others put together. I have never seen anything like it. I suspect even Disney has been surprised. ‘Quite frankly, you could sell empty boxes if they had Frozen written on them.’ 1. Frozen Snow Glow Elsa £34.99 . 2. Kidizoom Smartwatch £39.99 . 3. LeapPad Explorer Tablet £79.99 . 4. Frozen Ice Skating Doll £29.99 . 5. Frozen Toddler Doll (15in) £39.99 . Mr Grant said Frozen has outpaced any previous film in terms of the sales of themed toys. ‘Stocks of the dolls are coming in all the time, but if I get 2,000 of the interactive dolls they would be gone by the end of the week. It is bigger than Toy Story and Buzz Lightyear ever was.’ The other products on the top five best sellers stand out because they incorporate technology which mimics devices used by adults. The Kidizoom Smartwatch, which is made by Vtech and costs £39.99, includes a stills and video camera, a voice recorder and a series of games. Mike Lynch of Vtech said the watch will help prepare youngsters for the technology they will need and use in later life. ‘It takes adult technology and puts it into a child friendly toy. It has all the features you would want from a watch, in terms of a digital and analogue clock display as well as a stop watch. ‘There are games and a voice recorder that allows children to add some funny effects, like a robotic sound. There is a two megapixel camera for stills and video.’ Also on the list is the £79.99 LeapPad Explorer, an iPad-style tablet for toddlers, which includes eBooks, hundreds of educational games and apps, as well as a camera.","Tesco, Toys R Us and Argos all list Frozen Snow Glow Elsa as unavailable .

'He was animated, a result of too much booze and the team doing so well so far in the tournament. One of the last photos that Mr Amores uploaded on his Twitter profile show him on the boat . Mr Amores is seen with friends on the boat and with a life-jacket on next to a Jacuzzi on the boat . He was on the deck of the cruise liner MSC Divina when he plunged over the railings into the ocean below last Wednesday . 'I heard him say to her: 'I am so happy that I can fly! Look at me!' And with that he stuck his arms out and dived overboard. 'The ship was moving at a fair clip and he vanished into the foam created in the ship's wake. 'By the time the ship had stopped and turned around, he was nowhere to be seen.' Brazil's . coastal waters are filled with dangerous currents not to mention . sharks, with government officials in some coastal areas increasing . lifeguard numbers and erecting signs in English to warn World Cup . tourists about sharks. Although the Brazilian navy has joined in the hunt for Mr Amores, the chances of him being found alive are slim. Mr Amores celebrates his country's win with his friends last week .

"Louis van Gaal was 'shocked' by Manchester United's poor first-half performance against Burnley according to Chris Smalling, who labelled the display as their worst of the season. Smalling scored a brace and Robin van Persie converted an 82nd minute penalty on Wednesday as United beat Burnley to move up to third in the Barclays Premier League. Van Gaal's team have lost just once in 18 matches but a section of United's fan base is becoming dissatisfied with the team's style of play, which is often laboured and unproductive. Chris Smalling scored twice as Manchester United beat Burnley 3-1 at Old Trafford on Wednesday evening . But United were hugely disappointing for vast swathes of the Premier League encounter . That was certainly the case against the Clarets, who passed the ball better and looked more incisive at Old Trafford in the first half even though their team cost a fraction of Van Gaal's expensively-assembled starting XI. Van Gaal was unhappy with his team at half-time and the United boss made his players acutely aware of his feelings in the dressing room. 'I think the manager was shocked at half-time,' Smalling said. 'The manager said in the dressing room that the first half was unacceptable and all the players know that. 'It wasn't a 3-1 scoreline game. Especially in that first half, we all let ourselves down. We could have played much better. 'That the first half was probably the worst we've had all season, we were lucky to go into the break with a lead. 'We knew that it wasn't good enough in the first half. We were lucky to get away with it, and we had to stand up and fight in the second-half.' Smalling said Louis van Gaal was shocked by how badly United played in the first half . The Dutch manager chats to coach Albert Stuivenberg during the match against Burnley on Wednesday . Over the next 24 hours, Van Gaal is set to meet with the club's co-chairmen Joel and Avram Glazer, who were at the Burnley match, to discuss plans for the summer. With United 12 points behind Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea, the FA Cup looks to be the only chance the Dutchman has of ending his first season at Old Trafford with a trophy. As such, United cannot afford another repeat performance on Monday when they travel to League One side Preston in the fifth round. 'We need to make sure that we come out of the blocks quickly against Preston,' Smalling added. 'There is [more to come from us]. But If we can win games playing that badly, then it shows that if we do play well and it all clicks, then there will be a lot better performances at Old Trafford, that's for sure.' The two positives for Smalling were the improvement of United's play in the second half and the fact that he managed to get on the scoresheet twice. Chris Smalling rises above the Burnley defence to score United's second goal on Wednesday night . Robin van Persie sealed victory from the spot after Angel di Maria had been upended by Scott Arfield . The defender is not used to scoring so much - this was his first career brace - but he was happy to find the net just 22 seconds after replacing Phil Jones, who hobbled off with a knee injury, and head United into 2-1 lead after Danny Ings' equaliser. 'It's not something I'm used to, but because of our first-half performance I couldn't get too overjoyed at half-time,' the United defender added. 'From one to 11, I don't think we were good enough, but it's always nice to score. 'It was great to get the (second) goal before half-time because I think that settled us, and we were more composed after the break. It was a lot better, and a bit more like Manchester United.' Van Gaal said he was worried that Jones is set for another lengthy layoff but the good news for United is that the head injury Daley Blind suffered in the first half was only minor and he looks set to feature against Preston. 'In the last couple of games we've been able to have a fully-fit squad, so it's unfortunate that we've picked up a couple of injuries,' Smalling said. 'It seems that whenever someone comes back, another drops out. It's been unfortunate, but hopefully they [Blind and Jones] won't be out for long.'","Manchester United beat Burnley 3-1 at Old Trafford on Wednesday .

"In the speech, Mr Cameron said 'there is further to go' in filtering out extremist propaganda online . Majot internet firms must act faster to delete terrorist propaganda including beheading videos, David Cameron warned yesterday. Movies showing extremist violence should be treated like those showing child abuse, the Prime Minister said. Firms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter have a ‘social responsibility’ to strengthen filters, improve reporting and be more proactive in taking down the material. In a speech to the Australian parliament, in Canberra, Mr Cameron said the West faced a ‘new and pressing challenge’ in filtering out extremist propaganda designed to radicalise impressionable youngsters. The warning came as Mr Cameron revealed that the security services have foiled multiple ‘major plots’ to attack the UK in recent months – and stepped up pressure on Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to allow the reintroduction of control orders on terror suspects. British police and intelligence experts are already removing 1,000 extremist images and videos a week from the internet – equal to one every ten minutes. Of these, some 80 per cent relate to jihadist activities in Iraq and Syria. But Mr Cameron said leading internet firms also had a ‘role’ to play. He added: ‘We are making progress but there is further to go. ‘This is their social responsibility. And we expect them to live up to it.’ His comments came as Downing Street announced that several major internet companies have now signed a deal to make it easier to taken extremist propaganda offline. Mr Cameron announced the crackdown as a British jihadi in Syria sought revenge on the Government’s decision to strip him of his citizenship by posting bomb-making instructions on the internet. Mr Cameron said leading internet firms also had a ‘role’ to play in removing extremist propaganda . David Cameron is joining world leaders in Brisbane, Australia, for the G20 summit, which begins today . The Islamic State fighter, who calls himself ‘Muslim-Al-Britani’, said he had recently arrived in the war zone from the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In a badly-spelled message on his Twitter account – now suspended – he said: ‘I just wana thank the Home Secretary Theresa May 4 taking my British Citizenship away. I thought I should reward her.’ He then posted details of how other jihadis could construct home-made bombs and assemble weapons. The man, who is based in the IS stronghold of Raqqa in northern Syria, is thought to come from Manchester.","In a speech in Canberra, Prime Minister said internet firms had role to play .

"While Peaches Geldof appeared to have beaten her drug demons, her continuing fascination with the occult, and particularly a mysterious religious cult called OTO, worried her family. Just three weeks ago Peaches, 25, tweeted a picture of bookshelves groaning with works by Aleister Crowley, the British founder of the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). She also posted a photograph of Crowley's book, Magick - In Theory And Practice, praising him as a 'beautiful writer and thinker'. Her interest in OTO ran alongside previous fascinations with the Scientology cult, and Judaism, the religion of her husband, Thomas Cohen. Celebrity devotee: Peaches Geldof was a fan of Ordo Templi Orientis and had OTO tattooed onto her right arm . Groaning bookshelves: Three weeks ago Peaches posted this photo showing copies of Crowley's books . Aleister Crowley, who died in 1947, wrote books about the occult and called himself 'The Great Beast, 666' Crowley, who styled himself as 'the Great Beast, 666' and was dubbed 'the wickedest man in the world', revelled in sadomasochistic sex rituals with men and women, and the use of hard drugs including opium, cocaine, heroin and mescalin. Peaches, who had 'OTO' tattooed in a heart on her right arm, is said to have become interested in the occultist's religious theory during her short-lived marriage to musician Max Drummey when she was 19.  At the same time, she also pursued an interest in Scientology after talking to actress Katie Holmes, then married to Scientologist Tom Cruise. She was said to have visited Scientology centres in Los Angeles and New York, before losing interest in the cult.  More recently, Peaches, whose husband, Thomas Cohen is Jewish, developed an interest in Judaism. While the marriage to Drummey failed, Peaches' interest in Crowley's teachings persisted, and she has previously urged her online followers to read his 'super interesting' books, an interest that worried her family. Last year her father's girlfriend, actress Jeanne Marine, said of Peaches' interest in the cult: 'You don’t know if it’s something that will pass or if it’s longer than that. The thing is, young people, they change their minds a lot.' She said neither she nor Bob Geldof knew anything about the cult, but said the fact that Peaches had tattooed its name onto her skin indicated that her interest in it might be more than a passing fad. OTO was said to have been brought to Britain from Europe in the early 20th century by Crowley, an infamous occultist and drug addict. Crowley, who was said to have filed his teeth into fangs, was rumoured to drink blood and stage drug-fuelled orgies, and was widely criticised for being 'in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time'. Aleister Crowley founded the religion of Thelema, around which the Ordo Templis Orientis was organised . He founded the religion of Thelema, . which was based around the idea of free will, and reorganised the OTO's . teachings around the same principles. One of his books, The Diary Of A Drug Fiend, was among those pictured on Peaches' bookshelf. Crowley's . followers, however, say he was a highly influential thinker and writer . in the field of western esotericism and counter-culture, and in 2002 the . BBC ranked him 73rd in their list of the greatest Britons of all time. 'His work within the OTO was nothing short [of] miraculous and he was a beautiful writer and thinker too, as well as magical practitioner' Peaches Geldof on British OTO founder, Aleister Crowley . On 16 March, Peaches posted a picture of Crowley's Magick book alongside the slogan 'Do what thou wilt', a central tenet of the philosophical law of Thelema, upon which the thinkings of the OTO were based. When one follower asked her if Crowley, who died in 1947, was a satanist, Peaches replied saying: 'No, it has nothing to do with Christian ideas like satan or Jesus at all.' And when others made references to his less appealing traits, she leapt to his defence, saying: 'All the stuff about him being a Nazi sympathiser and a racist was lies made up by the press who hated him. 'He would also just say controversial stuff purely to subvert people's perceptions of him in the media.  If you read any of his work, he makes this abundantly clear. 'His work within the OTO was nothing short [of] miraculous and he was a beautiful writer and thinker too, as well as magical practitioner.' Crowley called himself 'Supreme and Holy King of Ireland and all the Britains within the Sanctuary of the Gnosis' Crowley, pictured in ceremonial garb, liked to call himself 'The Wild Beast, 666' lived from 1875-1947 . Other celebrities linked to OTO include the rapper Jay-Z, who has been seen wearing a t-shirt bearing the slogan 'Do what thou wilt', and Led Zeppelin guitarist, Jimmy Page. Last year the head of OTO in Britain, John Bonner, 63, told the Mail that its followers here numbered hundreds rather than thousands. He said: 'We are used to being misunderstood. Many stories about Crowley, like people saying he filed his teeth down into fangs, are nonsense. 'You could call us a sex cult in a way, because we recognise, accept and adore the whole process which goes towards making tangible the previously intangible.' Devotees of OTO say it can take years of study to understand the religion, something Mr Bonner, who lives in Sussex, acknowledged. He said: 'You’re not supposed to just jump straight in to it. It takes time and study, but our rituals are not for public consumption. You need to join us and go through the initiation process before you can begin to understand. 'But according to our beliefs we can’t turn anyone away. So if you are over 18, are passably sane and are free to attend initiations, then you have an undeniable right of membership.'","Peaches was devotee of religious cult led by occultist Aleister Crowley .

"What price to watch the world’s best two players in competition on English soil? We will probably find out when Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi descend Old Trafford for an international friendly with more stars than Matthew McConaughey encounters in Interstellar. You needn’t trawl across galaxies to see these wonders either; Manchester calls on November 18 as Portugal face Argentina. Prices start from £40 per ticket. Seems decent value for such a rare spectacle. Ronaldo heads back to the stadium he graced for six years for the first time since he ejected Manchester United from the Champions League in April 2013. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Nani, Rodriguez and Ronaldo . Three big international fixtures will be taking place in England over the next week, starting on Wednesday .

Angel di Maria is set to play for Argentina at his home ground Old Trafford in the middle of next week . Ronaldo laughs in training ahead of Portugal's Euro 2016 qualifier against Armenia this week . Nani will grace Old Trafford for the first time since his summer move to Sporting Lisbon . Argentina v Croatia - Upton Park . Wednesday, November 12, 7.45pm . Adult tickets from £25 . USA v Colombia - Craven Cottage . Friday, November 14, 7.45pm . Adult tickets from £20 . Portugal v Argentina - Old Trafford . Tuesday, November 18, 7.45pm . Adult tickets from £40 . His goal for Real Madrid proved to be the last conceded by a side managed by Sir Alex Ferguson in Europe’s elite competition. If he scores this time you can expect the celebrations to be a little more celebratory. Messi is a familiar foe, but only once before have English observers been able to see these two pre-eminent practitioners in direct opposition without leaving the country. They were on the same Old Trafford pitch in April 2008 when a Paul Scholes rocket separated the teams and sent United on the path to Champions League glory. Between them, Messi and Ronaldo have won the last six Ballon d’Or prizes – in both guises – and share 35 major honours, including five Champions League titles. Argentina won the last match these nations played, a friendly in at the Stade de Geneve in Switzerland in February 2011, when Messi scored a last minute penalty to render Ronaldo’s goal meaningless. Angel di Maria also scored. Argentina striker Carlos Tevez will play at West Ham - where he was an immediate hero in 2007 - again . Tevez is fresh from scoring a wonder solo goal during Juventus' 7-0 win against Parma at the weekend .

Tevez shared a laugh on the West Ham pitch ahead of their game against Croatia on Wednesday night . Real Madrid's James Rodriguez is the standout star in a promising Colombia team . Nani is another with United links likely to feature, as is Carlos Tevez, although his warmest greeting should be found on Wednesday night, when Argentina play Croatia at Upton Park. Tevez became a cult hero at West Ham for keeping the club in the Premier League during his controversial spell in 2006-07. Tevez has been recalled to the Argentina squad by coach Gerardo Martino for the first time in nearly three-and-a-half-years after scoring a wonderful goal in Juventus’s 7-0 demolition of Parma at the weekend. Tevez has good memories of Old Trafford - not least for saving West Ham from relegation in 2007 . Pepe and Ronaldo must first turn attentions to a Euro 2016 qualifying game against Armenia . It will be Tevez’s first game back at Upton Park since appearing for Manchester City in a 0-0 draw in November 2012. Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano is also likely to play. For Croatia, Real Madrid playmaker Luka Modric, Atletico Madrid striker Mario Mandzukic and Messi’s Barcelona team-mate Ivan Rakitic all expected to be involved. Colombia face USA at Crave Cottage on Friday with World Cup golden boot winner James Rodriguez in tow. He leads a country that earned admirers in Brazil, and includes Porto’s Jackson Martinez.

"A young woman was reported missing in a notorious prostitute hotspot where 'psycho' trader Rurik Jutting spent seedy holidays, it emerged today. The woman, who was in her 20s, vanished in the red-light district of Angeles City - dubbed the 'Sin City' of the Philippines, MailOnline can reveal. Jutting is understood to have visited the vice capital several times over the last 18 months to hook up with groups of women, including a former girlfriend, for debauched breaks away. Pictures that emerged after his arrest for the murder of two prostitutes in Hong Kong show the Cambridge graduate surrounded by girls at hotels and clubs in the city, where call girls cost a fraction of the rate in the former British colony. A tourism website boasts the district offers 'alcohol and sexy, young women' where 'recreational sex is the sport of choice'. Out with the girls: British 'psycho' banker Rurik Jutting is pictured with two women at Club Rio in the red-light district of Angeles City in the Philippines. A woman was reported missing in the area last year, police said . Holiday hotpot: A friend of one of Jutting's alleged victims claims the banker regularly visited Angeles City to hook up with girls, including ex girlfriend Ariane Guarin (second left), seen here at the ABC Hotel hotel in the city . Despite anti-trafficking laws being passed two years ago, Angeles City's Fields Avenue continues to thrive, with its mile-long, gaudily lit bars full of young women and under-age girls roosting outside, beckoning to foreigners. A website called www.balibago.com – named after the city's red light district – openly brags: 'It's all here: alcohol and sexy, young women. 'There are over 100 bars full of attractive and readily available women eager to show you a good time. 'Balibago is a non-stop, drunken revel seven days a week, everyday of the year. Recreational sex is the sport of choice. 'You can enjoy full privileges with one or more attractive young females regardless of your age, weight, physical appearance, interpersonal skills, wealth or social class.' Jutting, however, seemed to prefer to party outside Fields Avenue. He chose to stay at Angeles Beach Hotel, more popularly known as ABC Hotel, which is a stone's throw from the airport known for budget flights to and from Hong Kong. Seedy trade: Sex workers line up for customers in a bar in the notorious prostitute hotspot of Angeles City . Vice girls: Sex workers in Angeles City cost a fraction of the rate charged in Hong Kong, where Jutting lived . Lighted up like a Nevada hotel despite a brewing nationwide shortage o power, ABC is known for its 'suites' with beds wide enough for threesomes, jacuzzi and steam baths, and a pool with a beach where wild parties are staged. Rurik Jutting stayed at the venue - known as The Party Hotel' - with former partner Ariane Guarin before the two parted ways in September. It was not clear why they broke up. In recent Facebook postings, Miss Guarin had expressed no regrets for the break-up. She even showed herself happily partying somewhere in Angeles City on Halloween Night, around the time Jutting was said to have killed two women in his apartment in Hong Kong. It was also not known whether Guarin was a sex worker – euphemistically called 'GROs' or guest relations officers – or simply a visitor who fell for a foreigner. In Angeles City, prostitution is 'hidden in plain sight', complained the Commission on Women which, together with Senator Cayetano, succeeded in having a law enacted to punish sex clients for the first time. A man unabashedly walks hand-in-hand with three Filipino sex workers through downtown Angeles City . Although prostitution is illegal in the Philippines, a Philippine senator cited a study in 2008 that estimated some 800,000 sex workers, half of them underage, operated in the country. Senator Pia Cayetano also quoted former American Ambassador Harry Thomas as saying that four out of every 10 foreign male visitors were sex tourists. The senator then pointed out that Angeles city was the place to go for sex. Reports of the woman's disappearance emerged after police in Hong Kong were understood to be widening their enquiries to the Philippines. It is also believed Interpol and British police are  liaising with law enforcement officials in Hong Kong in an effort to piece together Jutting's movements. Today, a police officer in Angeles City told MailOnline that an investigation had been launched after a worried mother reported her daughter missing. But he said officers had not been able to establish whereabouts and the mother never returned. Romeo Amarillo, chief investigator for the district of Balibago, said: 'Last year, a mother came to the station to report that her daughter – around age 24 or 25 - was missing, but the mother never came back.' Many young women in the Philippines end up in prostitution because of widespread poverty . The Bunny Ranch bar & nightclub  in Angeles City, Pampanga province in The Philippines . Police have launched a crackdown on sex clubs and bars in the red-light district of Hong Kong where two prostitutes were found dead at Rurik Jutting's flat. Dozens of officers raided premises at around midnight in Wan Chai demanding to see work permits and immigration documents from workers. At the Neptune III Disco, they left after around ten minutes without making any arrests, the paper reported. Women sit outside of a bar in Wan Chai district close to where two prostitutes were found murdered at the flat of British banker Rurik Jutting . Dozens of officers raided premises at around midnight in Wan Chai demanding to see work permits and immigration documents from workers . Asked if the operation was linked to the murders, one officer told The Telegraph: 'There is a little bit of a relationship.' It comes after the brutal killings of Indonesian women Sumarti Ningshi and Seneng Mujiasih, who are believed to have been working in the district on tourist visas. Seneng Mujiasah, who adopted the name Jesse Lorena in Hong Kong, was visiting with a domestic worker's permit which had expired, officials said. Sumarti Ningsih, meanwhile, had been in the former British colony on a tourist visa which ended on Monday. It is believed they had both been operating as call girls in the district, which require special permits. Earlier this week, a friend of one Jutting's alleged victims, Robert van den Bosch, said 'well informed sources' had told him that the murder suspect had regularly been to Angeles City. In one picture posted online, Jutting is seen in a strip bar called Rio Club, where tourists are known to pick up sex workers, with his arms draped around two women. Behind them is a mirror scrawled in marker pen that appears to list the particulars of the bar's women. Police are expected to look at the travel movements of Jutting throughout his two years working in the Far East. Manila, Bangkok and the former Portuguese colony of Macau are other popular destinations of sex-hungry expatriates. Amarillo said he was not aware of Jutting's case. He added that it would take time for them to dig up the missing woman's name since they were not computerised and cases brought to them are recorded by hand on large journals that serve as police blotters. Another investigator, Marlon Mamucut told MailOnline that news of the double murder was briefly flashed this morning on local Channel 11. 'We are not aware that the accused has been coming to Angeles City,' Mamucut said. He added that no one from 'higher headquarters' has ordered them to do any follow-up of Jutting's visits there. Taste for the high life: Rurik Jutting, 29, drapes an arm around Miss Guarin after moving to Hong Kong . It was also revealed today that officers investigating the murders  found grisly 'selfies' on Jutting's phone which show the accused killer posing with one of the dead bodies, it has been claimed. The gruesome photographs are said to show the British banker posing with the corpse of victim Sumarti Ningsih, whose decomposing body was found stuffed in a suitcase on Jutting's balcony. The images are understood to be among 2,000 photographs and videos of the two women found on the former public schoolboy's mobile phone, many of which show him having sex with the women. The news comes as it emerged Jutting's trading permit was revoked over suspicions he was a rogue trader on the day he is accused of killing the first of his alleged victims, raising questions that the collapse of his high-flying banking career may have triggered the killings. Details of the 2,000 photographs and video clips are said to have emerged from a police source, according to Hong Kong's Apple Daily newspaper. Jesse Lorena (pictured posing with cash) was found by police with her throat slashed at Jutting's apartment . Victim: Friends said Sumarti had travelled to Hong Kong from her home in Indonesia to seek a better life and send money back to their families . As police widened their inquiry last night, it emerged Jutting's trading permit was revoked on the day he is said to have killed the first of his alleged victims. His licence was cancelled by watchdog the Securities & Futures Commission in Hong Kong. Investigators will want to know if the banker – described by the Wall Street Journal as a competitive poker player – was suspected of being a 'rogue trader' and if the loss of his permit triggered the bloodbath. Earlier, in his first account since two prostitutes were found butchered in his luxury bachelor-pad, the Cambridge graduate insisted he had no mental health problems. Jutting was said to be 'frank and honest' with his legal team that the vice girls died in his flat – one was found chopped up in a suitcase – and blamed it simply on 'incidents involving him and girls' without elaborating.","Woman in her 20s was reported missing in Angeles City in the Philippines .

"If you look back wistfully at the Sixties and wish you were there, perhaps it's worth refreshing your memory. These outrageous adverts were the norm - with men blowing smoke in their wives' faces, stepping on their heads and groping them while they clean the house. Everything from Volkswagen cars to Kellogg's cereals used a little everyday sexism to brighten up their brands in a time when political correctness wasn't even dreamed up. Advertisers once played on the fact many saw women as good for little other than shopping. While attitudes have come a long way, recent research suggests many men are still afraid to speak up in support of women . 'Some men want to voice their support, but fear that no one will take them seriously, because they lack a vested interest in the cause,' said Professor Grant. Pictured is a sexist vintage advert from Schlitz . Fur-ious: This advert for trousers depicted a woman as a tiger-skin rug, boasting: 'After one look at his Mr Leggs slacks, she was ready to have him walk all over her'. The same would be unlikely to be true now . The big questions: It seems husbands tended to be either half-murderous towards their wives or groping them . Don't buy the wrong coffee! This advert for Chase & Sanborn is light-hearted, but would shock many today . In fact, the phrase 'politically correct' only gained its current meaning in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. That meant these advertisers felt free to be as offensive as they liked - depicting women being spanked and babies telling their mothers to smoke Marlboro cigarettes. And the spirit of TV hit Mad Men is alive and well in one poster for Van Heusen ties, which shows a wife on her knees delivering breakfast with the bold claim: 'Show her it's a man's world'. Some of the adverts are simply funny, like the Gillette razor so safe it's pictured being used by a baby. But others would now be downright irresponsible: 'For a better start in life, start Cola earlier!' Easily replaced: This VW ad said its parts were cheap, and it was cavalier in its attitude to women too. It boldly said: 'She can jab the hood or bump off the bumper... You can replace anything she uses to stop the car' A man's world: Sexism was used to sell every luxury brand, from Van Heusen ties to Tipalet cigarettes . 'Men are better than women!' This advert for sweaters said wives were 'a bit of a drag' on a mountain . The advert for Volkswagen boasts of the firm's hard-wearing cars, beginning simply: 'Women are soft and gentle, but they hit things'. And one for Drummond sweaters proclaims: 'Indoors women are useful - even pleasant. On a mountain they are something of a drag'. The vintage pieces look shockingly out of date now, but they will be far from the last adverts to be deemed sexist. Last year an advert for Renault cars was banned in Britain for having a little too much 'va va voom' - in other words, multiple close-ups on the breasts and bottoms of burlesque dancers. And a U.S. commercial for hair removal product Veet prompted outrage earlier this month by suggesting women were manly if they chose to keep their body hair. Light up Mom! This advert claimed 'you need never feel over-smoked'. Perhaps they hadn't heard of cancer . Rotten: These adverts promoted sugary drinks for toddlers, asking: 'How soon is too soon? Not soon enough' Nice and safe: The 'recent nationwide survey' this Camel advert was based on is probably a little out of date . And finally: Some of the ads, such as this one for a razor so safe it can be used by a baby, are downright funny . Women do not have the monopoly on being offended, however. A Samsung TV advert last year infuriated some customers who claimed its depiction of lazy, hairy 'slobs' was unfair to the world's men. The controversy was a lesson in there being no such thing as bad publicity, however - as despite being slammed as 'feminist porn' it got more than 10million hits on YouTube.","Volkswagen, Drummond sweaters and Kellogg's all feature in collection .

Forecasters said a nor'easter brewing over the Atlantic is likely to sweep up the East Coast during Tuesday and Wednesday, bringing a mixture of snow and freezing rain. Some forecasts said as much as eight inches of snow could hit New York City in a single day, however it is likely to be between three and five inches.

Snow day: Wednesday is forecast to bring the bulk of the snow, with areas from Washington, D.C. to Maine all at risk. Some areas had as much as ten inches of snow predicted . Intense: Wednesday night could bring more snow - even in Virginia - with the most intense fall set to hit an inch an hour . On its way: A nor’easter is expected to dump New York City with anywhere from 3 to 5 inches of snow Wednesday afternoon, turning the after-work commute and out-of-town travels into a nightmare . And the west: This NOAA satellite image taken Tuesday shows an area of low pressure over the Pacific Northwest along a stationary front. Widespread rain and mountain snow will overtake Washington, Idaho and Montana . Nast predictions: The Weather Underground forecast for Wednesday shows the East Coast's chances for rain and snow the day before Thanksgiving . Travelers wait in lines to pass through security and get to their gates at LaGuardia Airport in New York, Tuesday on November 25, 2014. A nor'easter was expected to develop along the East Coast just as millions of travelers head to their Thanksgiving destinations . Between three and five inches is expected to drop on New York on Wednesday afternoon, however most of it is likely to have melted by Thanksgiving, according to The New York Daily News. The storm will hit the eastern corridor from Boston to Washington. Meanwhile airlines - which canceled flights yesterday and are due more high winds and bad weather - were offering passengers the chance to switch their flights away from Wednesday for free. American Airlines told fliers they can switch some Northeastern routes from Wednesday to Tuesday or Thursday for free. Delta was offering switches from Wednesday flights to ones on Thursday and Friday. The storm will bring a mixture of snow and rain across the East Coast - and especially the I-95 corridor, though it is uncertainly exactly where the divide between the two will fall.

(Predictions from The Weather Channel, valid 9.30am ET) Snow map: The interior of New England is due the mos snow - but much of the I-95 corridor is within the 5 to 8 inches category above. The National Weather Service said 5 inches could hit New York City in the daytime, with another 3 inches at night . Second opinion: The above map shows how likely an area is to receive at least two inches of snowfall - with dark red areas practically certain to be hit. New York City sits around the 60-70 per cent band . According to the Weather Channel, the dividing line itself will see the most intense precipitation, with as much as an inch an hour falling. One line of thinking pegs the dividing line almost exactly over the I-95. 'I would pack your patience,' said Robert Sinclair of AAA New York. 'Unfortunately, the storm is scheduled to hit right in the middle of getaway day.' Jeff Masters, chief meteorologist for Weather Underground, said that the highest amount of snow was expected to fall in northeastern Pennsylvania, the Catskills of upstate New York and into Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. Officials at the three major airports in the New York City area — Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty — were 'monitoring weather forecasts carefully,' and were ready to take action if needed, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airports. All the major U.S. airlines were closely monitoring the situation but have not yet canceled flights or made any other changes. Nationwide: Much of the nation is due to be clear Tuesday, as the beginnings of the winter storm can be seen hitting the East Coast . Storm proper: Wednesday brings the largest bands of snow in the north, while rain continues in the south. The west of the country is due a clear day . Holiday: On Thanksgiving itself snow is not due over much of the country - though Washington, D.C. could be hit by flurries .","Storm brewing due to sweep north, with rain turning to snow past D.C.

"Spanish newspapers have been reacting to the news that Fernando Torres is set to return to his boyhood club Atletico Madrid. The 27-year-old is currently on a two-year loan at AC Milan from Chelsea, but has failed to impress so far and the deal is set to be cut short so he can return to Spain. Alessio Cerci, meanwhile, is preparing to move in the opposite direction. Front page of Spanish newspaper Marca reacting to the news that Fernando Torres is set for a return to his boyhood club Atletico Madrid after leaving there in 2007 to join Liverpool . Spanish paper Marca is one of the papers to have led their post-Christmas news with Torres, referring to him as 'el delantero, y symbolo rojiblanco', which translates as 'Atletico symbol and striker'. Torres joined Milan in the summer as he looked to rebuild his career following a largely unsuccessful few years at Chelsea, but failed to impress at the San Siro with just a single goal in 10 appearances. Spanish paper AS also delivers the news that  Torres is set to return to Atletico Madrid . Elsewhere, fellow Spanish paper AS has also reported that Torres is set for the move, with a deal that will run until the summer of 2016. The 30-year-old first left Atletico to join Liverpool in 2007, and was one of the best strikers in the Premier League and Europe as he scored 81 goals in 142 games in all competitions. A record £50million move to Chelsea followed in January 2011, but he struggled to show the same form at Stamford Bridge as he did on Merseyside and, following the arrival of Diego Costa in the summer, was deemed surplus to requirements.","Fernando Torres set to rejoin Atletico Madrid on 18-month deal .

"The chairman of the House panel responsible for green-lighting war spending warned the Obama administration Thursday that ruling out 'boots on the ground' in the battle against ISIS if it formally asks Congress to authorize future military operations. 'I will not support sending our military into harm’s way with their arms tied behind their backs,' said Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, a California Republican who is in the last weeks before his retirement. He warned during a committee hearing that regardless of who holds his gavel when a formal Authorization for Use of Military Force comes to Capitol Hill from the White House, 'should the AUMF proposed by the president contain such limitations it will be DOA in Congress.' Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said in the same hearing that Iraqi military forces are making progress restoring order in the Northern city of Mosul and re-establishing the country's border with Syria. As those operations gain traction, he said, the 'boots on the ground' question could be re-opened. 'I'm not predicting at this point that I would recommend that those forces in Mosul and along the border would need to be accompanied by U.S. forces, but we're certainly considering it,' Dempsey told lawmakers. Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, issued a pointed warning that Congress would refuse to sign a permission slip for war unless the option of using ground troops were left on the table . 'I don't know specifically what they are going to propose': Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he;s out of the loop on a new AUMF from the White House . 'WE'RE CERTAINLY CONSIDERING IT': Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told lawmakers he was open to the idea of recommending US ground troops to Obama . As it conducts a long-term military operation to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the self-declared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), the Obama administration has been relying on an AUMF hastily passed in the weeks following al-Qaeda's September 11, 2001 terror attacks on New York City and the Pentagon – and on an Iraq war resolution passed in 2003. Now, however, the enemy is ISIS, a Muslim caliphate that has rampaged across two-thirds of Syria and Iraq. Its members were expelled from al-Qaeda and the older terror group regards ISIS fighters as apostates. The result has been a White House that is relying on a battlefield permission-slip that many in Congress say is ill-fitting and obsolete. The administration has asked for $5.6 billion in new defense spending authority, raising eyebrows and new questions on the Hill as Obama pledged to double the U.S. military presence in the ISIS war while simultaneously claiming there would be no American battle engagement. McKeon warned Gen. Dempsey that 'limiting our advisers to headquarters buildings will not help newly trained Iraqi and Syrian opposition forces hold terrain, much less defeat [ISIS] in the field.' 'Yet the president has doubled down on his policy of 'no boots on the ground,' despite any advice you give him.' Texas Republican Rep. Mac Thornberry told Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that vague commitments from the White House has made it impossible for Congress to do its job. 'Until you get words on paper it's kinda hard to make progress,' Thornberry said. Hagel was noncommittal and said the White House was internally debating whether it needs a new AUMF from lawmakers – and how a request should be worded. 'I don't know specifically what they are going to propose,' he said. 'I don't know specifically if they are going to send it up as a legislative proposal.' 'I know the president has had specific conversations with specific members of both the House and Senate on this.' Senate Democrats have found their voices since their Election Day drubbing, and have spent much of the last week demanding a vote on a new AUMF before Republicans take over committee chairmanships and swear in a new majority in January. On Wednesday at the Woodrow WIlson Center in Washington, D.C., Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine complained that the U.S. has been 'engaged in a war – that is not about imminent defense of the United States – without legal authority.' In a statement after the election, Kaine said he was 'troubled by suggestions ... that Congress should wait until the new Congressional session in 2015 to take this vote.' 'We have already asked too many U.S. service members to risk their lives without a political consensus behind this mission,' he said. ANTI-WAR PROTESTS ONLY ON DAYS ENDING IN 'Y': The Code Pink group sent an activist to disrupt Thursday's proceedings . THE ENEMY: An ISIS fighter gestures from a vehicle in the countryside of the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane after the terror army took control of the area last month . BOOTS ON THE GROUND ARE KURDISH: While U.S. armed forces aren't carrying weapons into battle, the Peshmerga forces have been holding ISIS at bay . Republicans like North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones insist that anti-ISIS airstrikes are illegal without a congressional go-ahead. 'This is nothing more than an abdication of our constitutional responsibility,' he said Thursday. But moments later he hinted that many Republicans would play a dovish role unless the Obama administration clearly defined victory while asking for billions of dollars to achieve it. 'For goodness sakes, why in the world should be make such a commitment, and we don't even have an endpoint for it?' 'What is the end-state of what we are trying to accomplish?' he asked. 'I don't know how we convince the American people that a nation which is financially broke ... where is it coming from? Please explain to the Congress and the American people how it ends one day?' Hagel insisted that ISIS 'continues to represent a serious threat to American interests, our allies, and the Middle East ... and wields influence over a broad swath of territory in western and northern Iraq and eastern Syria.'","Obama wants $5.6 billion to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria but Republicans bristle at insistence that US troops won't engage in combat .

"Revealed: David Cameron, pictured today, has spoken about how a hoax caller was put through to his mobile just by claiming he was the director of GCHQ . David Cameron has today revealed the moment a drunk hoax caller high on cocaine and cannabis was put through to his mobile as he carried his daughter on a family walk as part of his new pre-election fitness regime. The caller, who bragged later: 'I was off my face', said he was the head of spy agency GCHQ Robert Hannigan and was put through to the Prime Minister by the Downing Street switchboard. Mr Cameron asked him: 'Who is this?'' and quickly ended the call when the prankster could only say: 'It is a hoax call'. Downing Street and the security services have now launched a major review of procedures following the breach, although Mr Cameron has said nobody would be sacked and no crime was committed. The Prime Minister has revealed the call came after he returned from Saudi Arabia to pay his respects after the death of King Abdullah and he was enjoying a 'very nice walk' with his family when his mobile rang. He said: 'I had Florence on my back to add to the exercise regime that I'm undertaking. My Blackberry went in my pocket, I answered it and it claimed to be a conference call established – which I do obviously very frequently – between the head of GCHQ and some of the staff in my office. 'A voice came through, a voice I didn't recognise. The voice said he said he was sorry to wake me up, which I thought was strange as it was eleven o'clock in the morning, and so I quite rapidly asked 'who is this?', to which the answer came 'it is a hoax call', and so I pushed the red button on the Blackberry which ended the call. 'That is what happened so no harm was done, no national security was breached, but it is important when these things happen to make sure we do everything we can to put in place systems to we weed out hoax calls, but every now and again, I suspect these things will happen'. The call followed a separate astonishing security lapse earlier in the day when a caller, believed to be the same man, was given a mobile number for GCHQ director Mr Hannigan after he rang the organisation. The unnamed man, described as well-educated and in his twenties, told a newspaper: 'I've just made complete monkeys out of GCHQ. I got the mobile number of a director.  What's more, I'm off my face on booze and cocaine. I had some spliff too. I've been up all night, I'm utterly wasted – hilarious.' Scroll down for video . Security breach: The Prime Minister (pictured in July last year) received the hoax call on an official mobile phone after the caller claimed to be Robert Hannigan, the director of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) The man, who sounded well educated and in his twenties, added: 'What's really funny is that GCHQ believe the word of someone so smashed they can hardly string a sentence together.' He had started making the calls in the early hours of Sunday morning. First he called the GCHQ switchboard and said that he was an aide to the Prime Minister from Downing Street. Breach: A caller was given a mobile number for GCHQ director Mr Hannigan after he rang the organisation, who gave him the director's private mobile number . He had told the operator that Robert Hannigan was not answering his 'usual number' so the GCHQ employee gave him the director's personal blackberry. Mr Hannigan is then said to have received a call from a man claiming to be a journalist from ITN - and then ended the call. Security officials have insisted that it was not the line used by the GCHQ chief for 'secure' top secret calls on matters of national security. On Sunday morning the same caller is said to have impersonated Mr Hannigan after calling the Downing Street switchboard - who put him through to the Prime Minister. All this was done by a man who 'couldn't string a sentence together', he said. Treasury minister Priti Patel insisted Downing Street takes security 'very, very seriously'. She told Sky News: 'There will now be a security review in light of what has happened. We've had an issue here, it's quite right and proper that GCHQ and Downing Street… look at the details of this… and they will have a thorough investigation. That is the right approach.' Downing Street last night insisted no confidential information had been disclosed by the Prime Minister. But both No 10 and GCHQ, which eavesdrops on the phone calls of terror suspects and criminals, launched immediate inquiries into the security breach. Last night no one had claimed responsibility for either of the calls. It was unclear if they were by the same person. Attention is likely to focus on computer hackers or self-styled internet privacy campaigners unhappy with the Prime Minister's stance on state surveillance. Downing Street said no sensitive information was disclosed during the 'quite brief' conversation and said Mr Cameron ended the call upon realising it was a hoax. Security procedures at No.10 are now under review . Blunder: An operator at GCHQ in Cheltenham appears to have handed over the number . In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks, he has called for greater powers to allow GCHQ to monitor the content of calls, emails and social media. Early hours of Sunday morning: Hoaxer calls GCHQ switchboard and says that he is an aide from Downing Street. Tells operator that director Robert Hannigan was not answering his 'usual number' so the GCHQ employee promptly gave him the director's personal blackberry. Then calls Mr Hannigan claiming to be a journalist - and the spy chief hangs up. 11am Sunday: Same caller telephones the Downing Street switchboard pretending to be Robert Hannigan. He is then put through to the Prime Minister and has a 'brief' conversation before David Cameron ends the call. It’s not clear whether the man was put straight through by the switchboard or after being transferred to someone else. He provoked alarm among some privacy campaigners by suggesting services such as WhatsApp should not be able to encrypt messages in a way they cannot be read by spies. A Government spokesman said: 'Following two hoax calls to Government departments today, a notice has gone out to all departments to be on the alert for such calls. 'In the first instance, a call was made to GCHQ which resulted in the disclosure of a mobile phone number for the director. 'The mobile number provided is never used for calls involving classified information. In the second instance, a hoax caller claiming to be the GCHQ director was connected to the Prime Minister. 'The Prime Minister ended the call when it became clear it was a hoax.' Mr Cameron is not the first high profile victim of a prank call. A hoaxer in December 2012 sparked tragedy when an Australian radio station succeeded in getting through to a hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness. The prank led to the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who took her own life after transferring the call. In 1995, the Queen spoke to a prank caller for 17 minutes – believing the person was the Canadian prime minister. In 1995, the Queen spoke to a prank caller for 17 minutes, believing the person at the end of the line to be the Canadian Prime Minister and in 1998, Tony Blair (right) took a call which he believed to be from William Hague . During the call, taken at Buckingham Palace, she promised the man, who claimed to be Jean Chretien, that she would try to influence a referendum being held in Canada. In fact, the caller was a Canadian impressionist Pierre Brassard calling on behalf of radio station CKOI FM in Montreal. Former prime minister Tony Blair also fell for a prank call from a radio station. In 1998, he took a call which he believed to be from then Tory leader William Hague. The caller was in fact Steve Penk – a DJ from Capital FM. Within moments, Mr Blair realised that the call was a fake but played along with the joke. David Cameron is not the first Prime Minister to have a phone hoaxer put through to him. Radio host Steve Penk played the trick on Tony Blair as he left his morning briefing in 1998, right at the time, with the help of impressionist Jon Culshaw. Culshaw put on the voice of then-leader of the opposition William Hague, and a Downing Street operator put him through. The impressionist told Mr Blair he was ringing to see how he was and the prime minister laughed along and said: 'That's quite a good imitation.' Mr Blair knew it was not his Tory rival because  Culshaw called him 'Tony', whereas Mr Hague would always have used 'prime minister'. One of the most famous hoax calls ever staged came some three years earlier when the Queen chatted on air to a Canadian DJ pretending to be Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien. Pierre Brassard got through to Buckingham Palace, spoke to the monarch on-air for 15 minutes and elicited a promise for her to influence Quebec's referendum on proposals to break away from Canada. The Queen did not know it was a hoax with the Palace later describing the incident as 'irritating and regrettable'. On another occasion, Brassard spoke to pope John Paul II, asking the pontiff if he had ever thought of fixing a toy propeller to his cap. In 2003, Miami radio station El Zol spoke to late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez pretending to be Cuban president Fidel Castro before reversing the prank by calling Castro posing as Chavez. Castro famously lost his temper and swore at the DJs live on air after they revealed that 'the whole of Miami' had been listening in on the joke. One of the most recent notorious pranks  led to the death of a nurse at a hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness. Australian DJs Mel Greig and Mike Christian called King Edward VII hospital impersonated the Queen and Prince Charles to ask staff questions about the Duchess's health. Indian-born nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who transferred the call to a duty nurse, was found dead three days after the prank was broadcast in December 2012.","David Cameron reveals call came while out walking with his family and he was carrying his daughter Florence on his back .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez joked Ross Barkley looks more natural with a ball at his feet than without it after the 20-year-old made an inspirational comeback at Goodison Park. The England midfielder is not just a huge talent, conservatively valued at £40million, he is also a talisman and leader for his club. Having suffered knee ligament damage in pre-season, he showed remarkable fizz and energy in his first outing of the season to lift senior colleagues who had started the weekend on the fringes of the relegation zone.

Booked: Richardson, Agbonlahor . Referee: A Taylor 6.5 . Star man: Leighton Baines (Everton) Barkley helped set up the first two goals and earned a standing ovation when he was substituted in the second half, before Seamus Coleman added a third. Martinez’s smile was only matched by that of Roy Hodgson’s assistant Ray Lewington, who will surely tell the England boss to pencil in Barkley’s name for the next Euro 2016 qualifier, against Slovenia. ‘I didn’t think there was any way eight days ago Ross could have started this game. But he’s been phenomenal in the last week and when he curled one in the top corner in training, it was a message to me,’ Martinez said. ‘It was like he’d been involved in every game this season. You ask yourself if he was born to play football. He looks more natural with a ball than without it. As humans, that’s not right!’ Everton had not won in their previous three League games but Barkley brought the feel-good factor rushing back with an audacious shot that was tipped around the post by Brad Guzan. From the following short corner, Leighton Baines turned Ashley Westwood inside-out and delivered the perfect cross, right-footed for once, for Phil Jagielka to head in. The 32-year-old skipper did not score at all for Everton last season but now has three in six games for club and country, including a Merseyside derby classic and a Wembley goal against San Marino. Villa boss Paul Lambert, who gave Christian Benteke his first start since March, accepted his side were second-best. ‘We didn’t deserve anything out of the game,’ he conceded. The only surprise was it took Everton until the 48th minute to extend their lead. Barkley played in Lukaku with the outside of his boot and Guzan let his shot squeeze through his hands. With the game won, Martinez hooked the ‘sensational’ Barkley, though he admitted the player looked fresh and would have carried on if asked. Everton did not need him by that stage. Seamus Coleman ran across Aly Cissokho to hook in another Baines cross for 3-0 after 76 minutes. ‘A ridiculous goal to give away,’ said Lambert.

Martinez seemed as pleased with the clean sheet as anything else. ‘We haven’t been solid enough in defence this season but today we had that right intensity. We stopped Villa being a threat and that is an incredible achievement against a team with Benteke and Gabby Agbonlahor,’ he said. He knows he has a special talent on his hands in Barkley. ‘Normally players either have good technical ability or good physical ability. He has both,’ said the Spaniard. For Villa, it is back to the drawing board. ‘Tom Cleverley and Alan Hutton were good but you can’t win games with only two of them,’ added Lambert.

"A 20-year-old woman has been jailed for six years after she falsely accused a man of rape then led a gang to beat him to death. Latiqwa Mayes was enraged that her victim Donald Robinson had not received a stricter sentence for breaking into her room and assaulting her friend at a boardinghouse. Months later, she saw him walking down the street in Baltimore, Maryland, and yelled: 'He raped me! He's a sex offender!' Jailed: Latiqwa Mayes, 20, (left) cried, 'He raped me!' then ordered a gang to beat Donald Robinson (right) in the street in Baltimore. He died later in hospital. Mayes has been jailed for six years for the attack last year . According to the Baltimore Sun, her father, Willie Mayes, rushed over and a group of teenagers playing basketball nearby joined to hold Robinson down. Surveillance footage of the attack on September 2, 2013, then showed passers-by joining the attack to kick and punch Robinson as Latiqwa Mayes pepper-sprayed him. Robinson stumbled away from the scene but hours later fell ill. He was pronounced dead in hospital and an autopsy stated the beating as the cause of death. Slamming Latiqwa Mayes, who has been in solitary confinement since September 2013, Judge Timothy Doory said Robinson's offense did 'not justify a call to the community to impose physical, violent retribution.' Complicit: Her father Willie Mayes joined the attack. He was jailed for two years for second-degree murder . Joshua Insley, defending, argued Robinson was a dangerous sex offender that should have been off the streets and violated his parole. He said: 'They wanted him to never come back, with good reason.' However, Judge Doory dismissed the claims, insisting they 'went too far'. Latiqwa and Willie Mayes both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. They were each sentenced to 10 years in prison, however Latiqwa will serve six and Willie will serve two, with the other years suspended.","Latiqwa Mayes, 20, was enraged Donald Robinson was on the streets months after breaking into her boardinghouse and assaulting her friend .

"British troops may have to return to Iraq to fight Islamic fanatics and the UK will have to accept a ‘willingness to take casualties’, Tony Blair warns today. The former prime minister calls for boots on the ground to take the fight to Islamic State (IS) terrorists who have seized control of large swathes of Iraq and Syria. In a 6,500-word essay on his website, Mr Blair acknowledges that there is ‘no appetite’ among the public for sending British troops back to Iraq following his own military forays in the region. Scroll down for video . Former prime minister Tony Blair  warned that British troops may have to return to Iraq to fight Islamic fanatics . But he warns it may be the only way to defeat IS fanatics who have murdered three Western hostages in recent weeks and are now threatening to kill British taxi driver Alan Henning. ‘Because the enemy we’re fighting is fanatical, because they are prepared both to kill and to die there is no solution that doesn’t involve force applied with a willingness to take casualties in carrying the fight through to the end,’ Mr Blair says. David Cameron is due to discuss plans for British air strikes with US President Barack Obama in New York tomorrow. But the Prime Minister has all but ruled out committing British troops. Government sources say the possibility of a recall of Parliament this week has not been ruled out to seek approval for a bombing campaign expected to begin soon. Ed Miliband signalled yesterday that Labour MPs could back air strikes on Iraq, provided the mission had ‘clear objectives’ and a ‘base in international law’. Mr Blair welcomes the apparent willingness of regional powers to take the fight to IS, but says Western troops may also be needed, and warns that air strikes will not be enough to defeat the extremists. A member loyal to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant waves an ISIL flag in in the strong-hold city of Raqqa . ISIS released a video of British journalist John Cantlie following the murder of fellow captive David Haines. UK aid worker Alan Henning has also been threatened . ‘Air power is a major component of this,’ he says. ‘But – and this is the hard truth – air power alone will not suffice. They can be hemmed in, harried and to a degree contained by air power. But they can’t be defeated by it. ‘If possible, others closer to the field of battle, with a more immediate interest, can be given the weapons and training to carry the fight – and in some cases, that will work. It may work in the case of IS. ‘I accept fully there is no appetite for ground engagement in the West. But we should not rule it out in the future if it is absolutely necessary. Provided that there is the consent of the population directly threatened and with the broadest achievable alliance, we have, on occasions, to play our part. We’re not talking about armies of occupation. We are, in certain situations where it is necessary and subject to all proper limitations, talking about committing ground forces, especially those with special capabilities.’ He warns that the roots of IS go deep into Muslim society, parts of which have an ‘innately hostile’ view of the West, and says the extent of extremist teaching in the UK and elsewhere is ‘much more frightening than you would think’. He adds: ‘The problem is not that we’re facing a fringe of crazy people, a sort of weird cult confined to a few fanatics. If it was, we could probably root it out, kill or imprison its leaders, deter its followers and close the doors to new recruits. ‘The problem is that we’re facing a spectrum of opinion based on a world view which stretches far further into parts of Muslim society.’ Selfless: Alan Henning helps at a refugee camp before he was abducted whilst delivering aid last December . British hostage Alan Henning’s wife has begged Islamic State jihadists to ‘see it in their hearts’ to release him. Barbara Henning said the 47-year-old taxi driver from Bolton had been delivering aid to Syrian children in an act of ‘sheer compassion’ when he was abducted last December. ‘Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job ... to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need,’ she said in a statement released by the Foreign Office. ‘When he was taken he was driving an ambulance full of food and water. ‘I cannot see how it could assist any state’s cause to allow the world to see a man like Alan dying ... when they hear this message, I implore the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband.’ Her heartfelt plea follows dozens of imams and other Muslim leaders calling for the release of the father of two, described as ‘a man of peace’. Even radicals such as hate preacher Abu Qatada have spoken out to condemn IS for holding Mr Henning. But British firebrand Anjem Choudary yesterday said he had no sympathy for the aid worker because, he claimed, ‘in the Koran it is not allowed for you to feel sorry for non-Muslims’. Mr Henning’s plight was revealed earlier this month at the end of an IS video showing the beheading of fellow British hostage, David Haines.","On his website he acknowledges 'no appetite' to send troops back to Iraq .

"Officer Darren Wilson, the cop who shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in August, has quietly gotten married. The 28-year-old officer, who hasn't been seen in public since the shooting, visited a St Louis County office last month to apply for a marriage license. Wilson then married Officer Barbara Spradling, 37, several days later on October 24 in front of his lawyer and a judge in Overland, Missouri. Scroll down for video . Darren Wilson, the  28-year-old Ferguson officer who shot dead unarmed teen Michael Brown, got married to fellow cop Barbara Spradling (pictured right) last month, it was revealed on Monday . Darren Wilson's marriage license to fellow Ferguson cop Barbara Spradling last month. His new bride is nine years his senior . A municipal judge performed the ceremony in Overland, Missouri. The marriage license was first published by the New York Times on Monday. Records showed that Officer Wilson and his new wife had both been married before. Wilson's divorce came through on November 10, 2013. Wilson married his first wife Ashley Brown in Old Monroe, Missouri in October 2011 but divorced last year. They had no children. The new Mr and Mrs Wilson already own a home together in Crestwood, Missouri. She had previously been named as his girlfriend prior to their wedding. The new bride also has not been seen since the August 9 shooting. Both Officer Wilson and Officer Spradling have received honors for their police work. She received a medal of valor award in 2012 for her work. Officer Wilson received a commendation earlier this year for his arrest of a suspect in a drug case. Darren Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson on August 9. A grand jury deliberating over whether Wilson should be indicted in Brown's shooting death had reached a decision on Monda. Sources told The Washington Post that press conferences are being prepared by the county prosecutors’ office and the Missouri governor and expected to come later today - but no indication of the verdict was given. Law enforcement has dispatched hundreds of police armed with grenades, enlisted 100 FBI officers and erected barricades around Buzz Wesfall Justice Center ahead of the verdict following months of unrest and angry demonstrations following the shooting.

They had no children . A group shot from Wilson's wedding in 2011. His divorce was finalized last November and he quietly married at the end of October this year . A lawyer for Michael Brown's family criticized how prosecutors have handled the grand jury process, which has dragged on longer than many expected. The attorney, Benjamin Crump, told ABC's This Week program on Sunday it was the first time in his 20 years as an attorney that a prosecutor had not recommended charges to a grand jury hearing a case. 'Why you can't come in and recommend charges right now based on the probable cause?' Crump said, a reference to witnesses who said Brown had his hands up in the air, signaling surrender, when the officer shot him. Wilson's supporters say he shot Brown in self-defense. St. Louis County prosecutors have said the grand jury's decision will be announced at a news conference, but the date, time and location remain unknown. Crump said he expected to get about six hours notice before an announcement. In anticipation of the announcement, barriers were erected over the weekend around the courthouse where the jury meets, and traffic restrictions were imposed on some nearby roads. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency and called in National Guard troops to back up police, which protesters have criticized as heavy-handed. Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told demonstrators on Saturday night they should remain peaceful whatever the grand jury decides. After a fourth straight night of low-level protests in Ferguson, Missouri, anxious residents still did not know on Sunday when a grand jury would return its decision .","The 28-year-old officer, who hasn't been seen in public since the shooting, visited a St Louis County office last month .

"Roy Hodgson and Louis van Gaal have cleared the air after Manchester United’s Dutch manager gave his blessing for Luke Shaw to be selected for England’s Under-21s. Hodgson and Van Gaal became embroiled in a spat when England’s head coach said the issue of Shaw’s fitness had been ‘mentioned’ at the World Cup finals. Van Gaal hit back by saying that Hodgson was ‘in no position’ to make such a judgment. However, Hodgson and Van Gaal have spoken extensively in recent weeks and dealt with the issue of Shaw being made available for Gareth Southgate’s Under-21 squad for the Euro 2015 play-off against Croatia. Luke Shaw's fitness was raised as a problem following his move to Manchester United in the summer . Louis van Gaal (left) and Roy Hodgson (right) were embroiled in a spat over the player, but have since made up . Hodgson and Southgate went to see Shaw , who has just returned from a hamstring problemmake his United debut in the 2-1 win over West Ham 11 days ago and Van Gaal’s felt it would be beneficial for the 18-year-old’s development — and his fitness — to be involved in two pressurised matches. Southgate said: ‘At the moment Roy would deal with Louis direct. With some of the players I’ll deal with the first team manager but in this instance, because Roy is dealing with Louis on Wayne Rooney and hopefully others that will be involved, Roy had that conversation. ‘The last time I saw Van Gaal was in a lift in Brazil during the World Cup. It broke down on the morning they were playing Chile, so we had a laugh about that — him and Patrick Kluivert, our lift got stuck between floors, thankfully for not too long! Luke Shaw has now received Louis van Gaal's blessing to play for the England U21s squad . Shaw, right, will play for Gareth Southgate's side in a Euro 2015 play-off match against Croatia . ‘But I know from the conversation that he was really positive about him coming and playing matches. It is not something we’ve just thought “we’ll make this squad as strong as we possibly can” – we are thinking about the individuals all the time and what is the right experience for them.’ Southgate, meanwhile, has moved to clarify the situation surrounding Jonjo Shelvey’s selection for the senior squad, when he had gone more than a year without playing for the Under-21s. Hodgson’s decision was met with stinging criticism from former Under-21 head coach Stuart Pearce. But Southgate said: ‘The first squad I selected last September, he was injured. In the October games, he was still carrying an injury and Swansea were in Europe. There was a lot going on because his girlfriend was pregnant so I didn’t think he was ready. ‘I had a good chat with him (when he arrived at St George’s Park) about it as obviously he’s thought “what have I walked into?” He wasn’t eligible for Toulon because of his age. Could I have called him back in? Yes I could, but I’m very big on the group and rewarding those that have done well.’ VIDEO Lallana hails Clyne inclusion .","Roy Hodgson and Louis van Gaal were embroiled in a spat when the England manager brought up the issue of Luke Shaw's fitness .

"British Muslims have greater belief in the police than the rest of the population according to new research published today. A study in the British Journal of Criminology found that six out of ten Muslims rate the police as either good or excellent, compared with 53 per cent of the non-Muslim population. Researchers analysed crime data surveys in England and Wales between 2006 and 2010. The findings were published in the British Journal of Criminology. British Muslims, such as these young women celebrating the festival of Eid in Trafalgar Square in London  have greater faith in the police than the rest of society according to new research published today . The survey also conducted 50,000 doorstep interviews, which the Home Office said provides a better indication of the true level of crime, as not all incidents are reported to police. According to the Independent, the survey also investigated the probability of Muslims being the victims of crime. However, the author of the report Julian Hargreaves of Cambridge's Centre of Islamic Studies said: 'It's often reported that Muslim individual are more likely to be at risk of violent crime than other communities. But not only is violent crime a rare occurance, it's no more likely to affect Muslims than others, such as Hindus and Sikhs.' Researchers admitted that the survey does not include attacks against property, possibly under-estimating the extent of anti-Islamic crime. The new research, affirming support in the British Muslim community for the police comes as fears grow over the number of people being radicalised by Islamic extremists. The Government has introduced a new counter-terrorism bill to combat the threat of British men and women becoming jihadists. Labour MP Khalid Mahmood believes British jihadists are being able to enter the country due to lax security . It is believed that several hundred British Muslims have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS and other extremist Islamic groups. Khalid Mahmood, MP for the Birmingham Perry Barr constituency, claimed that official figures on the numbers of British jihadis is grossly underestimating the size of the problem. UK security officials believe in the region of 500 men have travelled to Iraq and Syria, but Mr Mahmood claims this figure is widely inaccurate. He said: 'The authorities say there are 500 British jihadists but the likely figure is at least three to four times that. I think 2,000 is a better estimate. My experience in Birmingham is it is a huge, huge problem.' Mr Mahmood said: 'The Government does not have significant people at border control. The fact is these jihadists are coming in and going out without almost ever being arrested. We have had hardly any arrests. We have had people coming back in after six months in Syria and they are not being picked up.' Mr Mahmood's warning follows reports that British jihadis Abu Dharda, 20 and Abu Abdullah al Habashi, 21. The two men from London are believed to have been killed in heavy fighting in the Syrian border town of Kobane, which has been the subject of a major counter-offensive by Kurdish fighters, supported by US Air Force bombers. Al-Habashi grew up in north London in a British-Eritrean family and converted to Islam at the age of 16. He told the BBC back in August that he was one of the few British jihadists who fought with ISIS in Syria and Iraq. During the interview, he admitted that he was never going to return to Britain despite the pleas of his family. Dhardra grew up in west London and is from a British-Somali background. He entered Syria in December 2013 after crossing the Turkish border. Abu Abdullah al-Habashi, left, and Abu Dharda, right, are believed to have been killed in Kobane, Syria . Almost 30 Britons are believed to have been killed fighting for jihadist organisations although the Foreign Office confirmed that determining exact figures is incredibly difficult. A spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of two British nationals in Syria. 'The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, where all UK consular services are suspended. 'As we do not have any representation in Syria, it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British nationals there are extremely limited.'","Six out of ten Muslims rate the police as either good or excellent .

"The family of Michael Brown have said that the cop who shot him dead will 'feel the wrath of God's vengeance' after the officer claimed he was acting in self defense. Sheryl Davis, Brown's aunt, told MailOnline that she believes Darren Wilson committed murder and that he will suffer retribution in a 'mighty way'. She said that Wilson's actions were 'evil' and that he will be punished by a higher power for what he did - even if he is cleared. Anger: Sheryl Davis, left, with husband Eric, told MailOnline that Wilson will suffer retribution in a 'mighty way' Her comments are the most outspoken yet from Brown's family since Wilson's account of what happened was published in the New York Times at the weekend. The testimony - and alleged forensic evidence - has been described by experts as helpful to his defense and has provoked fresh outrage from the teenager's family and supporters. Wilson shot dead Brown, 18, on August 9, in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis in Missouri, sparking nearly two weeks of violent protests and rioting. 'Self defense': Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson says he feared for his life as he shot Michael Brown . Struggle: According to FBI analysis Brown's blood was found inside Officer Wilson's patrol car. the cop claims he wrestled with Brown in the car and was in fear of his life. But the account is disputed . Unrest has continued since then as a grand jury decides whether it will indict Wilson. A decision is expected next month. Speaking to MailOnline Davis said: 'It's murder and they will feel and see the wrath of God's vengeance come upon them in a mighty way, just as he promised all who do evil in his sight.' Wilson's account gave the first insight into what he told the grand jury during his four-hour testimony in September, a process which is held in secret. He supposedly said that Brown pushed him back into his police SUV as he was trying to get out and pinned him down. At that point Wilson reached for his gun and fired two shots, one of which hit Brown - his blood was found inside the car. The account did not explain why Wilson then shot Brown five more times in the front as, according to some witnesses, he put his hands in the air to surrender. Solidarity: Protesters are pictured here in Ferguson Monday night continuing a vigil for Michael Brown . Tensions: Police officers watch over the residents who have taken to the streets again, more than two months after the shooting . Brown's supporters are worried that Wilson is trying to exploit the law in Missouri which allows a police officer more leeway if they feel they are under threat. Wilson's account also flatly contradicts that of a number of witnesses including Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, who was standing next to him at the time. Johnson has said that Wilson was the aggressor and grabbed Brown's throat before pulling out his gun and threatening to shoot. But another witness, whose name has been withheld, has also reportedly told the grand jury that Brown did not have his hands above his head when Wilson shot him but instead they were 'out to his sides.' He also said Brown 'staggered toward Wilson despite commands to stop' and that 'the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired.' Among those who have already spoken out to attack Wilson's statement is Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Brown's family. He has said that Wilson's account should 'not be taken as gospel'. He said: 'He can say what he wants to say in front of a jury. They can listen to all the evidence and the people can have it transparent so they know that the system works for everybody. Fervent: A woman holds up a sign protesting the treatment of black people by law enforcement . Memorial: Neighbors wait by a memorial set up on Canfield Street, Ferugson - the spot where Brown was killed . 'The officer's going to say whatever he's going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid.' The Rev Al Sharpton also called it a ‘Michael Dunn defense,' referring the Florida man who was convicted of shooting dead a black teenager because he was playing music too loudly. Sharpton has said: 'It didn't work in Florida and it shouldn't work in Missouri’. Residents of Ferguson fear that violence could return to their streets if Wilson is not indicted - which is a very real possibility. The New York Times reported that, according to officials with knowledge of the grand jury hearing, the forensic evidence does appear to support Wilson's account. Another issue is the potential civil rights prosecution brought by the federal government after Attorney General Eric Holder began an FBI investigation. Condemnation: Al Sharpton on Sunday hit out at Wilson's version of events. And the Brown family lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said: 'The officer's going to say whatever he's going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid' Peter Joy, a professor at the Washington University of Law in St Louis, has told MailOnline that a charge of civil rights abuse would be a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter. He said that this is because the jury would have to be certain Wilson intended to violate Brown's civil rights by shooting him dead. He said: 'The federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse. 'There are some criminal charges that don't involve that kind of mental state, like murder. 'For example anger. They can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly, but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right.'","Officer Wilson told grand jury that he felt in fear for his life when he was attacked by Michael Brown before shooting him dead in Ferguson, Missouri .

"As one of the fastest growing cities in the world, Shanghai's mushrooming skylie should come as no surprise. Yet a cinematographer has managed to capture the Chinese city's growth with a video so stunning it makes the jaw drop. Taken from the 23rd floor of a building, producer Joe Nifas used a time-lapse video to document the surge in sky-high buildings which lends the city its futuristic look. Scroll down for video .

The inventive video shows the dramatic extent to which the landscape has changed . The two-minute long video showcases how from a sparse piece of land iconic buildings have popped up, making the district one of China's most powerful financial and commercial hubs. Mr Nafis, who has lived in the city since 2004, told the NY Daily News he wanted to convey the awe-inspiring progress of Shanghai. The 27-year-old, from California, said: 'My motivation for this video was really to show my family the view from my apartment and the things I've seen over the years.' 'They've visited once, but it's hard to grasp what it's like living in such a huge, vibrant city in only a few days.' Crumbling buildings with terracotta-coloured rooftops are demolished to make way for the unique high rise office blocks.

Smog in China’s most populated city is being blamed for a fertility crisis as the incidence of low sperm counts among its men reaches record levels. Doctors in financial capital Shanghai say air and water pollution is a ‘major culprit’ for the city’s predicament and warn that action needs to be taken urgently. ‘If we don’t protect the environment now, mankind will face a worsening infertility predicament,’ Dr Li Zheng, a sperm expert at the city’s Renji Hospital told the Shanghai Morning Post.

"The so-called Islamic State has published an interview with a Jordanian pilot captured by militants last week after he was forced to eject over northern Syria. First Lieutenant Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh bailed out near the insurgent group's de facto capital of Raqqa on Wednesday after his F-16 warplane was damaged during an airstrike. The 26-year-old is the first foreign military pilot to fall into the extremists' hands since an international coalition began its aerial campaign against IS in September. Scroll down for video . A picture published in Islamic State magazine Dabiq shows captive Jordanian pilot First Lieutenant Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh, who is the subject of a question-and-answer interview in which he says he was shot down . His interview appears as a short question-and-answer segment in the latest issue of Dabiq, Islamic State's English-language magazine. The full-colour monthly magazine, which is distributed online as a pdf document, also contains a lengthy article apparently by captive British journalist John Cantlie, as well as praise for Sydney hostage taker Man Haron Monis. Lt Kaseasbeh, who is pictured wearing an orange jumpsuit, describes how his jet was hit by anti-aircraft fire near Raqqa, which is located on the banks of the Euphrates River in northern Syria. 'We entered the region of ar-Raqqah to sweep the area, then the striker jets entered to begin their attack,' he was quoted as saying. 'My plane was struck by a heat-seeking missile. I heard and felt its hit. 'The other Jordanian pilot in the mission – the first lieutenant pilot Saddām Mardīnī – contacted me from a participating jet and told me that I was struck and that fire was coming out of the rear nozzle of my engine. 'I checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning. The plane began to deviate from its normal flight path, so I ejected. 'I landed in the Furāt River by parachute and the seat caught on some ground, keeping me fixed, until I was captured by soldiers of the Islamic State.' Islamic State fighters hold Lt Kaseasbeh after he was captured near Raqqah, Syria, last week . Elsewhere in the interview, Lt Kaseasbeh answers questions about himself and the coalition involved in airstrikes against Islamic State targets. He said his role in the mission was to destroy anti-aircraft positions and guard against any enemy jets. At the end of the short piece he is asked if knows what his fate will be at the hands of Islamic State. 'Yes,' he answers. 'They will kill me.' Praise: Sydney hostage taker Man Haron Monis was hailed for his actions in an editorial in Dabiq . Jordan's government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani said he had seen the comments but declined to comment. The U.S. has denied that IS shot down the Jordanian aircraft. The head of the U.S. military's Central Command, General Lloyd Austin, said the US will not tolerate IS's 'attempts to misrepresent or exploit this unfortunate aircraft crash for their own purposes'. The new issue of Islamic State's magazine also included a long article on global economics which goes under the byline of John Cantlie, the British journalist held hostage in Syria since November 2012. Like previous articles in Dabiq attributed to Mr Cantlie, the latest piece - headlined 'Meltdown' - appears right at the end of the magazine as its final article. It is not clear if the 43-year-old wrote the article himself or if his name was simply added to another's work, but it does appear to be written in a less-formal, more journalistic tone than others in the magazine. The article predicts the collapse of the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency and this rise of a gold-backed economic system - something Islamic State has backed by minting its own gold and silver coins. 'Nobody has discovered a better way for people to stay warm than wearing clothes. And nobody has found a more stable money than gold,' Mr Cantlie apparently wrote. Islamic State also praised the attack on a cafe and ensuing hostage crisis in Sydney, Australia, this month. Two hostages and the gunman, Man Haron Monis, were killed. Monis was a 50-year-old Iranian-born self-styled cleric with a lengthy criminal history. While holding the hostages, Monis made two demands - to be delivered an IS flag and to speak directly with Australian prime minister Tony Abbott. Islamic State's editorial sidesteps the issue of Monis's dubious morality, which included outstanding charges for more than 50 sexual offences, saying: 'The fact is ... that any allegations leveled against a person concerning their past are irrelevant as long as they hope for Allah’s mercy and sincerely repent from any previous misguidance.' IS had called on Muslims to kills disbelievers in the West, including Australia.","Lt Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh says his plane was hit by a missile over Raqqah .

'As businesspeople, when people call and say ''we want your player'', you are going to listen them. You have to do that.

"Strangers have raised tens of thousands of dollars to help two former death row inmates who spent decades in prison for a 1975 murder before being exonerated. Ricky Jackson, 57, and Wiley Bridgeman, 60, walked free from prison on Friday after a witness, who was just 12 at the time, revealed he had lied about seeing the murder in Cleveland, Ohio. The witness recanted his testimony last year, saying he had accused the men of killing a businessman following police threats. In just three days since their release, thousands of dollars in donations have been sent to fundraising pages for the two men. New life: Ricky Jackson, who was freed on Friday after nearly four decades in prison, grins as he holds his first ever cell phone on Sunday. An online fundraising page has raised nearly $30,000 for him so far . A gofundme page for Jackson had raised more than $29,000 by Monday morning, whileanother gofundme page for Bridgeman totaled more than $2,400. The pages were set up by the Ohio Innocence Project and Ohioans to Stop Executions to help the men rebuild their lives. On Jackson's page, the organizers shared a photo of him grinning while holding a cell phone on Sunday with the caption: 'Ricky with his first cell phone!' The men were convicted of murdering Harry Franks, a businessman in Cleveland, Ohio - based largely on the testimony of a 12-year-old, Eddie Vernon, who said he saw the murder. The two, along with Bridgeman's brother Ronnie, were given death sentences after Vernon testified. The death sentences were commuted to life in prison after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed capital punishment in 1978. Ronnie Bridgeman was released in 2003 for separate reasons. Free man: Ricky Jackson is pictured following his release from Cuyahoga County Jail after 39 years on Friday . Back: Wiley Bridgeman, pictured left, embraces his brother Ronnie after being freed on Friday. Ronnie, now known as Kwame Ajamu, was also convicted in the death but he was let out of prison years before him . Back together: The two brothers share a moment after Wiley, right, was allowed to walk free on Friday . He was reunited with the other two inmates Friday when they walked free from Cuyahoga County Jail after prosecutors asked that the charges be dismissed. The dramatic turnaround came after Vernon, now 52, recanted his testimony, saying that police officers coerced him into testifying and gave him details of the case. Their cases were first re-evaluated after a 2011 article in the Cleveland Scene magazine highlighted Vernon's unreliable testimony. Changing his account in 2013, he said: 'All the information was fed to me - I don't have any knowledge about what happened at the scene of the crime', Cleveland.com reported. In the initial court hearings, Vernon said he was on a bus with other schoolchildren when he heard gunshots near the a grocery store called Cut-Rite. Other children on the bus have said Vernon would not have been able to see anything from his seat - and he has since admitted that was true. Crime scene: A crime scene photograph shows the body of the man who the men were accused of killing . Victim: The three men were wrongly convicted of murdering Harry Franks, a businessman in Cleveland, Ohio . He now claims detectives talked him into testifying, then said if he claimed he was lying his parents could be put in prison for perjury. When he dismissed Jackson's case, Judge Richard McMonagle said, 'Life is filled with small victories, and this is a big one.' 'The English language doesn't even fit what I'm feeling,' Jackson said as he exited the building Friday. 'I'm on an emotional high.' Bridgeman said he never lost hope that he would be freed for good. 'You keep struggling, you keep trying,' he said. Bridgeman embraced his brother Ronnie, who changed his name to Kwame Ajamu, as he walked out of the courthouse. All he could say was that he is unsure what the future holds other than a celebratory fish dinner. Ajamu told him: 'Stick with me. You'll be all right. I ain't never going to let you go.' Jackson and his lawyers planned to celebrate  at a hotel. Asked where he was going to live, Jackson replied: 'It's ironic. For 39 years, I've had a place to stay. Now, you know, that's precarious.' Thankful: Jackson looks to the sky in court after a judge revoked his sentence on Friday afternoon . Mugshots: Jackson, left, and Birdgeman as pictured by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections . Ajamu said in an interview Thursday that the prospect of the three being together again is 'mind-boggling.' He spent his 18th birthday on death row and was in prison when his mother, a brother and a sister died. He said: 'The idea that my brother - both of those guys are my brothers - are getting out? I don't even care about me.' Vernon broke down during a court hearing for Jackson on Tuesday as he described the threats by detectives and the burden of guilt he had carried for so long. Jackson said he holds no animosity toward Vernon. 'It took a lot of courage to do what he did,' he said. 'He's been carrying a burden around for 39 years, like we have. But in the end, he came through, and I'm grateful for that.'","Ricky Jackson, 57, and Wiley Bridgeman, 60, were convicted of murdering a businessman in Cleveland, Ohio in 1975 and were put on death row .

"The FBI have found no bombs on the two Atlanta-bound planes that were guided into airports by fighter jets after threats were posted on Twitter. The Twitter user with no followers, who goes by the name KingZortic, sent a slew of warnings to Delta Airlines and Southwest Airlines, claiming to have planted explosives on flights which were due to land at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport. Bomb squads was rushed in as a result, but nothing suspicious was found on either flight. One tweet read: '@DeltaAssist I have a bomb on one of your planes, but I forgot which one when I left the airport. Can you help me find it?' Scroll down for video . Was this the threat? It is believed this is one of the tweets that prompted the FBI raid of two airplanes . Warning: The Twitter user sent a slew of warnings to Delta and Southwest on Saturday . Threats: A Delta flight and a Southwest flight reported credible bomb threats as they landed at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, on Saturday afternoon . Emergency: Passengers were escorted off the flights that landed around 3pm before bomb squads boarded . Another said: '@SouthwestAir As part of a nationwide State agreement. A bomb was placed on SWA2492. It will be detonated at a random time of my choosing...' It is believed these tweets prompted NORAD fighter jets to escort Delta flight 1156 and Southwest flight 2492 to the Atlanta, Georgia, airport. Bomb squads then rushed about the Delta flight, which came from Portland, and the Southwest flight, which flew in from Milwaukee, with canines. However after an investigation of both planes found there were no explosive devices on board. Both flights had landed by 3pm and all passengers were being ushered off as bomb squads prepared to sweep the cabins, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. FBI officials told WSBTV the passengers on both flights would be interviewed and searched before they are allowed to leave the area. After the flights were airborne, the Twitter user King Zortic, who claims to be a member of a group they title The State, bombarded Delta and Southwest with warnings. The user, who claims to be based in Chicago, wrote to Delta: 'I have a bomb on one of your planes, but I forgot which one when I left the airport. Can you help me find it? 'It was from Portland to Atlanta, I forgot the flight number, though. It was something like DL156 or DL 1556 I forgot the order. 'Oh yes, that's it. 1156, thanks. It was smuggled through one of the back entrences because the airport didn't... have much security around one of the entrences so the bomb is at the back of the plane. Everyone will know when it's detonated. 'I had one of the airport security help me because he's an old friend who now works for The State. No more information for you. 'If anything happens to me I'll make sure that more flights are targeted. I strongly suggest you don't try anything stupid.' To Southwest, the user wrote: 'Hello, I need help.

Following the FBI raid of both planes, the user tweeted: 'I'm going to get raided. Oh noeS!!' Airport spokesman Reese McCrainie would not say how the threats were received, only that, 'we believe the threats to be credible,' the Journal reported. A Southwest Airlines spokesman said: 'Due a security situation, the aircraft operating Flight 2492 was taken to a remote area of the airport where Customers and the aircraft are being rescreened. 'Our number one priority is the Safety of our Customers and People.

"David Moyes held his first press conference on Thursday after the former Manchester United boss accepted the top job at Real Sociedad. MATT LAWTON gave updates from San Sebastian. David Moyes talks on the phone as he watches Real Sociedad in training on Wednesday afternoon . Host commentator . Here's one final picture of the Scot in his new role... And that’s it. Not a single question from the floor about Manchester United. Suspect there will be when he speaks separately to the English media now. I think Moyes will be hoping his pre-match press conferences aren’t this long. 70 minutes this one. ‘I’m not sure many British coaches have been offered too many opportunities. ‘But I’ve been given an opportunity to come here and I think it’s right for me. They’ve got a bit of Britishness in this part of the world. John Toshack came here and did a brilliant job. I hope I can add to that. ‘I will add staff in time. I can’t tell you how many people want to come and work here. I can't tell you how many players want to come and work here.’ ‘I want to come here and stand on my own feet. I want to show I can work here. I need help with the people here. I will add to my staff as time goes on. But it’s easier to see what I need, make a more informed decision, once I can see what I need.’ ‘I’ve enjoyed Zubieta. There’s thing I will change. I look forward to bringing my methods. I think one of my strengths is working on the field. The one direction we have to go is up the league.’ ‘There were never any doubts but a family decision had to be taken. It was just making sure the family was supportive and everyone was looking forward to coming to live in San Sebastian. I had great support from my wife, my dad and my children.’ ‘Yes, I have had several opportunities to go back into management. But I felt I needed the break. ‘I really hope my side will show personality. A lot of flexibility and attacking options. I am a fan of football. I want to entertain. ‘But I also want to win, and in the end I care more about winning than anything else. The job here is to win.’ ‘I am planning to meet him next week. I’ve met him before when I played him in the Champions League and when I went up to watch them at Aberdeen. If he’s fine with it I’d like to meet him.’ 'I have to assess the players we have here first. But the transfer window is five or six weeks away and the president and the sporting director have said they will do all they can to help me.’ ‘I had the choice. The president gave me the opportunity. But I had a six-year contract at United and I lasted nine months. So don’t get too caught up in the length of the contract. I don’t pay much attention to that.’ 'Probably more Mourinho. I’m tough with them, I work hard. I had 11 great years at Everton and I took over a club very similar to this and we grew it and got better and better. I’m hoping I can do exact the same here and all the vibes, all the messages, say I can.’ So far so good for Moyes here. Saying all the right things. ‘It’s got a great history. It's one of the big clubs. I want to work at a big club. I want to get success. It’s a chance to work with the good people here but I also think it’s a good team. 'The attraction was the club, the team, and the opportunity to work in such a great country in a great league.’ 'Mikel Arteta told me I was a lucky man coming to a beautiful city and a great football club. He spoke very highly about the academy. He was very positive about the club.’ ‘I see the players being better than what they are showing at this time. I think there’s more they can give. The first objective is to avoid relegation but my expectations are high and I want a winning team.’ ‘Me and the president have had some long conversations. But I had to be sure I was climbing to a club with ambition, because I want to win. We’ve only won two games this season but hopefully we can improve on that. I see great morale among the players since I’ve been here and I think I have been lifted by the result they had last Sunday.’ We are now hearing a run of questions for the club's president, with the translator whispering what is being said in the new manager’s left ear. ‘I knew a lot about Real Sociedad from a long time back. I came here in 1982/83. I was with Celtic when we played Real Sociedad. I know all about the club, about the city. I also went to see La Real in Aberdeen when they qualified for the Europa League. I’m looking forward to getting stuck right into the job. I feel the job fits my character.’ ‘Real have had a great history of having British managers. John Toshack and Chris Coleman. And some of the greatest British managers have come and worked in La Liga. Bobby Robson and Terry Venables. I’m not putting myself at their level but this is an opportunity to test myself against the best and hopefully I can do well here.’ 'La Liga has overtaken the Premier League because of the quality of the teams getting regularly into the latter stages of the Champions League.’ 'You know it's not my style.' 'I never had any doubt. I had several offers to manage in the Premier League. I spoke to several clubs in other leagues. But the only club that pulled me was Sociedad.' 'I'm well rested I've had six months off, I'm ready.' 'It was a big ambition of mine to manage abroad. To be completely fulfilled as a coach you need to try all the cultures.' 'What convinced me was the (club's) president. He was fantastically passionate about his club: how special it is, his love for the club pulled me.' Carlos Vela - sound familiar? Estaban Granero - ever heard of him? Moyes will have two former Premier League players to take charge of in the form of the one-time Arsenal and QPR players. CLICK HERE for more on the players in Sociedad's squad. Fair play to Real Sociedad. They’ve found an Australian chap to translate Moyes from English to Basque and then Spanish, and everyone else from Basque, to Spanish and then English. At least I think that’s what’s happening. The poor chap just asked us if there’s a distinction between ‘head coach’ and ‘manager’. (Er, looks like this could get rather complicated...) ... we'll be hearing from Mr Moyes live in the next few minutes. There is a genuine sense of excitement here. A feeling that they have landed a seriously big fish for their modest football club. This morning the local paper devoted 10 pages to Moyes, including an interview with John Aldridge. Comments from my good self were rather less prominent, it has to be said. After arriving at the club's Zubieta training ground on Wednesday, Moyes ran the rule over his new players, and was spotted talking on the phone while wearing a big grin. Hello, is that Marouane...? Moyes had better get used to smaller crowds: While Old Trafford holds a mighty 75,000 supporters, Sociedad's Anoeta Stadium has a capacity of 32,000 and last season's average attendance was around 22,500.

Conference room filling up here but reports of 100 English journalists something of an exaggeration. I count seven. For Moyes it is that the Sociedad hierarchy have asked their new manager to mould the club in the image of Everton: a tough, streetwise team built on a base of young players and barqain buys. CLICK HERE to read more from our chief sports reporter MATT LAWTON on the task facing Real's new boss in this beautiful corner of Spain. When Moyes was sacked by Manchester United just seven months ago, did you anticipate that his next job would be in La Liga? Not at a high-flying club either - a struggling club from the Basque country, where money is tight and the squad is reliant on youth players. It's quite a challenge facing Moyes - although his track record at Preston and Everton shows it may be a situation that suits the 51-year-old down to the ground. You might be more familiar with the usual greeting of 'hola' in Spain but in the Basque country the above means hello.

Ronaldo may have missed out on a nomination from Hodgson but did receive one from England captain Wayne Rooney who awarded his former Manchester United team-mate his first vote. Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos, signed from Bayern Munich in the summer, has impressed the Manchester United skipper enough to take second place in the vote with Gareth Bale  third in Rooney's picks.

"The evidence heard by the grand jury deliberating over the shooting death of Michael Brown could be kept secret, it has emerged, as the panel prepares to convene to discuss the case further. The jury, which is deciding whether to indict officer Darren Wilson for fatally shooting the unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson on August 9, is expected to deliver a verdict on Monday morning. If they choose to indict Wilson, who is white, the testimonies, documents and photos presented to them will not be released to the public because they will be used during the subsequent trial. However, several weeks ago, St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said that if there is no indictment, the judge has agreed that the evidence in the case will be made public.

Shooting: The jury, which is deciding whether to indict officer Darren Wilson (right) for fatally shooting the black 18-year-old (left) in Ferguson, St Louis, on August 9, is expected to deliver a verdict on Monday morning . But on Sunday night, a contradictory statement was released, saying St Louis County Circuit Judge Carolyn Whittington has entered no such order or made no such agreement. In the statement, sent to KSDK-TV, the county's director of judicial administration, Paul Fox, said Judge Whittington must analyze the records before she can approve their release. He added that this cannot be done until the grand jury of seven men and five women has heard all of the evidence in the case of Brown, whose Missouri death made headlines across the world. The statement is in stark contrast to Mr McCulloch's earlier comments that 'If there is not an indictment returned... [the judge] has agreed, that the records will be made public.'

Brown's shooting in August sparked violent protests across Ferguson, Missouri and nationwide - and the conflicted suburb of St Louis is anticipating further outcry on Monday morning. On Sunday, as protesters took to the streets of Ferguson, a woman accidentally shot herself in the head with a gun bought for protection from the demonstrations, according to reports. The 26-year-old, named in a police report as Becca Campbell, was holding the gun in her boyfriend's car when he unintentionally rear-ended another vehicle, a police report said.

Campaigning: Protesters march shouting slogans (right) and carrying signs (left) through St Louis on Sunday . It caused the gun to go off, hitting Miss Campbell, who died hours later in hospital. Last night, a lawyer for Brown slammed the grand jury process as 'unfair', saying that because of the procedure, officer Wilson could completely avoid trial. 'I have no doubt if they were to indict the police officer, he would be guaranteed his full constitutional rights of innocent until proven guilty,' attorney Benjamin Crump told ABC News . 'He would get every benefit of the doubt. I don't worry about the due process for officer Wilson. I worry about the due process for the little black boy dead on the ground. 'The process is completely unfair.' Following evidence from Wilson, forensic pathologists and witnesses, the panel will have to decide whether the officer intentionally violated Brown's civil rights by fatally shooting him. Last month, legal experts told MailOnline the charge is more complex and difficult to prove than a murder or manslaughter charge. Peter Joy, a professor at the Washington University of Law in St Louis, said the charge of civil rights abuse is a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter, as the 12 jury members will have to be certain Wilson intended to violate Brown's civil rights by shooting him dead. 'The civil rights abuses are even harder to prove than an underlying criminal conviction. The federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse,' he said. 'Racism': Protesters accuse the county police of creating a racial divide in the majority black suburb . Devastated: Daily tributes are paid to shrines for Michael Brown who allegedly had his hands up when he died . 'There are some criminal charges that don't involve that kind of mental state, like murder.For example, anger. They can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly, but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right.' As a result, he said, they will need forensic evidence of damage to the car to disprove Wilson's account if they are to find him guilty. Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden has urged protesters to refrain from violence, while President Obama has called for calm. Obama added that he has not ruled out a trip to Ferguson following the release of the jury's verdict.","Grand jury is preparing to convene on Monday in Brown shooting case .

"Cristiano Ronaldo has explained the strange noise he made during his acceptance speech after winning the 2014 Ballon d'Or. He said it was a celebration that he often performs with his team-mates at Real Madrid. The scream did not take long to go viral and sparked intrigue about the media. National and global press had been trying to work out the forward's motives behind the noise, while several parody videos and memes had also started to appear on social networking sites. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates winning the Ballon d'Or for the second consecutive year with a loud scream . But Spanish journalist Guillem Balague was already clued up. He said on Twitter, 'In case you wondered, Ronaldo's war cry is Siiiiiii. Yeeees. I know it doesn't sound like that but that's what he says he shouts.' Ronaldo himself then confirmed to Spanish television station Cuarto that the noise was part of a Real Madrid celebration. He said, 'The scream? The players know I always do that shout when I score a goal or when we win - it's our team shout.' Spanish sports newspaper MARCA leads with 'I kiss, I cry and I shout' after Ronaldo wins the Ballon d'Or . Portuguese magazine Abola says Ronaldo's rallying cry means he is now looking to match Lionel Messi . The Portuguese forward was crowned the best player in the world for the third time in his career, and for the second consecutive year. Ronaldo was presented with the award at a ceremony held in Zurich on Monday evening after he received 37.66 per cent of the vote, finishing ahead of Barcelona's Lionel Messi (15.76 per cent) and Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer (15.72 per cent). Ronaldo defended his world player of the year status convincingly with 37.66 per cent of all votes . Ronaldo has scored 285 goals in 275 games for Real Madrid since joining from Manchester United in 2009 .

"Prince Charles’s coronation service should be opened with a reading from the Koran, a senior Church of England bishop said yesterday . Prince Charles’s coronation service should be opened with a reading from the Koran, a senior Church of England bishop said yesterday. The gesture would be a ‘creative act of accommodation’ to make Muslims feel ‘embraced’ by the nation, Lord Harries of Pentregarth said. But critics attacked the idea, accusing the Church of ‘losing confidence’ in its own institutions and traditions. Lord Harries, a former Bishop of Oxford and a leading CofE liberal thinker, said he was sure Charles’s coronation would give scope to leaders of non-Christian religions to give their blessing to the new King. The former Bishop of Oxford, who continues to serve as an assistant bishop in the diocese of Southwark, made the suggestion about the Koran during a House of Lords debate. He told peers the Church of England should take the lead in ‘exercising its historic position in a hospitable way’. He said that at a civic service in Bristol Cathedral last year authorities had agreed to a reading of the opening passage of the Koran before the beginning of the Christian ritual. He said: ‘It was a brilliant creative act of accommodation that made the Muslim high sheriff feel, as she said, warmly embraced but did not alienate the core congregation. ‘That principle of hospitality can and should be reflected in many public ceremonies, including the next coronation service.’ Lord Harries’ suggestion comes more than 20 years after the Prince first said he would prefer to be seen as ‘Defender of Faith’ rather than be known by the monarch’s title of ‘Defender of the Faith’. Charles said in 1994 he ‘always felt the Catholic subjects of the sovereign are equally as important as the Anglican ones, as the Protestant ones’. ‘Likewise, I think that Islamic subjects, or the Hindu subjects, or the Zoroastrian subjects of the sovereign, are of equal and vital importance.’ In 2006 the Prince made known that he wanted a multifaith coronation that would be more ‘focused and telecentric’ than his mother’s in 1953. However traditionalist Christians condemned Lord Harries’s idea. Lord Harries said the gesture would be a ‘creative act of accommodation’ to make Muslims feel ‘embraced’ by the nation . Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute think-tank said: ‘Most people will be amazed at the idea that a Christian leader would consider the use of the Koran at a Christian service in a Christian abbey. People are just so disappointed when senior Church of England figures lose confidence in the claims of the Christian faith.’ Andrea Minichiello Williams, a member of the CofE’s parliament, the General Synod, and head of the Christian Concern pressure group, said: ‘At a time when we are looking at what British values mean, we cannot have values in a vacuum. British values stem from our Christian heritage. ‘We cannot pretend all religions are the same, or have the same benefits and outcomes for the nation.’ Douglas Murray, associate editor of the Spectator, said if Muslims were included in the coronation service, there must be room to for Hindus, Sikhs, and atheists. He added: ‘If there were to be a reading from the Koran at the coronation, surely as a matter of reciprocity, all mosques in the UK should have prayers for the King and the Armed Forces every week at Friday prayers.’","Lord Harries said gesture would be a ‘creative act of accommodation’

"Adnan Januzaj admits he is struggling to fit into Louis van Gaal’s new formation this season. The Belgium international - left out of Manchester United’s squad for the FA Cup replay against Cambridge United on Tuesday - has made just six starts under the Dutchman and was linked with loan moves to Paris Saint-Germain and Everton in the transfer window. Januzaj looked to be getting back to his best form after playing the last two games, and impressed on his first Premier League start for nearly three months against Leicester City on Saturday. Adnan Januzaj admits he is struggling to fit into Louis van Gaal’s new formation this season . Januzaj was one of the shining lights of the David Moyes era and was rewarded with a five-year deal . However, Van Gaal has warned that he has to make the most of his undoubted potential and could not even find a place for the teenager on the bench for the fourth round replay. Van Gaal has largely favoured the use of wing-backs and a midfield diamond since arriving at Old Trafford, which is not ideal for his wider attacking players. Januzaj played on the left side of the diamond in the win over Leicester but admits that he prefers the No.10 role or winger. ‘The system really can make it more difficult for me to play there but I have to keep working,’ he said. ‘That is what I am doing in training every day, as I want to get more games this season. But under Louis van Gaal the Belgium international has started just six games . Januzaj looks to be getting back to his best form after playing the last two games . ‘My favourite position is as a No 10 or a winger. There are lots of players here and I can play in different roles – it’s just a case of taking my opportunities. ‘I’m not really a wing-back. It’s harder for me because there is more defending involved and I’m not really a defender.’ Januzaj was one of the shining lights of the David Moyes era and was rewarded with a five-year deal worth £30,000-a-week. However he has faded dramatically this season and few would have been surprised to see him go out on loan. He added: ‘Of course, last year I played a lot of games and every week I was feeling better and better. I’ve not been playing a lot this year but it’s okay I will try to work hard in training and out on the pitch.’","Adnan Januzaj was one of Manchester United's best players last season .

"Middle class taxpayers earning an average annual salary of £50,000 will pay twice as much in welfare contributions over the course of their career than they will to health care. Professionals earning £50,000 over a 43-year career will contribute £219,039 to the Treasury's welfare and pension budget but just £109, 821 to the NHS. But they have just a small chance of seeing any return for their welfare payments. Contributions: The average tax payment to different Treasury budgets based on an average annual salary of £50,000 . Breakdown: HMRC will send every taxpayer details of exactly where their annual tax payments go next year . According to the Government's own state pension calculator, a worker who is 30 today will not receive pension payments until they are 68. So, a 30-year-old who will earn an average annual salary of £50,000 will have to live to the age of 106 to become a net beneficiary. Earners on the same wage will also contribute more than £80,000 to the education budget, pay off more than £42,000 of the national debt, and put more than £35,000 into the UK defence budget. Transparency: Treasury Minister David Gauke has welcomed Treasury plans to send all taxpayers a breakdown of where their contributions go . A higher earner on an average wage of £100,000 will contribute £550,000 to welfare and only £274,168, according to the Daily Telegraph. The Treasury is preparing to send all taxpayers a breakdown of where their annual tax contributions end up next year. The figures were compiled by the newspaper using figures from HM Revenue & Customs that show how much of a person's income tax and National Insurance contributions go towards each of 13 different state budgets. Figures do not include indirect taxes such as VAT. Those who earned £50,000 in 2012-13 will have paid £14,032 in national insurance and income tax. More than £5,000 of that will have been paid into the welfare budget compared to just £2,554 on the NHS. Treasury minister David Gauke has welcomed plans to send taxpayers a breakdown of how their hard earned money is spent. He told the DailyTelegraph: 'It is quite right that people know how much tax they pay and what it is spent on. 'From 2014, the new personalised tax statements will make the system even clearer and more transparent.' But there is fear that rather than justifying the Conservatives arguments to cap benefit payments, the figures will only serve to anger the middle classes.

"Latvia has warned the Swedish hunt for a Russian submarine spotting in its water could become a security 'game changer'. The Swedish military today began their fifth day of searchers, after yesterday closing off waters and airspace off Stockholm and widening their search area from 30 miles to 45 miles southeast of the capital. Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics wrote on Twitter: 'Closely following events in the Swedish territorial waters, may become a game changer of the security in the whole Baltic Sea region.' Scroll down for video . Latvia has warned the Swedish hunt for a Russian submarine spotting in its water could become a security 'game changer' in the Baltic sea . The Swedish military today began their fifth day of searchers, after yesterday closing off waters and airspace off Stockholm and widening their search area from 30 miles to 45 miles southeast of the capital . Sweden's biggest submarine hunt since the Cold War has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge . The military released a picture on Sunday showing a partially submerged vessel near Stockholm . Sweden's biggest submarine hunt since the dying days of the Soviet Union has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge. The events in the past days have sparked alarm across the Baltic Sea in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — three small former Soviet republics already spooked by Russia's intervention in Ukraine. Estonia stepped up surveillance of its territorial waters, with the border guard looking out for 'potential anomalies,' spokesman Priit Parkna said. Lithuanians were concerned over the safety of a floating natural gas import terminal currently being transported on the Baltic Sea to the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda. The terminal will be key to Lithuania's plans to reduce its reliance on Russian energy. Yesterday the military confirmed it has made three sightings - two on Friday, and one on Sunday - of foreign undersea activity and it was revealed they were also investigating reports of a mysterious man seen with a backpack wading into the sea. One theory was that an experimental Russian mini-sub called the Triton NN had got into trouble on a spy mission in Swedish waters. The Triton-NN - developed around six years ago - has been called 'the synthesis of high-speed boat and underwater vehicle'. Yesterday the military confirmed it has made three sightings - two on Friday, and one on Sunday - of foreign undersea activity and  revealed they were also investigating reports of a mysterious man seen with a backpack . It is a 'submersible boat' capable of landing personnel on enemy beaches or depositing divers in key locations. On Sunday the military also released a grainy picture showing a partially submerged object, believed to be the 'foreign vessel' in the Stockholm Arcipelago. As their hunt intensified yesterday, Russian authorities who have denied any involvement, instead pointed the finger at the Dutch. They quickly denied the allegation. Meanwhile, Russian media suggested the Swedes were overreacting. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper even speculated that the submarine hunt could be a ploy by the Swedish military to boost its defense budget, which has undergone a series of cuts since the Cold War. The official government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta questioned whether there was any submarine at all, noting the Swedes hadn't found anything. 'Either Sweden's echo location equipment is working badly or, as the old saying goes, the eyes of fear see danger everywhere,' the paper said. Military spokesman Jesper Tengroth said more than 200 personnel were involved in the operation, but stressed that unlike Sweden's submarine hunts in the 1980s, the military wasn't using depth charges or other anti-submarine weapons. Speculating on whether the suspected underwater intruder was linked to a mother ship, Swedish media zeroed in on an oil tanker owned by Russian company Novoship, which had been circling near Swedish waters. As the Swedish military's hunt intensified, Russian authorities who have denied any involvement, yesterday pointed the finger at the Dutch. They quickly denied the allegation . The submarine scare in Sweden comes after a string of border incidents involving Russian forces that Western analysts say signal Moscow's growing assertiveness in the Baltic Sea region . In a statement yesterday, Novoship President Yuri Tsvetkov said he was 'flattered' by the attention but said the ship was charted for transporting oil from Russia to the U.S. and was drifting on standby awaiting loading orders. The submarine scare in Sweden comes after a string of border incidents involving Russian forces that Western analysts say signal Moscow's growing assertiveness in the Baltic Sea region. Finland's Environment Institute said last week that Russian military ships had twice intercepted one of its research vessels in international waters. On September 5 an Estonian security service officer was detained on the Russian border — Estonia and Russia disagree on which side of it — and is still in custody in Moscow. Both Sweden and Finland, which are not NATO members, have reported airspace violations by Russian military aircraft in the past two months. Even when they stay in international airspace, Russian aircraft are conducting more ambitious maneuvers than at any point since the end of the Cold War, Western analysts say. During Easter last year, Russian warplanes exercising over the Baltic Sea appeared to simulate attacks on targets in Sweden, embarrassing the Swedish Air Force which didn't have any jets on standby. 'These are aggressive attack drills where they make a clear statement to their neighbors,' said strategic analyst Magnus Christiansson of the Swedish National Defense College. NATO says Russian airborne military activity in the Baltic region so far this year is two-and-a-half times higher than last year, and the alliance has boosted its own air patrols over tiny members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. However, a submarine sneaking into another country's territorial waters would be much more serious than muscle-flexing maneuvers in the air, Christiansson said. 'To have military forces operating secretly on another country's territory, that's something different,' he said. 'It is a hostile act.'","Latvian foreign minister warns hunt will shake-up security in Baltic Sea .

"Microsoft Corp worked closely with U.S. intelligence services to help them intercept users' communications, including letting the National Security Agency circumvent email encryption, the Guardian reported on Thursday. Citing top-secret documents provided by former U.S. spy contractor Edward Snowden, the UK newspaper said Microsoft worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the NSA to ease access via Prism - an intelligence-gathering program uncovered by the Guardian last month - to its cloud storage service SkyDrive. Microsoft also helped the Prism program collect video and audio of conversations conducted via Skype, Microsoft's online chat service, the newspaper added. Revelations: Microsoft Corp worked closely with U.S. intelligence services to help them intercept users' communications, including letting the National Security Agency circumvent email encryption . Microsoft had previously said it did not provide the NSA direct access to users' information. On Thursday, it repeated that it provides customer data only in response to lawful government requests. 'To be clear, Microsoft does not provide any government with blanket or direct access to SkyDrive, Outlook.com, Skype or any Microsoft product,' the company said in a statement on its website. Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Microsoft had all publicly urged U.S. authorities to allow them to reveal the number and scope of the surveillance requests after documents leaked to the Washington Post and the Guardian suggested they had given the government 'direct access' to their computers as part of the NSA's Prism program. The disclosures have triggered widespread concern and congressional hearings about the scope and extent of the information-gathering. Microsoft also helped the Prism program collect video and audio of conversations conducted via Skype, according to files provided by former NSA security contractor Edward Snowden . Among the revelations from The Guardian are: . • Microsoft helped the NSA to circumvent its encryption to address concerns that the agency would be unable to intercept web chats on the new Outlook.com portal; . • The agency already had pre-encryption stage access to email on Outlook.com, including Hotmail; . • The company worked with the FBI this year to allow the NSA easier access via Prism to its cloud storage service SkyDrive, which now has more than 250 million users worldwide; . • Microsoft also worked with the FBI's Data Intercept Unit to 'understand' potential issues with a feature in Outlook.com that allows users to create email aliases; . • In July last year, nine months after Microsoft bought Skype, the NSA boasted that a new capability had tripled the amount of Skype video calls being collected through Prism; . • Material collected through Prism is routinely shared with the FBI and CIA, with one NSA document describing the program as a 'team sport'.","Microsoft helped NSA access data on its cloud storage service SkyDrive, according to a report in The Guardian .

"There was a bookies on Barking Road, behind which sits the Boleyn Ground, who offered the keys to the shop if West Ham beat Manchester City 7-0 and Joe Cole scored the opener last season. After they were thrashed 6-0 in the first leg of their Capital One Cup tie, the return fixture became more of a joke than a serious match. It was not just those two games, the second of which they still lost 3-0, where West Ham struggled against City. Diafra Sakho has been superb for West Ham since his arrival in the summer . Alex Song (left) has added resilience to West Ham's midfield since joining on loan from Barcelona . The head-to-head between the pair during last campaign makes painful reading for West Hams fans; played four, conceded 14, scored just one goal. But this season there will be a very different feel to the game when West Ham host the  Premier League champions in the early kick-off on Saturday. For a start, West Ham are fourth in the table after a scintillating, if somewhat surprising, start. Over the summer they added Alex Song to their central midfield on loan from Barcelona where he played, albeit infrequently, and trained every day with the likes of Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Xavi. Their two attacking summer signings have swiftly created a formidable force up front, where in the past they lacked strikers, especially in the absence of Andy Carroll. Diafra Sakho, signed from Boulogne for £3.5million, has scored in six successive games while Enner Valencia, who cost £12m from Mexican side Pachuca, has netted twice. Last campaign, West Ham's highest scorer, Kevin Nolan, finished the season with seven. 'We've got a different team and a different set of players,' manager Sam Allardyce said ahead of this weekend's match. 'Everyone still talks about the semi-final of the Capital One Cup, but there was little we could do with the injuries we had.' Manchester City scored 14 goals and conceded just once in four meetings with West Ham last season . Alvaro Negredo scored five times over two legs as Man City thumped West Ham 9-0 on aggregate . City manager Manuel Pellegrini would surely have preferred not to play a lunch-time league match after flying more than 3,000 miles to Russia and back for their Champions League tie against CSKA Moscow on Tuesday night. In the freezing temperature, and strange environment of a Khimki Arena stadium supposedly closed to fans by UEFA but with a few hundred home supporters gaining access, City threw away a two-goal lead late on to make the journey back to Manchester a far more sombre trip. West Ham are by no means getting carried away with their league position – players and the manager openly admit they are under no illusions they will finish in the top four. But Allardyce has spotted a chink in City's armour and has a front two at his disposal who together create, on current form, one of the most lethal weapons in the league. 'If we're going to challenge against them it's this moment in time,' he added. 'City have just come back from playing in the Champions League and we're in good, confident form. 'It's about the players going out and producing their top level, playing like they did versus Liverpool and nullifying their outstanding attacking force, which is a lot better than Liverpool's. 'Can we keep it quiet? If we can, they've concede a goal or two. Our approach is we must contain that very talented forward line.' Sam Allardyce has led West Ham to fourth in the Premier League after 13 points from eight games . City boss Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping they can repeat the form they showed over the Hammers last year . The 'goals against' column from their head-to-head last year would suggest not, but Alvaro Negredo scored five of those 14 and he has been loaned to Valencia. David Silva scored one and Sergio Aguero bagged two as City tore them to pieces in the league at the Boleyn Ground. And it is stopping the Argentina striker, who has put his injury problems behind him to score eight times in the past five games, including four against Tottenham last season, that Allardyce sees as the key to winning the match. 'You saw a fully fit Aguero last week against Spurs,' he explained. 'Not only scoring four but he missed a penalty as well. Sometimes he's unstoppable. 'We've got to focus on limiting service to him. The lads in front of defence can make life difficult. That's the key element to keeping him quiet. 'Even being marked he can receive the ball and wriggle free and is a fantastic finisher.' The odds of Aguero scoring first in this encounter will be slim, but West Ham will certainly not be odds-on to lose this time.","West Ham conceded 14 goals in four games against Man City last season .

"A Melbourne man accused of funding terrorism has been refused bail after he allegedly told police he did not believe he had committed a crime and sent money to 'protect his brothers and sisters'. Hassan El Sabsabi, 23, is charged with sending $16,000 in 11 installments to an unnamed individual overseas to fund their travels  to Syria and Turkey. El Sabsabi was arrested at his Seabrook home in police raids in September, and had been under observation for eight months when AFP officers were tipped off by an international law enforcement agency that he was allegedly sending money to an American fighter in Syria. Police are reported to have tracked El Sabsabi's communication with the man through Skype and Facebook, but he maintains that he does not believe he did anything wrong. Scroll down for video . Pictured: Hassan El Sabsabi, age 23. The man was arrested in Seabrook on Tuesday morning following terror raids across five suburbs in Melbourne - Seabrook, Meadow Heights, Flemington, Kealba and Broadmeadows . The 23-year-old Seabrook man appeared at the the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday afternoon . He allegedly told police 'for me it is not a crime', the court heard, and said 'I give this person money because I see him defending my innocent brothers and sisters.' The 23-year-old was charged with six counts of intentionally making funds available to a terrorist organisation, but El Sabsabi's lawyer Rob Stary said that he would 'hotly' contest the charges. Prosecutor Krista Breckweg said that El Sabsabi was driven by strong ideologies, opposing bail on the grounds that he could reoffend if bailed. 'He's willing to put his life at risk for his beliefs, so strong are they,' Ms Breckweg told the Melbourne Magistrates Court. 'The applicant is motivated strongly by ideology and has expressed support for organisations which adopt a radical interpretation of Islam.' Magistrate Lance Martin agreed and refused El Sabsabi bail, saying the risk of him reoffending or fleeing Australia if given bail was unacceptable. Ms Breckwig said that telephone intercepts had picked up El Sabsabi expressing support for the group Islamic State and expressing his interest in travelling to Syria. Around 25,000 pages from social media accounts and 500 telephone calls and messages will have to be analysed as part of the case against the accused, the court heard in an earlier sitting. El Sabsabi's uncle Ali Elbob told the hearing he was prepared to put up a substantial surety for his nephew, who would also report daily to police if bailed. He is facing seven charges of providing funds to a terrorist organisation, which carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in jail. 'A substantial amount of material will be sourced from overseas,' Prosecutor Andrew Doyle told the court in early October. Federal police officers question members of the public outside a house as part of  raids in Seabrook . Federal police officers investigate a Seabrook home as members of the public look on . El Sabsabi's lawyer Trieu Huynh asked for his client to be transferred from the Melbourne Custody Centre to the Melbourne Assessment Prison as soon as possible. He is due to reappear on February 3. 'Given the nature of the charges (and) it's his first time in custody, it's extremely onerous on him,' he said. He also asked for a doctor to examine his client as soon as possible for his medical conditions, which Mr Huynh said he would not outline in open court. Last month El Sabsabi leapt to the defence of the Islamic State in social media posts and labelled a story reporting the beheading death of U.S. journalist James Foley as ‘lies’. ‘(You) can never judge the actions of an individual based on a whole group,’ he said. ‘Second, how do you know this wasn’t a soldier, the mujahideen are out there doing what no one has the courage to do it is them against the world.’ El Sabsabi is a Facebook fan of controversial Perth preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne, as well as a page condemning the death of a 16-year-old U.S. citizen in a drone strike in Yemen. He had posted an image which said 'Aussie and bloody proud of it!' as his cover photo last month. In a post last month, El Sabsabi also said the media was filled with ‘lied and deception… a weapon used for hate and destruction’. One neighbour, Herve Du Buisson Perrine, 71, described El Sabsabi as a ‘very friendly’ man in an interview with The Australian. ‘I speak to him almost every day,’ the newspaper quoted Mr Du Buisson Perrine saying. ‘He likes gardening. I like gardening. I’ve given him advice about his lemon trees.’ ‘He’s a very friendly, very nice guy.’ Neighbour Sandeep Singh, 32, saw the man arrested and taken away in a car. A neighbour said the arrested man moved into the Seabrook residence with his wife in December . 'I've seen him but never spoken to him,' Mr Singh told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was alright, says hello and that's it.' Mr Singh said it was 'a bit scary' to see counter terrorism activity on his street. Police said the joint Australian Federal Police and Victoria Police counter terrorism raids in Seabrook, Meadow Heights, Flemington, Kealba and Broadmeadows on Tuesday morning were not related to last week's incident in Endeavour Hills in which an alleged terror suspect was shot dead. Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said police took action because they believed more money was about to be sent to the US citizen, who has been fighting in Syria for several months. 'We are of the view that further funds were about to be transferred to this person in Syria, so today was about an overt action to resolve this matter,' he said. In parliament Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australians who fund terrorists are complicit in their 'dreadful deeds'. Mr Abbott said the anti-money laundering agency Austrac had been given an extra $20 million to help track down terrorist funding. Federal cabinet has yet to give final approval for a combat mission in Iraq to fight Islamic State. But Mr Abbott said that subject to cabinet consideration 'our objective is to support governments that don't commit genocide against their own people, nor allow their territory to support terrorism against our people'. ASIO will brief state and territory attorneys-general and police ministers at a meeting in Geelong on Friday on the national security threat. Australian Federal Police officers will also brief the meeting on recent raids. Assistant Commissioner Gaughan said  police executed  six more search warrants at residences outside Seabrook to gain evidence in relation to the charges against the man. 'There is no suggestion at this stage that those people were involved in any criminality,' he said. The searches that were conducted were done 'in a far more low-key manner' than other recent terror raids in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Graham Ashton said. 'This is a terrorism financing case, we didn't assess there being a significant community safety risk or a significant risk to our officers,' he said. The 23-year-old man was arrested on Point Cook Road opposite Seabrook Primary School. Victorian Premier Denis Napthine said he was briefed by police as Tuesday's raids started and was told they were part of a long-running and ongoing counter-terrorism operation. 'They are not about a specific threat or there is certainly no immediate concern for public safety,' Dr Napthine told 3AW. More than 100 police officers executed seven search warrants across Melbourne at 6.45am on Tuesday . There is no intelligence to indicate the man was planning a terrorist attack and police believe he acted alone . The premier also urged the community to be tolerant and come together at this time, and said law enforcement was 'ahead of the game' in combating the risk of terrorism. 'It's a sad situation that we now face, but we can have confidence in the work of ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the VicPol. They do a terrific job,' Dr Napthine said. This comes after the two police officers stabbed last week before the fatal shooting of an alleged terrorist at Endeavour Hills  released a statement. 'We would like to thank our family, friends, colleagues and everyone who has helped and supported us through this difficult time,' they said. 'We are both holding up well and appreciate everyone's kind thoughts and well wishes. We ask that our privacy is respected while we continue to recover.' Police fatally shot Numan Haider outside the Endeavour Hills police station where it was arranged they would meet the 18-year-old after conducting raids on his home Tuesday morning. It was agreed that Haider would greet a Victoria Police senior constable and a 43-year-old AFP officer cordially on Tuesday night. Seconds after meeting the 18-year-old he took out a weapon and repeatedly stabbed both officers. He was then killed by a single shot. On Tuesday, Deputy Commissioner Ashton said Haider's family received death threats in the days after his death, which was concerning. He stressed Haider's family had nothing to do with the incident involving the 18-year-old. 'Family, particularly the parents of the young man, received death threats over the weekend,' he told reporters. This is an innocent family. 'I think the fact they received those deaths threats last week is very disappointing.'

"President Barack Obama pleaded quietly for calm in Ferguson, Missouri on Monday night, speaking from the White House as rioters overtook streets in the St. Louis suburb and cable TV broadcasts showed them setting fires and attacking police cars. After members of a grand jury determined that police officer Darren Wilson will not face criminal charges related to the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown on August 9, peaceful protests spiraled out of control. Obama spoke to the nation a half-hour later. The president said anger is an 'understandable reaction' from people who believe 'the law is being applied in a discriminatory fashion,' a reference to Wilson being white and Brown being black. 'What we need to do is try to understand them,' Obama said. Scroll down for video . 'There is no excuse for violence,' President Obama said Monday night just minutes after news broke that Officer Wilson was not indicted over the killing of Michael Brown . And referring to a growing feeling of distrust between urban blacks and mostly white police forces, he warned that healing the rift 'won't be done by smashing car windows. That won't be done by using this as an excuse to vandalize property. It certainly won't be done by hurting anybody.' 'There is no excuse for violence,' he said. 'Those who are only interested in violence and just want the problem to go away should realize that we have work to do here.' As the president spoke, cable news channels broadcast split-screen views of an imperturbable Obama on one side and angry reactions on the other. In one shot, dozens of protesters were seen trying to overturn a squad car not far from police headquarters. Thy dispersed only when tear gas canisters erupted. Contrast: 'No drama Obama' pleaded for calm while riots erupted in Ferguson . Calm: The taciturn president told the nation that violence won't solve problems, while split-screens showed the streets of Ferguson exploding into pandemonium . Study in contrast: 'No drama Obama' pleaded for calm while riots erupted in Ferguson . Meanwhile: As Obama spoke, protesters began gathering outside the White House to denounce 'racist police terror .

Power to the people: A protester shouts slogans during clashes with riot police in Ferguson . City on fire: A police car burns outside the  Ferguson Police Department on Monday night . Rioting: Police take cover during clashes with protesters in Ferguson, Missouri . Missouri Burning: More than 150 gunshots have been reported overnight, shops were looted and several buildings were set on fire in Ferguson . In another, rioters threw rocks and bottles and set fires as Obama counseled 'care and restraint in managing peaceful protests that occur.' Police 'need to work with the community, not against the community,' he said, indicating his desire to see law enforcement isolate violent instigators – many of whom traveled to Missouri from great distances – and a larger group of people 'who want to protest peacefully.' 'The fact is,' he said, 'in too many parts of this country a deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of color. Some of this is the result of the legacy of racial discrimination in this country.' 'And this is tragic because nobody needs good policing more than poor communities with higher crime rates. We need to recognize that this is not just an issue for Ferguson, this is an issue for America.' Obama delivered his nine-minute statement, answered a single question and then left the White House briefing room as journalists asked whether brown will face separate federal charges related to alleged civil-rights violations. The Missouri grand jury's decision isn't binding on the Department of Justice in Washington, where outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder still could charge him. It's possible that Wilson could still face a federal trial and a long prison sentence. That would still be the case even if he had been acquitted in a state-level court. A group of protesters vandalize a police vehicle after the announcement of the grand jury decision . Looters: This store is the same one Michael Brown allegedly robbed before the clash with police that resulted in his death on August 9 .

A female protester covers her face in milk to counteract being pepper sprayed by police after a group of demonstrators attempted to stop traffic on Interstate 5 . 'We need to accept that this decision was the grand jury's to make': Obama counseled acceptance of the outcome in Missouri, even as his Justice Department could lodge federal charges in the case . Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill hinted at a second bite at the apple for the government in a statement issued after the news broke, saying Missourians should 'await the conclusion of ... [an] independent investigation' being undertaken by the DOJ before passing judgment. But on Monday the president firmly legitimized the 12 citizens, nine white and three black, who heard evidence over a stretch of weeks and decided it didn't add up to an indictment. 'First and foremost, we are a nation built on the rule of law, and so we need to accept that this decision was the grand jury's to make,' Obama said. 'There are Americans who agree with it, and there are Americans who are deeply upset, even angry. It's an understandable reaction. But I join Michael's parents in asking anyone who protests this decision to do so peacefully.' Obama has not said whether he, like his attorney general, would personally visit Ferguson. He left that possibility open on Monday. 'Let's take a look and see how things are going,' he said in response to the one question he took. 'Eric Holder's been there. We've had a whole team from the Justice Department there. And I think that they have done some very good work.' The grand jury process is different from a courtroom trial. It's conducted in secret and without balance between the government and a potential defendant. Unlike in a trial, where a jury must assign guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the grand jury must only decide whether or not there's a rational reason – a 'probable cause – to believe that a crime was committed and sufficient evidence to bring the case to court. Despite taking place in that far more prosecution-friendly environment, the grand jury's determination means that the weight of the prosecution's case was too weak to sustain charges.","Television split-screen broadcasts showed dramatic contrast between the president's requests for nonviolent reactions and the fires set on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri .

"A student at Georgetown University wrote in an op-ed piece that he was 'Not at all' shocked that a recent mugging he suffered at gunpoint took place. Student: Oliver Friedfeld, pictured, wrote the opinion piece which sparked a debate among online commenters . Senior Oliver Friedfeld said in his piece, 'I Was Mugged, And I Understand Why,' that he questioned his own ability to criticize his attackers, citing his 'perch of privilege.' The op-ed was published November 18 in Georgetown's student newspaper The Hoya - and picked up by several media outlets this week. As of this writing, Friedfeld's piece has 142 comments on the student newspaper's website - a number of which debate whether or not the author is victim-blaming for the crime, while others debate the idea of privilege. Friedfeld wrote of the encounter 'Last weekend, my housemate and I were mugged at gunpoint while walking home from Dupont Circle. The entire incident lasted under a minute, as I was forced to the floor, handed over my phone and was patted down.' He continued 'And yet, when a reporter asked whether I was surprised that this happened in Georgetown, I immediately answered: ""Not at all."" It was so clear to me that we live in the most privileged neighborhood within a city [Washington, D.C.] that has historically been, and continues to be, harshly unequal.' Frieden revealed in the op-ed that he did not view the muggers as 'bad people' - and that instead of the various opportunities he'd received in life, wrote that, 'I'd venture to guess that our attackers have had to experience things I've never dreamed of.' 'Who am I to stand from my perch of privilege, surrounded by million-dollar homes and paying for a $60,000 education, to condemn these young men as ""thugs?""' he argued. 'It’s precisely this kind of ""otherization"" that fuels the problem.' Friedfeld wrote that though there is always the possibility of choice, 'it's a lot easier for me to choose good than it may be for them to.' The college student also dismissed the idea of an increased police presence being helpful; he wrote 'Police protect us by keeping those ""bad people"" out of our neighborhood, and I’m grateful for it. And yet, I realize it’s self-serving and doesn't actually fix anything.' At the end of his column for The Hoya, Friedfeld argued that people ought to acclimate themselves to crimes taking place. He wrote, 'As young people, we need to devote real energy to solving what are collective challenges. Until we do so, we should get comfortable with sporadic muggings and break-ins. I can hardly blame them. The cards are all in our hands, and we’re not playing them.' Friedfeld did not immediately return a request for comment from MailOnline. Georgetown student Oliver Friedfeld said he and his housemate were the victims of a mugging going home.

"Forces from Russia and other NATO member states have been linked to more than 40 dangerous incidents over the past eight months, a report has revealed. They include three incidents during the past year which could have sparked open conflict between Russia and the West, according to the findings by the European Leadership Network. The report follows this weekend's celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, during which ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev warned that Russia and the West were in danger of entering a 'new Cold War.' Russia has been involved in more than 40 dangerous incidents over the past eight months; earlier this month the Swedish military hunted a suspected Russian submarine near Stockholm . Mikhail Gorbachev warned that Russia and the West were in danger of entering a 'new Cold War . According to Fox News the report said: 'We believe [the incidents] are a very serious development, not necessarily because they indicate a desire on the part of Russia to start a war but because they show a dangerous game of brinkmanship is being played, with the potential for unintended escalation in what is now the most serious security crisis in Europe since the cold war.' Gorbachev accused the West, particularly the U.S, of giving in to 'triumphalism' after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the communist bloc. The result, he said, could partly be seen in the inability of global powers to prevent or resolve conflicts in Yugoslavia, the Middle East and most recently Ukraine. The first incident noted in the report involved a near-collision between a civilian airliner and a Russian spy plane that had turned off its transponders - making it difficult to track by air controllers - that occurred in March. The aircraft, on its way to Rome from Copenhagen, was carrying 132 people. The abduction of Eston Kohver, an Estonian secret service operative, who was taken to Moscow in September and accused of espionage, was the second major incident noted in the report. The third involved last month's hunt in Sweden for a suspected Russian submarine, after 'foreign underwater activity' was spotted in Stockholm. The report said Moscow should 'urgently re-evaluate' its posture and also recommended both Russia and NATO improve communications and exercise 'military and political restraint'; above, President Vladimir Putin is seen at an APEC conference in China yesterday . According to the report, most of the incidents have occurred around the Baltic Sea. Others have happened over the Black Sea and along both the U.S. and Canadian borders. In September, military officials said that two F-22 fighter jets intercepted six Russian military airplanes that were flying about 55 nautical miles from the coast of Alaska. After the U.S. jets were scrambled the planes returned to Russia. Two of the planes were later spotted 40 nautical miles off the Canadian coastline in the Beaufort Sea. The report said Moscow should 'urgently re-evaluate' its posture. It also recommended both Russia and NATO improve communications and exercise 'military and political restraint'.","Three incidents could have sparked conflict between Russia and the West .

"Iceland has received an informal approach from an intermediary who says NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden wants to seek asylum there, it has emerged. Snowden fled his home in Hawaii, where he worked for NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, after exposing the U.S. government's top surveillance secrets. He is at a secret location in Hong Kong. In a column in Icelandic daily newspaper Frettabladid, WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson wrote that a middleman had approached him on behalf of Snowden. Scroll down for video . Seeking asylum: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, pictured, has been charged with espionage and theft. He arrived in Moscow at around 5 p.m. Sunday . 'On 12 June, I received a message from Edward Snowden where he asked me to notify the Icelandic government that he wanted to seek asylum in Iceland,' Hrafnsson, who is also an investigative journalist in Iceland, told Reuters. He added that he has yet to receive a response from officials about his request but said they have a 'moral obligation' to answer the call for help. The Icelandic government, which has refused to say whether they would grant asylum to Snowden, confirmed it had received the message from Hrafnsson. 'Kristinn Hrafnsson has contacted two ministries in an informal way but not the ministers,' a government spokesman said. 'There has been no formal approach in this matter.' Helping hand: WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn . Hrafnsson, left, approached Iceland on behalf of Snowden and his . middleman. Julian Assange, right, also sought help from Iceland ahead of . Wikileaks' releases . Safety: Iceland has a reputation for promoting internet freedoms. Reykjavik is pictured . Iceland has a reputation for . promoting Internet freedoms and has long been discussed as an option for Snowden. As a U.S. citizen, Snowden would not need a visa to enter Iceland and could immediately apply for asylum. He would be free to live in Iceland while immigration authorities decide his case, which could take more than a year, experts have said. But if Snowden wants to seek refuge in Iceland, he'll have to get there first. And this is where the U.S. could have a chance. Interpol will sometimes issue a 'red notice' - which is like an international arrest warrant - but keep it sealed so that the person doesn't know it exists. If he tried to travel, he would be arrested at the airport. If he did get to Iceland, it is unknown if he would be safe. The government of newly-elected Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson is believed to be closer to Washington than past administrations and less keen to foster the country's cyber-haven image. 'I would be very surprised if they (the government) would be eager to engage in any international disputes with the U.S. And it is pretty difficult to be granted asylum here,' Stefania Oskarsdottir, lecturer in political science at the University of Iceland, told Reuters. 'I think what this guy is saying is based on something he is imagining or hoping for rather than actual facts.' Iceland does have an extradition treaty with . the United States, but it is unclear if it would cover any crimes . that he might be charged with. Hrafnsson would not identify who the middleman was. Snowden has previously mentioned Iceland as a possible refuge. Iceland has a reputation for . promoting Internet freedoms, but Snowden has said did not travel there . immediately from the United States as he feared the country could be . pressured by Washington. 'Iceland . could be pushed harder, quicker, before the public could have a chance . to make their feelings known, and I would not put that past the current . U.S. administration,' Snowden said in an online forum in the Guardian on . Monday. It had been . suggested that he would actually flee to the Icelandic consulate in Hong . Kong, rather than risking boarding a plane to fly there in person. Icelandic officials told USA Today last week that Snowden is missing a key element. 'The main stipulation for seeking . asylum in Iceland would be that the person must be in Iceland to start . the process,' said Johannes Tomasson, the chief spokesman for Iceland's . Ministry of Interior in Reykjavik. 'That would be the ground rule No. 1.' WikiLeaks founder . Julian Assange, who is holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to . avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning over allegations of sex . crimes, visited Iceland several times in the run-up to some of the . website's major releases. Assange denies any wrongdoing. Yet some experts added that Iceland might not be as welcoming as Snowden hopes. The government of newly-elected Prime . Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson has not been tested in relation to these cases, but is believed to be closer to . Washington than past administrations and less keen to foster the . country's cyber-haven image. 'I would be very surprised if they . (the government) would be eager to engage in any international disputes . with the U.S. And it is pretty difficult to be granted asylum here,' Stefania Oskarsdottir, lecturer in political science at the University . of Iceland, told Reuters. 'I think what this guy is saying is based on . something he is imagining or hoping for rather than actual facts.' Support: Snowden's image is displayed in Hong Kong, where the whistleblower has been in hiding . Yahoo has joined a list of major technology companies in releasing how many times the government requests data on its users - and it was a hefty 13,000 times in the past six months. The company, based in Sunnyvale, California, followed the likes of Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Google in releasing the broad numbers pertaining to the period from December 1, 2012 and May 31, 2013 in the wake of the NSA surveillance program revelations. Yahoo said most often, the government requested data concerning fraud, homicide, kidnapping and other criminal investigations. However, the number, which hovers somewhere between 12,000 and 13,000 also includes requests made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Unlike some of its competitors, Yahoo did not reveal how many accounts the government requested information on so it's hard to say how many customers have been impacted. In a blog post on Tuesday night, CEO Marissa Mayer said: 'Like all companies, Yahoo! cannot lawfully break out FISA request numbers at this time because those numbers are classified; however, we strongly urge the federal government to reconsider its stance on this issue.' Mayer, writing with the company's general counsel Ron Bell, said the internet firm would from now on release reports twice a year on global law enforcement requests.","An intermediary for Snowden approached a WikiLeaks spokesman, who then notified Iceland about the asylum bid .

"Murder suspect Nikolai Rakossi, nicknamed 'Russian Rambo,' seen here for the first time inside his pre-trial jail, is finally expected to face justice this winter after being accused of the brutal knifings of his American girlfriend and her daughter. The 61-year old-former Soviet paratrooper was held by Russian police last year on evidence from the US authorities linking him to the gruesome New York murders three years ago. Tatyana Prikhodko, 56, and her beautiful daughter Larisa, 28, both nurses, were found butchered in the family home in Brooklyn. Murder suspect Nikolai Rakossi, nicknamed 'Russian Rambo,' is finally expected to face justice this winter after being accused of the brutal knifings of his American girlfriend and her daughter . Rakossi, nicknamed 'Russian Rambo,' can seen here for the first time inside his pre-trial jail . Stunning: It is believed that Larisa Prikhodko, pictured, walked in on her mother and Rakossi arguing . A mother with a young son, Larisa was stabbed numerous times in the torso. Her body was discovered in a bedroom. Tatyana's throat was slashed open and she had multiple stab wounds to her chest and face. In the hours after the double homicide on 16 April 2011, Rakossi fled back to Moscow, using a one-way Aeroflot ticket he allegedly bought ahead of the killings. Rakossi, a veteran of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, was on the run in Russia for more than two years before being detained after he was snared a year ago (October 2013) in a flat in his home city of Novomoskovsk. After reaching Moscow, Rakossi vanished, with sources saying relatives helped hide him for more than two years . Together: Larisa Prikhodko, left, and her mother Tatiana, center, were killed in New York in April 2011. Larisa's sister Svetlana, right, believes suspected murderer Nikolai Rakossi led a double life . Tatyana Prikhodko, 56, and her beautiful daughter Larisa, 28, both nurses, were found butchered in the family home in Brooklyn . Tatyana's other daughter, Svetlana Prikhodko, 34, said she is frustrated by the delay in bringing Rakossi to court over the killing of her mother and sister, but is hopeful the trial will go ahead early next year. 'He is still in detention centre while Russian investigators prepare documents for the court,' she told Mail Online. 'It took a very long time to receive documents from America, and now naturally it takes a lot of time to translate them. 'We were told we would be informed as soon as the documents are ready, so that we can see them before the court. 'I expect the court to be in winter, at the beginning of next year, though we were not told the time yet.' She expressed the fear that Rakossi could protest his innocence in front of jurors at a time when there is a wave of anti-Americanism in Russia over the crisis in Ukraine. 'It is going to be a jury, so there is no guarantee on the verdict here, specially if he will be doing his tearful performances and passionate promises that it wasn't him,' she said. The family's victims are frustrated by the delay in bringing Rakossi to court over the killing of her mother and sister, but is hopeful the trial will go ahead early next year . 'But I do hope that there will be enough evidence to proof that it was him. I wish this case was closed once and forever, as it is a non-stop nightmare.' A source in the Russian Investigative Committee, the equivalent of the FBI which is handling the case, said the trial date was not yet fixed. Court spokeswoman Olga Dyachuk said last year that he was detained because the judge 'took into account that Rakossi is accused of a grave crime which can result in him being jailed for 20 years, or for life, and concluded that there is every reason to believe that the charged person might try and escape.' Rakossi - held inside a pre-trial jail in the Russian city of Tula - looks pale after his time on the run, our pictures show. The 61 year old former Soviet paratrooper was held by Russian police last year on evidence from the US authorities linking him to the gruesome New York murders three years ago . He has a daughter, Yevgenia, 32, in Russia from a previous relationship. 'He really wouldn't have done anything like this,' she said of 'complete nonsense' claims that he killed the two women. He is being held at the Temporary Detention Center for Suspects and Accused in Tula. Larisa's son Ryan, then three, was left motherless after her murder. The Russian constitution prevents the extradition of its citizens so 'Rambo' will face trial in Tula region. After reaching Moscow, Rakossi vanished, with sources saying relatives helped hide him for more than two years. The case is now under the supervision of the Russian Investigation Committee, equivalent of the FBI. While Russian laws forbid the country’s citizens being extradited, New York Post reported he will face trial in his homeland based on evidence supplied by the U.S. Andrei Yartsev, chief spokesman of Tula police, said: 'The results of the American side’s investigation were passed to the Russian General Prosecutor’s office so that the person can be charged with a criminal offense.' In March 2012, Prikhodko's other daughter Svetlana Prikhodko spoke exclusively to MailOnline. She believed Rakossi was being hidden by family and friends in Russia, in the grim industrial city of Novomoskovsk where he owns an apartment and where one neighbor claimed to have seen him since the double killing. 'I have no doubt it was him, none at all,' said the neighbor, asking to remain anonymous for her own safety. 'He looked worried and tense.' Svetlana told New York Post she and her family believe Rakossi led a sinister double life in New York, and he killed his wife and stepdaughter because they found out about it. 'The facts point to something far darker and more sinister than anyone could have imagined,' she said. 'The quiet subdued Rakossi was living a double life ever since the moment he landed in the U.S. 'Arriving on a tourist visa, he charmed Tatyana and soon asked her to marry him and became part of the family.' The family said they did not have 'a clear picture of what Rakossi was doing during these 11 years. He never held a regular job and claimed that he did construction work on the side.' Svetlana said she suspected his annual trips to Russia where he kept an apartment and car. He is being held at the Temporary Detention Center for Suspects and Accused in Tula . It was claimed that on the day of the murders, Rakossi was repeatedly on the phone to Russia, both before and after the killings. 'Rakossi made almost 20 phone calls to Russia, starting at 5.30am, though typically he seldom called anyone,' a source told MailOnline. 'The calls were only briefly interrupted at 2.40pm for ten minutes when he committed the first murder. He then resumed calling until 3.40pm when Larisa walked in, resulting in, another ten minute interruption in the calls.' New York Post reported Rakossi had called his sister Lydia, 62, who lives in Novomoskovsk, soon after the killings. 'He was in tears. He told me: ‘Please don’t keep any offence in your heart about me. Forgive me. You will never see me again',' she said. 'Then he ended the call.' Lydia said she didn't hide her brother in Russia. The killings were carried out clinically, without a single scream to alert neighbors in the block. 'Who was this Rakossi that he allegedly knew how to handle a knife so expertly and kill an adult without even a cry from the victim?' a neighbor said. 'And what animal must he be to murder a young mother as she opened the door to her mother's apartment an hour later? What possible monstrous force and deed could have caused such an act of violence? 'No one deserves the horrible end that Larisa and Tatyana met.'","Nikolai Rakossi, nicknamed 'Russian Rambo,' is expected to face a court this winter .

"West Ham United are preparing a move to sign Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher - but are likely to face competition from West Bromwich Albion. The Scotland international, who has six months left on his contract at Old Trafford, is expected to move on in order to gain more regular football as he has only made 16 appearances this season, the last of which was against Yeovil Town in the FA Cup. That has alerted Sam Allardyce, who is a keen admirer of the 30-year-old and wants to bring Fletcher to Upton Park to provide experience, as West Ham chase the dream of having European football when they move to the Olympic Stadium.

West Ham have space on their wage bill to add Fletcher, having just released Portuguese forward Ricardo Vaz Te; Allardyce is not expected to make too many additions to his squad during this window but the chance to sign Fletcher is something he would jump at. There is plenty of interest in Fletcher, however. Valencia and Celtic have made enquiries about Fletcher, who had made 340 appearances during his United career, winning the Champions League, the Barclays Premier League on five occasions, as well as 66 Scotland caps. West Brom are also understood to have ambitions of signing Fletcher, who has accepted that his opportunities to play for Louis van Gaal are going to decrease as he continues to overhaul United’s squad in the future. A move to The Hawthorns might be attractive from a personal point of view as Fletcher would not necessarily have to leave home. He is expected to make his decision over the next fortnight. The Scotland international has six months left on his current contract at Old Trafford .

"David de Gea is set to stay at Manchester United, according to his agent. The Spaniard, whose contract expires at the end of next season, has been strongly linked with a move to Real Madrid. But De Gea's representative, Jorge Mendes, believes the talented goalkeeper will remain at Old Trafford. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David de Gea's 2014/15 season stats with Manchester United . Super agent Jorge Mendes reveals Manchester United keeper David de Gea will stay with the club . Manchester United keeper De Gea in action against Liverpool's Mario Balotelli at Old Trafford in December . 'He has one year left on his contract and I think that he will stay in Manchester,' Mendes told the BBC. 'The player will decide, but he's happy there, at the moment.' Mendes' comments will come as a relief to United fans who were growing increasingly concerned that the 24-year-old, signed from Atletico Madrid for £17.8m in 2011, would be on his way. Last week manager Louis van Gaal, when asked about the keeper's future, admitted 'everything is possible'. He added: 'We would like to keep him.' Mendes reveals Real Madrid ace Cristiano Ronaldo has a £1billion buyout clause at the La Liga side . If Mendes' comments are anything to go by it looks like they will be doing just that. Lisbon-born Mendes has risen from DJ bar owner in Porto, where he became friends with numerous professional footballers, to one of the most powerful agents in the modern game. Mendes represents De Gea, as well as Jose Mourinho, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez and also negotiated Angel di Maria’s £59.7m move to Manchester United. Mendes is also agent for Radamel Falcao and negotiated Manchester United's £59.7million deal for Di Maria . Colombian World Cup star and Real Madrid forward James Rodriguez is also managed by Mendes . But it’s Cristiano Ronaldo, who joined Real Madrid from United for £80m in 2009, that is his most important client. Ronaldo’s move to La Liga was a record-breaking fee in its time but Mendes claims it will not be long before a club forks out over £200m as well as revealing Ronaldo’s sizeable buyout clause at Madrid. Mendes told the BBC: ‘He’s the most expensive player in the world because he’s the best footballer, the best sportsman ever in the world. ‘It’s impossible to say his worth. Cristano Ronaldo? One billion. His buyout clause is one billion, so it is one billion. Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo has a buyout clause of £1bn in his contract at Real Madrid, according to Mendes . ‘If for any reason they decided to sell him tomorrow for £300m, someone would pay. He loves the Manchester United supporters because he was there six years he but he will finish his career at Real Madrid, for sure.’ ‘Clubs like Manchester United or Real Madrid, if a player is worth £200m, of course they can do it,’ said Mendes, who also said players are worth even more than clubs are currently paying. ‘The most important part of the game is the players,’ he said. 'They deserve the maximum amount possible. Of course there is a limit but you can pay until this limit. I think the limit may be in three years or maybe after that.’ Ronaldo pictured celebrating with Alvaro Morato after he scored in the Champions League final .","Super agent Jorge Mendes thinks David de Gea will stay at Old Trafford .

"US spy planes are flying above Britain monitoring telephone and computer signals in a bid to track down British terrorist Jihadi John and those who are communicating with him. The aircraft, manned by British pilots and carrying FBI agents, are equipped with technology so advanced they can detect heat coming off a keyboard when a button is pressed. A source has revealed Jihadi John, who has beheaded three Western hostages on camera, comes from a South London suburb about 10 miles from Central London. Scroll down for video . Jihadi John, pictured with British aid worker David Haines, has been identified as coming from a South London suburb . The signals and data collected by the spy planes is being sent back to the US to be analysed, the Sunday Express reported. An FBI source told the paper: 'Electronic footprints might help us pinpoint the location of the British IS executioner because we believe there are associates of his in the UK who are directly communicating with him.' Shocking Islamic State (IS) videos have shown a man believed to be Jihadi John executing American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31, as well as British aid worker, David Haines, 44. International revulsion after the scenes were posted on the internet sparked a massive manhunt by British and American security services and the investigation has now focused on a district about ten miles from Central London. It's also believed the planes are being used to study the movements of Jihadi John's suspected Midlands associates. An intelligence services source said the delicate detection equipment on board the planes had previously been used successfully to work out a suspected terrorist's computer password because of the heat signature left on the keys. The intelligence source said the surveillance plane had recently been used over Birmingham in relation to Junaid Hussain - who is suspected of being one of the so-called 'Beatles' holding hostages. The planes are understood to be military aircraft which are sometimes used by the police to find escaped prisoners or stolen vehicles. The US Senate has also offered a £6 million reward to anyone providing information that could lead to the capture of Jihadi John. A team of more than a dozen US investigators from an FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force flew to the UK, where they are working with MI5 and anti-terrorist officers from the Metropolitan Police Force to identify the man. It is believed family members of Jihadi John have been interviewed by Met officers and an FBI agent. The source said Jihadi John was known to the security services even before he went to Syria, but had been regarded as a 'low-level player'. It is believed he did know some of the terrorists convicted in the 2006 'liquid bomb' plot to blow up ten airliners bound from the UK to the US in mid-flight over the Atlantic. An Italian hostage who was kidnapped with British hostage David Haines, pictured, is wanted for questioning as it is believed he could help identify Jihadi John . The Metropolitan Police refused to comment on the spy plane tactics. Meanwhile, an Italian hostage kidnapped with David Haines is wanted for questioning by investigators who believe he can help identify Jihadi John. Federico Motka was freed four months ago after 14 months in captivity when the Italian government paid a reported ransom of €6 million. Now authorities in Rome are urgently trying to track him down. In 2007 a plot to kidnap and behead a British soldier was disrupted with the help of surveillance aircraft flying over the West Midlands. It is believed an RAF Britten-Norman Islander plane was used in the hunt for a Birmingham terror cell which was plotting to kidnap a British soldier before beheading him live on the internet. The Islander is a one or two-seater, low-flying plane with a relatively long range and ability to loiter in the air at low speeds. The RAF says it uses two of the aircraft in what it calls 'photographic mapping and light communications roles'. The Army says on its website that the plane is usually employed for surveillance. Its other roles include air photography, 'support to the 'special user' and 'liaison flying'.","Sources say British jihadi has been identified and comes from South London .

"Mike Phelan is set to make an swift return to coaching by joining Hull City as number two to manager Steve Bruce. The former Manchester United assistant manager quit his coaching role at Carrow Road in the wake of Alex Neil’s shock appointment as Norwich boss. It looks like being a brief spell away from the game for Sir Alex Ferguson’s one-time deputy at Old Trafford, though, following claims on Humberside that he is set to join Hull’s coaching staff as assistant to Bruce. Former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan has left his role as Norwich first-team coach . Phelan, in discussion with new Norwich manager Alex Neil, has departed the Championship club . Phelen is set to join Premier League side Hull's coaching staff as Steve Bruce's number two . Ex-United centre-back Bruce has seen Hull slip into relegation trouble in recent weeks and is thought to view the vastly-experienced Phelan’s arrival as a move that will provide fresh impetus for his struggling side. Hull have only managed four Premier League wins all season and are currently on a run of three straight defeats without scoring. Phelan spent five years as assistant manager at United but left the club after Ferguson's retirement in 2013 following the appointment of David Moyes. The former defender joined Norwich, for whom he played between 1985 and 1989, as first team coach in November last year but, after a short spell as caretaker manager following the resignation of Neil Adams, but left his role after Neil took charge.","Mike Phelan spent five years as Alex Ferguson's No 2 at Manchester United .

"Real Madrid are continuing to monitor David de Gea's impressive form at Manchester United. There had been increasing clamour in Spain for 23-year-old De Gea to replace the under-fire Iker Casillas in the national side and Madrid are considering a similar move at club level. United, though, are planning discussions over an improved contract with their goalkeeper and hope to ratify a new long-term deal soon. Real Madrid are continuing to monitor David de Gea's impressive form at Manchester United . De Gea dislodged Iker Casillas between the sticks for Spain during the recent win against Luxembourg . The 23-year-old was largely untroubled during the comfortable 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win . De Gea, who was player of the year last season, signed for £17.8million in June 2011 and his deal runs out in 2016. Although initial conversations took place last year, talks had been put on hold as United strengthened their squad in other areas. Louis van Gaal still wants another goalkeeper to provide competition for De Gea with Anders Lindegaard looking for a new club. However, Real see the former Atletico No 1 as the man to replace Casillas, just as he did for Spain in the 4-0 win over Luxembourg. Meanwhile, Ryan Giggs will be given the Legend of Football Award at the HMV Football Extravaganza on Tuesday at the London Hilton Hotel on Park Lane.

"Missing: Teresa Cowley is feared dead as police fear she went overboard on a cruise . A British mother of twin girls was feared dead today after she fell overboard following a night drinking on board a ferry with her husband. Teresa Cowley, 43, disappeared while she and her partner Mark, also 43, sailed from Hull to Rotterdam in the early hours of Friday morning. The couple, from Mickleover, Derby, had set off on board the P&O ferry at 8.30pm on Thursday and were due to arrive in the Netherlands at 8.15am the next morning. They spent the evening in the Pride of Rotterdam's bar and returned to their cabin just before 1am but their key did not work in the lock. Police say Mark went to reception to get a new key while his wife waited outside the cabin, but when he returned Teresa had vanished and he raised the alarm. CCTV cameras on board the ship show Teresa staggering alone on deck shortly after 1am on Friday and she has not been seen since. A spokeswoman for Derbyshire Police said: 'The door key to the cabin did not work and while Mr Cowley went to reception to resolve the problem he left Teresa sitting outside the cabin. 'CCTV and witness accounts show Mrs Cowley go alone to Deck 11 Sun Lounge on the ship shortly after 1am on Friday, December 28. She did not return. 'Searches of the ship failed to locate Mrs Cowley who has since been reported missing. 'It is not looking good considering she is lost at sea.' Teresa - who reportedly has two teenage daughters from a previous relationship - is white, of medium build, around 5ft 4in tall, with black bobbed hair with red highlights. She was last seen wearing a grey jumper, black leggings and black boots. Trip: Mrs Cowley was on the P&O ship Pride of Rotterdam (pictured) as it headed for Holland when she disappeared on Friday morning . She has several distinctive tattoos including the words ‘Mrs Cowley’ written on her forearm, a black panther on one of her ankles and a large tattoo on the right side of her body made up of a dozen roses joined together. She had no money or identification with her when she went missing. Detectives from the Harbour Police at Rotterdam are currently investigating. It is not thought that anyone else is involved or any criminal offence had taken place. A neighbour, who did not want to be named, told The Sun: 'It's heart-breaking. She was a mum of two teenage girls from a previous relationship. There is still some slim hope she may be found alive.' Night out: Mr and Mrs Cowley had been drinking in the bar of the Pride incident . Meanwhile the body of a different woman was today pulled from the water near a British ferry terminal. Police were called at 1.04pm after the crew of a Red Funnel ferry spotted a body floating near a pontoon at Town Quay, in Southampton, Hampshire. She was hauled onto a police launch boat and taken to Southampton General Hospital, where she will be searched for identification. Detectives are waiting for the result of a post mortem examination but have said they are not treating the death as suspicious. A . spokesman said: 'We believe we know who the deceased was but her family . have yet to be notified and formal identification hasn't yet taken . place.' Witness Simon Dale . was watching the scene unfold before he caught the ferry to Hythe and . saw crewmen from the Red Jet ferry trying to hook the body out of the . water.

"The attorney's representing the parents of Michael Brown said today that they have forensic evidence the unarmed teen was shot dead with his hands up by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Attorney's Benjamin Crump and Anthony Gray were supposed to be joined at Thursday's press conference by Brown's parents, but instead revealed that their private autopsy shows the 18-year-old was surrendering when he was fatally gunned down. Crump and Gray also used their public appearance to admonish Missouri Governor Jay Nixon for warning protesters not to riot after the grand jury decision instead of telling the heavily armed police to control themselves too. Scroll Down for Video . Final days: Benjamin Crump addresses the media in St, Louis as the grand jury investigation into whether or not to indict officer Darren Wilson enters its final stage . The news conference occurred at the same time as Dr. Michael Baden testified before the grand jury in St. Louis. Baden performed the private autopsy at the request of Brown's family in August. After reading their prepared statements, Crump took questions from the press and re-itereated the Brown family's opinion that the grand jury is a political fudge and lacks transparency because it is behind closed doors. Moreover, Crump said he feels the grand jury is a waste of time and fails in its responsibility to justice. 'There was enough probably cause to charge Officer Darren Wilson with killing Michael Brown,' said Crump. In Missouri, Governor Jay Nixon said on Tuesday the National Guard would be on standby to respond to any violence after the grand jury decision. Nixon said 1,000 police officers had undergone more than 5,000 hours of specialized training ahead of the grand jury decision . Speaking out: Michael Brown Sr and Lesley McSpadden, parents of the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown who was shot and killed by white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri last August attends a press conference on Wednesday in Geneva after a session of the United Nations Committee against Torture . The family then urged restraint on the part of both protesters and police once a grand jury decides whether the officer who shot him should face criminal charges. Attorneys Anthony Gray and Benjamin Crump held a press conference Thursday outside the St. Louis County Justice Center, where the grand jury is meeting and Dr. Michael Baden, who performed a private autopsy on the family's behalf, was scheduled to testify. Crump said attorneys would not get into the substance of Baden's testimony, except to say he had identified one additional entry wound in Brown's chest. He did not elaborate on what that might mean. Brown's parents, who were in Geneva this week as the U.N. Committee Against Torture heard testimony about U.S. policies, did not attend. On Wednesday, the family of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen shot dead by a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri in August, have called for their neighbors and supporters to keep calm whether or not a grand jury chooses to indict Officer Darren Wilson. Telling their story: Lesley McSpadden (L) and Michael Brown Sr. (R), and Attorney Daryl Parks (C) attend a press conference about the UN Committee Against Torture . Gunned down: The August shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by Darren Wilson sparked a national debate on race relations and led to weeks of street demonstrations. Some groups have threatened extensive protests if the officer is not charged with a crime . Brown's father Michael Sr. made the call for peace as he and Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden visited Geneva to ask for continued U.N. pressure on the United States government over the affair. Back in Missouri, meanwhile, Governor Jay Nixon said on Tuesday the National Guard would be on standby to respond to any violence after the grand jury decision. Nixon said 1,000 police officers had undergone more than 5,000 hours of specialized training ahead of the grand jury decision. Hoping such training and force would not be necessary, Brown Sr. said Wednesday: . 'Me and his mother have come to the U.N. to get redress for our son,' Brown Sr. told a news conference after a session of the U.N. Committee on Torture which held a regular review of the U.S. record. 'There couldn't be a better place to do that.' 'The Brown family continue to call for non-violence. They continue to feel the Grand Jury will do the right thing,' Parks told reporters in Geneva. In addition to the National Guard, police officers from across the state could be called on to restore order if protests get out of hand, Nixon told a news conference. A decision by the grand jury is expected in mid-to-late November. The August shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by Darren Wilson sparked a national debate on race relations and led to weeks of street demonstrations. Some groups have threatened extensive protests if the officer is not charged with a crime.

"David Moyes has revealed that he was offered the chance to return to the Premier League, but turned it down in favour of a chance to impress in La Liga. Moyes was unveiled as the new manager of Real Sociedad in a press conference, and the former Everton and Manchester United man admitted he could still be in managing in England's top division. ‘To be completely fulfilled as a coach, you have to try different cultures. I’ve always wanted to work abroad,' said the 51-year-old Scot. VIDEO Scroll down for David Moyes unveiled as Real Sociedad's new head coach . David Moyes was unveiled to the press in San Sebastian on Thursday afternoon . Moyes then took to the Anoeta Stadium pitch to pose with a Sociedad scarf . ‘I never had any doubt (that I would get back into football). I had several offers to manage in the Premier League. ‘But this is the opportunity to manage in La Liga. I think it has overtaken the PL because of the quality of the teams, getting regularly into the latter stages of the Champions League.’ When pressed for comment on which Premier League teams had offered him a route back into management, Moyes refused to comment, stating, 'I would never do that. You know it's not my style.' Moyes (right) shakes hands with Director General Lorenzo Juarros prior to his first training session . Former Everton and Manchester United man Moyes took to the field to watch his players in action . Moyes penned an 18-month contract with Sociedad, a far cry from the initial six-year deal he was given at Old Trafford. With reports he was offered four years in Spain, questions were raised as to why he opted for the shorter contract. 'I had the choice. The president gave me the opportunity. But I had a six year contract at United and I lasted nine months. So don’t get too caught up in the length of the contract. I don’t pay much attention to that.’ The Scotsman joins Real Sociedad with the club lagging in the lower echelons of La Liga, and Moyes explained the reasons for his decision to move to Spain. 'What convinced me to come was the president,' he explained. 'He was fantastically passionate about his club. He told me how special it was. His love for the club was what pulled me here. Moyes poses with the blue-and-white stripes of Real Socidad in front of the cameras . Moyes follows in the footsteps of John Toshack (left) and Chris Coleman (right) at Real Sociedad . The Real Socidad squad gather in a circle as they meet their manager for the first time since his appointment . ‘But this is a big challenge. It’s an opportunity to show British managers can go and work abroad. Hopefully I’m the first of many.’ ‘Me and the president have had some long conversations. But I had to be sure I was climbing to a club with ambition, because I want to win. We’ve only won two games this season but hopefully we can improve on that. 'I see great morale among the players since I’ve been here and I think I have been lifted by the result they had last Sunday.’ Moyes is the fourth Brit to manage Real Sociedad, following on from Harry Lowe, John Toshack - who enjoyed three separate spells in charge between 1985 and 2002 - and latterly Chris Coleman. Moyes enjoyed a very successful 11 years as the manager of Everton in the Premier League . His nine-month stint at Old Trafford was less successful though, and he was sacked in April 2014 . It is Moyes' first foray into foreign management, and he cited La Liga's history of British managers as a contributing factor to his decision. 'Real (Sociedad) have had a great history of having British managers - John Toshack and Chris Coleman. And some of the greatest British managers have come and worked in La Liga - Bobby Robson and Terry Venables. 'I’m not putting myself at their level but this is an opportunity to test myself against the best and hopefully I can do well here.’ And Moyes is far from in the dark when it comes to his new club. His knowledge, he insisted, goes right back to the early 1980s when he faced them wearing a Celtic shirt. Moyes stood at the corner of the Anoeta pitch to pose with the stadium behind him . The Scot took a stroll around the ground with club president Jokin Aperribai . ‘I knew a lot about Real Sociedad from a long time back. I came here in 82/83. I was with Celtic when we played Real Sociedad. I know all about the club, about the city. I also went to see La Real in Aberdeen when they qualified for the Europa League. I’m looking forward to getting stuck right into the job. I feel the job fits my character.’ Moyes' job now is to stamp his mark on Sociedad as he did with Everton. He was asked at the press conference whether he will be bringing in players from the Premier League. 'I will add staff in time. I can’t tell you how many people want to come and work here. I can't tell you how many players want to come and work here.’","David Moyes was sacked as manager of Manchester United in April .

"Shot: Pragaret Singh, 35, was attacked as he left Manchester Food Traders in Openshaw, Manchester . A businessman was shot dead by armed robbers who fled with ‘tens of thousands of pounds’ of his company takings. Pragaret Singh, 35, who was married with three children aged seven, five and two, was locking up his food whole-sale business with his nephew when he was targeted on Friday night. As he tried to get into his BMW to drive away he was attacked by two men. He struggled with the pair but was shot twice, in the chest and stomach. The thieves stole the cash he had been carrying, before fleeing in a small silver hatchback, possibly a Vauxhall. Mr Singh’s nephew, who was uninjured, dialled 999 following the attack and alerted police. Last night relatives and friends of Mr Singh, who was known as Charlie, described him as a ‘true gentleman’ and condemned his murderers. His brother Tiggy said: ‘He was robbed of his life. He was happy, jolly and full of life – he never said anything bad about anyone. 'He was the kind of person who’d go out of his way to help anyone in need. He had taken out loans to give financial help to his colleagues, acting as their guarantors. ‘The robbers could have shot him in the leg, they could have hit him with a stick – but instead they shot him twice. He had no chance. If they’d have shot him once, he’s the kind of person who probably would have put up a fight.’ British-born Mr Singh lived with his wife Sukhwinder, 33, their children and other members of his extended family in a large £750,000 home on the outskirts of the smart suburb of Worsley, Greater Manchester. The company director had run Manchester Food Traders, a successful import and export business, for around 15 years. He was locking up at the premises, on an industrial estate in Openshaw, with his nephew just after 6pm when the raiders struck. Scroll down for video .

"Some at Manchester United believe that, in Luke Shaw, they have signed the player who will go on to be the best left back in the world. Certainly, Old Trafford chief executive Ed Woodward had told people how pleased he is with the arrival of the teenage defender. Some of have questioned the transfer fee. It was £31m. That, though, will be rendered largely irrelevant if Shaw goes on to play for the club for a decade. Remember that some people thought £30m was too much money for Rio Ferdinand back in 2002. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson: Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers belong in seniors . Luke Shaw, in action against Everton on Sunday, is starting to impose himself at Manchester United . Shaw cost £31million but not many thought Rio Ferdinand's £30m fee was a waste of money after 10 years . The teenager has been called up to England's Under 21 squad for their crucial play-off . As he prepares to play for England Under 21s this week, what is abundantly clear is that Shaw has some improving to do. His club manager Louis van Gaal has recognised that and much of the the player's work on a daily basis at United's Carrington training ground is understood to focus on the basic nuts and bolts of his defending. Modern full backs play a different game than those that came before them. Many of them are encouraged to be attacking players first and defenders second. In Shaw, it is easy to detect a bit of that. For Van Gaal and the way he likes his teams to play, that does not necessarily represent a fundamental problem. For example, as he was extolling the virtues of a three-man defensive system to his players shortly after his arrival, he told his wing backs that he saw them as 'mainly attackers'. Shaw, however, does look significantly better in one half of the field than the other and that, over time, perhaps needs to be addressed. Shaw impressed against Everton and formed a fine partnership with winger Angel di Maria (below) Against Everton for United at Old Trafford, for example, the 19-year-old was exceptional at times in the other half of the field. His understanding with Angel di Maria appears to have developed immediately and the two of them gave Tony Hibbert right back a terrible time for much of the afternoon. It was the Everton right back, though, whom Shaw brought down to concede a penalty. Shaw thought he was hard done by. He wasn't. It was a reckless, impetuous tackle and that wasn't the only example of the young player getting it wrong that day. Van Gaal, it must be said, didn't know that much about Shaw on arriving at United. His early concerns about his charge's fitness – the defender was carrying extra pounds during pre-season in America – were made clear but what did impress the new United manager is the manner in which the player responded. Shaw admits he must improve defensively after giving away a penalty following a foul on Tony Hibbert . The left back was taken off injured with a knee problem but is fit enough to feature for England's youth side . 'It's something I have got to work on,' admitted Shaw subsequently. 'It was a surprise when I got to United. 'I didn't come into United thinking it would be much harder. That's something that I think I made a mistake on.' Shaw's efforts at Carrington have, by all accounts, been impressive since United's return from tour. Van Gaal noticed them immediately and was happy to enough to take England coach Roy Hodgson to task when he suggested Shaw had issues with general fitness going back to his Southampton days. Louis van Gaal has been impressed with Shaw's effort in training after initially questioning his fitness . Shaw was not picked for the England senior squad but sitting on the bench would do nothing for him . Tom Ince grapples with the young star during an Under 21 training session at St George's Park . 'He [Hodgson] has not been here to see him train,' said Van Gaal. 'He has been an example to the others. I'm really happy.' Having just recovered from a hamstring injury, Shaw limped off with a bang to the knee on Sunday. It is not serious and he should start for Gareth Southgate's Under 21 team against Croatia this week. It may feel like a demotion, but it shouldn't. At this stage of his career, he is better playing competitive football than sitting on the bench watching Leighton Baines.

"Scotland vs England was a good tear-up on Tuesday night, but I cannot wait for the return of the Barclays Premier League and this is a fixture that has me licking my lips. They may not be the heavyweights of old, slugging it out at the top of the table, but Arsenal and Manchester United are still ferocious rivals. Here are the five key areas that will decide the contest. Make no mistake about it, this is a big game. Sanchez and Welbeck vs the fragile United defence . United have terrible injuries, not helped by a lack of investment in defence, while Arsenal’s two attacking signings are in good form, especially Alexis Sanchez. He has 12 goals for the club and hasn’t required time to settle. Arsene Wenger passes on his tips on unlocking the Man United defence to star man Alexis Sanchez . The Arsenal manager talks to Sanchez during their final training session before the Man United showdown . Wenger and Sanchez share a joke during the Friday morning training session at London Colney . Danny Welbeck (left) picked up an knock vs Scotland and Alexis Sanchez may be fatigued from Chile duty . Paddy McNair may start for Manchester United at the back after injuries ruled out more experienced players . Danny Welbeck on the ball in Arsenal training as Jack Wilshere watches on . Forward-thinking trio Olivier Giroud (left), Danny Welbeck (centre) and Jack Wilshere arrive for training . The biggest concern is how quickly he can recover from his recent international exploits, with matches for Chile against Venezuela and Uruguay. He isn’t due back at Arsenal until Friday and Arsene Wenger must decide if he is fatigued, or fit enough to try and continue his explosive form. If Danny Welbeck is fit after picking up a hamstring injury on England duty, this will be a huge game for him. He will be motivated after being written off by Louis van Gaal and will relish this fixture. I’d still like to see him further up the pitch and finishing chances in the box, but he looks at home at Arsenal. I wonder if he’ll celebrate if he scores? Di Maria vs Chambers . My training ground sources at Arsenal tell me that Arsene Wenger sees Calum Chambers as a defensive midfielder eventually. Right now, he is having to stand in at right back and was given a real chasing in Arsenal's last game against Swansea by winger Jefferson Montero. He also found himself second-choice behind Nathaniel Clyne with England. Angel Di Maria celebrates scoring for Manchester United against Leicester in September . Calum Chambers (left) struggled to contain Swansea's Jefferson Montero during Arsenal's 2-1 defeat . Football analysts Bloomberg Sports believe an Arsenal win is the most likely outcome against Man Utd . But he’s a young man with lots of ability and I am a huge fan. He comes face to face with dynamic Angel di Maria, who looks to be off his game at the moment. If he is fit – he too took a knock on international duty – he owes United a big performance, because he has been flat recently. After three goals and four assists in his first six games, he has only one assist in his last three. He hasn’t been helped with the changing of his position. Since moving out to the left wing, he hasn’t contributed as much. He clearly wants to play through the middle. What system will LVG pick? He’s chopping and changing his formation at the moment and it’s confusing his own players, more than the opposition. People praise a manager who changes his formation mid-game to impact on the result, but it only proves he got the formation wrong in the first place. Louis van Gaal has chopped and changed United's formation lead to confusion among his players . Will United play with a diamond? Will it be three at the back? Or maybe 4-4-2? Where will he play Di Maria? Van Gaal has had rotten luck with injuries, especially in the back line, and he will probably have to play with a rookie pairing at Arsenal. His reputation is giving him breathing space. Where will Jack play (if he starts)? Jack Wilshere will probably wish to play in the deep midfield position. He’s done well there for England, but Arsenal have more competition for places. Wilshere has also played better for England this season than he has for his club. Wenger doesn’t seem to agree with Roy Hodgson’s assessment of Wilshere’s best role, so can he force his way into the team higher up the pitch? I agree with Wenger; I like to see Jack playing one-twos around the opposition box, but there are question marks about his energy levels. Jack Wilshere reacts to a missed chance in Arsenal's Friday training session before the Man United game . Wilshere gets away from Tomas Rosicky during the practice match during Friday's training . Jack Wilshere impressed in a deeper role for England against Scotland earlier this week . Wilshere gets a helping hand from captain Mikel Arteta, who is set to return for the United game . Aaron Ramsey pings the ball during Arsenal's training session ahead of the Man United clash . Theo Walcott was wrapped up warm in training on Friday morning . He needs a big game for Arsenal, so if he is picked, can he deliver as he did against Manchester City, when he was terrific? RVP is under pressure . There are growing questions being raised about Robin van Persie. He no longer has the centre forward role to himself, with Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao - who is out for two weeks with a fresh injury - breathing down his neck. Some people are too keen to withdraw Rooney, either into midfield or behind the striker, but he showed against Scotland that he still has much to offer up front. Is he a better pick than Van Persie in United’s No 9 position? Robin van Persie celebrates scoring against Chelsea (left) but has had a mixed season . Radamel Falcao celebrates scoring for United against Everton in the Premier League in October . The former Arsenal striker seems to have lost some pace and is no longer the same force. Will he celebrate if he scores against his old club? You bet he will. Arsenal’s defence is not at its best and this is a chance for him to show he still has what it takes.

"Islamic State militants fighting in Syria and Iraq have released an audio message they claim is of terror leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi urging supporters to unleash a 'volcano of jihad' on the West. Lacing his speech with religious phrases, the voice believed to belong to Baghdadi describes jihad as 'the peak of Islam' and said those who do not fight non-believers will suffer 'painful torment.' The release - which has not been independently verified - comes just days after Iraqi officials claimed the ISIS chief had at least been injured and may very well be dead after an American airstrike destroyed a convoy of up to 10 vehicles that was travelling through the country. The bombing killed Baghdadi's right hand man Auf Abdulrahman Elefery, who is commonly known by his nom de guerre Abu Suja, but there have been conflicting reports about the terror leader himself - with U.S. officials admitting that even they were stumped as to his fate. Scroll down for video . Terror: Lacing his speech with religious phrases, the voice believed to belong to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi describes jihad as 'the peak of Islam' and says those who do not fight will suffer 'painful torment' In the chilling audio clip, the voice believed to belong to Baghdadi says that a U.S.-led military campaign intended to destroy his terror group was failing. 'We see America and it's allies stumbling between fear, weakness, inability and failure. America, Europe, Australia, Canada, their apostate tails and slaves from among the rulers of the Muslim lands were terrified of the Islamic State,' he said. 'They fear for their security. They fear the revolt of the Muslim peoples. They fear their defeat. They fear the return of the caliphate and the return of Muslims to pioneering and leadership,' he added. Making specific reference to Arab partners in the US-led coalition of nations carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic State, the voices goes on: 'America did not dare start a campaign until after amassing support from their slaves and dogs from among the rulers of Islamic lands.' He goes on to praise Islamic extremists in the Middle East and North Africa, describing them as the 'fuel' of jihad but demanding they do not allow Westerners and moderate Muslims 'security and happiness for as long as you have a blinking eye and a pulsing vein.' Militant: Before the audio release, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (shown before his rise to power) was thought to have been injured or possibly even killed during an American air raid last week . The statement was posted online six days after Iraqi officials claimed that Baghdadi had been wounded in an airstrike. It is not clear whether the recording was made before or after the incident. In the recording, Baghdadi vowed to fight the 'crusader campaign' to the bitter end. 'God has ordered us to fight,' he said. 'For that reason the soldiers of the Islamic State are fighting... they will never leave fighting, even if only one soldier remains. They will never leave fighting, because they reject humiliation.' The recording, released on social media networks, appeared authentic, and the voice appeared to match that in previous recordings released by the group. The self-styled caliph called on Muslims to wage holy war everywhere, and to attack and kill 'apostates' in Saudi Arabia and Yemen specifically. An earlier audio recording from al-Baghdadi is believed to have inspired militants in Algeria to kill and behead a French national. Attacks: The audio release - which has not been independently verified - comes just days after Iraqi officials claimed the ISIS chief had at least been injured and may very well be dead after an American airstrike destroyed a convoy of up to 10 vehicles that was travelling in Al Qaim along the Syria-Iraq border . One interesting aspect of recording is that the man believed to be Baghdadi urges militants to focus on defeating their enemies at a local level before battling 'Crusader' forces from the West. That comment is a clear indication that Baghdadi's immediate priority is to expand the area under the control of his so-called caliphate, rather than simply encouraging Al Qaeda-style terror attacks. The speech was not dated but carried a reference to a November 7 U.S. announcement that President Barack Obama had approved sending up to 1,500 more U.S. troops to Iraq. 'O sons of al-Haramayn [Saudi Arabia]...the serpent's head and the stronghold of the disease are there...draw your swords and divorce life, because there should be no security for the Saloul,' he Baghdadi said, using a derogatory term to refer to the leadership of Saudi Arabia. Islamic State has seized swathes of Syria and Iraq, declaring a caliphate over territory it controls in June. Baghdadi said he had accepted oaths of allegiance from supporters in Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Algeria, adding: 'Oh soldiers of the Islamic State...erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere. Light the earth with fire against all dictators.' Global threat: ISIS has seized swathes of Syria and Iraq declaring a caliphate over territory it controls in June . Air strikes: The reports say that U.S. warplanes dropped bombs on the town of al-Qaim in Iraq. Pictured is an earlier strike against ISIS in Kobani, on the Turkey-Syria border . Following last week's claims Baghdadi had been killed, ISIS members took to social media to argue that the terror leader had not been traveling in the same convoy that killed Abu Suja. Other sources stated that senior militants and their tribal allies had informed them that Baghdadi had been either seriously injured or killed in the American airstrike. An Iraqi security official, Hisham al-Hashimi claimed that Abu Suja was 'Baghdadi's very close companion' and was killed in the attack which destroyed up to 10 vehicles. 'He and Baghdadi were rarely separate. It's for this reason that it could be possible that Baghdadi was with him at the time of the attack,' he said. Hashimi revealed that Elefery's death was confirmed to him by relatives.","Audio message purportedly from Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi released today .

"Manchester United are willing to listen to offers for goalkeeper Sam Johnstone. The 21-year-old, who has played for England from Under 16 to Under 20 level, has found it impossible to break into United's first-team following the arrival of David De Gea in 2011. With former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes signing an 18-month contract earlier this month to become their back-up, pushing Anders Lindegaard into the reserves, Johnstone has fallen even further down the pecking order. Manchester United goalkeeper Sam Johnstone has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford . Victor Valdes has come in to the club on a free transfer and is expected to make his debut against Cambridge . He joined Preston on loan last week, where his father Glenn played in goal during the early 1990s, for the remainder of the season. Johnstone only signed a three-and-a-half year contract extension in January last year, but United are open to offers to sign the player on a permanent basis in the summer. Johnstone won the FA Youth Cup with Manchester United in 2011 and was part of England's Under 17 side which won the European Championship in 2010. Anders Lindegaard finds himself third choice and has been playing for the reserve team this season . He has twice made it on the bench for United's senior side, against Stoke in the Capital One Cup and West Ham in the Barclays Premier League, and David Moyes saw the potential to offer him a long-term contract. But United manager Louis Van Gaal does not see a future for him at the club and is ready to let him leave. Johnstone, who joined United's academy in 2009, has had loan spells at Scunthorpe, Walsall, Yeovil and Doncaster Rovers.

"Roy Keane has reignited his war of words with Jose Mourinho, again branding the Chelsea manager 'disgraceful' for attempting to shake his hand before the end of Aston Villa's 3-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge last month. The Villa No 2 last week expressed his anger with Mourinho for disrespecting him and manager Paul Lambert before the final whistle, while the Portuguese responded by saying he would continue to try to shake hands before the end of matches.

The Irishman also responded to Mourinho's claim that he was merely trying to boost sales of his new book when he initially came out and criticised the Chelsea boss. 'It has got nothing to do with the book,' insisted Keane. 'You shake hands with someone at the end of the game. I think it was disgraceful. But do you think I am some sort of robot on a PR trip to sell books?'

"It was a constant and haunting reminder of their young daughter’s brutal murder. For two years, the parents of five-year-old April Jones had driven past her killer’s cottage knowing its four walls hid the final grisly secrets of her death. Yesterday they watched as the bulldozers moved in to demolish the isolated property they dubbed the ‘house from hell’ – and said its destruction had finally set their little girl’s spirit free. Scroll down for video . In mourning: The family of April Jones, mother Coral, centre, father Paul, brother Harley and sister Jasmine watched the house where she was murdered by Mark Bridger being demolished today . House from hell: The cottage rented by Mark Bridger, where he murdered April Jones, is being knocked down and was visited by her parents . Remorseless: Bridger has never admitted April's murder and will remain behind bars for the rest of his life . Watching with husband Paul and their two surviving children, mother Coral Jones wept as workmen razed the whitewashed property where paedophile Mark Bridger is thought to have killed April in October 2012. The 43-year-old said: ‘It is a relief that it is gone and April’s spirit can now be free. ‘She was murdered there and in a brutal way – every time we see it, it’s heartache for us. Even driving on the main road near the village is difficult. ‘You go past and your head ultimately turns to that house. It brings back the horrible memories of what happened. It has opened my wounds up again. It’s the house from hell.’ The family has long pleaded for the destruction of the rented three-bedroom cottage in Ceinws, mid-Wales, which has lain empty since Bridger’s arrest. In an emotional message on Facebook before the demolition, Mrs Jones, of nearby Machynlleth, wrote: ‘April, I am counting the hours down until that house from hell is knocked down and your spirit can go free baby girl.’ Yesterday she wrapped her arms around her daughter Jasmine, 18, and son Harley, 11, as they watched it reduced to rubble. Emotional: The family said they thought of April as the walls of the cottage where she died were torn down . Hand in hand: The family held eachother as they walked towards the 'house from hell' where April died . All gone: The house where April died was completely destroyed this afternoon . She said she did not want a memorial garden built in its place, adding: ‘We want to remember the little girl who loved to make cakes, to sing and dance and jump in puddles, and to keep all the happy memories we have of her.’ Instead, the family want the community to decide what should happen to the site of the cottage, which the Welsh government bought from its owners for £149,000 – the same price they paid for it in 2008. April’s father Paul said the demolition is ‘one chapter closed’ and said it would also stop ‘unwanted guests’ coming to look at the house or taking ghoulish souvenirs. He also praised the local community for their support, adding: ‘I don’t see how we could move anywhere else – if we start running, when do we stop?’ Bridger is serving a whole life sentence for April’s abduction and murder in 2012. Cruel: April's disappearance sparked the biggest search operation in British history, but Bridger's attempts to hide his crime, carried out at home,  meant her body has never been found . Safety first: Builders have fenced off the white-washed cottage as it is razed to the ground . Killer: Mark Bridger, pictured,  murdered April after snatching her and was convicted last year. He is one of only around 50 criminals in British jails given whole life terms . The former abattoir worker is thought to have killed the girl inside the rented cottage after he snatched her from outside her family’s home. Traces of her blood and fragments of a child’s skull were discovered inside the cottage, despite Bridger’s desperate attempts to clean up. He is then thought to have dumped her body, which has never been found despite a huge search operation – and he remains the only person who knows what happened inside the house or where her remains are hidden. During his trial, Bridger claimed he knocked her over in his Land Rover and then ‘forgot’ what he did with her body. Mrs Jones added yesterday: ‘So far he hasn’t said anything and I don’t think he ever will. He has no hold over us. ‘He is there in those four walls and he cannot come back out and hurt any of our family.’ The cottage, named Mount Pleasant, joins a list of properties that have been destroyed because of their connection with horrific crimes – such as the Cromwell Road home of Fred and Rose West in Gloucester. Mark Bridger snatched April Jones and took her to his home where he murdered her - but when police found out he then came up with a series of bizarre and far-fetched excuses. April Jones's murderer was a serial offender with convictions relating to guns, thefts and road rage attacks, but bizarrely he tried to claim his violent past, dating back 28 years. Bridger wanted his criminal record laid bare during his murder trial so the jury would get to know that he had never been in the dock for sexual offences or for having indecent images of children. Taken in: Bridger minutes after his arrest as he was taken in for questioning - the murder then began to spout a series of bizarre lies about what had happened to April . This was despite the father of six having an obsession with child pornography, uncovered after police raided his home following April Jones’s disappearance in October 2012. Having first tried to hide his guilt by helping search for April, police pieced together that he was the prime suspect after his car Land Rover was seen near where she was taken. He then told police that he accidentally ran her over and meant to take her to hospital before ‘blacking out’ because of a combination of drink and panic. A forensic inspection of his car quickly proved this was a pack of lies. The police raided Bridger's home and found he had tried to cover his tracks by trying to clean his house from top to bottom. He had washed his clothes, carpets and upholstery while local people were out searching for April, before placing air fresheners in the rooms and cranking up the heating to dry the rooms quicker. Officers who searched the property said they were overwhelmed by the strong stench of bleach. Shocking: April's blood and bone fragments were found in the lounge of the house but her killer falsely claimed she had been hit by a car . April's blood had also been found in the bathroom - despite Bridger's attempts to clean his house from top to bottom . Cold blooded: Bridger made a number of attempts to hide the murder, but a full forensic examination of his cottage revealed what he had done . But despite this police found blood stains and fragments of April's bones - although her remains were believed to have been thrown in the nearby river. The blood stains had a 'one in a billion' match to April's DNA profile were found near the wood burning stove, on the carpet and on the sofa. April’s blood was found in his living room, hallway, the bathroom door, washing machine door and the shower curtain, the court heard. Once police confronted Bridger about the child skull bones in his fireplace he said that  they were from a chicken supper he cooked for his children. Blood under the carpet at his home was because he placed April in front of  the fire to keep her warm, he said, as part of his lies about hitting her with a car. His then told detectives the child pornography on his computer was because he wanted to track the physical development of his own children.","Coral, Paul Jones and April's siblings hugged as house was pulled down .

"Protesters are gathering in support of Michael Brown in and around St. Louis as they nervously await what many believe will be an inevitable no-indictment vote in the coming days by a grand jury for the officer who shot him. Demonstrators held a 'die-in' Sunday to mark 100 days since the unarmed Ferguson, Missouri teen was killed. They also convened to, among other things, prepare for the imminent court decision by issuing 'rules of engagement' for police there for crowd control, the New York Times reports. Many of the the high-profile protesters met with President Obama and discussed the matter November 5, including Reverend Al Sharpton. It was a meeting the Gateway Pundit notes was not included on the president's daily schedule. Sharpton told the Times that Obama urged the group to 'stay on course.' Scroll down for video . Preparing for the inevitable: A demonstrator marches through the streets during a protest marking the 100th day since the shooting death of Michael Brown in St. Louis, Missouri on November 16 .

Chilling: Snow falls on a memorial on the 100th day since the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson. A crowd of a couple hundred demonstrators took to the streets of St. Louis on Sunday . '[Mr. Obama] was concerned about Ferguson staying on course in terms of pursuing what it was that he knew we were advocating. He said he hopes that we're doing all we can to keep peace.' A crowd of a couple hundred . demonstrators, angry about the fatal August shooting  took to the . streets of St. Louis on Sunday, briefly blocking a major . intersection in protest. Dozens of people lay down in the street outside of a . downtown theater hosting a film festival, pretending to have . been shot by other demonstrators playing the role of police officers . in an action intended to evoke the memory of 18-year-old Brown, who died 100 days ago in front of his home in the suburb . of Ferguson. On course:  Rev. Al Sharpton revealed the President secretly met with Ferguson protestors . Marchers went on to briefly block a major intersection near . Washington University and the event ended without any of the . violence that was seen in Ferguson following Brown's shooting death . by police officer Darren Wilson. 'This is a mature movement. It is a different movement that . it was in August. Then it just had anger, justifiable anger,' said DeRay McKesson, a 29-year-old protest leader, as wet snow . fell on the city. 'Now we are organized. We are strategizing. And we are going to bring our message to the power structure.' A grand jury, sitting in the county seat of Clayton,Missouri, is currently deliberating whether to bring criminal charges against Wilson. Many residents and officials in the region fear another wave of rioting similar to the one in August that led to the burning out of multiple businesses if the grand jury decides not to charge Wilson. 'We are bracing for that possibility. That is what many people are expecting. The entire community is going to be upset,' if Wilson is not indicted, said Jose Chavez, 46, a leader of the local Latinos en Axion group. There have been conflicting witness accounts of the . shooting, with some saying that Brown had his hands up in . surrender while others have described it as a struggle . between Brown and Wilson. Ferguson and its surroundings have been fairly quiet the . last few days as both police and protesters plan their response to . the grand jury's report. 'We've decided not to wait for that decision. We've decided . to get started,' said Rockit Ali, a 22-year-old organizer of . Sunday's demonstration, who marched in a Spider-Man mask.

'There is no revolution without violence.' From Boston to Los Angeles, police departments are bracing for large demonstrations when the grand jury decides. The St. Louis County grand jury, which has been meeting since August 20, is expected to decide this month whether Officer Darren Wilson is charged with a crime for killing 18-year-old Michael Brown after ordering him and a friend to stop walking in the street on August 9. For some cities, a decision in the racially charged case will, inevitably, reignite long-simmering debates over local police relations with minority communities. 'It's definitely on our radar,' said Lt. Michael McCarthy, police spokesman in Boston, where police leaders met privately Wednesday to discuss preparations. 'Common sense tells you the timeline is getting close. We're just trying to prepare in case something does step off, so we are ready to go with it.' In Los Angeles, rocked by riots in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers in the videotaped beating of Rodney King, police officials say they've been in touch with their counterparts in Missouri, where Gov. Jay Nixon and St. Louis-area law enforcement held a news conference this week on their own preparations. A St. Louis County town that neighbors Ferguson, Missouri, is warning residents to prepare for potential unrest that may follow the grand jury announcement in the Michael Brown case. Berkeley officials passed out flyers this week urging its 9,000 residents to be prepared just as they would in the event of a major storm, with plenty of food, water and medicine on hand in case they're unable to leave home for several days. The flyer says Lambert Airport will be protected by the National Guard, but airport spokesman Jeff Lea says that's wrong. Lea says the airport will continue to be protected by its own security force. Brown was killed Aug. 9 by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson. A grand jury is expected to decide this month whether to charge Wilson. A suburban St. Louis school district says schools will get early notice once the Ferguson grand jury reaches a decision. A letter on the Hazelwood School District's site from Superintendent Grayling Tobias says the St. Louis County prosecutor's office will alert districts 24 hours before the media if the decision is on a weekend. If it's a weekday, Tobias says districts will learn three hours before media, so students can be sent home before potential protests. District spokesman Jack Wang says districts won't be told what the decision is. The grand jury is expected to decide this month whether to charge white Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old who was black and unarmed. A prosecutor's office spokesman didn't return messages seeking comment. Indict America: Protesters made some startling statements as they awaited the grand jury decision . 'Naturally, we always pay attention,' said Cmdr. Andrew Smith, a police spokesman. 'We saw what happened when there were protests over there and how oftentimes protests spill from one part of the country to another.' In Las Vegas, police joined pastors and other community leaders this week to call for restraint at a rally tentatively planned northwest of the casino strip when a decision comes. In Boston, a group called Black Lives Matter, which has chapters in other major cities, is organizing a rally in front of the police district office in the Roxbury neighborhood the day after an indictment decision. In Albuquerque, New Mexico, police are expecting demonstrations after having dealt with a string of angry protests following a March police shooting of a homeless camper and more than 40 police shootings since 2010. Philadelphia police spokesman Lt. John Stanford said he anticipated his city will see demonstrations, regardless of what the grand jury returns. But big-city police departments stressed they're well-equipped to handle crowds. Many saw large but mostly peaceful demonstrations following the 2013 not-guilty verdict in the slaying of Florida teen Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman. In New York, hundreds of protesters marched from Union Square north to Times Square, where a sit-in caused gridlock. The New York Police Department, the largest in the nation, is 'trained to move swiftly and handle events as they come up,' spokesman Stephen Davis said. In Boston, McCarthy said the city's 2,200 sworn police officers have dealt with the range of public actions, from sports fans spontaneously streaming into the streets following championship victories to protest movements like Occupy. 'The good thing is that our relationships here with the community are much better than they are around the world,' he said. 'People look to us as a model. Boston is not Ferguson.'

"Islamic State fighters routinely rape girls as young as nine held hostage at the terror group's training camps, it has been claimed. A purported former IS member turned whistleblower says all the group's fighters are told it is their God-given right to rape non-Muslim prisoners. He claimed that those preparing to sacrifice themselves on suicide missions are particularly encouraged to subject prisoners to depraved sexual ordeals, and that many of those would-be martyrs are British. Scroll down for video . Violence: A whistleblower has claimed that British Islamic State fighters routinely rape girls as young as nine held hostage at the terror group's training camps . 'I saw many foreign recruits who were put in the suicide squads not because they were ""great and God wanted it"" as IS commanders praised them in front of us, but basically because they were useless for IS,' said the whistleblower, calling himself Sherko Omer. 'They spoke no Arabic, they weren’t good fighters and had no professional skills. They were brainwashed into the “women in heaven” and those they could rape on earth before they eventually killed themselves.' Among other dramatic claims, Mr Omer said: . * Islamic State fighters are promised 72 'eternal virgins' in heaven if they are martyred while fighting for the group; . * Non-Muslim women help captive are fair game for sexual exploitation because 'God wills it'; . * Some Muslim women who join the group are promised rewards in the hereafter if they willingly offer their bodies to jihadists in 'Sex for Jihad' programmes - although it is mostly commanders who benefit; . * Turkish soldiers turn a blind eye to the movements of extremists back-and-forth across the border with Syria. Encouraged: The Iraqi Kurd claimed  those preparing to sacrifice themselves on suicide missions are particularly encouraged to subject prisoners to depraved sexual ordeals . Mr Omer, an Iraqi Kurd whose real identity has been hidden behind a pseudonym for security reasons, gave his account of life within Islamic State's militia in a exlusive Q&A with Kurdish journalist Rozh Ahmad. In the article published by Your Middle East, he described how he was tricked into joining the extremist group after initially trying to join the Free Syrian Army to fight the regime of President Bashar Assad. He said Islamists within the Kurdish community in Halabja, northern Iraq, arranged for him to meet contacts in Turkey who took him to a training camp on that country's border with Syria. It was only when he arrived that he realised he had been brought to an Islamic State camp. Because of Mr Omer's technical background, he was not drilled for the battlefield but instead trained as a communications and technological expert. Brotherhood: The whistleblower described IS commanders as 'very nice and respectful', while in the camp but he soon witnessed events, such as sleeping with women prisoners, that he felt compromised his moral values . He said that as a new recruit he found that Islamic State commanders were 'very nice and respectful at the camp', and there was an atmosphere of 'friendship and brotherhood'. But he soon saw things that he felt compromised his moral values. 'IS emirs and commanders ... believe it is permissible to sleep with women prisoners even against their will if they are infidels, non-Muslims and apostate women,' he said. 'This happened to Christian women in Al-Raqqa after their husbands were publically beheaded and I witnessed it... 'I saw six jihadists demanding that a Christian woman and her daughter become their wives. The daughter was about 12-13-years-old. 'I told the jihadists forcing women is forbidden in Islam and children can't be touched under any circumstances. They loaded their guns in my face and told me to leave.' Mr Omer said he took the decision to escape from Islamic State after he witnessed the beheading of a fellow Kurd, a fighter for the Kurdish People's Protection Units who was captured in battle.","Ex-member says fighters told it is their 'right to rape non-Muslim prisoners'

"A sergeant with the Detroit Police Department has been found wearing a dead victim's expensive watch several months after he was in charge of the man's murder investigation. Homicide sergeant Alex Vinson has been suspended from his position and his department is now asking prosecutors to review the case to bring any potential charges. Vinson was in charge of a case several months ago in which the unidentified victim's belongings included an expensive, German-made watch, Police Chief James Craig told the Detroit News. The watch was photographed and placed with other evidence in the homicide unit's property room before the case went cold. Caught: Sergeant Alex Vinson, who works for the Detroit Police Department, was found wearing the watch of a murder victim. He had presided over the case, which went cold, a few months ago, police said . But earlier this week, detectives decided to reopen the case and went to collect the evidence. When they removed the watch, they realized that it did not match up with the item in the photograph and that it had been switched for a less-expensive one, police said. An internal investigation was launched and the FBI helped the police track it down. Vinson was attending advanced police training in Idaho at the time - and the police learned he was wearing the watch there, Craig said. Police Chief James Craig (pictured) said that the sergeant had been suspended and could face charges after he was found wearing a watch from a murder victim.

"Michael Brown struggled with the cop who killed him and tried to grab the officer's gun, a report has claimed. Darren Wilson - the police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, who shot the teenager - has told investigators he feared for his life when he opened fire. He claims he was trying to get out of his police car when Brown pushed him back into the driver's seat and reached for his gun through the open window. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: This is the first picture of Darren Wilson standing over Michael Brown after shooting him dead . Claims: Wilson, pictured again surveying the body, insists he fired from inside the car during a tussle but his account did not explain why the unarmed teenager was then shot at least four times outside the vehicle . The teenager punched and scratched him repeatedly, he claims, leaving him with swelling on his face and cuts on his neck. Eventually, Wilson said, he pulled his gun from the holster on his right hip, fired two shots, and one hit Brown's arm - leaving his blood smeared inside the car and on his uniform. However the account leaked to the New York Times last night stops there, and does not explain why Brown was then shot four times outside the car. A number of witnesses agree that Brown and Wilson were embroiled in a physical fight through the car window, but few had an accurate vantage point to see what was happening. They insist, however, the teenager was trying to flee and holding up his hands. One passer-by, Tiffany Mitchell, is certain Brown was leaning away but Wilson kept pulling him closer. Another, Dorian Johnson, said Wilson grasped Brown's throat and then pulled out his gun threatening to shoot. They then heard shots fired from inside the SUV. There remains no account from witnesses or police of the final four shots fired. According to Wilson's description of the August 9 shooting - revealed for the first time today - Brown made him fear for his life. 'Self defense': Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson says he feared for his life as he shot Michael Brown . Police officers are generally given more scope for lethal force if they reasonably believe that their life is in imminent danger. Investigators are now examining the officer's claim that the teenager physically assaulted him as a grand jury considers whether he is guilty of a number of crimes including: first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter. City officials claim there is still not enough evidence to charge Wilson with violating civil rights. In September, Officer Wilson appeared  before a St Louis County grand jury, which was convened to determine whether there is probable cause that he committed a crime. His willingness to testify surprised many. However, his account of feeling vulnerable will be a significant boost in his favor as the grand jury considers its verdict before the deadline of January 7. Nine of the 12 jury members will have to vote against Wilson in order for charges to be leveled. They are expected to vote by mid-November. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch could have bypassed the grand jury stage and simply taken the case to trial by filing a charge against Wilson. He could also have filed a complaint to a judge who decides if there should be a trial. However, McCulloch chose to take the full investigation of Wilson’s use of deadly force to the grand jury, leaving the 12 members to decide. According to the New York Times, the leaked account of his version of events did not come from the Ferguson Police Department or from officials whose activities are being investigated as part of the civil rights inquiry. People claiming to have witnessed the shooting have given wildly different accounts of what happened. Some have said that some the young man had his arms raised over his head while others claim that Wilson shot him while his back was turned and he was running. The police have maintained that the unarmed teen physically assaulted the officer and tried to get his gun. One witness, whose name has been withheld, from St. Louis, Missouri, told the grand jury that the teenager did not have his hands above his head when Wilson shot at him, but rather 'out to his sides.' Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times by Officer Wilson in the middle of a Ferguson, Missouri, street. His death prompted outrage in the community and resulted in several investigations . He also said Brown 'staggered toward Wilson despite commands to stop' and that 'the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired.' Protests in Missouri have continued ever since the shooting amid claims it was unjustified - and an extreme example of police brutality in the town. Civil rights groups say Brown's death is part of a national epidemic in which a disproportionately high number of unarmed black men are fatally shot by white police officers, an allegation police deny. Officials said that the evidence given so far did not support civil rights charges against Officer Wilson. To press charges, the Justice Department would have to prove that he wilfully violated Brown's rights when he shot him.","Officer Darren Wilson claimed he and Brown struggled in his police car .

"A cruise ship was trying today to rescue hundreds of people stranded aboard a fishing trawler off Cyprus, and officials said they are apparently refugees who fled Syria. Salamis Cruise Lines Managing Director Kikis Vasiliou told The Associated Press that one of its cruise ships has been instructed to change course and pick up the estimated 300 people, mostly women and children. A Cypriot Defense Ministry statement said the small boat 'most likely' set sail from Syria loaded with 'civilian refugees.' SOS: A large fishing trawler overloaded with people in the Mediterranean Sea that a cruise liner is attempting to assist. This picture was taken by a Cypriot army helicopter . Vasiliou said the company received the request from Cypriot Search and Rescue authorities to assist in the rescue operation Thursday morning while the cruise ship was returning to Cyprus from the Greek islands. The Defense Ministry said the small boat is located about 50 nautical miles off Cyprus' southwestern coastal town of Paphos. Vasiliou said the cruise ship, with a crew of 230 and a passenger capacity of 800, would be able to give rescued people blankets, medical care and food while taking them to the Cypriot port of Limassol. The Cyprus Defense Ministry said the small boat is located about 50 nautical miles off Cyprus' southwestern coastal town of Paphos . No reason was given why the boat issued its emergency call, but a Defense Ministry statement said it was because of 'inclement weather conditions' in the area.

"Airstrikes in Syria could stir up lone wolf terrorists carry out attacks on U.S. soil in retaliation for the American incursion into the war-torn country, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have warned. A U.S.-led coalition has hit dozens of ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria in the last three days in an effort to thwart the extremist terrorist group and spot them plotting attacks against the U.S. However, the FBI and Homeland Security sent out a bulletin to police departments around the country on Tuesday that the military strikes could provoke new attacks from terrorists already in the U.S. - with 'little or no warning.' Fighting back: U.S. strikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq could stir up homegrown lone wolf terrorists to carry out attacks on American soil, the FBI and Homeland Security have warned . 'We believe these strikes will contribute to homegrown violent extremists’… broader grievances about U.S. military intervention in predominantly Muslim lands, possibly motivating Homeland attacks,' the federal government warned. The greatest risk at this time is not from ISIS or other terrorist organizations plotting large-scale attacks on U.S. soil, the agencies said. Instead, local police should be on the lookout for attack similar to the Boston Marathon bombings, which were carried out by two brothers who became radicalized by online Islamist propaganda, but were not affiliated with al-Qaeda or any other terrorist network. Three people were killed and 264 were wounded on April 15, 2013 when the brothers detonated two homemade pressure cooker bombs packed with gunpowder from fireworks and nails and ball bearings. ISIS uses a sophisticated and highly visible propaganda operation on social media that had drawn hundreds of westerners to Syria and Iraq to fight on their side. Homegrown terrorists: The Tsarnaev brothers who carried out the Boston Marathon bombing were not connected to a terror group - but were radicalized by online extremist propaganda . According to the FBI bulletin, the group has already called on followers to carry out 'lone offender attacks in the Homeland in retaliation for U.S. military operations in Iraq and Syria.' American diplomats convinced  five Sunni Muslim nations - Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Bahrain - to help carry out strikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, in attempt to increase their legitimacy in the Arab World. However, the New York Times reports that American fighter jets and cruise missiles from American destroyers are carrying out nearly all of the strikes - with occasional assistance from Arab allies.","U.S. has targeted ISIS strongholds and targets where terrorists were plotting attacks on America .

"Passengers were left terrified after a plane lost one of its propellers in a bird strike but continued with the rest of the hour-long flight on just one engine. The Flybe service had just taken off from Guernsey for Birmingham when startled travellers heard a loud bang on the left side of the aircraft. They looked out and saw the front cone of the prop had been smashed and the remains of a bird could be seen on the jagged edge. Scroll for video . Smashed: The Flybe plane's propeller was smashed in a bird strike after take off . But to their alarm, the captain announced that instead of turning round, the 78-seat Bombadier Dash-8 would carry on with the single remaining engine. Airport worker Dan Brehaut, 23, travelling with his girlfriend Joanne Corlett, 25, said he was shocked the crew didn't declare an emergency and land. Dan, an aircraft despatcher from Guernsey, who also filmed the incident on his mobile phone, said: 'It is very unusual for an engine to shut down. 'It's not unheard of - I have heard stories about it - but I have never seen an aircraft sustain that amount of damage to it and carry on. Dan Brehaut and Joanne Corlett were on board the flight and reported hearing a 'loud bang' 'Usually planes will land with a problem over the smallest of things, so it just seemed so unusual. 'When that bit of the prop came off, it could have very easily gone into the engine, and that would be the engine on fire. 'It could have hit the elevator - that's the bit that pitches the aircraft to climb or descend - if you don't have that, the plane crashes. 'Of course, there is nothing that anyone could do about hitting a bird, but I was just more concerned they carried on regardless. 'They took quite a while to shut the engine down - maybe 20 minutes into the flight - and then to carry on flying for the rest of the flight with just one engine. 'If something happened to that one engine, the plane would have just dropped out of the sky. An airport worker inspects the damage to the Flybe plane after it landed in Birmingham . 'They would have had to put the remaining engine on max thrust and it is not supposed to be at full speed for the whole flight. 'It was very unusual for them to carry on. I can only assume it was a case of the pilots wanted to be at home in Birmingham for the night.' Dan and Joanne were travelling to a family party on the 10.30am flight last Saturday when the drama happened. They heard a 'loud bang' shortly after take-off and a cabin assistant reported the damage to the flightdeck. Dan said: 'She went and reported it back to the flight crew on the phone at the front of the cabin, and I got my phone out and started filming the prop through the window. 'I could see a bird's claw was hanging off the prop. 'Shortly after one of the pilots came back and had a look out and then returned to the cockpit. Full emergency: Dan, who was on board the flight, said there were eight fire engines and four operational vehicles waiting for the Flybe plane at Birmingham airport . 'There was a PA announcement from the first officer I think saying that as a precaution they were going to shut the engine down as it was wobbling a lot. 'The aircraft was also vibrating more than normal, but they said they were going to continue all the way to Birmingham. 'I immediately thought that was unusual. There had been talk of diverting to Exeter. 'When we got too Birmingham they had declared a full emergency. There was eight fire engines and I think four operational vehicles.' Dan claimed that he and another passenger were warned not to photograph the damage when they exited the plane. He added: 'The cheek of it. We'd just had to sit on that plane.' The incident was reported to the Civil Aviation Authority who record all 'birdstrikes'. A CAA spokesman said: 'We have received a Mandatory Occurrence Report (MOR) from Flybe relating to a birdstrike, which occurred during a flight on November 8th.

Following the leader's public re-emergence last month, the North Korean Ambassador in London, Hyon Hak Bong, told the BBC that there was ‘no doubt about it’ that Kim was healthy. But his comments came as a source told the Daily Mail that the 31-year-old had spent a few weeks in a Beijing hospital having his stomach tied, or ‘banded’, to help him fight his weight gain. In September, it was claimed Kim has been putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of Emmental cheese, which he got a taste for while a student in Switzerland. He has also been treated for sprains or fractures, to his ankles - a problem that developed after he injured a leg while joining troops in a military exercise in August. It has since been speculated that, as he continued to limp around, his weight added to the pressure on both legs, resulting in him seeking medical treatment for both that injury and his weight gain.

The 29-year-old played an integral role as Real Madrid won the Champions League last season . Ronaldo scored a staggering 56 goals in 51 appearances for Real as they won four trophies in 2014 . 37.7 per cent of the votes went to Ronaldo - a figure double the amount of Messi and Neuer . Ballon d'Or: Cristiano Ronaldo . Women's world player of the year: Nadine Kessler . Puskas award: James Rodriguez . World coach of the year for men's football: Joachim Low . World coach of the year for women's football: Ralf Kellermann . World XI: Neuer; Lahm, Ramos, David Luiz, Thiago Silva; Di Maria, Iniesta, Kroos; Messi, Ronaldo, Robben . FIFA presidential award: Hiroshi Kagawa . FIFA fair play award: FIFA volunteers . In marched Ronaldo first, peacock proud, chest puffed out; a glistening diamond in each ear, not a hair out of place, a man who – with 31 goals in 30 La Liga games in 2014 – looked every inch the superstar. Messi shuffled in next, ahead of Manuel Neuer, in a grey hoodie and jeans, appearing as if he had just walked out of the classroom. There had been anxieties within FIFA that Messi might not turn up for their big night and the Argentine hardly gave the impression of wanting to be in Switzerland. He scored a staggering 56 goals in 2014 but, unlike his rival, he will not look back with any kind of affection; a failure to reach the last four of the Champions League, a lost World Cup final and recent simmering tensions at the Nou Camp have knocked Messi from his pedestal. Did he try and steal some of the spotlight back here? Perhaps. Turning up for the actual ceremony in a garish purple tuxedo, Messi set tongues wagging with a cryptic answer to an innocuous question from the floor, hinting that the unthinkable – leaving Barcelona – might be possible. 'I'm not sure if I will go back to Newells Old Boys one day,' said Messi. 'I'm not sure where I will be next year. I have always said I will end my career at Barcelona but as Cristiano said, only God knows the future. Things can change in football overnight.' Cue a raising of eyebrows. If Messi is sulking about Barcelona's current state, he didn't try to hide his emotions. When a video with a message from current coach Luis Enrique was shown, wishing him well for the award, Messi's face never cracked. Enrique's words during the broadcast were equally cold. Asked later to define his relationship with Enrique, Messi bluntly replied: 'A manager-player relationship, just like any other.' Messi (right), who finished second, arrived on the red carpet with his partner Antonella Roccuzzo . The diminutive superstar is mobbed by fans on the carpet as he signs autographs . Messi (centre right) captained Argentina to the World Cup final where they lost to Germany after extra-time . The 27-year-old (centre) scored 50 goals in 52 appearances for Barcelona last season . He was only third behind Ronaldinho and Frank Lampard in the 2005 Ballon d’Or but Steven Gerrard won a special prize via social media on Monday night. Twitter users mocked last season’s infamous slip in the crucial defeat against Chelsea by awarding the Liverpool captain the ‘2014 Fallon D’Floor’. Clearly all is not well. Messi is not doing anything to quell the storm that is brewing around him and it did not go unnoticed that he voted for Jose Mourinho in his top three coaches of the year. Coming a week after he started following Chelsea on Instagram, the conspiracy theories will run. This night, however, was about more than Messi. It was a coronation of genius, which is what Ronaldo is; it should not be taken for granted what he has achieved or what he has become since he first came to our attention as a spindly yearling in the summer of 2003. Ronaldo has matured into the most magnificent specimen. Tall, powerful, with the neck of a boxer and the speed of a sprinter, his third Ballon d'Or puts him up with Gods such as Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten. Joining Messi on four will be a certainty if he holds his form. 'This is one of the happiest nights of my life,' he said shortly after coming off stage. 'Fantastic. It was a dream come true for me. I never thought I would win three Gold Balls. Fantastic. I want to win as many as possible. It's hard, it's very difficult to win. But everything is possible. 'A fourth? It depends on what I am going to do during the season but this is going to give me motivation to work hard and get myself more and more and we will see if I am here next year. It's more difficult to win it the third time than the first time.' During that early afternoon Q-and-A, Messi, the outstanding Neuer – a keeper who 'dominates absolutely everything', according to Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola – and Ronaldo had been asked which players from the past they would have most like to work with. None, out of fear of being received to be disrespectful, felt it appropriate to pick out an individual, so Ronaldo played to the gallery and said it would be nice 'if us three guys' could be on the same team. Messi then cracked and said Ronaldo had been excellent. The internet can be a cruel place as social network users were quick to mock Steven Gerrard . Third-placed Neuer signs autographs on the red carpet ahead of the Ballon d'Or Gala on Monday . Neuer (left) was a mainstay in the Bayern team that won the Bundesliga and German Cup last season . The 28-year-old's brilliant year was completed by helping Germany to win the World Cup last summer . So how did it feel to hear that from his greatest rival? 'Listening to Leo felt good,' said Ronaldo. 'Listening to my team-mates and rivals say good things feels great. Especially Leo. I think the same about him. Maybe he has helped me become a better player. People mention that and it's possible. It's good. 'I hope he does that for many years to motivate me to win more things for the club and individual things too. This gives me motivation to be a better player all the time. I'm really happy, it's a fantastic moment in my career. 'I want to carry on with more titles, collective and individual, and see if we are here again next year.' If they are, it will be the ninth consecutive year they have shared this particular stage. Some may argue there is no fun in a two-horse race but this, beyond question, is a rivalry to be savoured. There may never be another like it. The trio were all included in the FIFPro World Team of the Year which is selected by their peers . 61 - Number of goals scored in 2014 for club and country . 9 - Ronaldo’s major honours in 2014, including the Champions League, Copa del Rey, La Liga top scorer and the Ballon d’Or . 142 million - Ronaldo’s social media following...more than the population of Japan . 62 - Number of minutes per goal scored in La Liga . 1st - The Portuguese attacker is the first Real Madrid player to win the Ballon d’Or in two consecutive years . 22 - Number of assists he provided in 2014 .","Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo attended Monday's Ballon d'Or Gala .

Dressed in an open-neck blue shirt and wearing sunglasses, the 29-year-old royal pulled faces when fellow revellers at a music festival saw through his disguise and yelled ‘Hello Harry’ as he soared past.

Fun-loving: Prince Harry dons a comical straw hat emblazoned with a Union Flag as he enjoys a fairground ride . Sunglasses: The royal pulled faces when fellow revellers at a music festival saw through his disguise . One festival-goer at the Secret Garden Party in Huntingdon even photographed him stripping off his shirt – causing much excitement among females nearby. Michaela Baker, who filmed Harry on the fairground ride at the festival said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I got on the ride and saw Harry next to me. ‘He had a really good time and was waving his arms around and encouraging others to.’ The event, described as the ‘festival for professional party-goers’, is held in a beautiful landscaped garden in Cambridgeshire. It attracts some 20,000 music lovers each year but has a chequered past. Twenty people were arrested there last year for possession of drugs and a man was taken to hospital after taking a suspected drug overdose. Enjoying himself: Harry rides on a giant swing at the Secret Garden Party in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire . On the ride: Harry was later seen at the festival dancing to acts including Clean Bandit and Foxes .

Harry, who celebrates his 30th birthday on September 15, quit his role an Apache helicopter pilot in the Army Air Corps earlier this year to take a Ministry of Defence desk job in London in order to bring the Invictus Games to Britain. The event, which will be held from September 10 to 14 at the Olympic Park in London, will see 600 wounded servicemen and women from 14 countries compete in a Paralympic-style games.

"Manchester United's summer target Arturo Vidal has aggravated his troublesome knee whilst on international duty for Chile. The Juventus star had to quit a routine training session in Miami, where Chile face Mexico and Haiti in friendlies, but is set to have a series of tests before returning to Italy. Vidal was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford throughout the summer, but nothing materialised despite a series of negotiations between the clubs. VIDEO Scroll down for Massimiliano  Allegri: Vidal happy to stay at Juventus . Opening win: Arturo Vidal featured in Juventus' 1-0 win at Chievo in Serie A before the international break . The 27-year-old required knee surgery towards the end of last season and was evidently far from fully fit at the World Cup. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is an admirer of Vidal but was hesitant to fork out a significant fee, with question marks surrounding the player's fitness. Instead, United paid a British record fee of £60million for Angel di Maria. These concerns could be justified as Vidal might have to go back for more surgery in an attempt to alleviate the niggling problem. If so, the Chilean will be on the sidelines for a considerable amount of time. New Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri will be frustrated by the revelations as he is trying to cope without talismanic playmaker Andrea Pirlo, who is out until October. Midfield force: The Chile midfielder was a top summer transfer target of Manchester United .

"Keith Millen said Dwight Gayle’s hat-trick, that brushed aside Walsall, will lift the gloom that has hung heavy around Crystal Palace. The caretaker manager admitted the text scandal, revealed by Sportsmail that engulfed prospective boss Malky Mackay and sporting director Iain Moody, exacerbating Tony Pulis’s departure, had made life difficult for the club. But three clinical first-half strikes from Gayle saw Palace obtain their first win of the season and progress to the third round of the Capital One Cup. VIDEO Scroll down for Keith Millen: It's been a strange few days at Crystal Palace . Clinical: Dwight Gayle fired in his opener for Crystal Palace after just seven minutes with a smart finish . Class above: Gayle was the difference in the first half as Palace proved their Premier League class at Walsall . Walsall: O'Donnell, Kinsella, Holden, Taylor, Downing, Chambers, Sawyers (Baxendale 61), Forde (Benning 75), Grimes, Clifford (Flanagan 61), Bradshaw. Subs Not Used: O'Connor, MacGillivray, Morris, Bakayoko. Crystal Palace: Hennessey, McCarthy, Mariappa, Williams, Delaney (Hangeland 45), Thomas, Williams (Garvan 75), Guédioura, Bannan, Gayle (Gray 62), Murray. Subs Not Used: Kettings, Boateng, Kaikai, Puncheon. Goals: Gayle 7, 25, 41. Att: 3,987 . ‘As a group of people we really needed that,’ said Millen. ‘It’s no been easy but you don’t want to make excuses. ‘It will give everyone a lift. Coming in Thursday there will be a lot more smiles on the faces.’ Gayle pressed strong claims for a start against Newcastle on Saturday. ‘His hat-trick was fantastic, his finishing was really good. It gives me a nice selection problem for the weekend. He showed how clinical he can be and that’s at any level he can be at.’ Millen made nine changes to the team which lost 3-1 at home to West Ham but Gayle was the most important. ‘The team gave me the chances and I felt confident of taking them,’ Gayle said afterwards. It took him just seven minutes to make his mark. Referee Darren Drysdale harshly penalised Walsall captain Adam Chambers for handball and as he protested Adlene Guedioura slipped a quick free-kick to Gayle. In charge: Caretaker Manager Keith Millen was in the dugout again for Crystal Palace as they cruised to the win . Up for the fight: Barry Bannan (left) attempts to win back possession as Crystal Palace eased to victory . He beat the offside trap, sprinted into the area, and drove a finish past Richard O’Donnell from a tight angle. Walsall were actually controlling possession but Palace were the team with penetration. Walsall midfielder Billy Clifford had a couple of shots from range which tested deputy goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey but when Glenn Murray went on a marauding run for the visitors midway through the half, it signalled genuine danger. Chambers brought Murray down and Gayle dispatched the resulting free-kick low and with venom just inside the near post. He was looking super sharp and claimed his hat-trick four minutes before the interval. Jerome Thomas played a well-weighted ball through and Gayle twisted defender Paul Downing inside out before powering a shot beyond O’Donnell. The opponents may only have been from League One - the division below where Gayle made his name at Peterborough - but on this form he looks worth the inflated fee of £8m Palace purportedly handed over. Hero: Gayle celebrates in front of the away fans after completing his first-half hat-trick in the Capital One Cup . He brought intelligent runs, pace and that aura required by top-class strikers. It reminded you of the brace he scored against Liverpool that stunned Brendan Rodgers and blew their title hopes away towards the end of last season. Walsall are yet to win in League One this season and this match gave an indication why. They can retain the ball handsomely but do little with it. Their edge is more comfy than cutting. Five minutes after the break Ashley Grimes went closest, bending a delicious shot against the post with Hennessey well beaten. But it was Palace who continued to threaten more keenly. Murray flashed a shot from range just wide and Jonny Williams tested O’Donnell with a thumping shot inside the box. Neil Warnock, Steve Clarke and Neil Lennon lead the bookmakers’ odds for next to take up position in the Selhurst Park dugout but at one stage in this match travelling fans sung: ‘Who needs a manager?’ Millen could yet continue his role further but Gayle showed the value of having a forward with predatory instincts.

"Isis are using ‘significant quantities’ of US-made weapons to spread their reign of terror across the Middle East, according to a new report. This finding came from London-based research group Conflict Armament Research (CAR) after it conducted on-the-ground investigations in Iraq and Syria. It’s been known for a while that Isis has been using U.S military hardware, but CAR’s study is the first by a non-government body to try and document in detail what hardware the terrorist group, also known as the Islamic State (IS), is deploying. Scroll down for video . U.S weapons: An investigation by a London-based research team has found that Isis is using large quantities of American-made arms. Pictured is an Isis fighter holds a flag and a weapon  in Mosul, Iraq, in June . Hardware: An American-made M16A4 assault rifle that CAR documented in the Middle East after it was recovered from Isis forces . Logistics: CAR noted that Isis appears to have a very well-organised supply system as weapons had been transferred with speed across large distances . CAR’s report said: ‘Islamic State forces have captured significant quantities of US-manufactured small arms and have employed them on the battlefield.’ The Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) and the Kurdish Regional Government Peshmerga Forces in Iraq habitually use recovered Isis weaponry to supplement their firepower, but CAR said it documented U.S weapons just two days after their capture, so they could be easily differentiated. Small arms being used by Isis include American M16A4 assault rifles and XM15-E2S semi-automatic rifles. CAR also noted that Isis appears to have a very well-organised supply system as weapons had been transferred with speed across large distances. It said: ‘YPG forces captured US-made material documented close to Ayn al-Arab, Syria, roughly two weeks after the fall of Mosul to IS forces. ‘The distance between the two regions is roughly 500 km. The speed of transfer to Ayn al-Arab demonstrates the logistical competence of IS forces and the strategic importance of Ayn al-Arab to the group.’ Worrying: M79 90mm anti-tank rockets captured from IS forces in Syria . Brutal: A Chinese PKM-pattern M80 machine gun that was being used by Isis . Forbidding: These photographs show how Isis has acquired some powerful equipment . Small arms being used by Isis include American M16A4 assault rifles and XM15 semi-automatic rifles . Other weapons Isis is using include M79 90mm anti-tank rockets given to the Free Syrian Army by Saudi Arabia, Chinese-made M80 general-purpose machine guns and a Croatian Elmech sniper rifle. CAR noted that the origin of many weapons was disguised by an unknown party using used oxy-acetylene torches or arc-welders to remove the serial numbers. CAR director James Bevan told MailOnline: ‘Excluding activities by state intelligence services, of which we know little and are not in the public domain, this is the first time anyone has sent a field investigation team to document captured IS weapons.’ The study's findings were revealed as news emerged that Britain has begun arming the Kurds to fight back against ISIS. David Cameron told MPs, in a statement following last week’s Nato summit in Newport, that Britain ‘will continue to support the Kurds, including by providing them with arms and training their troops’. Until now the Government has limited itself to transporting weapons from former Soviet countries to the Kurds, for example from Albania. But Mr Cameron was asked if Britain will now be providing the Kurdish peshmerga militia directly with arms. The Prime Minister responded: ‘The short answer to that is yes.’ Britain has also offered to train the Kurdish fighters.","London-based Conflict Armament Research investigated Isis weaponry .

"A woman has lost over 10 stone after a stranger threw a drink at her on a night out and told her she was disgusting. Steph Hammel, 25, was devastated when she was humiliated in front of all of her friends and a bar full of strangers after the man threw a drink at her on the stairs of a bar in her hometown of Preston. It was the turning point Steph needed to finally do something about her 22st 5lb frame. Steph managed to shed an impressive 10 stone after the eye opening event at a bar in her home town . Now, she weighs just 11st 13lb and is a size 12 - and has been crowned Woman of the Year by the Cambridge Weight Plan. Steph, who is a local government authority officer, said: 'I was never a skinny girl, even when I was younger, but I was never fat either. I danced four times a week and was competing in championships on nearly a weekly basis. 'I would always be nervous when I went on a night out, but the night it happened I had made the effort with my hair and make up, and worn a dress. I felt really confident which is why it came as such a blow. 'He walked right up to me, turned round and said, ‘Look at the state of you. You’re disgusting,’ and threw his drink at me. Although her father made healthy food at home, Steph would buy crisps and sweets with her own money and eat them in secret, causing her weight to balloon . 'Nobody should be made to feel the way that man made me feel, but it finally gave me the push I needed to do something about my weight. 'If I met him now I’d shake his hand because without him I never would have done anything about my size.' Steph started putting on weight when she stopped dancing aged 17. Although her father made healthy food at home, she would buy crisps and sweets with her own money and eat them in secret. Steph said: 'I thought that if no one saw me doing it, then I hadn’t done it, which is never a good way to be. The incident on her friends birthday forced Steph to look at the risks associated with her unhealthy lifestyle . 'By the time I realised that my weight was going up, it was too late. By then I was a size 26.' Steph’s diet was always put on the backburner until the turning point came while out for her friend’s birthday. She says: 'I went to the toilets on my own and was going back down the stairs to find my friends as this young man was coming up. 'Luckily, my friend was coming up the stairs as it happened because I was furious.' But the incident forced Steph to look at the risks associated with her unhealthy lifestyle and she started researching diet plans and which one would be right for her. Steph says if she met the man who threw the drink now she would thank him . She eventually decided on the Cambridge Weight Plan, which involved rebuilding her relationship with food by first cutting it out completely and replacing it with milkshakes and porridge. Her incredible weight loss of 10st 7lb led to Steph being crowned Woman of the Year at the Cambridge Weight Plan awards. Steph said: 'I needed to know that I had set boundaries and wouldn’t be tempted by even just small amounts of unhealthy foods. 'A lot of people doubted me when I first started and didn’t think I would be able to stick to the diet, but when they could see how well I was doing they became more encouraging. 'Proving people wrong has given me an extra boost of confidence and motivated me to carry on. 'Now my mum will tell anyone that will listen for long enough about how well I’ve done. 'There were times when I would think ‘this is it, I’ve done enough now’, but my mum and my boyfriend’s mum spurred me on to keep going and keep losing the weight.' Since losing the weight, Steph’s confidence has skyrocketed and she has also met her boyfriend, Neil. Steph said: I met Neil towards the end of my diet and we’ve been together about seven months. 'The relationship wouldn’t have worked before I don’t think. I would have constantly been wondering why he was interested in me. 'I would have been constantly thinking he’s only with me until something better comes along. Before I was with Neil I didn’t know what it was like to be with someone who was nice to me all the time.' Steph has also noticed more subtle changes in her day-to-day life, including in other people’s behaviour towards her, especially as a young woman. Steph has been crowned Woman of the Year by the Cambridge Weight Plan due to her dieting success . She says: 'People used to look at me and judge me. They were looking down on me because I was young and overweight. 'Now, people will hold a door open for me. It sounds silly but that was something that wouldn’t have happened before. 'There are also things that people take for granted, like being able to cross my legs under my desk at work, sitting in an aeroplane seat comfortably and being able to walk between two cars in a car park without worrying you’d get stuck.' Seeing herself as a role model, Steph is now feeling the pressure to keep the weight off for good. 'Losing this much weight, going from a size 26 to a size 12, is something people in their forties do, not people in their twenties. 'By doing it, I’ve proved that it doesn’t matter how old you are, there shouldn’t be any excuse for being overweight. 'I’m much happier in myself because of how healthy I feel and how much better I feel about myself.'","Dropped from 22st 5lb and a size 26 to 11st 13lb and a size 12 .

"Gareth Bale has slammed the artificial pitch at Andorra’s Estadi Nacional as ‘by far the worst pitch’ he has ever played on after his late free-kick gave Wales a narrow 2-1 win over the minnows in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier. It was the first time the 3G surface had been used for a match and the difficulties with controlling the ball were clear for all to see. The roll would be uneven and bounces awkward, with clusters of black rubber pellets spraying into the air with each landing. Dodgy surface: Gareth Bale said the 3G surface in Andorra was the worst he's ever played on, despite scoring twice in the win . Matchwinner: Despite the surface cutting up all game Bale was not to be denied, scoring a late free-kick winner to send the Welsh fans into raptures . At last: The Real Madrid star wheels away after scoring a crucial winning goal for Wales, getting their qualifying campaign off to a good start . Jumping for joy: Bale celebrates his winning goal 10 minutes from time in front of the travelling Welsh fans . Roar: Bale is joined by Joe Ledley to celebrate the late goal that spared their blushes against an Andorra team that has won just one international in their history . Equaliser: Bale had also scored with a commanding header in the first half to bring Wales back on to level terms . Click here to read Laurie Whitwell's match report from Andorra . Manager Chris Coleman had tried to play down fears of the pitch’s unsuitability before kick-off but afterwards declared he felt it was not up to UEFA standards. The surface was only certified by Europe's governing body last week after originally failing tests because of a fast roll. ‘It was by far the worst pitch I have ever played on,’ said Bale. ‘I can't describe how bad, bobbly and hard the pitch was to deal with. ‘We said at the start that the most important thing was to get three points. Other teams are going to find it difficult coming here so for us to get three points is important. ‘We want to qualify and you have to come to places like this and get victories.’ A 3G - or 'third generation - pitch is made of artificial plastic grass 'blades' and is suitable for all weather conditions, meaning it is largely unaffected by differing seasons and temperatures. The artificial turf is held in place by a thin base layer of sand, as well as an infill of rubber pieces which act like the soil on a normal pitch in order to allow grip. Plastic pitches were originally banned from English football in 1995 after Queens Park Rangers, Preston North End, Oldham Atletic and Luton Town had trialled them during the 1980s, with Loftus Road the first English stadium to try it in 1981 and Preston  the last Football League club to remove theirs in 1994. However, the FA made a U-turn in March when they announced that synthetic pitches could be used in every single round of the FA Cup this season - having previously only allowed them up until the first round proper. Maidstone United, who play in the Ryman Premier League, have had great success with their 3G pitch and have championed its cause. Artificial pitches are also used in many places on the continent, particularly in Eastern and Northern Europe. Targeted: Bale also had to deal with some roughhouse tactics from Andorra's defenders, tackled here by Marc Vales from behind . Tricky task: Wales' players such as Neil Taylor, pictured,  had to get used to playing on an artificial pitch in Andorra . Challenging: Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey was also tested by the tricky surface against the minnows, who have lost their last 45 competitive matches . Coleman kept his team from practising on 3G pitches through fear of its effects on joints and went through a light training session on Monday evening for the first time. ‘I can talk about the pitch now, if you're a passing team forget it,’ he said. ‘I don't want to make a protest as I want other teams to come here. ‘But when we trained on it, my heart sunk. In my opinion the pitch is not up to standard of UEFA qualifier.’ Mission complete: Two-goal hero Bale salutes the Wales fans after the final whistle, but he'll know they have a long way to go to qualify . Kicking up: The artificial 3G turf sprays up from the pitch as Aaron Ramsey passes in midfield during the crucial victory . Surrounded: Wales enjoyed 71 per cent of the possession against Andorra, including this attack by Ramsey, but struggled to make a breakthrough . Eyes on the ball: Bale manages to get a pass away on the tricky surface despite the attentions of Andorra's Ildefons Lima . Calm down: Bale appeals for Wales fans to settle down after scoring their second goal, with supporters having run on the surface . On the pitch: Wales fans knocked down advertising hoardings and encroached on to the pitch after Bale's free-kick winner . Celebrations: Welsh fans joined the players to celebrate the winning moment, with goalscorer Bale acting to calm things down . If Wales were expecting an easy ride in the principality they were stunned when Andorra took the lead after just six minutes. Swansea defender Neil Taylor conceded a soft penalty, referee adjudging him to have pulled the shirt of Ivan Lorenzo. Ildefons Lima made no mistake from the spot to score Andorra's first competitive goal in four years. But Bale rescued Wales with a classy double to get the qualifying campaign off to a winning start. First he headed home from Ben Davies' excellent cross. And the world's most expensive player curled in a beautiful free-kick with 10 minutes remaining to claim the victory.

"China has toppled America to become the biggest economy in the world, according to figures from the International Monetary Fund. The White House seemed caught flat-footed by the news, crowing on Wednesday about America's relative economic strength in comparison with the rest of the world. The US has been the global leader since it overtook Britain in 1872, but has now lost its status as top dog. The latest IMF figures show the Chinese economy is worth $17.61 trillion compared with $17.4 trillion for the U.S. Scroll down for video . Economic battle:The International Monetary Fund has indicated that China, and not the US, is now the biggest economy in the world . Out of the loop? US President Barack Obama touted America's manufacturing economy during an Oct. 3 speech at an Indiana steel company, claiming that jobs and work orders were no longer 'moving to China or other countries' China – whose wealth has accelerated in recent decades amid rapid industrialization – is expected to extend its lead, with the IMF estimating its economy will be worth just under $26.98 trillion in 2019. That would be 20 per cent bigger than the U.S. economy, which is forecast to be worth $22.3 trillion by then. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest seemed oblivious to the news as it percolated on Wednesday. Asked for his assessment of the health of the global economy in the face of Russia's zero-sum economy and other troubles in Europe – including Germany's search for stimulus measures to head off a recession – Earnest crowed. Those conditions, he said, 'make the president's policies look pretty good. They certainly make the performance of the American economy look pretty good.' 'The United States is showing the kind of resilience that other counties are desperate for,' Earnest claimed. 'And a lot of that is due in no small part to the policies that this administration put in place.' 'There is no doubt that the economic policies that this president put in place are the envy of the world,' he boasted. Earnest added that the White House is 'hoping that the economy of our allies and partners around the globe strengthens. We certainly would like to see that happen.' He cited 'a tremendous record of progress that we have made here in the United States ... occurring against the backdrop of a global economy that continues to struggle.' That, Earnest told reporters, 'is an indication of how strong the America economy is.' President Barack Obama himself showed his confidence in a U.S.-centered manufacturing economy on October 3 during a speech in Princeton, Indiana. 'About 10, 15 years ago, everybody said American manufacturing is going downhill, everything is moving to China or other countries,' Obama said. 'And the Midwest got hit a lot harder than a lot of places because we were the backbone of American manufacturing.' 'But because folks invested in new plants and new technologies, and there were hubs that were created between businesses and universities and community colleges so that workers could master and get trained in some of these new technologies, what we've now seen is manufacturing driving economic growth in a way we haven't seen in about 20-25 years.' Flat-footed: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest claimed on Wednesday that 'there is no doubt that the economic policies that this president put in place are the envy of the world' Silver lining: Without adjustments for living costs, the Chinese economy is still smaller than that of the US . The latest IMF figures show the Chinese economy is worth $17.61 trillion, compared with $17.4 trillion for the US . Spokespersons for several U.S. senators who serve on the Finance Committee did not respond to requests for comment. Two Republican aides said on background that they wouldn't be offering a critique. The new IMF analysis is based on a statistic called 'purchasing power parity' (PPP), which makes adjustments for the fact that goods are cheaper in China and other countries relative to the US. Without these cost adjustments factored in, the Chinese economy is still smaller than that of the U.S., at $10.3 trillion. But experts have described the toppling of America after nearly 150 years by China, even on the PPP measure, as a 'symbolic' moment for the global economy. China enjoyed three decades of double-digit growth before the global downturn, as industrialization and sweeping economic reforms created a new powerhouse in the East. Growth has slowed in recent years but remains strong by Western standards with the IMF forecasting expansion of 7.4 per cent this year and 7.1 per cent in 2015. By contrast, the IMF is predicting growth of just 2.2 per cent in the US this year and 3.1 per cent next year. Financial powerhouse: In the last decade alone, the skyline of major cities in China, such as Shanghai (pictured), have been completely transformed as the economy grew in leaps and bounds . Britain led the world in the industrial revolution of the mid-18th century, but America was hot on its heels. The US underwent huge industrial expansion after its civil war ended in 1865, fueled by rapid urbanization and huge population growth – including the immigration of nearly 30 million Europeans. In 1872, its economy overtook Britain to become the world's largest, a position it held for the next 142 years. Productivity, leading brands and innovation, coupled with the success of the US dollar and the fact that 62 per cent of the world's financial reserves are held in the currency, kept America on top. Meanwhile, the economies of Britain and other European powers were ravaged by two world wars. Britain borrowed heavily from America during the Second World War and received a further $4.3 billion in 1945. China was the world's leading trading nation up to the 18th century, until control of its ports and trade were taken over by imperial nations in Europe. Under Communism it remained inward-looking, until 1980 when the government started to allow foreign investment. The Fund said Tuesday that the U.S. and the UK 'are approaching economic lift-off' as they bounce back from the recession. But Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the IMF, warned that 'potential growth is lower than it was in the early 2000s' for much of the West, including the U.S. and the UK. He added that China is 'maintaining high growth' which will slow in the coming years to a more 'healthy' level between 6 per cent and 7 per cent. Arvind Subramanian, senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute and an expert on China, recently highlighted the 'symbolic' importance of China overtaking the US. 'China is very big and getting bigger,' he said. 'It's not to be underestimated.' The news that China is now the largest economy in the world is an embarrassment for Barack Obama and ends America's 142 years at the top. Britain had out-produced the U.S. and its European rivals for much of the 19th century, at the height of the industrial revolution and with trade links across the Empire. But the US caught up as a growing population, the expansion of the railways and a focus on industry as well as agriculture boosted its economy. China's wealth has accelerated in recent decades amid rapid industrialisation. Pictured, a car factory in Beijing . China has a population of around 1.3 billion – four times that of the US – but its economy has only just become the biggest . The PPP measure of output makes India the third largest economy, followed by Japan in fourth place and Germany in fifth. Russia, Brazil, France, Indonesia and the UK make up the rest of the top 10 in that order. Many economists believe the PPP measure of an economy is the fairest measure because it takes into account the cost of living in different countries. For example, although wages are typically far lower in less developed countries than in mature economies, goods and services are often also cheaper, which affects individual consumers' comparative purchasing power. But critics argue that analysis does not take into account how well off people actually are. China has a population of around 1.3 billion – four times that of the U.S. – but its economy has only now become the biggest. That means Americans are typically far wealthier than their Chinese counterparts, and better off than people in other emerging markets that benefit from huge work forces and more rapid growth.","Figures show the Chinese economy is worth $17.6 trillion, compared to America's $17.4 trillion .

"George North recovered from having his spine brutally re-arranged at Franklin’s Gardens to ignite Northampton’s title defence with a sensational hat-trick. The Wales wing appeared in danger of being forced out of this fiery Aviva Premiership opener after just five minutes, when he was smashed in the back, off the ball, by Gloucester lock Tom Savage. But he eventually shook off the damaging effects of the dubious hit to score two tries before the break and wrap up his treble in the 50th minute to send Jim Mallinder’s side on their way to an emphatic victory which will leave their rivals in no doubt that the champions mean business. Impressive: George North recovered from a bad tackle to score a hat-trick against Gloucester . Dejected: Gloucester took a hammering at in their opening Aviva Premiership game . Try: Jon Fisher breaks clear to score Northampton's sixth try of the night against a disappointing Gloucester . NORTHAMPTON: Wilson, K Pisi, G Pisi, Burrell, North, Myler, Dickson, Corbisiero, Hartley (capt), Ma’afu, Lawes, Day, Clark, Wood, Manoa. Tries: North (3), G Pisi, Burrell (2), Fotuali’i, Fisher. Penalties: Myler . Conversions: Myler (4), Hooley . GLOUCESTER: Cook; Sharples, Trinder, Twelvetrees (capt), May; Hook, Laidlaw; Murphy, Hibbard, Afoa; Savage, Hudson; Kalamafoni, Rowan, Morgan. Penalties: Hook, Laidlaw . Man of the match: George North . Referee: Wayne Barnes . Attendance: 13,374. This was a galling occasion for David Humphreys as he attempts to orchestrate a revival at Gloucester, especially when his men alarmingly unravelled in the latter stages. Up front, the visitors were often abrasive and dogged, yet they were eclipsed by the Saints forwards, who drove their opponents into submission. American No 8 Samu Manoa was outstanding, as was the ring-master behind the scrum, Stephen Myler. These rival clubs had approached the new season from opposite ends of the preparatory spectrum. For Northampton, on the back of domestic and European success, the buzz-word was ‘stability’.Gloucester, on the other hand, had responded to abject failure in 2013-14 by overhauling their management and squad. The first points of the season went to the Saints’ prolific sharp-shooter, Stephen Myler, but the first statement of intent came from Calum Clark, who unceremoniously flattened Billy Twelvetrees in the first minute. Gloucester’s captain suffered worse damage later in the first half when he was blasted backwards by the rampaging Manoa. Tussle: Gloucester's Henry Tinder endured a difficult evening and was on the receiving end . North also dished out a robust tackle on Henry Trinder early on, but seconds later he was on the receiving end of Savage’s smash from behind. North was treated and appeared to be struggling for some time afterwards, but he soon made light of the pain. After James Hook briefly levelled the scores from the tee, the champions swept ahead. From an attacking lineout on the left, Courtney Lawes claimed the catch and the home pack rumbled forward, drawing in defenders. Having created space, the ball was transferred left again and Luther Burrell sent North over in the corner. Myler converted from an acute angle and the Northampton No 10 had a major hand — or foot, to be precise — in his side’s second try on the half-hour. He sent a penalty to touch on the right and after the forwards had repeated their deadly catch-and-drive routine, he chipped diagonally into the 22, where George Pisi took the ball on the full and crashed under the posts. Score-sheet: James Hook scored a penalty for Gloucester,  Greig Laidlaw scored the other . Try: James Wilson makes a break to set up a try for Northampton centre Luther Burrell . Tackle: Kahn Fotouali'l scores a try for Northampton despite last-gasp tap tackle . That was a stylish strike but there was even better to come, once another Myler conversion had been followed by a Greig Laidlaw penalty. Right on half-time, Lee Dickson broke from a lineout and Myler released James Wilson, whose brilliant off-load picked out George Pisi, whopassed on to North and, ignoring inside runners, he dummied and stepped outside to touch down himself. Myler’s third conversion made it 24-6 at half-time. The procession continued in the second half. Wilson was running amok from full back and the Kiwi set up a fourth try for the rampant hosts. After breaking from halfway, he drew the last defender and a sublime, deft pass sent England centre Burrell in at the left corner. Man of the match: George North goes over for one of his three tries in a hugely impressive performance . Gloucester: Billy Twelvetrees in action as the visitors shipped eight tries on a terrible night . Defence: Northampton enjoyed the perfect start to the defence of their Aviva Premiership title . Again Myler added the extra two points and his personal tour de force went on and on. With an England squad due to be announced next month, this was an ideal time for the Saints playmaker to show peak form. He conjured North’s hat-trick try with a wonderful pass; floated high and long to the left flank where the predatory Lion pounced to bring the house down. There was no let-up in the punishment for Gloucester. Replacement scrum half Kahn Fotuali’i had been on the field just two minutes when he touched down on the left from another canny kick through by Myler and then Jon Fisher claimed a try on his competitive debut. The last word — and eighth Saints try — went to Burrell, who latched on to a loose pass by Ross Moriarty for an easy canter to the line. What could have been a close contest had become a massacre. The champions are up and running; the rest have been warned. SARACENS v WASPS . (Saturday: Twickenham, 2pm, LIVE on BT Sport 1) Charlie Hodgson starts at No 10 for Saracens.

"Imtiaz Shah was jailed for 30 months and given a three-year driving ban after crashing into a motorcyclist when he fell asleep at the wheel of his car . A motorist with a health condition which made him fall asleep at the wheel left a motorcyclist paralysed in a 'sickening' head-on crash after ignoring doctors' guidance not to drive. Imtiaz Shah ploughed his 4x4 into Steven Hayes's motorbike in April last year, leaving the former mechanic unable to walk or talk. The 42-year-old from Nelson, Lancashire, was jailed for 30 months at Preston Crown Court and banned from driving for three years, but is likely to be released from prison after half that time. Mr Hayes, 48, is now permanently confined to a wheelchair and requires round-the-clock nursing in a care home. His horrified family have spoken of their outrage at Shah's sentence, saying: 'That is not justice'. 'He condemned my dad to a life sentence dealing with those injuries yet he'll be out of prison in a little more than a year,' Mr Hayes's 21-year-old daughter, Jenny, said. 'This incident has had a devastating impact on my dad and our entire family. 'In a split second, my dad was robbed of his independence, much of his ability to communicate and to enjoy his life and his hobbies. 'He will need the support of carers every hour of every day for the rest of his life.' The mechanic's wife, Linda, said she was 'grieving' for the loss of her husband's former-self. 'He'll never be the Steven I fell in love with. We are grieving for the Steven we lost that day.' The court heard how Shah, a former council worker, had been told by doctors to refrain from driving after complaining of sleep apnoea - a condition which causes throat muscles to relax and narrow, putting sufferers into a deep sleep. Despite doctors' advice, Shah continued to drive for months, and had clocked up 200miles on the day of the crash. Mr Hayes is confined to a wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care. His daughter Jenny, 21, criticised Shah's sentence saying: 'That is not justice' The 48-year-old was 'deeply unconscious' for months before being released from hospital to a care home . He had fallen asleep at the wheel when driving in Blackburn, Lancashire, while negotiating a roundabout. His Honda CRV narrowly avoided crashing into a Range Rover before he crashed into Mr Hayes, throwing his body into the air 'like a rag doll', the court heard. The vehicle was eventually stopped when it crashed into a wall. Mr Hayes's daughter said he had been 'robbed of his independence' 'You were falling asleep at the wheel and losing control, narrowly missing a black car as you were veering towards the centre line,'  Recorder Simon Earlam told him. 'You continued to veer over the centre line. The driver of a Range Rover realised you were not going to straighten up. 'He and his passenger described how your head was down. I find you were probably asleep at this stage. 'It was a sickening collision head on. He was thrown into the air like a rag doll by the force. 'The impact was such that his helmet came off. Mr Hayes hit your windscreen leaving hair and flesh where he struck. He then hit the road surface leaving a trail of blood on the ground. 'The injuries to Mr Hayes have been most serious and permanently life-changing. They have ruined his life and that of his immediate family.' Mr Hayes was in a 'deeply unconscious' state for months before being released from hospital and admitted to a care home. The 48-year-old needed surgery to have part of skull removed. His family plan to launch a civil case against Shah.","Imtiaz Shah was told not to drive after complaining of sleep apnoea .

"Sorry: Dominic Grieve, the country's most senior law officer, has apologised after he said minority communities have brought with them 'endemic' corruption . Corruption is rife in Britain’s Pakistani community, the country’s most senior law officer has warned. Dominic Grieve said politicians needed to ‘wake up’ to the threat of corruption posed by minority communities using a ‘favour culture’. In remarks that will inflame already sensitive diplomatic relations with Pakistan, the attorney general said he was referring to ‘mainly the Pakistani community’. He said electoral corruption was a . problem in constituencies such as Slough in Berkshire. Tory councillor . Eshaq Khan was found guilty of fraud involving postal ballots in 2008. Khan and five others were jailed in 2009 for using 'ghost' voters to win a local council ballot to oust longstanding Labour councillor Lydia Simmons from her seat on Slough Borough Council. The audacious scam in 2007 was described by the Crown Prosecution Service as part of an 'epidemic' which threatens to destroy democracy in the UK. Father-of 10 Khan received a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perjury. The . Electoral Commission is planning to introduce tougher identity checks . at the ballot box in Tower Hamlets in East London, another area that has . suffered from electoral fraud. In a statement released today, Mr Grieve said: 'I am very clear that integration between ethnic communities in the United Kingdom has worked well and has delivered great benefits for all of us. 'The point I was making is that, as a law officer, it's my duty to ensure the rule of law is upheld, and one of the issues that I feel requires close attention is any potential for a rise in corruption to undermine civil society. 'I am absolutely clear that this problem is not attributable to any one community, as I know very well from my many years promoting community cohesion.' Tory MEP Sajjad Karim, the party's legal affairs spokesman in the European Parliament, hit out at Mr Grieve, calling his comments 'offensive'. He told the BBC: 'As a member of the British Pakistani community myself, I found these comments to be offensive, divisive; I do think they were ill advised and I'm afraid the very general way in which Dominic is trying to make the points that he is making will have the net effect of being seen as purely populist in nature. Mr Grieve had previously said electoral corruption was a problem in constituencies such as Slough in Berkshire where Tory councillor Eshaq Khan (pictured) was found guilty of fraud involving postal ballots in 2008 . 'It was quite clear when one carries . out even the most basic examination of the claims that he is making that . the facts do not support the argument that he is presenting'. Mr . Karim added: 'It's absolutely essential that if any politician in an . influential position, regardless of whatever personal political . ambitions that individual may have, it is essential that they do not try . and behave in a way that creates a general impression about any . particular community. 'If . Dominic has got any individual specific points he wants to make in . relation to voter fraud or anything of that nature that's quite a . separate issue and can be looked at. Disgraced Khan used fake votes to win a seat on Slough Borough Council (file picture) 'But . to try and generalise in this way and to paint all British Pakistani . community members in a certain light, I'm afraid that is simply . something that cannot be ignored and it is certainly not something that . the British public at large will accept from Dominic at all.' Labour's Khalid Mahmood accused Mr Grieve of 'scapegoating' the Pakistani community and called for David Cameron to state whether he backed his Attorney General. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'This is the law officer who has made this statement. 'The Prime Minister needs to make clear whether this is his understanding of what's going on, either agree with Dominic or not.' He added: 'I wholly agree with Dominic that he does need to address issues of political fraud wherever they exist. 'That can be done without scapegoating a particular community and getting tension within communities.' But Tory Andrew Stephenson, chairman of the all-party group on Pakistan, backed Mr Grieve and said there was a problem 'mainly driven by corrupt political activists on all sides'. The Pendle MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'There is, in parts of the Pakistani community, a favour culture. But also there are very strong family bonds. 'So if you allow an entire family to be registered on postal votes, where the head of the household can see how his wife and how his children are voting, they will instinctively almost want to vote in the same way as him because of the strong family bonds. 'Unfortunately the postal voting system allows that to happen and means that women and young people are disenfranchised from the political process.' David . Cameron sparked outrage earlier in his premiership when he accused . Pakistan of ‘exporting terrorism’ while on a visit to India. Mr Grieve told the Daily Telegraph that . corruption could also be found in the ‘white Anglo-Saxon community’ as . well as among other groups. But he said the rise of corruption . was ‘because we have minority communities in this country which come . from backgrounds where corruption is endemic. 'It is something we as . politicians have to wake to up to’. Condemnation: Baroness Warsi, the Foreign Office minister, has previously said the Conservatives lost three seats at the general election because of voter fraud in the Asian community . Inflammatory: David Cameron sparked outrage on a previous visit to India by suggesting Pakistan was 'exporting terrorism' Baroness . Warsi, the Foreign Office minister, has previously said the . Conservatives lost three seats at the general election because of voter . fraud in the Asian community. Mr . Grieve, whose Beaconsfield constituency in Buckinghamshire has a . sizeable Asian community, said: ‘I can see many of them have come . because of the opportunities that they get. ‘But . they also come from societies where they have been brought up to . believe you can only get certain things through a favour culture. ‘One of the things you have to make absolutely clear is that that is not the case and it’s not acceptable.’ Asked if he was referring to the Pakistani community, Mr Grieve said: ‘Yes, it’s mainly the Pakistani community, not the Indian community. I wouldn’t draw it down to one. I’d be wary of saying it’s just a Pakistani problem.’ He added: ‘I happen to be very optimistic about the future of the UK. We have managed integration of minority communities better than most countries in Europe.’ Mr Grieve also admitted that the ‘volume’ of potential immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria next year when movement controls were lifted ‘may pose serious infrastructure problems’. Jailed for electoral fraud: Eshaq Khan . Disgraced Tory representative Eshaq Khan and five others used fake votes to oust longstanding Labour councillor Lydia Simmons from her seat on Slough Borough Council. The audacious scam in 2007 was described by the Crown Prosecution Service as part of an 'epidemic' which threatens to destroy democracy in the UK. Eshaq Khan, 52, received a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perjury. During his trial the court heard that Eshaq Khan, a father-of-10, had been dishonestly elected as a Tory councillor in May 2007 after a scheme in which 'ghost voters' were registered on the electoral role. The fraudulent plot was uncovered when ousted Labour councillor and former Mayor Miss Simmons and her Labour team questioned the result. They pointed out that at a number of houses up to 19 names - all Asian - had registered in the run up to the election at the same address then opted to vote by post. Charles Miskin, prosecuting at the trial said the action of the convicted vote-riggers was like a virus that needed to be eradicated. He referred to a report by Electoral Commission Richard Mawrey QC which served as a warning that unless the UK election procedures are changed, the nation's democracy will be at stake. Citing the report Mr Miskin said: 'The systems to deal with fraud are not working well, they are not working badly - the fact is there are no real systems. 'Until there are, fraud will continue unabated. The system for voting would disgrace a banana republic.'","Dominic Grieve made inflammatory remarks in a newspaper interview .

"A Southampton father has found a novel way to get his children to change the loo roll in the toilet. Ingenious Will Reid who has been trying to instruct his children, Beth and James on household chores decided that the only way his children would listen to him was if he posted the video online. This is the first  in what he describes as a 'series of instructional videos to help them with life.' 'Obviously me telling them face-to-face is not working,' the exasperated father says. 'So I've tried to be creative and I've come up with the idea of using social media to try and reach you. 'This first instructional video is number one in the series – how to change the toilet roll. 'I know this is a difficult one so, James and Beth, please pay attention.' He then turns the camera to a toilet roll holder with an empty roll on it before panning to a fresh, new roll on the window ledge. Beginning his step-by-step instructions, the dad then says: 'The first thing you've got to do is you've got to find a new toilet roll.' He means business: Will Reid filmed the video to show his children how to change loo roll. This is the first in a series of 'instructional videos' The camera then pans down to the toilet roll holder. 'Second thing is, this is the toilet roll holder,' he continues. 'Now as you can see guys, there's an empty one already on there. 'So the first thing you have to do is remove this empty one,' he says, reaching out to the toilet roll holder. 'Like this,' he says, demonstrating how it's done as he slips it off the holder. The camera zooms in on a close-up of the fresh loo roll on the window ledge . The offending item: The empty loo roll holder waiting to be restocked. The video received over 200,000 views in three days . Speaking in utmost seriousness, he continues with his guidance. 'And then we take the toilet roll.' At this point the camera pans to the top of the window ledge and the father's hand is seen reaching for the roll. The camera then pans down again, as he says,' And we place it on there,' as he slides the fresh new roll onto the toilet roll holder. 'Like that,' he exclaims in tones of triumph. But the father hasn't finished with his instructions as he goes on to tell his children that there is one more step to the task. Demonstration: Will Reid takes off the loo roll and ends the instructional video by thanking his children for watching . 'Make sure you watch that a few times as the advance level would be to take the empty toilet roll holder and put it in the bin,' he says drily. 'But I feel that might be just a step too far at the moment,' he says, bringing the camera back to his face, 'so we'll keep it as is at the moment.' 'Thank you very much for watching.' The video was first posted on a private family group before being publicly shared online. 'My kids said this wouldn't go world-wide as no one would be interested! I guess there are other parents out there that feel the same as I do', he posted on YouTube. 'I jokingly said to my kids that I would post it wider if they didn't start being more tidy,' Mr Reid told Storyful. 'They said to go ahead as I wasn't funny and no one would be interested.' The clip however has gone viral, receiving over 200,000 views in three days.","Will Reid's first video is part of a series 'to help his children with life'

"Failed to assist: Dr Christopher Uwagboe on Thursday . A GP refused to help an 88-year-old woman who fell and knocked herself unconscious in front of his surgery because he was ‘not first-aid trained’. Iris Henderson had just got off a bus when she collapsed, cutting her head and injuring her arm. Passer-by Jane Batchelor found her knocked out and dashed into the practice to ask for help, but said staff were ‘completely uninterested’. When she persisted, locum Christopher Uwagboe was approached, but he refused to leave his office. Staff even declined to supply a blanket to make Mrs Henderson comfortable until an ambulance came. The widow was eventually taken to hospital where she remains more than a week later. Yesterday, Mrs Batchelor said she was ‘completely disgusted’ with the surgery. The mother-of-two was visiting Knebworth and Marymead Medical Practice in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, with her daughter when she heard a ‘big bang’. Referring to Mrs Henderson, she added: ‘She had got off at the wrong bus stop and was really confused. ‘I think she tried to cross the road but then fell over and banged her head. Her arm was trapped underneath her and her hearing aid had fallen out. She was unconscious for about five or ten minutes. ‘I ran straight into the doctor’s and thought they would have come straight out, but the receptionist was really rude. There was no urgency and she seemed completely uninterested. She eventually went to get the doctor but she came out of his office and just said there was nothing he could do.’ Mrs Batchelor, who runs a cake business, was forced to call 999 herself and was advised to get a defibrillator because Mrs Henderson had a pacemaker. But the surgery refused to hand one over. The following day, she complained to practice manager Kenneth Spooner who told her Dr Uwagboe was not first-aid trained and the surgery had been sued several times for treating people in similar circumstances. After Mrs Henderson injured herself on September 18, a paramedic in a rapid-response car arrived within five minutes, but it took another 30 minutes for an ambulance to turn up and take her to Lister Hospital in Stevenage. Mrs Batchelor has visited her there and says she has a bandaged head and a cast on her right arm. Neither the pensioner, who lives alone in sheltered accommodation in Stevenage, nor her family wanted to discuss her ordeal yesterday. Scroll down for video .

But a neighbour said: ‘She’s a very frail lady. It’s very sad and shocking that no one from the surgery would help her.’ Dr Uwagboe, 62, declined to comment when approached at the surgery yesterday, and left in a Mercedes with a personalised number plate. He said: ‘I have been told not to speak to the Press.’ Dr Uwagboe and Mr Spooner also refused to confirm whether he had received first-aid training. The Nigerian-born GP, of Loughton, Essex, graduated in the West African state at the University of Benin in 1977 and trained at the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh. He qualified in 1989 and moved on to the GP register in 2006. The Royal College of GPs last night said members were not automatically trained in first aid but there is a ‘Good Samaritan principle’ under which all British doctors have medical indemnity whoever they treat, even if it is not one of their patients. It also pointed to a General Medical Council document, Duties of a Doctor, that states medical professionals must ‘show respect for human life’ at all times. Spokesman Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard added: ‘There is no legal reason for not helping.’ The surgery has written to Mrs Batchelor to explain it had held a ‘robust’ conversation with the two receptionists on duty when she came in. They have been told their ‘response to the situation was inadequate and not acceptable’. The letter said: ‘The policy now makes it clear to all staff (clinicians and receptionists) how they are to respond to any such event. ‘This includes making it mandatory for a doctor to respond and that reception staff take responsibility for contacting ambulance services.’ In a statement, the practice said it was ‘reviewing procedures to ensure this does not happen again’. The case is the latest in which public servants refused to act because of health and safety concerns or red tape. Simon Burgess, 41, drowned in 3ft of water when a paramedic and a police officer were ordered not to wade in to help. A coroner said in 2012 that the charity worker might have been saved if emergency services had intervened sooner. Treatment: An ambulance eventually arrived and took the pensioner to the Lister Hospital (pictured) where she is still being treated, a week after the fall at around 4.30pm last Thursday .

"Jailed: Mohamed Hacene-Chaouch, 46, of Catford, south-east London, took advantage of the woman, 24 . An unlicensed taxi driver was jailed for raping a passenger in his car nearly one decade after being cleared of an almost identical attack. Mohamed Hacene-Chaouch, 46, of Catford, south-east London, took advantage of the drunken 24-year-old woman after she spent a night out in Soho, central London. The victim had been at a birthday party with friends and was so intoxicated that licensed black cabs had refused to take her home. By the time the Algerian married father-of-five  picked her up on Tottenham Court Road, she was slipping in and out of consciousness. Hacene-Chaouch, who was unlicensed and had convictions for touting, drove to her home in Hackney, east London, before the attack. He admitted picking the victim up but claimed no sexual activity could have taken place because he was only parked up for a minute. However, CCTV cameras proved he was lying. Hacene-Chaouch was convicted of rape following a trial at the Old Bailey, before being jailed for seven years and three months today. Jurors were not told Hacene-Chaouch had been acquitted of an almost identical attack in the Tottenham Court Road area in 2004. Sentencing, Judge Wendy Joseph QC told him: ‘It must have been clear to you that she was helplessly and hopelessly drunk. ‘She told you she was so drunk no black cab would take her. It is clear she could hardly stand and was barely able to walk. Sentence: Hacene-Chaouch was jailed after being convicted of rape following a trial at the Old Bailey (pictured) 'You had positioned yourself where such people as her were found and you knew well that such touting was against the law. I am quite satisfied there was an element of predatory behaviour. ‘She trusted you to take her safely home. She was clearly vulnerable, obviously helpless and in your power. After that attack she suffered panic attacks and had great difficulty in sleeping. Previous: Jurors were not told Hacene-Chaouch had been acquitted of an almost identical attack in the Tottenham Court Road area in 2004 . ‘She has found it impossible to form any new relationship with a man. She is a straightforward, sensible and practical young woman. ‘She holds out some hope for the future but recognises it will take a long time to get over what happened to her. You refuse to accept the wrong you have done. I have never heard the least scintilla of remorse.’ Before being led down to the cells, Hacene-Chaouch gestured to his wife in the public gallery and said: ‘I am innocent. I never touched her’. He was convicted of touting for hire on several occasions between 2004 and July 2012. On January 27 this year he was waiting at the junction of Tottenham Court Road and Charing Cross Road. The woman had been out for a meal to celebrate a friend’s birthday before joining others at a bar. She became separated from her friends and was trying to get a cab home when she bumped in Hacene-Chaouch. She said: ‘I remember having the overwhelming feeling of being alone. I remember being in the car, in the back seat, and going in and out of consciousness. It’s very blurry but I think I got sick in the car and he was upset.’ Hacene-Chaouch stopped at a garage so she could withdraw £25 for the fare before parking up near her home. He then groped her between her legs before forcing her to perform a sex act on him. 'She trusted you to take her safely home. She was clearly vulnerable, obviously helpless and in your power' Mohamed Hacene-Chaouch . She told her flatmate the following morning and the attack was reported to the police. The driver was traced through CCTV from the garage and from the street outside the victim’s flat. Hacene-Chaouch denied oral rape but was convicted. He was also alleged to have stolen her mobile phone and camera, but a separate theft charge was withdrawn by prosecutors during the trial. He was banned from operating as a taxi driver for ten years and ordered to pay a £120 surcharge. Hacene-Chaouch will also have to sign on the Sex Offenders Register for life.","Father-of-five Mohamed Hacene-Chaouch, 46, took advantage of woman .

"UEFA has adopted a new procedure allowing referees to stop matches for up to three minutes to assess head injuries when a concussion is suspected. FIFA medical committee chairman Michel D'Hooghe sought the approval of UEFA's executive committee for rules that go beyond the existing medical guidance. UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino says the new procedures will come into immediate effect in all of the European football governing body's competitions. UEFA president Michel Platini will oversee a new head injury procedure . Infantino says after a match is stopped, players ""will only be allowed to continue playing on specific confirmation by the team doctor to the referee of the player's fitness to do so."" D'Hooghe said last week that a concussion case occurs on average once in every 20 games. Clubs have caused controversy while allowing players to stay on the pitch after concussion. Last season Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris stayed on the pitch despite being knocked out after a clash with Everton striker Romelu Lukaku.","FIFA medical committee chairman sought approval of UEFA's executive committee .

"Radamel Falcao has scored more than half his goals by getting on the end of crosses... 52.8% - Porto (72 goals, 38 from crosses) 51.4% - Atletico Madrid (70, 36) 36.4% - Monaco (11, 4) TOTAL: 51% (153 goals, 78 from crosses) Radamel Falcao feeds off crosses. Manchester United's newest striker craves them and, more often than not, makes himself a menace to defenders. Since arriving in Europe, Falcao has scored more than half his goals by meeting the end of a cross. The 28-year-old owes a sizeable portion of his records at Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco to that very ability. Portugal, Spain and France have been ticked off the list, England is next. Those at Old Trafford can only hope Falcao remains as aggressive as his El Tigre nickname suggests when he enters the Premier League den. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Radamel Falcao meeting crosses and scoring for Porto . Radamel Falcao has proved himself deadly in the box when meeting the end of a cross in Europe so far . New striker Radamel Falcao has scored more than half of his goals in Europe by meeting the end of a cross . Radamel Falcao will look to keep up his extraordinary cross-to-goal conversion rate in the Premier League . United have put in the second-most crosses in the Premier League but completed the fewest! 78 - Southampton (14 successful) 65 - Manchester United (3 successful) 64 - Newcastle United (10 successful) 9.42% - Stoke . 7.32% - Aston Villa . 4.62% - Manchester United . Trouble is, where will those crosses come from? United, having played three Premier League games under new manager Louis van Gaal, boast the lowest completion rate. Sixty-five attempted, just three successful. They are yet to win but the cavalry has arrived. Angel di Maria registered more assists than any other player in Europe's top five leagues last season. Seventeen to be exact. Daley Blind, United's new defender and makeshift midfielder, delivered what was surely the cross of the 2014 World Cup. It was the 24-year-old's 50-yard diagonal ball that met Robin van Persie's flying header against Spain. What Van Gaal wouldn't give for an exact repeat against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. Van Persie, despite such brilliance in Brazil, is among the culprits at Old Trafford that may be in awe of Falcao's record. Since 2012, the former Arsenal striker has scored 24 per cent of his goals from crosses. Wayne Rooney? 23 per cent. The now-sold Danny Welbeck? 20. Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind were unveiled in a Manchester United press conference on Thursday evening . Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind  set for their Premier League debuts against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday . Louis van Gaal will hope Radamel Falcao can be just as lethal in the box as he has been in Europe so far . 24% - Van Persie (38 goals, 9 from crosses) 23% - Rooney (30, 7) 20% - Welbeck (10, 2) Falcao should not be short of putting his talent to good use, given United are second only to Southampton with the most crosses in the league so far. The man sacrificed for the Colombia international's arrival was Welbeck. The 23-year-old joined Arsenal for £16million while the transfer window was wedged open, despite the 11pm deadline having been and gone. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger had little hesitation picking up after Van Gaal, though. The Frenchman reckons he's inherited a 'fox in the box' not dissimilar to Ian Wright and Thierry Henry. The England international, though, has some way to go before he is on par with Falcao's record.

"It appears Prime Minister David Cameron, US President Barack Obama and a few other political heavyweights will have to look elsewhere for discounted booze or oversized chocolate bars if they ever find themselves in the Russian city of Vladivostok. They have been banned from shopping at a duty free shop at Vladivostok International Airport in a bizarre move that hits back at EU and US sanctions against Russia amid the deadly conflict in Ukraine. Writer and editor Michael Idov photographed a backlit sign, which announces the decision to ban 13 world leaders or Ukrainian officials, when he flew out of the airport over the weekend. No-buy list: A duty free shop at Vladivostok Airport has banned world leaders and Ukrainian officials . The sign says: ‘In line with the decision of Duty Free shop Administration these persons are not welcome here and will not be attended to a customer in this shop'. In addition to the UK prime minister and US president, the duty free shop has also said ‘nyet’ to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, French President Francois Hollande, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Six Ukrainian officials, including President Petro Poroshenko and Kiev Mayor Vitali Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion, are also on the no-buy list as the shop exacts its revenge for the sanctions. Mr Idov told i100 that the duty free shop’s sign reminded him of homemade printouts, declaring ‘Entry denied to Barack Obama’, that have been posted on random walls in recent weeks. Blacklisted: Prime Minister David Cameron is one of 13 officials who are not welcome at the duty free shop . He said: ‘What took me aback in this case was both the placement - the international lounge of an international airport, in a city that has just hosted a great international music festival - and the sleekness of the design. ‘I can’t imagine this sign being installed without the approval of the airport authorities. It truly boggles the mind.’ In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, the airport said it did not put up the sign and it has no plans to remove it because it is a matter of free speech. The airport said: ‘The announcement about sales limitations to certain persons within the duty free shop area is from the duty free shop administration. ‘However, according to national current legislation regulations Vladivostok International Airport, JSC does not consider it necessary to prevent anyone from expressing his/her views or opinions.’ Vladivostok is a port city on the Sea of Japan in Russia’s far east, near the country’s borders with China and North Korea.

"A drunken driver who struck and killed two teenage cousins on a southern New Jersey roadway two years ago has pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter charges. Cape May County prosecutors say 33-year-old Joshua Malmgren of Middle Township is expected to receive two nine-year state prison terms when he’s sentenced December 5. Prosecutors say Malmgren was driving drunk and texting in July 2012 when his sport utility vehicle hit 15-year-old Nioami Lazicki and her cousin 13-year-old Ashley Dauber of Philadelphia on a Middle Township road. Guilty plea: Two years after hitting and killing two girls in his car, Joshua Malmgren has admitted to drunken driving and texting before the tragic incident . Cousins: Ashley Dauber (left) and Nioami Lazicki (right) were walking home from a playground when they were hit by Malmgren, who veered off the road while texting and had a blood-alcohol reading of double the legal limit . Close: Ashley Dauber (right) was visiting from Philadelphia when the tragedy occurred. The younger sister of Nioami Lazicki (left) managed to escape Malmgren's car . Lazicki’s 14-year-old sister was walking with them but was able to get out of the way of the vehicle. The three girls were walking home from a playground along Bayshore Road near the Green Creek Firehouse in Middle Township on July 31, 2012, when the incident occurred. Malmgren was driving in the eastbound lanes of Bayshore Road when he veered into the shoulder and hit the two girls. They were both pronounced dead at the scene. Plea deal: Malmgren initially pleaded not guilty and rejected an earlier plea bargain that would have seen him serve 25 years in jail . 'She suddenly had an urge to turn over her shoulder and she’d seen the headlights and got out of the way,' Bill Gaston, Nioami’s father told CBS of his surviving daughter. 'By the time she screamed, this guy was right on top of them.' Malmgren was found to have a blood alcohol reading of .183, more than twice the legal limit. He also admitted to having taken the prescription painkiller Tramadol and anti-anxiety drug Clonazepam in combination with the booze. When police arrived just minutes after the accident, they found Malmgren sitting under a tree, crying and hugging his knees, reports the Press of Atlantic City. Elizabeth Melli, the mother of Malmgren's two children and his on-off partner, testified in court that he had been on an alcohol and pain-pill binge of several days when the accident happened. Malmgren initially pleaded not guilty and had rejected a plea agreement that required him to serve 25 years, reports the Press of Atlantic City. He pleaded guilty under a new plea agreement. Under New Jersey state law, the No Early Release Act, he will have to serve 85 per cent of the sentence, or 15.3 years before he is eligible for parole.","Joshua Malmgren, 33, pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter charges .

"An autistic boy from Ohio has agreed to take the ALS challenge, only instead of ice water the unsuspecting teen was doused with a bucketful of bodily fluids and cigarette butts, according to his family. The sick prank was recorded on the teen's cell phone, but according to the 15-year-old's parents and older brother, the boy was so embarrassed that he initially kept it a secret. When his parents discovered the revolting video on the teen's phone, they decided to share it with the station Fox8 in order to raise awareness of bullying. Scroll down for video . Unaware: This 15-year-old autistic boy from Ohio has agreed to take the ALS ice bucket challenge, not knowing that the teens who asked him to do it were playing a sick prank on him . Humiliating: Standing in his underwear outside a garage, the teen was doused with a mixture of urine, feces, saliva and cigarette butts .

"Colorado's tax revenue from its much-vaunted legalization of marijuana has fallen far short of estimates. Original projections for taxes to Colorado for recreational marijuana were $33.5 million for the just-ended fiscal year. Governor John Hickenlooper's office predicted $100 million. The state hoped to appeal to locals and marijuana tourists alike with its legalize-and-tax tactic, but so far, results have been sluggish. Scroll down for video . Revenue: Tax revenue from legal sales of marijuana has fallen short of the $33.5 million estimated (pictured: the Evergreen Apothecary in Denver, Colorado) Governor John Hickenlooper, who signed the measures to implement marijuana legalization in the state, predicted that Colorado would gain $100 million from the taxes. The actual amount in retail sales and excise tax came in at just over $12 million, according to Colorado Department of Revenue. State Representative Dan Pabon said it might be time to look at medical marijuana. Pabon chairs a special legislative committee on marijuana revenue that met for the first time Tuesday. A market study for the state found that the lower-taxed medical-marijuana market continues to outpace the recreational market in sales. Recreational sales are expected to grow, but Forbes reports that only an estimated 60 per cent of marijuana purchases this year will be through legal channels. Part of the reason is likely to be cost. Black market: It's estimated that only 60 per cent of marijuana sales in Colorado are through legal channels, rather than legal retailers such as the Evergreen Apothecary in Denver (pictured) In Colorado, there’s a 2.9 per cent sales tax and a 10 per cent marijuana sales tax. Forbes reports that there is also a 15 per cent excise tax on the average market rate of retail marijuana. Altogether, that's almost 30 per cent tax. It could indicate that people are reselling their medical marijuana, obtained at a 2.9 per cent tax rate, on to the public. State economists are coming out with new forecast next month using the data from the first six months of sales. 'If another lawmaker from a different state came to me and said, ""I want legal marijuana sales because of the tax revenue for my state,"" I'd certainly make it known for them to take caution. It's not what people expected,' said Pabon.","Tax estimates for Colorado's recreational marijuana industry were $33.5 million .

'The two-cap England international has agreed a deal that will see him spend the entire 2014/15 season at Selhurst Park.' New Eagles manager Neil Warnock revealed on Thursday morning he spoke to Zaha about making the switch. 'I did speak to him last night,' Warnock told talkSPORT. 'I spent half an hour telling him why I want him to come back and I'm optimistic we are going to do it today.' Saviour: Neil Warnock (left), the new Crystal Palace manager, is bringing Zaha (right) back to Selhurst Park after the 21-year-old signed for United in 2013 but failed to break into the team .

"Angel di Maria will become the latest player to wear the iconic Manchester United No 7 shirt when he lines up for his debut at Burnley's Turf Moor on Saturday lunchtime. We are all aware of the legends who have worn this number down the years - George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. But what about those who wore the shirt but didn't live so long in the memory? Who took on the legend but weren't able to live up to expectations? MailOnline Sport takes a look back. VIDEO Scroll down Manchester United signing Angel Di Maria's career highlights . Magnificent Seven: Angel di Maria is the latest to wear the iconic Manchester United shirt number . Steve Coppell (United 1975-1983) It would certainly be unfair to say winger Coppell was a flop as a United No 7 but he perhaps didn't achieve the glory he deserved. Part of Tommy Docherty's promising team in the late seventies, he suffered FA Cup final heartache in 1976 when United were beaten by second division Southampton at Wembley. Coppell made amends 12 months later, ending Liverpool's Treble ambitions in a 2-1 win and in all he made 322 league appearances, scoring 53 times. Hindered by knee problems, Coppell was forced to retire in October 1983, at the age of just 28, before forging a long managerial career. Underachiever? Steve Coppell was good at United but perhaps could have been more . Ashley Grimes (United 1977-1983) Dublin-born utility player Grimes played in 107 matches for United during his half a dozen years at Old Trafford yet was never able to hold down a first-team place. He wasn't especially favoured by manager Dave Sexton and even less so by his successor Ron Atkinson, who brought in the likes of Bryan Robson. Grimes played for United during a relatively barren spell in their history for silverware but he did collect an FA Cup winners' medal in 1983 as an unused substitute in the final with Brighton. He was moved on to Coventry the same year and later played for Luton Town and Osasuna. He won 18 caps for the Republic of Ireland. Sent to Coventry: Ashley Grimes was never really favoured by his managers at Old Trafford . Ralph Milne (United 1988-1991) Squad numbers officially came along with the inception of the Premiership in 1992, but Milne wore the No 7 shirt during his three years at Old Trafford in the early Alex Ferguson years. United had finished second in the First Division the season before midfielder Milne arrived and Ferguson believed the former Dundee United man would help them win the title. It didn't quite transpire that way, with Milne scoring just three goals in 30 appearances for the club. He was certainly not loved by the fans and regularly crops up in debates about their worst-ever players. Ferguson admitted many years later that Milne was his worst signing, saying: 'I only paid £170,000 but still get condemned for it.' Given this, it's remarkable Milne clung on to the club's payroll until the summer of 1991 before being released. Trouble at Milne: Ralph Milne (right) is often mentioned when United fans discuss their worst ever players . Keith Gillespie (United 1993-1995) A member of the Class of '92 alongside Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville et al, Northern Irishman Gillespie was a player with real pace and promise. But he was unable to force his way past Russian Andrei Kanchelskis in an era of success for United and he only made a handful of first-team appearances. In the end, Gillespie moved on to Newcastle, part of the deal that brought striker Andy Cole to Old Trafford. He later went on to play for Blackburn, Leicester and Sheffield United among others and won 86 caps for his country. Struggle: Keith Gillespie (left) could not forge a career for himself on United's right wing . Michael Owen (United 2009-2012) It's fair to say that Ferguson's offer to join United came as a big surprise to Owen, who was considered well past his best and prone to injuries. Handed the No 7 shirt, Owen spent three years at United, making 52 appearances and scoring 17 times. He found it hard to dislodge the likes of Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov from the forward line and any progress seemed to be checked by yet another injury setback. Highlights included a last-minute winner against Manchester City and a Champions League hat-trick away to Wolfsburg. Injury hit: Michael Owen (right) spent a lot of his time at Old Trafford on the sidelines . Antonio Valencia (United 2009-present) After Owen's departure, the No 7 shirt was passed on the Valencia, who was entering his fourth season with the club. The change in number led to an inconsistent season with the Ecuador winger finding the net only once in 40 games, a decrease from his previous seasons. He duly switched back to his more familiar No 25 shirt the following year though it's debatable whether his form has actually improved for the change. He's got your number: Valencia is rebuked by Mark Clattenburg during his unsuccessful spell wearing seven . One of the best: United were in seventh heaven with Cristiano Ronaldo .

For United, Di Maria was a threat every time he had the ball at his feet, especially in space. The Argentine though, more renowned for his lethal crossing, was excellent feeding his fellow forwards - Wayne Rooney in particular. Of his 76 passes, 14 of them were long, with total accuracy of 80.3 per cent - a figure which dropped to 69.4 per cent in the attacking half when risks were more acceptable. Chilean Sanchez's passing numbers were never going to compare with Di Maria, with Arsenal having just 45.3 per cent of possession compared to United's 69 per cent. The Gunners' utility forward made 46 passes with a 60.9 per cent success rate. It was his workload that most impressed though, a he chased everything in sight and dragged City's defence into areas they may not have wanted to venture into. Starting on the left and spending spells on the right and up front when Welbeck went off, Sanchez is an undoubted asset for Arsene Wenger.

"Talulah Riley is getting $4.2million in her divorce from PayPal founder and Silicon Valley golden boy Elon Musk. It's not a bad sum for the 26-year-old British actress, considering the marriage lasted just two years. The divorce deal looks a little less generous in light of Mr Musk's net worth, which is an estimated $2billion -- the result of a fantastically successful career in the tech industry. Payoff: Talulah Riley, 26, was with billionaire playboy Elon Musk, 41, for four years. They were married for two years, but separated after just 10 months of marriage . Mr Musk -- whom the New York Times called 'Tony Stark without the Iron Man suit' -- is paying off his second wife over the course of nine years, TMZ reports . But, in the interim, Ms Riley gets to keep her Cartier and Gucci watches, an assortment of diamond jewelry and her $110,000 Tesla Roadster. Content: Ms Riley's lawyers aren't contesting the meager settlement . She received $1.4million up front as an initial payoff, according to court documents. Mr Musk, a South African who attended the University of Pennsylvania, made his fortune by founding a series of highly-successful ventures -- beginning with Zip2, which produced online content publishing software that was purchased in 1999 for nearly $340million. Later, for his next venture, Mr Musk helped create PayPal, the online money transfer and payment service. Ebay bought PayPal for $1.2billion in 2002. He founded Space X later that year -- a outer space exploration company. In 2009, the company launched the first privately-owned liquid-fueled rocket ever to enter space. Space X now has a contract to deliver cargo to the International Space Station that is worth between $1.6billion and $3.1billion. Mr Musk also founded Tesla Motors, an electric car company that had a $226million initial public offering in 2010. For all his wealth, Ms Riley seems content with the $4.2million figure. Her lawyers haven't contested the offer from Mr Musk, age 41 -- which amounts to little more than pocket change for a man who spends a reported $200,000 a month on personal expenses. In 2010, Mr Musk finalized the divorce with his first wife, Canadian fantasy novelist Justine Musk, who is the mother of his two sons. He had been with Ms Riley for four years before they separated in July 2011.","Elon Musk has is divorcing Talulah Riley, a 26-year-old British actress, after two years of marriage .

"As well as being home to 25,000 displaced Syrians and dozens of aid workers, the squalid Atmeh refugee camp - where Briton David Haines was captured by militants in March last year - is located just one mile from an ISIS stronghold full of swaggering UK jihadists who lived in a hilltop villa. Temporary canvas tents line the so-called Olive Tree camp's tracks, but the residents  dared not dream of going back to their home towns - and certainly wouldn't risk visiting nearby Atmeh village. Their lives and those of the aid workers such as Haines were in stark contrast to the self-described 'goodly' existence of ISIS militants are living in Atmeh - who posed for boastful photographs with expensive vehicles, swimming in luxury pools and relaxing in a huge mansion overlooking the camp. While the swaggering militants enjoy 'five star jihad' living like medieval lords in their hilltop fort, the terrified refugees below were forced to suffer regular raids on their rundown camp. It appears to have been on one of these missions that Haines was kidnapped along with three other men while working for an aid company MailOnline can now reveal to be the French Charity ACTED. Scroll down for video . The . jihadists regularly post social media updates boasting of how the spend . their time inside the villa.

ISIS militants are based just a short drive from the Olive Tree refugee camp in the nearby Atmeh village . The militants are believed to use this villa in the village of Atmeh as a centre for their local operations . The internet cafe in Atmeh village is dominated by Islamist flags, highlighting the danger so close to the camp . ISIS militants are known to have started massing in Atmeh late last year - around the time Al Qaeda condemned the group's barbarism, and a few months after Haines was kidnapped from the camp. Before this other Islamist militant groups were active in the area - among them the feared Nusra Front, who are believed to have originally kidnapped slain U.S. journalist James Foley before militants defecting to ISIS eventually took him with them. As if so-often the case with tech-savvy, Western-raised militants, many of the young ISIS fighters opted to document every aspect of life in their new stronghold is a series of social media posts. In stark contradiction to the hardships of the refugee camp below, a group of militants appear to have lived in a large hilltop mansion in Atmeh - posting images of themselves posing with expensive cars, swimming in luxury pools and keeping fit at an outdoor gym. The hub of their operations in Atmeh, however, seems to have been the village's internet cafe, where the men photographed themselves browsing on the internet while wielding guns in a room decorated with black and white jihadist flags. When two of the British militants, Choukri Ellekhlifi, 22, and Mohammed el-Araj, 23, were killed in clashes, a third fighter paid tribute to them Facebook, saying: 'This brother [el-Araj] need no introduction. Those who knew him knew he was always working for his deen [religious path].' Revealing the training the group had, the militant added: 'He had the best manners, he came with a brother and left this world with the brother! They where tight and where both at the top of their classes and within a month where graduated as commandos and started teaching others.' Danger: British hostage David Haines was captured by militants in the Atmeh camp in March last yea . Grim: Canvas and plastic tents line the camp's squalid tracks but the residents dare not dream of leaving to visit the nearby ISIS-occupied Atmeh village . As Haines . was kidnapped by Islamist militants in Atmeh refugee camp early in 2013, . there is nothing to suggest this particular band of ISIS loyalists . active in Atmeh later in the year had anything to do with his . disappearance, and exact details of who carried out the kidnapping . remain sketchy. It is also unclear whether the group are still active in Atmeh, which falls outside official estimates of territory under ISIS control - although these maps tend to ignore isolated pockets the group operates within, particularly in western Syria where villages are regularly taken and lost. Despite the dangers posed by jihadists . of all persuasion on its doorstep in 2013, the Olive Tree camp . attracted a number Westerners eager to raise . awareness of the refugees' desperate situation. Among . them was Steven Sotloff - the American journalist brutally beheaded by . an ISIS militant earlier this week in a sickening video that made public . the fact the group also held Haines. In . January 2013 - just two months' before Haines' capture - Sotloff wrote a . harrowing dispatch from Atmeh, in which he detailed the despair of . families with so little to eat that they willingly sold blankets . protecting them from the harsh Syrian winter in order to buy bread for . their malnourished children. The extremist group now presides over a mass of land equivalent to the size of the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq, and controls at least four million people. Atmeh is close to the border with Turkey . Jihadist snacks: As if so-often the case with tech-savvy, Western-raised militants, many of the young ISIS fighters opted to document every aspect of life in their new stronghold is a series of social media posts . Known . as the Olive Tree Camp, Atmeh was set up in 2011 by Texas-based Maram .

The . refugees had fled their homes as the Syrian conflict intensified, but . their hope of being allowed to seek refuge in Turkey was in vain and so . they were left with nowhere to go and very little to eat. Over . the next two years, the number of people living in the camp grew . steadily as Maram Foundation were joined by groups such as Aid For All . and Caravan of Mercy in providing food and medical aid. The growth of ISIS in the area isolated the locals still further - and among the images uploaded to social media by the militants were photographs of them practicing shooting in the very olive groves that gave the camp its name. Vast numbers of British jihadists have . arrived in Syria via Turkey's popular Antalya airport, where they pose . as tourists before slipping off along countryside roads leading to the . war-torn country.

For . many would-be militants the first stop along the way is the village of . Atmeh, which is believed to have become an ISIS stronghold due to the sheer number of Western fighters arriving via Turkey. The town's police station was painted in the distinctive black and white of ISIS' flag - a symbolic reminder that for them, law and order is a religious concept, not a man-made one. The ISIS militants and the various faction that came before them also carry out regular raids in the Atmeh camp. Officially at least it is protected by rebels from the Free Syrian Army, but as the population swelled the defence force has often proved incapable of stopping unwanted elements getting in - including jihadists, forces loyal to Syrian president Bashar Assad, and opportunist militia factions sent by local tribal leaders. When Sotloff wrote his dispatch for Foreign Policy during the bitter Levantine winter last January, the full terrifying force of ISIS had yet to properly arrive in Atmeh. Within just a few months, even the trees inside the camp were not safe from militants. Last November a 150-year-old tree was cut down by a masked militant wielding a chainsaw after it was deemed the residents of Atmeh spent more time venerating it than they did praising God.

"Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen, who killed 17 women in the early 1970s and 80s. He died in prison last month aged 75 . The remains of an unidentified victim of an Alaskan serial killer who hunted down his victims as if they were game have been exhumed in a bid to establish who she was. Robert Hansen confessed to killing 17 women in the 1970s and early 80s and after the murder 30 years ago, led authorities to her body near a lake in the north of Anchorage. However, she was never identified and Hansen died last month aged 75, while serving a 461-year sentence in Alaska. Now her body has been exhumed from from the cemetery at Anchorage Memorial Park with the hope that DNA testing and facial reconstruction will lead to her being identified. The woman, who was believed to in her late teens was found on April 25, 1984, near Horseshoe Lake. This led to her becoming known by many as 'Horseshoe Harriet' within the state's medical examiner's office. The work is being paid for by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and a former forensic anthropologist for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is working for the center on the case. Stephen Hoage, operations administrator for the state medical examiner's office said: 'We know what happened to her. 'We're not trying to solve the crime. We just want her to be identified.' Mr Hoage said the woman was among cases of unidentified and missing people that were being reviewed by the center, with authorities receiving permission for the exhumation, the day before Hansen died. The date on her grave marker is April 24, 1984, one day off the date the body was found. But that's not the only discrepancy, another Hansen victim, DeLynn Frey, reportedly also was found near the same lake on the same day, but Mr Hoage said Frey was found near another lake in 1985. Hansen was convicted in 1984 after confessing to killing 17 women, mostly dancers and prostitutes, during a 12-year span  in the 1970s and 80s. He was convicted of just four of the murders in a deal that spared him having to go to trial 17 times. Hansen was the subject of a 2013 film titled, 'The Frozen Ground,' which starred Nicolas Cage as an Alaskan State Trooper investigating the slayings, with actor John Cusack portraying Hansen. Hansen owned a bakery in a downtown mini mall and lived across town with his wife and children, who knew nothing of his double life. He would abduct the women and take them to remote places outside the city, sometimes driving them and other times he would fly his private plane. The identity of one of his victims, who was found near Horseshoe lake north of Anchorage has never been established and now her remains are being exhumed . Investigators have said that in some instances Hansen would rape the women but return them to Anchorage, warning them not to contact authorities. Other times, he would let the women go free in the wilderness and then hunt them with his rifle. In June 1983, one of his victims, Cindy Paulson, managed to escape his car as he loaded his plane to take her to his cabin. He had already tortured and raped her, and she was still handcuffed when she ran from his car to flag down passing traffic. She described the kidnapper and his plane to authorities, but when police questioned him, he had an alibi and a gentle demeanor, so they let him go. But after some bodies were found by hunters in the area, investigators re-visited suspects and realized he fit the profile. His alibi - two friends - also admitted they had been lying. They searched his plane, home and car and found he had some items, including jewelry, that had belonged to the women. Only 12 bodies of the 17 women Hansen confessed to killing have been found. The others were never located.","Robert Hansen confessed to killing woman over 30 years ago in Anchorage .

"A top Seattle lawyer has died after a truck crashed into her bike - leaving her partner to bring up their seven-month-old daughter alone. Sher Kung, 31, was riding in the bike lane along Second Avenue in the city on Friday morning when a truck made a left turn and struck her. She died at the scene. The tragic accident came less than two weeks before the city plans to improve safety for cyclists at the intersection, including adding a protected lane and a separate signal,King5 reported. The young lawyer, described by her firm Perkins Coie as 'one of our brightest young lawyers', had welcomed her first child, Bryn, with her fiancee Christine Sanders in February. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: 31-year-oldSher Kung, who welcomed a baby daughter with her partner earlier this year, was killed by a truck as she rode her bicycle in downtown Seattle last Friday . Loved: Kung, pictured with her fiancee Christine Sanders, was a top lawyer who had worked for LGBT issues . She was 'an exceptional lawyer and a wonderful comrade, with boundless energy, legal brilliance and relentless optimism,' Perkins Coie said in a statement on Saturday, the Seattle Times reported. 'Our hearts go out to her partner and their child, her extended family, and her many friends.' Most famously, Kung was part of the American Civil Liberties Union trial team that successfully challenged the military's 'Don't Ask Don't Tell' policy. In September 2010, she helped the ACLU represent Air Force Major Margaret Witt, a nurse who was fired from the military in 2004 for being gay. The court ordered the military to give Witt her job back. Adored: She shared numerous photographs of her welcoming baby Bryn to the family earlier this year . Happy: Sanders, 37, has now been left to bring up the seven-month-old girl alone . Loved up: A photograph shared on Kung's Facebook at the start of last year shows her proposing . In photos of Witt and her partner Laurie McChesney celebrating after their victory outside court in Tacoma, a fresh-faced Kung can be seen grinning beside them. More recently, Kung worked on intellectual-property issues and educational materials that helped educate farmworkers about their rights, the Seattle Times reported. She had received her bachelor's degree from Brown University and her law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of Law. She met Sanders, 37, more than three years ago and the couple enjoyed an active lifestyle together. In a Facebook post last year, Kung was pictured on one knee proposing to Sanders. On January 1, Sanders shared an image of her large baby bump with the comment: 'Happy New Year, little bug! At 37 weeks you're officially term and we can't wait to meet you.

Loved: A note left on the memorial thanked the young lawyer for her dedicated work on LGBT issues . 'I'm not sure how we did it all, but in 2013, we got engaged, bought a house and made a person. In 2014, we solemnly swear we'll accomplish a little less.' On a fundraising page set up in her memory, friends wrote: 'Sher Kung was a beautiful, active and caring person that was loved by everyone who had the honor of knowing her. 'A life lived with heart, joy, passion, and such soaring love for her family and friends. Her cheery smile, positive attitude and warm, energetic personality will be missed by many.' The truck driver has cooperated with investigators and showed no sign of impairment, police said. Friends have left running shoes and t-shirts at the scene, which has been marked by a white bicycle - a ghost bike.

"Formula One’s governing body, the FIA, have confirmed that Nico Rosberg will not face a sanction for his crash with Lewis Hamilton in Sunday’s Belgian Grand Prix. Although Hamilton claimed that Rosberg told him in a post-race meeting that he ‘deliberately’ orchestrated the second-lap collision, Mercedes’ director Toto Wolff tried to play down the accusation afterwards. Rosberg, too, said it was a ‘racing incident’. In light of the evidence, FIA spokesman Pierre Regent told Sportsmail: ‘The FIA will not intervene in this issue. Only a ""new element"" that would have appeared after the results became final could justify us opening an investigation. A comment alleged to have been made in an internal briefing and later denied by the team itself does not constitute such a ""new element"".’ Winging it: A piece of wing soars over Rosberg's car after the collision, which Hamilton says was deliberate .

With the FIA not prepared to investigate the incident, Rosberg will remain 29 points clear of Hamilton, who ultimately retired from the race as a result of the smash that initially punctured his tyre, while his Mercedes team-mate, Rosberg, came second behind Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo. Wolff was keen to distance himself from an initial briefing from within Mercedes that Hamilton’s recollection of his meeting with Rosberg was ‘broadly correct’. Wolff said: ‘They agreed to disagree in a very heated discussion, but it wasn’t deliberately crashing. That is nonsense. ‘Nico felt he needed to hold his line. He needed to make a point. He thought it was for Lewis to leave him space, and that Lewis didn’t leave him space. ‘It was deliberately taking into account that if Lewis moved it could end up in a crash.’ Rival: Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton was forced to retire after a collision at the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa .

"With one small tweet designed to have maximum effect, Andy Murray showed in the early hours of this morning that continually he has the capacity to surprise. Finally he has held true to what he said after winning Wimbledon, that he would have his say on Scottish independence, having spent the whole time in between making excuses for not doing so. Some of us have wearied of listening to his various reasons: 'I can’t vote anyway'/'Who cares what I think'/'It isn’t going to happen anyway' have been among his methods of batting away inquiries on the subject. Andy Murray poses with the union jack flag after winning gold and silver at the London 2012 Olympics . Murray pictured with the Scottish Saltire flag ahead of the Aberdeen Cup exhibition event in 2006 . Every hint he has dropped – and there have been plenty – suggested that he was a No sympathiser, reluctant to break his cover for fear of alienating some of his fellow Scots. And then he comes out on the actual day of the referendum to endorse the breaking up of the United Kingdom based, he says, on the negativity of the Unionist campaign of the past few days. His intervention happens to come on the day that Great Britain were drawn against USA at home in the first round of the Davis Cup World Group next season. Murray’s desire to see the end of Great Britain in its present form calls into question whether he will make himself available for the tie, even if the outcome of the referendum is, as most pollsters and bookmakers predict, a rejection of independence. Among the many contradictions in all this is that Murray has rarely played better than when wrapping himself in the Union Flag. He has only ever lost two singles rubbers in the Davis Cup while he was brilliant in the London Olympics in being carried to the singles gold medal on a tide of patriotic support. Murray celebrates after winning a gold medal in the men's singles at the London 2012 Olympics . Murray signs a Scottish flag during his homecoming parade in Dunblane in September 2012 . Murray tweeted his support for the Yes campaign in the early hours of Thursday morning . It was the summer of 2012 when his relationship with the wider British public became distinctly warmer. First there was the raw emotion he showed after losing the Wimbledon final to Roger Federer, and then there was his considerable part in the incomparable surge of national pride that accompanied London 2012. Suddenly many people started to believe what they may have read or heard in the media that he is a far more personable fellow than his often surly demeanour on court or in set-piece interviews would suggest. He was a willing part of the public relations effort around him to nurture this effect after the overblown reaction to some silly joshing about the England football team all the way back in 2006. So it is hugely admirable from one angle to stand up for his principles and throw all that to the wind in a probably doomed attempt to help secure victory for Alex Salmond, with the resulting chill in public attitudes towards him.

Murray (2nd left) joins Nick Clegg (left), David Cameron (3rd right), Ed Miliband (2nd right) and Angus Robertson during a cross-party reception at Downing Street to celebrate his Wimbledon triumph in 2013 . Slightly confusing, too. Murray stated that his mind had been swayed in the last few days by the ‘negative’ campaigning of the No campaign, yet the one politician he has spoken of in glowing terms before is Gordon Brown. On Wednesday Brown gave what was described as the most passionate speech of his career in defence of the Union, the centrepiece of the No side’s late push. Even political commentators who have spent years haranguing the former Prime Minister praised it as the most inspiring of his career, yet it seems to have swayed Britain’s tennis number one in the other direction. His brother Jamie also endorsed the Yes cause on Thursday morning while mother Judy is of a similar persuasion, despite being Fed Cup Captain of the British team. Murray and brother Jamie (right) speak at a GB press conference ahead of the London 2012 Olympics . Murray's brother Jamie also tweeted his support for the Yes campaign on Thursday morning . But it is the far more celebrated younger brother who now faces the collateral damage from suddenly making his views known. His representatives are currently negotiating a new clothing deal worth around £3 million per year whose value is unlikely to be enhanced by alienating so many, especially at a time when he is struggling to recapture previous form on the court. The GB ticket is a big selling point. You wonder how anti-independence Standard Life or their thousands of employees – facing being moved south or losing their jobs in the event of a Yes vote – will feel about their company spending millions on sponsoring an athlete who supports that outcome. Murray now finds himself a social media hero among the separatists, while in the infinitely more trivial world of British tennis there will be trepidation over whether, regardless of the referendum outcome, he will turn out for GB again in the sport’s premier team competition.","Andy Murray tweeted his support for the Yes campaign in the early hours of Thursday morning .

Teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by a white police officer on Aug. 9, triggering violent protests that rocked Ferguson - a St. Louis suburb - and shone a global spotlight on the state of race relations in America. ‘The excessive use of force by law enforcement officials against racial and ethnic minorities is an ongoing issue of concern and particularly in light of the shooting of Michael Brown,’ said Amir, an expert from Algeria. ‘This is not an isolated event and illustrates a bigger problem in the United States, such as racial bias among law enforcement officials, the lack of proper implementation of rules and regulations governing the use of force, and the inadequacy of training of law enforcement officials.’ The panel of 18 independent experts grilled a senior U.S. delegation August 13 about what they said was persistent racial discrimination against African-Americans and other minorities, including within the criminal justice system. U.S. Ambassador Keith Harper told the panel that his nation had made ‘great strides toward eliminating racial discrimination’ but conceded that ‘we have much left to do’. Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Brown, has been put on paid leave and is in hiding. A St. Louis County grand jury has begun hearing evidence and the U.S. Justice Department has opened its own investigation. Police have said Brown struggled with Wilson when shot. But some witnesses say Brown held up his hands and was surrendering when he was shot multiple times in the head and chest. Catalyst: The UN committee studied the US record on police brutality after Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown (pictured) earlier this month . In its conclusions issued on Friday, the UN panel said ‘Stand Your Ground’ Laws, a controversial self-defense statute in 22 US states, should be reviewed to ‘remove far-reaching immunity and ensure strict adherence to principles of necessity and proportionality when deadly force is used for self-defense’. Ron Davis, father of Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old shot dead in a car in Jacksonville, Florida during an argument over loud rap music in November 2012, attended the Geneva session. Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teen killed in Miami, Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer, testified. The UN panel monitors compliance with a treaty ratified by 177 countries including the US. ‘The Committee remains concerned at the practice of racial profiling of racial or ethnic minorities by law enforcement officials, including the FBI, Transportation Security Administration, border enforcement officials and local police,’ it said, urging investigations. The experts called for addressing obstacles faced by minorities and indigenous peoples to exercise their right to vote effectively. This was due to restrictive voter identification laws, district gerrymandering and state-level laws that disenfranchise people convicted of felonies, it said. Jamil Dakwar of the American Civil Liberties Union said the UN recommendations highlighted ‘shortcomings on racial equality that we are seeing play out today on our streets, at our borders and in the voting booth. ‘When it comes to human rights, the United States must practice at home what it preaches abroad,’ he said.","Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination concluded that minorities in US are victims of persistent discrimination .

"The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has accelerated quickly with almost 1,000 deaths in the last month alone, according to the latest World Health Organisation figures. The United Nations is establishing an Ebola Crisis Centre with the goal of stopping transmission in affected countries within six to nine months, the UN chief said, as the death toll from the outbreak surpassed 2,000 for the first time.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters after a meeting with senior UN leaders that $600million (£368m) is urgently needed for supplies to combat Ebola in West Africa. He again urged airlines and shipping countries to lift their bans on flights and port visits so doctors, nurses, beds, medical equipment and supplies can reach those in need. 'This is a huge serious challenge,' he said. 'We are organising to meet it and I am convinced we can succeed.' The New York-based Ebola Crisis Centre will coordinate efforts of the UN, aid organisations, governments, the private sector, financial institutions and other grass-roots groups to bring 'synergy and efficiency' to the effort to end the outbreak, he said.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters after a meeting with senior UN leaders that $600m (£368m) is urgently needed for supplies to combat Ebola in West Africa . 'The number of cases is rising exponentially,' Mr Ban said. 'The disease is spreading far faster than the response. People are increasingly frustrated that it is not being controlled.' Healthcare in Sierra Leone's capital city has 'crumbled' because the deadly Ebola outbreak has made people too terrified to go to hospitals, while some doctors are wary of treating those who do show up, a physician said. Speaking at the launch of a public education programme in Freetown, Kwame O'Neil said patients suffering from all kinds of ailments are dying due to lack of treatment because of the outbreak fears. WHO said the number of people who have died in the outbreak has reached 2,097 across five West Africa countries, with about half the deaths in Liberia. Above, a man contaminated with Ebola rests in a Monrovian hospital . A worker in a PPE suit uses a stick to move rubbish inside the high-risk quarantined zone of the John Fitzgerald Kennedy hospital in Liberia. Liberian officials today confirmed that a police barracks in central Monrovia was shut down after the wife of one of the officers died of Ebola . Ebola is a deadly disease for which there is no known cure and which is spread through contact with bodily fluids. One young girl died of appendicitis when, after showing up at a hospital, a doctor there denied he was a doctor and refused to treat her, Dr O'Neil said. Dr O'Neil also said his own aunt died after suffering a stroke and being left untreated at a hospital for two days. WHO said today that experts had agreed blood-derived drug therapies and convalescent serum may be used for treatment of the Ebola virus, and called for investment in the unproven drugs. Two 'promising' Ebola vaccines have also been identified, and safety results from clinical trials may be available this November, paving the way for their use, WHO assistant director-general Marie-Paule Kieny told a news conference. The two vaccines are made by GlaxoSmithKline Plc and NewLink Genetics, according to WHO documents submitted to the two-day talks attended by nearly 200 experts. 'These must be prioritised in terms of clinical development,' Kieny said. Sierra Leone has recorded 1,107 confirmed cases and 430 confirmed deaths from Ebola, according to the World Health Organisation. But the country's health ministry says most are outside the capital. The outbreak has killed about 1,900 people across five countries, according to WHO. By contrast, the capital of neighbouring Liberia has been the focal point of the outbreak there. Liberian officials today confirmed that a police barracks in central Monrovia was shut down after the wife of one of the officers died of Ebola. Information Minister Lewis Brown said the officers decided to 'self-quarantine'. About 35 officers live in the barracks with their families, said Abraham Kromah, deputy director of the national police force. Liberian Christian leaders planned to convene about 100 'prayer warriors' at a historic church in the capital to drive out Ebola, said the Rev Kortu Brown, vice president of the Liberian Council of Churches. The event was being held at the Providence Baptist Church, where Liberia's declaration of independence was signed in 1847. 'It is where Liberia has always prayed in the past when it was confronted,' Mr Brown said. A state of emergency in Liberia restricts public gatherings, though church services have largely continued unimpeded. In an article published in Time magazine, Dr Kent Brantly, an American who contracted Ebola in Liberia and who survived after receiving an experimental treatment in the US, said the world needs to act. 'Ebola has changed everything in West Africa,' Dr Brantly wrote. 'We cannot sit back and say, ""Oh, those poor people."" We must think outside the box and find ways to help.'

Clinton has kept a high public profile after leaving her post as secretary of state in 2013. In an article last month in the Atlantic, Clinton put some of the blame for the rise of ISIS on President Obama. 'The failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad—there were Islamists, there were secularists, there was everything in the middle—the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled,' said Clinton.

The message, at the time of writing, had been retweeted almost 1,000 times. Scroll down for video . Mocking: A joke tweet from the Russian Embassy in the UAE . One Twitter user fired back at the embassy, quipping: 'A tweeted claim as accurate as everything else coming out of the Russian government.' Another, meanwhile, did not see the funny side, writing: 'An official account mocking a tragedy. How shameful. Shows the lack of sensitivity of the Russian state.' It follows Russia responding to a sarcastic tweet by Canadian NATO officials that mocked their excuse that troops had mistakenly wandered into Ukraine with its own map of the area. The Twitter account Russians at NATO posted the map, which shows the Crimea region that was annexed by Russia in March, as part of Russian territory. It comes with an explanation they are helping Canadian colleagues 'catch up with the contemporary geography of Europe'. The social media spat began last week when the official NATO account of Canada tweeted a colour-coded map, marked in block letters to clearly show that Ukraine was 'NOT RUSSIA' and that Russia was indeed 'RUSSIA'. Russia has responded to Canada's mocking tweet by posing their own map of the area, showing the annexed Crimea region as part of Russia territory .

"A Thai woman is thought to have the world's biggest hands - weighing almost one-and-a-half stone each. For more than 50 years, shop owner Duangjay Samaksamam, from Surin Province, Thailand, has suffered from an extremely rare and painful affliction that leaves her limbs permanently swollen. Experts believe the 59-year-old is the only person in the world to suffer the rare condition macrodystrophia lipomastosa from shoulder to fingers on both arms. It causes vast build-up of fat deposits to be distributed across her arms and hands. Duangjay Samaksamam, from Surin Province, Thailand, is thought to have the world's biggest hands, with each weighing almost one and a half stone . The 59-year-old has the rare condition macrodystrophia lipomastosa, which causes vast fat deposits to distributed across her arms and hands . Moving can be very uncomfortable and even the simplest tasks, such as washing and combing her hair, are extremely difficult for Duangjay. Embarrassed by her condition throughout her childhood, she spent the first 20 years of her life as a recluse ashamed of the way she looked, meaning she never went to school. But she was forced to come out of hiding at the age of 20 to earn a living in order to care for her elderly parents, and take over running the family grocery shop. Duangjay has caught the attention of medics all over the world and many have attempted surgery to decrease the swelling but, to date, none have succeeded. She said: 'My hands are so heavy I can barely lift them to comb or shampoo my hair, it's very difficult. Getting dressed is also very difficult and painful. 'Some doctors said the only solution was to cut off my hands if I wished to walk around freely. But I don't want to do that.' Growing up she struggled to come to terms with her oversized hands - for which there is no cure - and spent most of childhood avoiding people, skipping school and hiding in the family home. 'My mum told me that I was like this since I was born. I became afraid to go out or go to school, so I never learned to read,' she said. Moving can be very uncomfortable and even the simplest tasks, such as washing and combing her hair, are extremely difficult for Duangjay . Embarrassed, she spent the first 20 years of her life as a recluse ashamed of the way she looked, meaning she never went to school. But she was forced to come out of hiding at the age of 20 to earn a living in order to care for her elderly parents, and take over running the family grocery shop, pictured above .

Some doctors said the only solution was to cut off my hands if I wished to walk around freely. But I don't want to do that' At the age of 25, she started undergoing a series of operations to try and treat her condition but rather than improving the situation the surgery made it worse . Raised in a rural village in Thailand, there were no medical experts who could provide treatment and Duangjay was so self-conscious that she refused to go out in public. But when her parents became elderly and unable to work, she had no choice but stop being a recluse and take over the family business. As news spread of her condition, at age 25 she started undergoing a series of operations to try and solve her problem. Experts believe she is the only person in the world to have the condition from shoulder to fingers in both arms . But  rather than improving the situation, the surgery made the condition worse. Duangjay who now lives with her sister and her niece, said: 'During the surgery they didn't remove any tissue, just opened it up, opened up my arm to check it. 'They said it wasn't bad tissue just really thick fat in there, but they didn't remove anything for fear of damaging the nerves. 'After five months my wrists began to hurt. I felt so much pain. I couldn't sleep. 'If I held something it would fall out of my hands because I couldn't feel them.' Having undergone two further operations, Duangjay was left in a crippling condition. She added: 'They removed about 700 grams of fat and blood out of my hands but after a month it just grew back.' Months later she was contacted by a doctor, from Kitasato University in Japan, who flew her to the country for MRI scans and discovered she was suffering from Macrodystrophia Lipomatosa. Plastic surgeon Dr Eiju Uchinuma said: 'This case is very rare. Both her arms are enlarged. Her arms and hands are enormous so they swell badly but it could be worse. 'My diagnosis is that she is the first and only person in the world who has Macrodystrophia Lipomatosa from shoulders to her fingers on both arms. 'The cause of the disease is unknown and is therefore incurable.' Duangjay's story appears in a new series of Body Bizarre, September 25, 9pm on TLC.","Duangjay Samaksamam from Thailand suffers macrodystrophia lipomastosa .

"Former care home manager Janet Tracey died at Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge after a 'do not resuscitate' notice was placed on her medical file . Doctors have a legal duty to consult patients and their relatives before placing ‘do not resuscitate’ orders unless there are ‘convincing reasons not to’, the Court of Appeal said yesterday. The court ruled that the human rights of care home manager Janet Tracey, 63, were violated when a DNR order was placed on her medical notes without  discussing it with her first. The landmark judgment follows a lengthy legal battle led by Mrs Tracey’s husband David and paves the way for greater consultation of patients and relatives over end-of-life decisions. National guidance already recommends consultation, but yesterday’s ruling confirmed for the first time that doctors have a legal obligation to do so under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Grandmother Mrs Tracey had  terminal lung cancer when she was admitted to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, in Cambridge, with a fractured neck following a serious car accident in February 2011. Despite a poor prognosis, her family say she had ‘a strong will to live’ and ‘wanted to have every minute of every day’ for her four daughters and seven grandchildren. Mrs Tracey had told doctors she wished to be included in conversations about her care, and even wrote a note to one consultant from her hospital bed which said ‘Please do not exclude me’ and ‘I will do my damnedest’. So she was ‘distraught’ and ‘horrified’ to discover that a DNR order had been placed on her notes without her knowledge. When Mrs Tracey objected it was cancelled by Addenbrooke’s staff, but it was reinstated days later following discussions with the family after her condition deteriorated, and she passed away on March 7, 2011. Mrs Tracey's widowed husband, David, pictured with daughters Alison Noeland (left) and Kate Masters (right), said he was pleased with the judges' decision outside court today . Appeal court judges found Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge violated Mrs Tracey's human rights . Yesterday, Lord Dyson, Master of the . Rolls, ruled the first DNR unlawful, and that the hospital breached Mrs . Tracey’s right under Article 8 to respect for private and family life by . ‘failing to involve her in the process’. He said it was a human rights breach because ‘a decision as to how to pass the closing days and moments of one’s life’ clearly touches on ‘a patient’s personal autonomy, integrity, dignity and quality of life’. Yesterday, Mr Tracey, 67, a retired engineer, said: ‘My wife spent her life looking after the elderly. 'She knew about the options and wanted to take part in discussions about her treatment. ‘It was extremely distressing for her when she found out about the DNR. 'We hope this will go some way to helping other patients. I feel relief that something has been done.’ Lord Dyson added: ‘Since a [DNR] . decision is one which will potentially deprive the patient of . life-saving treatment, there should be a presumption in favour of . patient involvement. 'There need to be convincing reasons not to involve the patient.’ The court stressed the importance of the case as DNR orders affect most of the population ‘directly or indirectly’ because 68 per cent of the population die in hospital and 80 per cent die with such notices in place. Kate Masters, 47, one of Mrs Tracey’s four daughters, said: ‘It was absolutely awful for my mum to find out that this decision had been taken without consulting her. We are really pleased with the outcome and we hope it will give some protection to other patients – that’s what my mum did not have.’ Current guidance – which is issued by the British Medical Association, the Resuscitation Council and the Royal College of Nursing – is now expected to be updated to reflect the ruling. Dr Keith McNeil, chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Today’s ruling hinges on a specific point of law. There was no criticism of our clinical care.’","Janet Tracey was in a car accident after terminal lung cancer diagnosis .

"Not so long ago, Daley Blind – Manchester United’s new £14million signing, World Cup star and current Dutch Player of the Year – was in danger of seeing his career disappear down the pan. Shipped out on loan to Gronigen and mercilessly derided by the Ajax fans on his return to the Amsterdam Arena in the summer of 2010, Blind’s confidence was in tatters and his future in doubt. He was, they said, only there because of his father, Ajax legend Danny Blind. At times, the youngster’s performances did little to deflect the flak coming his way. Blind looked out of his depth and it seemed inevitable that he would have to leave a club he had joined at the age of seven. VIDEO Scroll down for Daley Blind featured in Ajax 4-1 victory over Vitesse Arnhem . New beginnings:  Daley Blind joined Manchester United in a £14million move from Ajax on Monday . All smiles: Blind (left) has been reunited with Louis van Gaal (right) after the pair worked together at Holland . Rough ride: Blind's early career at Ajax received a lot of flak from fans who thought he wasn't good enough . ‘The public was not always kind to me, they are quite critical here,’ he admitted later. It was former Tottenham and Fulham boss Martin Jol who decided to give Blind another chance, and Jol’s successor Frank de Boer who spotted his true potential. Even then, as recently as two years ago, he was substituted on the opening day of the 2012-13 season at home to AZ Alkmaar with sarcastic cheers ringing in his ears. That was to be Blind’s breakthrough campaign. He was voted Ajax’s Player of the Year as they lifted a third successive Dutch title – a fourth followed in April together with the honour of being voted the best player in Holland – and he was called up to the Netherlands squad by Louis van Gaal in February 2013.

International pedigree: Blind's performances at Ajax have made him a regular in the Dutch national team . On the ball: Blind shone for Holland as they finished third at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Blind has been an automatic choice for his country ever since. When Van Gaal’s side finished third at this summer’s World Cup, Blind caught the eye with his high-energy performances as a left wing-back and outstanding range of passing. People are bound to remember Robin van Persie’s spectacular diving header in the 5-1 win against reigning champions Spain more than the pin-point 50-yard pass that picked out his run. Blind rounded off an outstanding tournament with a well-taken goal in the third-place play-off victory over hosts Brazil, and his remarkable rise was complete late on Monday night when United confirmed that the 24-year-old had followed Van Gaal to Old Trafford. Crowning glory: Blind (left) scored for Holland in their third-place play-off win against Brazil . Ardent fan: Fleur (centre right) was in the Holland crowd cheering Blind on during the World Cup . Stunning beauty: Blind's girlfriend Fleur (right) works as a model and dancer . Mr Versatile: Blind's (right) ability will make him a valuable asset to Van Gaal and United this season . It had been expected for some time, not least after the player was seen strolling through Manchester with his girlfriend Candy-Rae Fleur, a model and dancer, on Sunday. In spite of Blind’s impressive performances on the left for Holland, he is expected to be deployed in a deep midfield role at United. It is the position he filled as he progressed through Ajax’s much-vaunted youth system and one that he returned to so successfully under De Boer last season. ‘I’m indebted to Frank de Boer,’ says Blind. In many ways he is the archetypal Ajax product; an intelligent, disciplined and tactically astute player capable of operating in a number of different positions and following his coach’s orders to the letter. Exactly the type of player that Van Gaal wants to bring to United. Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page. D Blind leading D Blind: The Holland coach (left) talks to his son during a training session . Some may question Blind’s lack of pace or physicality, even though he has beefed up significantly from the skinny youngster who made his senior debut at the age of 18, more than a decade after joining the Amsterdam giants. But he has tremendous stamina and a sharp football brain that enables him to dictate the tempo of a game when his team are in possession and then lead the pressing game to win the ball back when they are not. Most of all, those harsh early years toughened him up mentally and helped mould a formidable character somewhat at odds with those boyish looks and trademark mop of blond hair. Like father, like son: Blind's dad Daley (left) is an Ajax legend for his 13 years service at the club . Captain leader legend: Danny Blind skippered Holland many times, including at Euro 96 . It’s worth noting that Blind Snr also endured a difficult start to his career before going on to achieve legendary status at Ajax by lifting the 1995 Champions League under Van Gaal. Now his son is following a different route, but fate has brought him together with the enigmatic coach. ‘He has put a lot of trust in me and I feel really good about that,’ said Blind after completing his move to Old Trafford. ‘It’s a little bit crazy. I was with Ajax from seven years old which feels like a whole lifetime. But I’m 24 now and I think it’s a good move to make – a chance like this may never come again.’","Manchester United signed Ajax's Daley Blind in a £14million deal on Monday .

"Not since May, 1987 have Coventry fans driven through the city blaring horns with sky blue scarves waving from car windows. On Friday, after a soulless season spent some 35 miles away at Northampton’s Sixfields Stadium, their football team returns home to the Ricoh Arena. A dispute over rent between the club’s owners, Sisu, and Ricoh operators, Arena Coventry Limited, has now been resolved, and nearly 25,000 are expected for the League One visit of Gillingham, hundreds having camped overnight for a ticket. Home sweet home: Coventry haven't played at their Ricoh Arena for over a year due to a rent dispute . Pure ecstasy: Coventry's Ricoh Arena return has been viewed on par with their 1987 FA Cup success . Such is the feeling of relief, ecstasy and pride at a protest waged and won, celebration has been akin to 27 years ago when Coventry – memorably, thanks to Keith Houchen’s diving header – lifted the FA Cup following a 3-2 victory over Spurs at Wembley. And Houchen told Sportsmail: ‘Last season I just could not comprehend that this was the same club which I played for, it was soul destroying. ‘But to be back in Coventry is brilliant. I hear fans are queuing around the block for tickets and this will be their cup final all over again. ‘They have been at their lowest ebb recently but hopefully this is the start of a new era – the fans deserve massive credit.' Protest: Coventry fans have been calling for the club's owners to depart for the dispute over the Ricoh Arena . Little atmosphere: Coventry have been playing their home games at Northampton Town, 35 miles away . For, as Houchen alluded, this is a triumph for supporters, for those who boycotted ‘home’ matches and instead campaigned – peacefully – for a return to the city. Barely a major sporting event has passed without representation from the ‘Keep Cov in Cov’ campaign; there were flags at the World Cup in Brazil on the Copacabana Beach and in front of Christ the Redeemer, as there have been at England internationals, be it football, cricket or rugby. The local newspaper, the Coventry Telegraph, petitioned every Football League club to join their cause and today they print a super-sized poster marking the victory. Force: Coventry forward Simeon Jackson will hope to fire in the goals to promote Coventry out of League One . Since confirmation of the return, fans have posted on YouTube a remake of Baddiel and Skinner’s famous ‘Football’s Coming Home’ anthem, including the quite wonderful words: ‘Cheers for heroes in Sky Blue, we had a fight with Sisu, but we knew, we’d come through… Elephants on the shirt, FA Cup still gleaming, many years of hurt.’ Friday evening, then, promises to be some occasion. ‘A lot of fans thought we would never return,’ Michael Orton, co-ordinator of Keep Cov in Cov told us. ‘But this creates a feeling of absolute pride throughout the whole city. We have kept our dignity but have protested continuously and this is a result for everyone who boycotted Northampton (where attendances averaged around 1,500). ‘Of course, we were never that attached to the Ricoh Arena previously and we longed for Highfield Road, but absence makes the heart grow fonder and we’re determined to make this our home now. It will be a special night and a real “I was there” occasion.’ Pleased as punch: Coventry boss Steven Pressley can't wait for his side to return to the Ricoh Arena . Manager Steven Pressley has played the role of master diplomat amid the conflict, but his words were telling. ‘I think if the supporters had turned out in their numbers at Sixfields there would not have been such a great pressure to return,’ said the Scot. ‘But the supporters have voted with their feet and I think you can never forget that football clubs are built around the supporters.’ Indeed, the Sky Blues now have 25,000 around which to build their future.","25,000 fans expected at League One visit of Gillingham to the Ricoh Arena .

"Caroline Wozniacki stayed on course for a second grand slam final appearance with a rout of Sara Errani in the quarter-finals of the US Open. After beating Maria Sharapova on Sunday for one of the best victories of her career, Wozniacki picked up where she left off to defeat 13th seed Errani 6-0 6-1. And the 10th seed will be a big favourite to reach the final when she takes on unseeded Chinese player Peng Shuai in the last four. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Caroline Wozniacki get wet in the ice-bucket challenge! One step closer: Caroline Wozniacki eased past Sara Errani to reach the semi-finals of the US Open . Sealed with a kiss: Wozniacki celebrates her win in New York having lost just one game to Errani . Wozniacki reached the only slam final of her career in New York in 2009, losing to Kim Clijsters, and is through to the last four at one of the big four tournaments for the first time in three years. Errani beat Venus Williams in round three and things might have been different had she taken one of four break points in the first game. But Wozniacki saved them all and thereafter played a near perfect match, mixing aggression with control and seizing on Errani's weak serve at every opportunity. The Italian did not hold serve once in the match but did at least manage to break the Wozniacki serve at the start of the second set. Normal service was soon resumed, though, and it was a sign of how good Wozniacki is feeling about her game that a player known for her defensive capabilities hit 26 winners. On top: Wozniacki has reached the last four of a grand slam for the first time in three years . Blown away: Errani had no answer to Wozniacki in New York as she was knocked out of the US Open . The 24-year-old said: 'It was a great match. It was really tricky conditions with the wind but I stayed aggressive and it really paid off today. The first game was very important. I was a little bit nervous but I served really well after that. 'To be in the semi-finals means so much to me. It's been an up and down year but it's an incredible feeling and it shows that hard work pays off.' Wozniacki has beaten Peng in five of their six previous meetings but the Chinese woman was equally impressive in a comprehensive victory over Belinda Bencic earlier. 'She's been on tour for so long,' said Wozniacki. 'She's very aggressive so it's not going to be easy but I'm so happy to be in the semis and having another chance to be here.'","Caroline Wozniacki beat Sara Errani 6-0, 6-1 to reach the last four .

"Jack Wilshere does not need reminding just how important this season is to his career. The Arsenal midfielder is painfully aware that, at the age of 22, he must start to deliver on his enormous potential and put the injury-ravaged start to his career behind him. Ahead of Monday’s Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland, Wilshere knows England boss Roy Hodgson is looking to him with expectation after losing Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, and is not impressed with what feels like a barrage of criticism from former internationals. VIDEO Scroll down for Jack Wilshere discussing a big season, his form and recent criticism . Positive response: England midfielder Jack Wilshere is hoping to prove the critics wrong . Injury problems: Wilshere has struggled for fitness during the early years of his career . Opinionated: Paul Scholes (left) and Jamie Redknapp (right) have launched successful careers in punditry after hanging up their boots . Sky Sports — August 2014 . Jack Wilshere’s problem is Jack Wilshere. He’s not performing. He’s got to take games by the scruff of the neck like two years ago — there’s no excuses anymore. Daily Mail — June 2014 . With Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard coming to the end with England, Jack has an open goal to be our midfield general. Daily Mail — September 2013 . Jack looks like he is lacking confidence. Maybe he has a lack of faith in his body after so many injuries in quick succession. It happens, I know. Daily Mail — February 2013 . Jack Wilshere wore Paul Gascoigne’s old No 8 shirt and showed signs he could be England’s next midfield genius. Daily Mail — October 2012 . Wilshere, like all very good players, has an image in his head of where the next pass is going — that means he is a step ahead. It started last season with Paul Scholes and resurfaced after Arsenal’s opening game of the season from Sportsmail columnists Jamie Carragher and Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports. Carragher claimed the brilliant form of Aaron Ramsey was Wilshere’s ‘biggest problem’ but Redknapp said: ‘I think you are being kind. Jack Wilshere is Jack Wilshere’s biggest problem. ‘He is not performing. He has got to do better. He has to take games by the scruff of the neck. There are no excuses for this young man any more. It’s nothing to do with smoking. I played with better players than him who smoked. He has got to do better on the pitch.’ Last season, Scholes said on television that Wilshere had not improved since he was 17. It prompted a call to Scholes for an explanation, then Scholes hit out again at Wilshere for going public about their conversation. ‘With Paul Scholes, we weren’t even playing,’ said Wilshere. ‘I think it was a Manchester United game and he came at me. I spoke openly about it which, obviously, I shouldn’t have. ‘If anything, I think Redknapp should have a little bit more sympathy. He was injured just as much as I was. Maybe more than I was. He was never injured at my age and it does take a lot of mental strength. So to hear people go on TV and say: “He’s got to be doing this or that”. I don’t need that. Winner: Wilshere will be hoping to add to his trophy collection after winning the FA Cup last season . Eye on the ball: Midfielder Wilshere started England's friendly against Norway on Wednesday . ‘It disappoints me. It’s easy to go on TV and say: “He’s got to do this or that” or “if he’s not fit, he’s not in the starting line-up and he’s got to get fitter”. That’s the easy way out. I’ll take criticism. I know that’s part and parcel of football. But when it’s just reckless and aggressive, I don’t listen.’ Sportsmail’s Redknapp twice broke his ankle on England duty near the start of his career and later suffered a succession of knee problems, which led to 12 operations, restricted him to 17 caps and ended his career at the age of 31. He has criticised Wilshere, but he has also showered him with praise. Wilshere was 17 and hailed as the nation’s great midfield hope when he was hit by a series of ankle injuries and tendinitis. It has taken time to get back to the same high levels and his lifestyle has also come under scrutiny. ‘I’ve been caught a couple of times smoking, but I’m not a regular smoker,’ said Wilshere. ‘I spoke with Arsene Wenger after the second time and it was: “Look, come on Jack. This is a big season for you”. I knew that already. When I came back to pre-season training I said I’d be fit and ready to start and I have been.’","The Arsenal man has responded to recent criticism of his performances .

"Harnaam Kaur, 23, is embracing her facial hair . A 23-year-old woman with a condition causing excessive hair development has revealed that she would like to find love - and says she hopes someone will be attracted to her in the future. Harnaam Kaur, of Slough Berkshire has already admitted that that growing a beard makes her feel more feminine but in a new interview with This Morning she said she is looking for someone to share her life with. She told presenter Eamonn Holmes: 'I'm looking for someone to accept me truly. 'I understand certain people won't be attracted to me but there are so many people in the world and I hope there's someone out there who will accept me.' Eamonn agreed saying, 'I hope so', but later presenter Jenni Falconer read out comments sent in by viewers, some of which were not very kind. One said: 'I was confused about whether Harnaam was a male or female. 'Personally I think it's horrible looking but who am I to judge?' Harnaam suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome - and a beard first started to appear on her face aged just 11. The hair quickly spread to her chest and arms, and the condition made her the victim of taunts at school and on the street. She even received death threats from strangers over the internet. But Miss Kaur has now decided to stop cutting her hair after being baptised as a Sikh - a religion in which cutting body hair is forbidden. She said: ‘I would never ever go back now and remove my facial hair because it's the way God made me and I'm happy with the way I am. 'I feel more feminine, more sexy and I think I look it too. I've learned to love myself for who I am nothing can shake me now.’ During her early teens, Miss Kaur was so ashamed of her beard that she waxed twice a week, and also tried bleaching and shaving. But the hair became thicker and spread - with Miss Kaur feeling so self-conscious that she refused to leave her house. She even began self-harming and she considered suicide. She said: ‘I got bullied badly - at school I was called a “beardo” and things like “shemale” and “sheman”. I can laugh about it now, but back then it affected me so badly that I began to self-harm because it felt better than all the abuse I was getting. ‘I'd talk to people with a hand over my face and I wore baggy, tomboy clothes to cover up the hair on my chest and arms. ‘I didn't want to go outside my house because I couldn't take the stares from strangers so I'd lock myself in my room. It got so bad that I just didn't want to live anymore.’ Scroll down for video . Harnaam Kaur talks to Eamonn and Ruth on the This Morning sofa about how she would like to find a partner who accepts her facial hair . Despite all the opposition, she took the step to bear her beard, and now embraces the thick hair on her face and chest. But at the age of 16, everything . changed for Miss Kaur when she decided to be baptised as a Sikh. It . meant she would have to let her facial hair grow out. The . decision proved controversial - especially with her family. Miss Kaur . said: ‘My mum and dad didn't want me to do it - they didn't think I'd be . able to have a normal life if I had a beard. ‘They . worried I wouldn't be able to get married and that I'd never get a job. But I wanted to make my own decisions and live for myself - not anyone . else. I'd had enough of hiding. Out in Slough: Miss Kaur (centre) with her younger brother Gurdeep, 18, and friend Surrinder Bhachy, 40 . ‘I'd . had enough of the bullying and the self-harming and the suicidal . thoughts. I wanted to change my whole outlook on life and I thought I . thought it was time to stop locking myself away - I had to do something . about it.’ PCOS is a common condition affecting a woman's ovaries, with three main features. These are cysts developing in their ovaries, the ovaries not regularly releasing eggs, and high levels of male hormones - 'androgens'. The syndrome is associated with irregular hormone levels in the body, including insulin. There is no cure for the condition, but medicine is available to treat symptoms such as excessive hair growth and fertility problems. Most women with the condition can get pregnant - but sometimes need a surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling. This involves destroying tissue in the ovaries making androgens including testosterone. Her parents have come to terms with her decision - and her brother Gurdeep Singh, 18, is her biggest supporter. She said: ‘It was incredibly daunting going outside because people would stare more than ever. At first I was angry but I realised . that they didn't understand and were probably too afraid to ask me so I . just decided to smile back.’ But . Miss Kaur has struggled to get a job and even shaved off her beard at . the age of 17 after pressure from members of her extended family. She said: ‘I removed my beard once during a really low moment but when I'd done it all I could do was cry because I didn't feel like myself without my beard. ‘My brother was actually the one person who was completely shocked by what I had done - he hugged me and said I had looked so beautiful with my beard, he didn't understand why I had done it.’ She added: ‘It was from that point that I thought I'm never going to remove it ever again.’ Happier now: Miss Kaur has been employed at a local Sikh primary school as a teaching assistant and her confidence has soared . Since then Miss Kaur has been employed at a local Sikh primary school as a teaching assistant and her confidence has soared. 'I couldn't take the stares from strangers so I'd lock myself in my room. It got so bad that I just didn't want to live anymore' Harnaam Kaur . She said: ‘I still get shop assistants calling me “sir” and strange looks from people - they see my beard first and realise I've actually got breasts too. It must be confusing for a lot of people. ‘The funniest reactions I get are from the children at my school. Some ask me what my beard is and I joke it's a Halloween costume. Some even ask me where I buy it and I just say “Asda”. ‘I can laugh about it now - sometimes I say I'm a man and I put on a deep voice to scare other people because it's quite funny to see their reaction.’ Siblings: Her parents have come to terms with her decision - and her brother Gurdeep Singh, 18, is her biggest supporter . Despite often being mistaken for a man, Miss Kaur says she feels more feminine than ever - choosing girly tops over baggy, high-necked jumpers. 'I feel more feminine, more sexy and I think I look it too' Harnaam Kaur . She said: ‘I'm able to go out and shop in the women's section without feeling I shouldn't be there. I wear skirts, dresses and jewellery and I like to get my nails done like every other girl.’ Today Miss Kaur hopes her story will help other women find self-confidence. She has decided to share her story on YouTube - and continues to upload videos despite receiving death threats. She said: ‘I've had people telling me they're going to burn me and throw a brick at me - all sorts of things like that. Younger days: Miss Kaur is pictured (left and right) during a wedding in India, aged 13. A beard first started to appear on her face aged just 11 . ‘But I've also had a lot of positive messages from women in the same situation as me. I've also had loads of nice comments from men all over the world. One even asked me to marry him. ‘I haven't found a potential husband yet. I still get some grief from the men in my community and it does still seem to be a barrier to marriage. But I'm young and there's still plenty of time for that. ‘All that matters to me at the moment is that I love myself. I love my beard and all my other little quirks - my tattoos, my scars, stretch marks and blemishes. ‘I want other women to find the strength that I have. If I had any message it would be to live the way you want - it's your journey and it's your life.’","Harnaam Kaur, 23, of Slough, Berkshire, has polycystic ovary syndrome .

"Authorities say 12 elementary school students have been injured after their school bus overturned on a North Texas highway as the driver became distracted. The Texas Department of Public Safety says the Waxahachie Independent School District bus ended up on its side Tuesday morning. Trooper James Colunga says 19 children and the driver were on board during the wreck midway between Waxahachie and Boyce. Overturned: The bus lay on its side off a Texas highway after the accident which saw 12 children injured . Lucky escape: The driver was distracted by something happening behind him, took his eyes off the road and swerved before over-correcting, causing the bus to tip over . He says 12 children have injuries not believed to be life-threatening and were transported to hospitals to be checked. The children are suffering head and neck pain and abdominal problems, reports NBC. The most serious injury appears to be a young boy's broken arm. The driver wasn't hurt. Colunga says the driver was monitoring the children, became distracted, the bus wheels left the road and the vehicle overturned during the morning route. According to NBC, the driver saw something in the back of the bus that distracted him, causing him to look away from the road and swerved before over-correcting, which caused the bus to overturn. Clean-up: The bus was towed and the injured children taken to hospital - there were no injures more serious than a broke arm . The bus was near Farm-to-Market Rd and Ike road at around 6:50am when the accident occurred. School district officials did not immediately identify the driver.

"Steven Gerrard says that Luis Suarez 'engineered' his move away from Anfield this summer, expressing his disappointment at his former teammate's World Cup antics and summer move. The former England captain said that he knew Suarez would leave Liverpool as soon as he saw the Uruguayan's bite on Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini. Gerrard had hoped that Suarez would stay at the club after he topped the scoring charts in the Premier League last season, but told Sky Sports that the incident, which led to a four month ban, was the turning point.

'I was actually already on the floor when I saw the bite because we knew we were going out. It was a double blow, knowing you're going out of the World Cup and knowing you're going to lose your best player.

"Roberto Martinez has given Romelu Lukaku his ultimate backing by insisting he would have paid £100million to sign the striker. Lukaku became the biggest signing in Everton's history at £28m last month and he will be aiming to prove a point when he faces Chelsea for the first time on Saturday. Diego Costa's hamstring injury, which is likely to rule him out for six-to-seven weeks, has again raised the debate about whether Chelsea were too quick to let the young Belgium centre forward leave, particularly with doubts over Fernando Torres' long-term future and whether Didier Drogba will be as effective in his second spell. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez: Signing Lukaku is a statement of intent . Public backing: Roberto Martinez has backed Romelu Lukaku to live up to his price-tag . True blue: Lukaku will be hoping to do the business against former side Chelsea on Saturday . Some have questioned whether Everton paid too much for Lukaku, particularly when Costa only cost Chelsea £4m more, but Martinez is adamant the striker is worth the fee because he is integral to the club's ambitions. When asked about the difference in the respective fees for Lukaku and Costa, Martinez replied: 'They are different ages and the situation at Atletico Madrid is very different in how they work. Sometimes as a club you have a say and sometimes you have investment groups who have a say. That could be one answer. 'Secondly, it's not about the value. I would have paid £100m for Lukaku. If I had the money, why not? 'The figure is insignificant. It is about the character and type of player you want in the group. Sometimes a player at £3m can be an expensive buy and sometimes a player at £28m can be a very cheap buy.' It will be intriguing to see how Lukaku handles the occasion of facing Chelsea, given that there was a cold relationship between him and Jose Mourinho, which stemmed from how the 21-year-old left the club on transfer deadline day 12 months ago to join Everton. Point to prove: Lukaku failed to make the cut at Chelsea despite the west London side's striker shortage . Worth £100m? Lukaku's Premier League record . He only made 15 appearance for Chelsea and never scored for them, spending the majority of his three years at Stamford Bridge on loan, but Martinez does not have any concerns that Lukaku – who he expects to be available after a toe problem – will be preoccupied about proving a point. 'I know what you are saying,' said Martinez. 'My answer is of course he is human and leading up to the game people will say you are facing your old team-mates and manager. That is normal. But what I am saying is at this level, the level of performance will not change from against Arsenal or Leicester. 'He has a status and vital role for us. I see him wanting to play 90 minutes against Leicester when he was not ready, and wanting to stay on against Arsenal when it would be easy for him to say he wanted to be ready for Chelsea and so wait until he is 100 per cent. 'He is not going through the motions he is raising his levels. Every game he is fresh so I do not see any difference at all. Rom has found a very strong inner motivation. We are excited about what he can give us. It is not about him facing his former club.' Bounce back: Martinez will look to see off Chelsea at Goodison after settling for a 2-2 draw against Arsenal .

He hugged both left and right touchlines at times, drifted inside to make an impact on other occasions, and had the energy to get into the penalty area with some great runs. From an inside-right position, he produced a fantastic pass with the outside of his left boot for Sergio Aguero to score the opening goal.

He crossed for Tottenham’s Erik Lamela from the right-hand byline and set up Federico Fernandez with a set-piece. He then scored the fourth himself with a delightful dink over advancing goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, timing his run into the area to perfection to receive and dispatch Javier Mascherano’s pass. It must have given food for thought for van Gaal as he works out how to assemble his expensive chess pieces in the right formation. He was the outstanding individual from a clash between the two best teams in the world, and it wasn’t surprising Martino described him afterwards as ‘one of the best five players in the world’. Exquisite: Di Maria (right) scored Argentina's fourth goal against Germany with a delightful chip . All hugs: Di Maria (right) is embraced by Pablo Zabaleta (left) after scoring against the World Champions . Delighted: Argentina boss Gerardo Martino (right) hailed Di Maria as one of the best five players in the world’ All smiles: Di Maria (right) poses for a picture with Fernando Gago (left) and Ezequiel Lavezzi . It’s clear he could play wide, in the middle or as an orthodox No10 for United. Or a combination of all three. Just set him free and let him get on the ball! Di Maria was injured when Germany beat Argentina in the World Cup final in July – and showed in Dusseldorf how badly the South Americans missed him. Now it’ll soon be time to turn his attention back to United, where former Real team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo, one of Di Maria’s predecessors to wear United’s famous No7 shirt, has already given his blessing. ‘Di Maria is going to be good. I told him being No7 is a big responsibility but he will be able to live up to it’. The hype that was attached to United’s dramatic deadline day capture of Falcao on loan somewhat overshadowed the fact that their most important piece of business was signing Di Maria from Real Madrid. Exepsnive taste: Manchester United's new No 7 Di Maria joined in a £60million move from Real Madrid . Overshadowed: United also signed world class striker Radamel Falcao on loan on transfer deadline day . Van Gaal won’t be able to squeeze in all his big names and Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Falcao and particularly Juan Mata will be sweating, not to mention Adnan Januzaj, Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia lower down the pecking order. Yet Di Maria won’t have to worry. He will be in any strongest United XI. The only question is where? Van Gaal primarily sees him as a winger, complaining that the wide players already at the club weren’t world-class. But Di Maria showed, especially with the opening assist for Aguero, that if he does drift inside, he has the vision to create chances from virtually nothing. Food for thought: Di Maria's ability means United boss Louis van Gaal could use him in several formations . On the ball: Di Maria (centre) made his Manchester United debut in their 0-0 draw at Burnley on Saturday . If van Gaal chooses a 4-3-1-2, Di Maria is capable of playing at No10, supplying the ammunition for two out of Rooney, van Persie and Falcao. That would guarantee he sees as much of the ball as possible. Or he could be part of a midfield three with Ander Herrera and Michael Carrick or Daley Blind, though that would take away some of his attacking dimension. In a 3-5-2, he could bomb on from midfield, and van Gaal might even think he’s got the work-rate to be one of the wing-backs. Supreme talent: Di Maria could be utilised as a wing-back, winger or central midfielder by van Gaal . In a 4-3-3, he could play either right or left to feed Falcao or van Persie. Van Gaal’s philosophy is all about footballing intelligence and the ability to change positions, not only between matches but during matches too. In that respect, Di Maria is his identikit signing. If he can prove it against world champions Germany, imagine how he might tear up the Premier League.","Angel di Maria shone for Argentina against Germany on Wednesday .

"Like many clubs who call themselves 'The Eagles' - including Crystal Palace, Benfica and Lazio - Club America fly a bird of prey around their stadium before games. It's a tradition at the club that features at half-time of every home game played at the Estadio Azteca. However, the Mexican side have now taken the spectacle a step further by attaching a GoPro camera to their resident eagle named Celeste to give a stunning bird's eye view of their stadium before a game against Pumas UNAM (who thankfully did not release their own animal).

"'Worrying': ChildLine is dealing with increasing numbers of calls from teenagers upset after seeing pornographic videos and images online . The number of youngsters ringing ChildLine after encountering videos of hardcore pornography on the internet has soared. Counsellors are dealing with more than 50 calls a month from teenagers upset after seeing adult images. Some are said to be worried about becoming addicted to porn. The number of calls is up 34 per cent over a year, leading to renewed fears about the safety of children online. Last night, ChildLine founder Esther Rantzen said hardcore adult videos were ‘warping’ children’s understanding of what normal sex is, persuading them to copy behaviour which is ‘disturbing, even dangerous’. Girls have called the helpline to report that they are being pressured, coerced or even forced into mimicking adult videos. In an article for the Mail, the former That’s Life presenter warned that the easy availability of internet porn meant that risky sexual behaviour was becoming ‘normalised’. ChildLine said it was being flooded with calls from young girls suffering in sexually abusive relationships. Pornographic videos are freely available on the internet without proof of age. Both ChildLine and the NSPCC are campaigning for more action to educate children and parents on the dangers of internet porn. They have also joined the Mail in calling on the Government to introduce an automatic block on online porn to protect children. Miss Rantzen said she would like to . see a comprehensive ‘opt-in’ system, where over-18s would have to . specifically say they wanted to be able to access adult images following . a rigorous age verification procedure. The . Department for Education is consulting on whether to strengthen . controls. Parents and charities have two more weeks to air their views. Disturbing: Girls have called the helpline to report that they are being pressured, coerced or even forced into mimicking adult videos (picture posed by model) In her article, Miss Rantzen said: ‘At ChildLine we are worried that we are hearing more and more often from children and teenagers who are suffering serious abuse from other young people. ‘We believe from what our callers  tell us that this may be because hardcore adult videos are now just a few clicks away for many teenagers, and this may be warping their understanding of what is normal – so they are mimicking behaviour which is quite unacceptable and frankly disturbing, even dangerous.’ ChildLine was set up by Miss Rantzen in 1986 to tackle the issue of child abuse. It is now part of the NSPCC. 'Warped': ChildLine founder Esther Rantzen (pictured) says many teenagers are copying behaviour which is 'quite unacceptable and frankly disturbing, even dangerous' The helpline said that during the year . 2011/12 it carried out 641 counselling sessions following calls from . children who had been ‘exposed to sexually indecent images such as . pornographic material and videos’. This . works out at more than 50 a month – up 34 per cent on the 478 total the . year before. The number of boys contacting ChildLine about the issue . has increased most notably – up 70 per cent to 268 in 2011/12. The NSPCC is campaigning for more education in schools to help children protect themselves on the internet, and more help for parents so they can keep their children safe. It wants the online industry to make a firm commitment to tackle the scourge of online porn, and says the Government should legislate if the industry drags its heels. Jon Brown, the NSPCC’s lead spokesman on sexual abuse prevention, said: ‘With over 4million pornographic websites on the internet, an increasing number of children are learning about sex and personal relationships through the warped lens of adult porn. ‘Pornography sends out unrealistic messages and expectations and is a poor and damaging sex educator for young people. ‘Though there are filters to block this material, they rely on users having the understanding and ability to activate them. Putting the onus on adults to make a decision to view pornography online, rather having it freely available to everyone, would go a long way to shield children.’ He said it was also vital that parents and teachers get the information and support they need to teach children about caring and respectful relationships. ChildLine collects anonymised information on some of the calls. They reveal how boys are increasingly becoming addicted to online porn, while girls are increasingly worried about the consequences. One teenage boy said: ‘My friend in . school has porn on his phone and he showed it to me. Since then I have . become addicted to it.’ Another . boy said: ‘My brother puts sex videos on my computer and shows me them. I have asked him to stop but he keeps doing it. My family would be . really annoyed if they found out.’ A teenage girl said: ‘My friend has upset me. She called me sick because she came round to my house and I showed her some sex videos on the internet. 'I did not like watching them at first but my dad likes them so I started watching them when he had  them on.’ In her article, Miss Rantzen said tougher action was needed from the web industry and from Government to ensure children were protected. She said: ‘The Government are currently on the cusp of having to take a brave decision on how to protect young people from these videos. ‘And whilst filters and blocks aren’t the only solution, they are a big step in the right direction and an opt-in system can only be a positive thing.’ 'Under pressure': ChildLine has received hundreds of calls from girls feeling coerced into sending sexual images of themselves to boys on their phones . Childline has received hundreds of calls from teenage girls under pressure to send boys sexual images of themselves in a phenomenon known as ‘sexting’. Many say they have already sent pictures and videos but regret it – in many cases because the images have been shared between the boys’ friends or even put up on the internet. The pictures are usually taken on mobile phones and then texted or emailed to boys. ChildLine said it carried out 274 counselling sessions about sexting in the year 2011/12. Many girls who take part in the practice have told ChildLine that they have ended up with depression or mental health problems, because they are humiliated by the sharing of the images. Others regret taking part because they do not think they are ready. The NSPCC warns that girls are being pressurised into copying what happens in videos they see online, and then ‘sext’ the images to boys. They say the influence of internet porn means that boys are increasingly seeing girls merely as sex objects – putting them under pressure to perform for them. Esther Rantzen, founder of ChildLine, said: ‘Young people need to know that “sexting” and being abused are not a normal part of growing up and that they have the right to say no.’ A study by parent advice charity Family Lives earlier this year found that girls as young as 11 are taking part in intimate webcam sessions on social networking sites. And Peter Davies of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre warned that the phenomenon of sexting was now so widespread that children as young as five need to be taught about the dangers in school. ‘The moment a child becomes the subject of the education system, that’s when you should start,’ he told MPs on the education select committee. ‘We used to extend our education packages down to ten, they are now down to about eight. ‘We are realising we may need to pitch them at ages below that because this is not something that kids do when they are at home under the natural surveillance of their family – the phone is in  their pocket and with them all  the time.’","Safety fears raised as number of calls increases 34 per cent over a year .

"Ukraine’s acting leader Oleksander Turchynov issued a warning to Russian separatists yesterday ahead of referendums in two eastern regions demanding to be ruled by Moscow. He said ‘Yes’ votes today in Donetsk and Luhansk would mean the ‘complete destruction of the economy, social programmes and life in general for the majority of people in these regions’.

"For the first time, archaeologists have delved into the lives of ancient Biblical kings - exploring a shrine that pre-dates Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem by three or four decades. It's the first evidence of a Judaic religion in the area at the time of King David - with the inhabitants of the ruins observing a ban on pork and on 'graven images' of animals or humans. Prof. Yosef Garfinkel, the Yigal Yadin Professor of Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University excavated at Khirbet Qeiyafa, a fortified city in Judah adjacent to the Valley of Elah, and found pottery, stone and metal tools, and many art and cult objects. Prof. Yosef Garfinkel, at the Hebrew University excavated at Khirbet Qeiyafa, a fortified city in Judah adjacent to the Valley of Elah, and found pottery, stone and metal tools, and many art and cult objects . Because these shrines pre-date the construction of Solomon’s temple in Jerusalem by 30 to 40 years, they provide the first physical evidence of a Judaic religion in the time of King David. The implications are huge - for archaeologists, biblical experts and the religious. Located approximately 18 miles. southwest of Jerusalem in the valley of Elah, Khirbet Qeiyafa was a border city of the Kingdom of Judah opposite the Philistine city of Gath. The city, which was dated by 10 radiometric measurements (14C) done at Oxford University on burned olive pits, existed for a short period of time between ca. 1020 to 980 BCE, and was violently destroyed. The biblical tradition presents the people of Israel as conducting a cult different from all other nations of the ancient Near East by being monotheistic and an-iconic (banning human or animal figures). However, it is not clear when these practices were formulated, if indeed during the time of the monarchy (10-6th centuries BC), or only later, in the Persian or Hellenistic eras.The absence of cultic images of humans or animals in the three shrines provides evidence that the inhabitants of the place practiced a different cult than that of the Canaanites or the Philistines, observing a ban on graven images. Because these shrines pre-date the construction of Solomon¿s temple in Jerusalem by 30 to 40 years, they provide the first physical evidence of a cult in the time of King David, with significant implications for the fields of archaeology, history, biblical and religion studies . The absence of cultic images of humans or animals in the three shrines provides evidence that the inhabitants of the place practiced a different cult than that of the Canaanites or the Philistines, observing a ban on graven images . Shephelah, Haelah fortress at Khirbet Qeiyafa overlooking Haelah valley, where the relics were found. Tel Azekah is in the background . The findings at Khirbet Qeiyafa also indicate that an elaborate architectural style had developed as early as the time of King David. Such construction is typical of royal activities, thus indicating that state formation, the establishment of an elite, social level and urbanism in the region existed in the days of the early kings of Israel. These finds strengthen the historicity of the biblical tradition and its architectural description of the Palace and Temple of Solomon.According to Prof. Garfinkel, ‘This is the first time that archaeologists uncovered a fortified city in Judah from the time of King David. Even in Jerusalem we do not have a clear fortified city from his period. Thus, various suggestions that completely deny the biblical tradition regarding King David and argue that he was a mythological figure, or just a leader of a small tribe, are now shown to be wrong.’ Garfinkel continued, . ‘Over the years, thousands of animal bones were found, including sheep, goats and cattle, but no pigs. Now we uncovered three cultic rooms, with various cultic paraphernalia, but not even one human or animal figurine was found. This suggests that the population of Khirbet Qeiyafa observed two biblical bans—on pork and on graven images—and thus practiced a different cult than that of the Canaanites or the Philistines.’","Ruins had ban on 'graven images' - so might have been Judaic religion .

"It is a familiar story of an overseas player coming to the Premier League and struggling with idiosyncrasies of English life when they arrive: the weather, the food, the intensity of the football. The only difference is that Eric Dier is English. Being a 20-year-old £4million recruit from Portugal and making an immediate impact on the Premier League isn’t so remarkable these days. Being an Englishman so immersed in Portuguese life, where he grew up and played for Sporting Lisbon, that his mum feared he was losing his native language is more noteworthy. ‘When I moved to the Sporting Lisbon academy and went to a Portuguese school my mum said she was worried because my Portuguese was getting better than my English,’ said Dier, whose family moved to Portugal when he was seven because his mother’s role as director of a catering company meant she had to be there to prepare for Euro 2004. ‘My whole life was in Portuguese. I only spoke to my family in English.’ Scroll down for video... Homecoming king: Eric Dier has returned to England after spending most of his life in Portugal . Now he is back for good, a summer signing for Tottenham and, bizarrely for a defender, he has two goals in two games. Perhaps more importantly, Tottenham have two clean sheets in the Premier League and he has settled in very well under Mauricio Pochettino. But however Anglo Saxon he might look and however well connected he might be in England — his grandfather, Ted Croker, was the former secretary of the Football Association — it is bewildering to be back. Although his parents now live in London, almost all his life has been spent in another country and he is still searching for his bearings. ‘It’s really strange,’ he said. ‘Last time I was living here I was seven and I don’t really remember it. It wasn’t strange being here for a week, but then when I stayed here after that, two weeks, three weeks, then it became strange. But I’m getting used to it.’ Naturally he misses the country that was his home. ‘All my friends are Portuguese and live in Portugal. You have restaurants, places you go. The food...’ he said wistfully. The biggest difference? ‘The weather!’ he said instantly, though he claims he doesn’t mind the rain. Bargain: Eric Dier was signed by Tottenham for £4.5 million from Sporting Lisbon . Hot Spur: The 20-year-old has scored two goals in as many games for his new club . Ironically, when he was first picked up by Sporting scouts from his ex-pat existence — his school was initially an international one and his life on the Algarve was conducted in English — he experienced the culture shock in reverse. ‘From eight years old to 13, I didn’t live in at the academy but I was training at Sporting and in the beginning I was seen as an outsider,’ he said. ‘I didn’t speak the language very well which made it really hard. But once I had learnt the language and they realised I wasn’t going anywhere, I didn’t have any problems. By the time I was 13 I was settled and I was just like one of them.’ It was a privileged start in life as Sporting’s academy is a prestigious alma mater, having produced Luis Figo, Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani. ‘They like to remind you,’ he said. ‘There are pictures everywhere, big, big photographs.’ Giving something back: Eric Dier met students at the Frederick Knight Sports Centre to help young people . Eric Dier made a special visit to Frederick Knight Sports Centre in North London to meet students studying in Tottenham Hotspur Foundation’s Education and Football Development programme, taking part in a Q&A session. Tottenham Hotspur Foundation’s Education and Football Development programme uses football as way to engage young people in education . It also afforded him opportunities most of his contemporaries have not had. Instead of playing in the Premier League’s Under-21 League at training grounds in front of scouts and parents for the past two years, he has featured in Sporting’s first team taking on the likes of Benfica in front of 64,000 in the Lisbon derby. ‘I don’t think anything anywhere matches playing Benfica,’ he said. ‘It’s just different to anything anywhere else. They’re night games, they hate each other, there are flares and banners: everything goes off; the whole country stops. It’s massive. Apart from the big teams, there aren’t many competitive games in Portugal, so when that game comes it’s a big occasion.’ Road to success: A young Eric Dier (L) before he left England and joined Sporting Lisbon's academy (R) Hero worship: A young Eric Dier meets England icon David Beckham while he was in Portugal . Equally, he has been schooled in an entirely different way from many young English players, only being allowed to play small-sided games until he was 12, a move now replicated at most English clubs. ‘We played seven-a-side when I was much younger and you played a 2-3-1 with a goalkeeper. The two defenders — I was one of them — didn’t work as centre-backs, they worked as full-backs. You would go wide and one would attack at a time and be a big part of attacking.’ That presumably accounts for his adaptability at centre-half or right-back and his ability to bring the ball out with more poise than most English defenders. He sees himself as a ball-playing defender — ‘I don’t want to burst my own bubble but I’d like to think so’ — and cites the likes of Gerard Pique and Rio Ferdinand as influences. ‘I think any kid would choose to look at one of them, more than a traditional centre-back. It’s more likeable, isn’t it?’ Lost in translation: Eric Dier has had to re-adapt to life in England after living in Portugal for so long . Portugeezer: The 20-year-old learned his football education while playing for  Sporting Lisbon . Hall of fame: Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Figo (R) both started their careers at Sporting Lisbon . He experienced traditional English coaching when he had a short spell at Everton on loan at 17 and it seems the main difference was the shouting. ‘It was tough,’ he said. ‘In Portugal you are not used to coaches screaming at you. They just sit there and watch. So it toughened me up.’ He laughs at the thought. ‘I was probably still seen as soft to them but it toughened me up! ‘That was hard for me, going to Liverpool because I was there by myself. I was 16, 17. I had left Portugal, which was my home and left my friends and family. So it was a massive culture shock. But it helped me a lot. I always say I went there a boy and went back a man.’ And although he returned to Sporting after Everton, his intention was always to return to his home country if he could. ‘It’s a massive step up. I’m not going to get carried away saying it’s the same, because it’s not,’ he said. ‘It’s a completely different world. I was texting Marcos Rojo at Man United the other day, because we were at Sporting together and he said the same things. It’s a different world in every way. Every game is competitive, in every game the stadium is full, home and away. There are loads of great players: Tottenham have great players, Liverpool, Man United, it’s full of superstars.’ Familiar faces: Eri Dier will come up against Lazar Markovic (L) again when Spurs face Liverpool . He will be facing a few of those stars on Sunday. One he knows well in Lazar Markovic — ‘a really, really good player’ — having played against him when the Serb was at Benfica; another, Mario Balotelli, is less familiar though he is equally unfazed. ‘It doesn’t really bother me to be honest,’ said Dier. ‘They’re great players but I just try to respect any player and try to do my best. I’m not really bothered who it is.’ And given such confidence, you would imagine he will soon feel right at home here.

"New EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker faced shock new claims about his drinking  last night. A . former Tory Foreign Office Minister who has worked with him closely . said he drinks so heavily he ‘dribbles’ during meetings and is often . ‘incapable of working after lunchtime’. And a newspaper in Mr Juncker’s native Luxembourg carried lurid details of a drinking binge he allegedly embarked upon. German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) and . Jean Claude Juncker (right), the new president of the European . Commission raise a glass in celebration . The . prominent British politician, who served as Minister for Europe, told . The Mail on Sunday: ‘All the stories about Juncker’s drinking are true. I . know because I had to work with him. He is a complete drunk. ‘I . regarded it as pointless talking to him after 12 o’clock because at . times he seemed incapable of working, so drunk you couldn’t get any . sense out of him. It is every bit as bad as people say. I have seen him . so p****d that he  was dribbling. Mr Juncker is said to have drunk one Campari, three glasses of wine and three Sambucas in an hour . ‘Everyone . in Brussels knows that Juncker drinks far too much. I would call him an . alcoholic. Talk to European politicians in private and they will all . tell you about his drink problem.’ The . politician, who spoke  to The Mail on Sunday on condition of anonymity, . said Mr Juncker’s drinking was not the only reason he was unfit to be . EC President. ‘He . is totally wrong for the job and isn’t any good. I was talking to a . senior French politician only the other day and he agreed with me that . Juncker is useless.’ Mr Juncker, 59, has been dogged by rumours of a drink problem for years. Summit . tables were said  to have been awash with alcohol during his 20-year . tenure as Prime Minister of Luxembourg. He resigned as a result of a spy . scandal last year. The newspaper Letzebuerg Privat (Luxembourg Private), has referred to him as the country’s ‘drunken stupor premier’. Last . year it ran a front-page report, accompanied by a photo of him guzzling . drinks, in which it was alleged that he quaffed ‘a Campari, three . glasses of wine and three Sambucas in only two hours’.

He is a master of the back stairs,’ it . said. Juncker’s own comments would appear to lend credibility to the claims. In 2011 he said: ‘Monetary policy is a serious issue. ‘We should discuss this in secret, in the Eurogroup. I am for secret, dark debates.’ He . is a multi-millionaire through several bank and political jobs, has a . £2m townhouse in Luxembourg city and a property in the country.

"Lee Cattermole wants fans to stop doubting Gus Poyet after the Sunderland boss felt moved to pen an open letter asking for their support. But on the evidence of Saturday’s sour stalemate with West Brom – an eighth goalless draw of the season – it will take more than the words of terrace favourite Cattermole to convince followers that all is well at the Stadium of Light. ‘There are no doubts, we are all pushing in the same direction,’ insisted the midfielder, who was just about the best English performer in front of the watching Roy Hodgson. Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole applauds the home fans following the goalless draw with West Brom . The midfield general complains about a decision with the assistant referee on Saturday . ‘We can’t be drawn in to any doubt about the manager. There is no-one thinking like that inside the club. ‘If anyone is doubting that then you have to look at the whole picture - we are getting better and the whole club feels more stable. We just need to get the results. ‘It was only a year and a half ago that we had a big carry on at the club. But change doesn’t happen overnight. You have to get players in and out. You have to be patient in football.’ Patience, however, will be wearing thin after Sunderland’s 13th draw of the campaign, a result which leaves them two places above the drop zone. In fairness, supporters did respond to Poyet’s call for backing, but that had little to do with the football being offered on the pitch. Under-fire Black Cats Gus Poyet penned a open letter to the club's supporters last week . A young set of fans show their support to the Uruguayan prior to Saturday's match . Adam Johnson was denied a legitimate goal by a linesman’s flag but it was a match low on quality and entertainment. But Cattermole is adamant they are getting better. ‘Let’s not forget what happened last season,’ he said. ‘All the players, even the senior players, will say they have improved under him. ‘We are definitely more solid now. All the lads are behind the manager we just have to keep pushing.’ He added: ‘The manager has been very honest and has come out and said an awful lot. He wants the fans to know directly from him. ‘I am in and around it every day and I think this club is heading in the right direction.’","Sunderland and West Brom played out a goalless draw on Saturday .

"Jamie Redknapp has stated he finds it impossible how Liverpool can win the Premier League title this term following their third defeat in four top flight games. The Reds crashed to a 3-1 loss at West Ham to follow up defeats by Aston Villa and Manchester City earlier in the season, which leave them six points behind league leaders Chelsea having played a game more. The former Liverpool midfielder voiced concerns over the impact of selling Luis Suarez over the summer and the time it will take for Brendan Rodgers' summer signings  to settle. Jamie Redknapp wrote off Liverpool's title chances on Saturday Night Football where he was a pundit alongside former West Ham United manager Gianfranco Zola . Steven Gerrard, Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli look on after Liverpool lost 3-1 at West Ham United . 'I don't put Liverpool in the equation to win the title,' Redknapp told Sky Sports. 'After selling one of the best players in the world, the best in the Premier League last season, it makes it impossible.' 'Now when you bring players in, it does take a little bit of time for them to bed in and settle. I want to see more from [Lazar] Markovic and [Adam] Lallana who are going to take time.' 'Top four should be the aim this year, the title no chance - not when you don't have Suarez in your team - he made such a difference.' Redknapp also voiced concern over a Liverpool defence which has already conceded eight goals in five games this season, claiming summer signing Dejan Lovren is struggling to match his Southampton form in a team desperately in need of more leadership. Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher both see the summer loss of Luis Suarez to Barcelona as a key reason to why Liverpool will struggle to win the Premier League title . Lovren has struggled to match his Southampton form from last term in the Liverpool defence this season, as he receives treatment from a head wound suffered in the defeat at Upton Park . 'Dejan Lovren was a really good signing, but he's struggling to find his way in the Premier League for Liverpool. The pressure is on and they have to adjust. The team needs more leaders and the top four is where they are.' Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher also criticised the Merseyside's club's defending, stating Rodgers' team have regressed. Carragher tweeted: 'After losing Suarez Lfc were never going to score 100 goals + this season so had to be better defensively, they actually look worse now.'","Jamie Redknapp rules Liverpool out of winning the Premier League title .

"A disturbing video reveals the vicious  training regimes run by a man believed to be a major figure in the seedy world of British dogfighting. Bodybuilder John Psaila, 49, who calls himself 'Pitbull John', used sticks, steroids and metal collars to ruthlessly train pitbull terriers for illegal fight-to-the-death bouts. Footage on his mobile phone shows his dogs, Ziggy, Tip and Cruise, struggling against metal chains as they are forced to run on treadmills as part of the 35-day programme. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Bodybuilder John Psaila, pictured, who called himself 'Pitbull John', used treadmills, steroids and metal collars to ruthlessly train pitbull terriers for illegal fight-to-the-death bouts, in which he bets on their survival . Ruthless: Footage on Psaila's mobile phone shows his dogs, Ziggy, Tip and Cruise, being prepared for fights. Above, two of the pitbulls are forced to run on treadmills, part of the training room found by inspectors . Fanatic: Psaila, who has a tattoo of a pitbull etched across his back, pictured, was caught when RSPCA inspectors raided his home in Abram, near Wigan, Greater Manchester last June after receiving a tip-off . The father-of-two was jailed for 121 days at Wigan Magistrates' Court after he admitted to 14 animal cruelty charges. He has also been banned from keeping animals for life. Psaila, who has a tattoo of a pitbull etched across his back, was caught when RSPCA inspectors raided his home in Abram, near Wigan, Greater Manchester last June after receiving a tip-off. They discovered one scarred dog being forced to run a treadmill - a technique designed to build up stamina and muscle - in what appeared to be a makeshift training school for fighting dogs. Weighing scales were used to ensure dogs were at their 'fighting weight' before a meeting and Psaila had 'breaking sticks' to open a dog's jaw when it had a bite hold on another dog in a fight. There were also home veterinary kits - stocked with steroids, bandages and Psaila's own antibiotics - that he had assembled so as to avoid taking any injured animals to the vet. One of the dogs, Ziggy, had injuries consistent with dog fighting, the court heard. As part of the judge's sentence, two of the dogs are to be destroyed as their training means they could pose a risk to the public. Jailed: The father-of-two, pictured outside court, was jailed for 121 days at Wigan Magistrates' Court after he admitted to 14 animal cruelty charges. Vets found his dog Ziggy, right, had scars consistent with  fighting . Buckets and sponges were also found, pictured, which are used during fights when dogs are placed in corners and washed down to stop 'noxious substances' being put on coats to gain advantage . The court heard the investigation was carried out by the RSPCA's Specials Operation Unit. RSPCA prosecutor Tony Stock said: 'Organised dog fighting is what it says, a highly organised tight knit fraternity in which people hide their identity behind names, keeping in touch by calls. 'Treadmills serve to build up stamina and muscle. Breaking sticks, both had bite marks on them and are used to break open a jaw that has a bite hold on another dog in a fight. Inspectors also found a 'captive bolt', designed for destruction of animals in slaughterhouses. Mr Stock added: 'Ziggy and Tip together with Cruise were kept and trained by the defendant for the purpose of dog fighting. 'Buckets and sponges were also found which are used during fights when dogs are placed in corners and washed down to stop ""noxious substances"" being put on coats to gain advantage'. Training: Treadmills, such as this one that Psaila used to train his dogs, serve to build up stamina and muscle . Psaila had a subscription to a dog fighting magazine that Mr Stocks said was something 'clearly not a normal dog owner would subscribe to'. Above, some of the dog fighting books found in Psaila's home . Psaila, described as being involved in the most serious dog fighting gangs in the country, also had a subscription to a dog fighting magazine. The prosecutor said text messages recovered from Psaila's mobile phone showed he was 'a man banged up in organised dog fighting'. One reply message from him read 'got mouth but no heart', meaning that the dog he was referring to had refused to fight its opponent due to a 'lack of courage'. It also emerged Psaila's Facebook page had a number of pictures of dogs including a mocked up image of three grim reapers crowding round a pitbull terrier as it prepared to fight in a boxing ring. In an interview, Psaila claimed he had been merely keeping the dogs 'in tip-top condition for shows' and claimed Ziggy suffered his when the dogs were fighting among themselves. Mitigating Psaila, Clare Parrott said her client had kept and bred dogs since the Eighties and had claimed he had acted out of 'desperation' after the collapse of his two retail businesses. RSPCA inspectors found home veterinary kits - stocked with steroids, bandages and Psaila's own antibiotics - that he had assembled so as to avoid taking any injured animals to the vet . Chilling: It emerged Psaila's Facebook page had a number of pictures of dogs including this mocked up image of three grim reapers crowding round a Pitt Bull terrier as it prepared to fight in a boxing ring . She added: 'He states that over the years, numerous times he was asked if he wanted to get involved in this activity but numerous times he shunned offers over the years. 'Unfortunately the offer of easy money got the better of him. His daughter said she was ""so surprised"" and said he had doted upon his animals.' 'There is no evidence that this is something he was doing every single day, they are few and far between. 'He says he has been desperate and dipped in and out of it. He knows the dogs will be taken. He wants to start afresh. He has showed genuine remorse.' Psaila was also ordered to pay £600 in costs plus a veterinary bill of £1728. After the hearing, RPSCA Chief Inspector Ian Briggs said: 'This man was actively involved in the most serious dog fighting gangs across the country. 'The level of the organisation and his involvement makes it one of the worst cases. He is actually involved in dog fighting at the most serious and organised level.'","John Psaila used treadmills, steroids and metal collars to train pitbulls .

"Newcastle United’s season is already in danger of unravelling after Siem de Jong was ruled out until Christmas. The Magpies loaned out playmaker Hatem Ben Arfa and versatile defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa on deadline day but failed to bring in any replacements. Ben Arfa’s departure in particular has angered supporters after the crowd favourite - exiled to the reserves following a fallout with manager Alan Pardew - was allowed to join Hull City until the end of the season. Blow: Newcastle United attacking midfielder Siem de Jong has been ruled out for 'a number of months' Fitness: De Jong sustained a thigh injury and the £6million summer signing from Ajax is out until Christmas . Gone: Newcastle allowed playmaker Hatem Ben Arfa moved to Hull City on loan for the rest of the season . Agreement: Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa has also left Tyneside for a season-long loan at Italian giants Roma . But news of De Jong’s injury - a thigh complaint which will seem him sidelined for ‘a number of months’ - is a bitter blow for Pardew in the same week Jack Colback was forced to withdraw from the England squad because of a calf problem. Despite bringing in seven players during the summer, including £6million De Jong from Ajax, former Newcastle and England defender Steve Howey believes United have left themselves exposed in key areas. ‘We all thought the business they did early was very impressive,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘But they have known for a long time now that they need a goalscorer and cover at centre-back. ‘Neither of these issues were addressed and they are a couple of injuries away from having some serious problems. ‘The De Jong injury is a massive blow, especially on the back of Ben Arfa leaving and fans will be quick to jump on that.’ Goals: Newcastle look short of firepower following De Jong's (centre) injury ruled him out for months . Out of favour: Playmaker Ben Arfa had been exiled to the reserves by manager Alan Pardew at Newcastle . Jumping ship: Newcastle defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa (left) has joined Roma on a season-long loan . Ben Arfa’s contract expires at the end of the season and he has played his last game for Newcastle. Howey, though, feels fans must trust Pardew and his backroom team when it comes to the French midfielder. ‘You’ve got to remember that the manager sees his players every day and he’d obviously decided there was nothing else he could do with Ben Arfa,’ he said. ‘It’s a shame because he’s a top, top player and the fans loved him. It’s left them short up front now and I just fear the season could be ruined by not having enough goals in the team.’ Backing: Former Newcastle defender Steve Howey (right) has supported Pardew's treatment of Ben Arfa . Opposition: Ex-Magpies midfielder Rob Lee (pictured)  believes Ben Arfa should not have been sent on loan . Howey’s former team-mate Rob Lee, however, believes Pardew should have taken the same approach with Ben Arfa as Kevin Keegan did with temperamental French winger David Ginola during the mid-90s at St James’ Park. ‘The first thing Kevin did every morning was to tell David how much he loved him,’ said Lee. ‘He put his arm around the Frenchman and whispered nice things in his ear. Kevin’s reward was that David was absolutely brilliant. ‘I don’t care if his attitude wasn’t always great or the fact he was never going to run back 50 yards to put in a tackle. Ben Arfa should have been told he was loved. I bet that’s what Steve Bruce is doing every morning down at Hull.’ Meanwhile, a club statement on De Jong’s injury read: ‘Siem de Jong sustained an injury to his right thigh in training and is to be assessed further at the start of next week. ‘Initial indications are that he is likely to be out for a number of months.’ Comparison: Lee says Pardew should have treated Ben Arfa like Kevin Keegan (left) did David Ginola (right) Dismay: Newcastle supporters unfurled a banner of Ben Arfa during the draw against Crystal Palace .","Siem de Jong ruled out for 'a number of months' with thigh injury .

"A tattoo artist was stunned to discover his picture on the front of a T-shirt being sold worldwide by high street chain H&M, without his knowledge. Richard Elsby, known as Gold Frank, felt angry and cheated when he found out the white tops, bearing his image and the words ‘Black runs through my veins’, were on sale in stores all over the world. The 36-year-old's plight drew comparisons with the recent high-profile Rihanna case, when the singer successfully sued Topshop for using her image on a T-shirt. Richard Elsby aka Gold Frank, a tattoo artist from Leeds, whose image has been used on a t shirt without his permission . Gold Frank, of Leeds, West Yorks., said: 'I spoke to to Rihanna’s lawyers and they said I had a good case for defamation, it could seem satanic because of the quote.' Musician Gold Frank said he had pictures taken in June, 2012, for the website for his new studio in Leeds city centre. They were on the website the next month, and he heard about the T-shirts appearing in H&M in August this year. After doing a bit of searching he found out that the images had gone on sale at the retail chain in May this year. 'I had pictures taken for the studio website and quite a few images ended up being used. Gold Frank had the photo taken for his new website and was shocked to see it on a T-shirt for sale a year later . 'It was a while later that somebody told me they had seen a picture of me on a T-shirt in H&M in Manchester. I got in a car and drove over to Manchester and it was there as soon as I walked in. It was a shock. 'Initially I though it was part of a small capsule collection but then I started getting pictures from friends of them popping up all over Europe and then in the US. 'Now it has sold out worldwide, so it must have been popular. 'I haven’t pursued anything yet legally. I need to find out whether it was sold in the right way,' said Gold Frank. The former clothes shop owner said because he his covered with tattoos he is used to people wanting to take his picture for clothing labels, but has turned them down. Rihanna successfully sued Topshop over the T-shirt bearing the picture of her face (left), and the brand was banned from selling them . But now his face is plastered all over the high street T-shirt. 'I feel peeved and cheated especially as there are other brands I have turned down for this type of thing. 'I’ve never had an apology from anyone about this and I’ve not seen a penny from any of the sales,' said the hip-hop artist. Gold Frank said he would like this incident to make the UK public aware that they don’t own the copyright to their own image, something he finds 'absolutely insane' The photographer was Julian Holtom of JH Media in Mirfield, West Yorks. He said he did take pictures of the tattoo studio for free and did not sign over copyright of his images. Julian said: 'Under UK copyright law I can do as I wish with the images, and I own the copyright. 'I don't want to say anything else.' When contacted by MailOnline for comment  H&M said: 'The image in question is bought from an image agency that has an agreement with Gold Frank.' However Gold Frank says he had no knowledge of thew photos use. Essentially the law says that whoever took the photograph owns the copyright to it and can do with it as they wish. This applies whether it is a friend, a professional photographer or a stranger on the street. The subject of a photograph may occasionally have moral right to limit its distribution if they don't want it published, or picture is embarrassing or sensitive in nature, but not always. The subject with moral rights can limit publication regardless of whether it’s sensitive, but it is not guaranteed. The only way to ensure a photo of you doesn't end up anywhere you don't approve of is to buy the copyright off the photographer... or take every picture yourself.","Richard, known as Gold Frank, had photos taken in 2012 for his website .

"Ayatollah Ali Khamnei authorised his top commander to coordinate with US forces, it was claimed . The mission to crush the Islamic State out of existence leaves the US and the UK facing the unpalatable prospect of having to make common cause with foes in Iran and Syria. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has approved contacts with US military officials to help defeat jihadists, it was claimed last night. Ayatollah Khamenei has authorised his top commander to co-ordinate military operations with the US, Iraqi and Kurdish forces, sources in Tehran told the BBC. Iran - which has called the US 'the Great Satan' - has traditionally opposed US involvement in Iraq, an Iranian ally. Iran's foreign ministry officially denied it planned to cooperate with the US, but Iraq's president Fuad Masum was said to have confirmed the extraordinary development. Shia Iran sees the extremist Sunni Islamic State group as a grave threat. The former chief of the defence staff, General the Lord Richards, said Britain should ask Iran and Syria for assistance - and also persuade Russia to step in, despite the conflict in Ukraine. Asked if the West should consider a deal with the Syrian regime, which it was proposing to attack a year ago, Lord Richards said: 'My judgement is that you do have to come to some accommodation with them. 'Russia, ironically could play a very important role in that and Iran too. 'There are the bones for a grand strategic solution to the Middle East here, if we can get together with people who we viewed as rather hostile. 'This is happening all over the world and needs to be the first stage in a grand strategic plan to once and for all deal with Muslim extremism in places such as Nigeria, Kenya, Somalia, Yemen, Pakistan, and now we hear in Myanmar.' David Cameron dismissed the idea that the Government should co-operate with President Bashar Assad in Syria to tackle the Islamic State - insisting he was 'part of the problem'. The alliance would bring together previously hostile governments in a bid to overthrow extremist Muslims in the Middle East . General Lord Richard Dannatt, former head of the Army, said Britain should ask Iran and Syria for assistance in overcoming ISIS . His suggestion for Britain to appeal to President Assad (right) was dismissed by David Cameron who described the Syrian leader as 'part of the problem' Assad's 'brutal' regime had encouraged the rise of Isis by persecuting parts of Syria's population. The Prime Minister said he still wanted to see a ""transition"" of regime in that country. 'Just as we need in Iraq a democratic pluralistic government to represent all of that country -Sunni and Shia and Kurd - so in Syria we need a transition to a government that can represent all the people in that country and stop brutalising them,' he said. 'My argument is you need that mixture of intelligent politics, diplomatic pressure, long-term engagement in a comprehensive plan as well as the potential for military or other more aggressive action.'","Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 'authorised top commander to coordinate with US'

"A bear terrified a Utah family inside their RV on Saturday as the animal scratched and pawed at their mobile home in an attempt to gain entry. KSL reported that Sami Graham was inside with her two young children when the bear approached the RV, which was parked in Book Cliffs. 'This bear is standing straight up on his hind legs looking at me straight in the eye [through a window],' she told the affiliate station. 'I wasn't expecting to be nose-to-nose with this bear. I just hurried and closed my blinds.' Scroll down for video . Family: Sami Graham was camping with her family on Saturday when the bear approached the trailer and tried to get in . Damage: Scratch marks caused by the eager bear can be seen on the outside of the RV . Graham did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MailOnline. The family tried to shoo the bear away 'by slamming cupboards, jumping up and down and increasing the volume on the TV,' the station reported. The bear continued trying to get inside, KSL reported, and left heavy scratch marks in its wake on the trailer's side and front door that were visible in photographs.

"This was very nearly a victory for organisation and character in the face of stacked odds that would have left Hull on maximum points and seen Stoke’s stutter continue. Instead, Steve Bruce was left livid at an incorrectly awarded throw-in that developed into Ryan Shawcross’s scruffy late equaliser, denying a side who had spent 76 minutes playing with 10 men full reward for their endeavours. Goal-line technology was required to rule that the Stoke defender’s stab from two yards should count, but Bruce railed against an old-fashioned officiating error in the seconds beforehand. As part of his criticism he made a call for replays to be used more widely than just in the act of scoring. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hull fans being attacked with bottles during their Europa League qualifying play-off match vs KSC Lokeren . Goalscorer: Hull City striker Nikica Jelavic scored the opening goal of the game at the KC Stadium after 42 minutes . Sheer delight: Jelavic was in jubilant mood after putting his side one-nil up against Stoke City . Equaliser: Ryan Shawcross levlled the scoring by netting a scrappy equaliser past Hull City's Allan McGregor . Dismissed: Hull City defender James Chester was sent off by Premier League referee Jon Moss after just 14 minutes . Unhappy: Hull City manager Steve Bruce did not look too pleased at losing his centre-back so soon into the game . Hull City (3-5-1-1): McGregor 7; Davies 7.5, Chester 3, McShane 7; Elmohamady 7, Quinn 7.5 (Meyler 76’ 6), Livermore 6.5, Huddlestone 8, Robertson 7.5; Ince 6.5 (Rosenior 56’ 6); Jelavic 7 (Boyd 81’) Subs not used: Harper, Figueroa, Bruce, Aluko.

Subs not used: Sorensen, Muniesa, Walters, Cameron. Booked: Bardsley, Krkic, Diouf . Referee: Jon Moss . Referee Jon Moss failed to spot a hefty deflection off Erik Pieters as Hull cleared their lines seven minutes from time and as Bruce protested, Bojan Krkic acted quickly, curling over a cross that found Phil Bardsley at the far post. He thumped a shot into the turf and on to a post and the ball ricocheted off Allan McGregor to the feet of Shawcross, who got just enough on it to claim Stoke’s first goal and point of the season. There was a delay as Moss’s watch failed to buzz immediately but the correct call was made in the end. It was a cruel way for the rug to be pulled out beneath the feet of players who had stood admirably firm since James Chester was sent off in the 14th minute for bringing down Glenn Whelan as the last man. Bruce switched his team from a 3-5-2 to a 4-4-1 and shortly before half-time Nikica Jelavic’s predatory instincts earned Hull an unlikely goal that nearly saw them follow up their 1-0 win at Queens Park Rangers on the opening weekend with the same score at the KC Stadium. ‘Given the circumstances you would accept a point being down to 10 men after 15 minutes,’ said Bruce. ‘However, we feel an injustice. It wasn’t just a slight deflection. The consequence was we weren’t set up the way we would have been. We all thought it was our throw-in. ‘Let’s give them (officials) a hand. There should be a big monitor next to us where the fourth official can say, “Hang on, you got that wrong”.’ Manager Mark Hughes acknowledged that his team, who failed to make the most of their advantage and fashioned scarce few chances, had got lucky. ‘We needed to show quality and guile and use our intelligence to know what was required,’ he said. ‘We didn’t do that to a great extent in the second half. So credit to Hull.’ Only four days ago, Hull suffered defeat in their Europa League tie at Lokeren because of a defensive error from McGregor. Another mistake at the back proved costly here. A dangerous ball from Paul McShane rushed Jake Livermore into a pass back to Chester but when Whelan got the first touch his foul was always going to result in a red card.

Keen runner: Ahmed Elmohamady covered a lot of ground for Hull during their match against Stoke - click HERE to view the Match Zone statistics from  the KC Stadium . Saviour: Shawcross saved the day by scoring with seven minutes to go against Hull City . Jon Moss got his first big decision right with the 14th-minute dismissal of Hull’s James Chester. Replays confirmed Chester had stopped a goalscoring opportunity with no defender covering. Stoke equalised when technology confirmed the ball had crossed the line, although it was strange Moss took so long to give a goal. Hull were rightly aggrieved about the throw-in awarded to Stoke in the build-up. Stoke took charge of possession yet for all the neat interchanges around the fringes of the box, they failed to create much of significance. Mame Biram Diouf looked awkward. Bojan was sent on in the 41st minute to affect things but his first involvement saw Hull open the scoring. Tom Huddlestone, excellent throughout, brushed aside the former Barcelona prodigy and struck a pinpoint left-footed shot from the edge of the area that would have gone in without Asmir Begovic’s intervention. But the Stoke goalkeeper could only parry to Jelavic, who took advantage of some slack marking by Marc Wilson to slide the ball home. Hull were pretty comfortable after that, even when Peter Crouch arrived to provide variety. His shot after a breakaway bounced off McShane to Diouf in the area but the striker sent his header harmlessly wide. It was left for Shawcross to show how it should be done and Bruce revealed that Hull are close to bringing in a defender of their own. A deal is agreed ‘in principle’ with Tottenham for Michael Dawson, he said, but added that a potential £12million move for Jordan Rhodes ‘seems further away than ever’.","Ryan Shawcross cancels out Nikica Jelavic's first half opener .

"Couldn't stay away: Michael Bloomberg will return to lead the company he founded in 1981 . Michael Bloomberg . will return as head of Bloomberg LP after the outgoing president became frustrated with the former mayor's increasing presence at the office, according to a report. Bloomberg will replace Daniel Doctoroff, the company said Wednesday, despite the widely held expectation that he intended to dedicate his life to philanthropy after leaving office just months ago. The life of leisure, it seems, is not for Bloomberg. The New York Times reports that Bloomberg has become an 'increasing presence' at the office, leaving Doctoroff 'frustrated with how the leadership dynamic had shifted.' The privately held company, in which Bloomberg is the . majority shareholder, said Doctoroff would step aside as . president and chief executive at year-end. Bloomberg, whose fortune is estimated at more than $32 . billion, had expected to spend much of his time on philanthropic . efforts after leaving office in late 2013. Those efforts have . included fights for public health and gun control. 'This is a sad day for me and my company,' Bloomberg said in . a statement. 'I really wanted Dan to stay and continue in his . leadership role. But I understand his decision.' Bloomberg, who stepped down as New York mayor last December, . added he 'never intended to come back to Bloomberg LP' after 12 . years as New York's mayor. However, the Times reports that the initial 'few hours a day' he said he'd spend at Bloomberg's Manhattan offices soon turned into six and seven hours everyday in which he'd play an increasing role in decision making. Doctoroff told Bloomberg his intention to step down two weeks ago and refused his billionaire boss's invitation to stay. Still pals: Though Bloomberg's right-hand man Daniel Doctoroff is stepping down over frustrations with the power shift since the former mayor left office, the two remain friends. Here, they participate in the ice bucket challenge . Moving on: Doctoroff stressed he was not leaving for anotheropportunity, but would focus more of his time on non-profitactivities. He also accepted Bloomberg's invitation to join theboard of the Bloomberg Philanthropies . 'So why have I decided to leave now?,' Doctoroff said in thememo. 'Simply put, while Mike never intended to come back fulltime, after he left City Hall and started to get to know thecompany again, he rediscovered what an exciting and incredibleplace this is. So he naturally wanted to be more involved.' Doctoroff became Bloomberg LP president in 2008 and CEO in . July 2011. During that period, the company's revenues increased . from $5.4 billion to more than $9 billion, he said in a memo to . the company's employees. Doctoroff, 56, a former New York deputy mayor, told the New . York Times that he informed Bloomberg two weeks ago that he . intended to resign. Bloomberg encouraged him to stay. 'This wasn't the plan,' Bloomberg told the Times. 'It was . his idea. If it was up to me, he would have stayed.' Bloomberg started the company in 1981, using a $10 million . severance package he received after he was laid off after . investment bank Salomon Brothers had been acquired. He had . headed equity trading at Salomon. During Doctoroff's tenure at the company, the numbers of . subscriptions for its terminals have grown from 273,000 to . 321,000, the company said in a statement. The company expanded . from providing financial information to markets for legal, . government and alternative energy information. Doctoroff stressed he was not leaving for another . opportunity, but would focus more of his time on non-profit . activities.

"A mother-of-five has spoken out for the first time about the terrifying moment where she and her children were shot at by police in their mini-van during a routine traffic stop. Oriana Farrell was driving a vehicle carrying her five children, aged six to 16, when an officer fired three shots at them during in Taos, New Mexico in October last year. She told GMA on Wednesday: 'I started thinking about children who have been shot, families who have been shot. I started thinking about Trayvon Martin.' Scroll down for videos . Oriana Farrell, pictured with her five children, said there was no excuse for police to open fire on her and her kids in their minivan when a routine traffic stop went awry last year in New Mexico . New Mexico officer Elias Montoya was caught on police dashcam shooting at the tires of the minivan which contained a mother and her five children in 2013 . The highway shootout happened after Farrell, 39, earlier had been stopped by a separate state police officer for speeding. She said today that she was unclear that the cop was going to give her a ticket when he walked away from her car window and so she drove off. The cop then chased her down in his patrol vehicle and when she stopped for the second time, she refused to get out of the van. When she finally agreed, she jumped back inside as an officer attempted to restrain her. With her younger children screaming and her eldest son Zeke leaving the car to defend his mother, the officer called for back-up cars. As Farrell pulled away in terror, dramatic dash-cam video revealed the moment that Officer Elias Montoya, 53, fired three shots at the vehicle. Farrell told ABC: 'Even if I was speeding, that doesn’t require being shot at any point.' Oriana Farrell (pictured) was dragged from her car and the officer attempted to arrest her after she drove off from a routine traffic stop for speeding . Farrell and her teenage son were arrested after police brought them to a stop. She faced charges of child abuse, fleeing and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia for marijuana pipes allegedly found in the van. The charges against the mother-of-five have been since dropped by an appellate court but the District Attorney still has the opportunity to bring charges against her. The veteran police officer who was sacked last year after firing shots at the minivan said his 'heart sank' when he realized there were children inside. Montoya, a father-of-three, said that tinted windows in the van kept him from seeing the children inside. 'My heart sank when they finally stopped and I was at the passenger side at that time seeing them get out at gunpoint again,' he said. 'I couldn't believe it that there were that many children in there.' Montoya, who is appealing his department's decision to fire him, insisted that it was the first time he had fired his gun on duty during his 12 years on the force.","Oriana Farrell was driving a vehicle carrying her five children, aged six to 16, when a cop opened fire on them last year in New Mexico .

"Heading for the Commons? Benefits Street star White Dee will debate the welfare system at this year's Conservative Party conference . White Dee has been invited to speak at this year's Conservative Party Conference. The Benefits Street star will give her views on the welfare system in a debate with the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP). It comes after Dee, or Deirdre Kelly, revealed she is toying with the idea of becoming an MP - but at £70,000-a-year, it doesn't pay enough. The final annual conference ahead of the general election will take place in Birmingham from September 28 to October 1. Last year saw Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith debate with former editor of ConservativeHome Tim Montgomerie. But this year, the Policy Exchange has decided to invite 47-year-old Ms Kelly in a debate chaired by Newsnight's Allegra Stratton. Dee insists she has been waiting for an opportunity to lend her own voice to the serious arena of policy-making. And she hopes to take David Cameron out for a drink afterwards. Her agent Barry Tomes told MailOnline: 'Dee is very excited. She has lots of ideas about how to improve benefits. 'She agrees that the benefits system is totally abused in the UK. 'She wants to address how it is so easy to get on them but so hard to get off them. 'In classic Dee style, she said she won't think about what she wants to say until the actual debate. 'She shoots from the hip, Dee, and that's what everyone likes about her. Scroll down for video . 'This will be a great way for her to get her ideas out - and hopefully she will get to go for a drink with David Cameron.' It is a dramatic career turn for Ms Kelly, who shot to fame on the Channel 4 documentary in January. Since, she has done a string of media appearances across the UK and in Magaluf, hosting bar crawls and pool parties. Crucial moment: The conference in Birmingham will be the last one before the general election, featuring talks from Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and David Cameron, who Dee hopes to meet for a drink . She has even filmed her own cooking programme, which is due to screen later this year. But according to her representatives, she has been approached by all three major parties to run for a seat in Birmingham. 'She is tempted by the idea, but there just isn't enough money in it,' Mr Tomes added. 'Nick Clegg has invited her to go on his show and all the parties have approached her to represent them. Career: Dee has been approached by all parties to run for parliament but it doesn't pay enough, her agent says . 'She is a Lib Dem at heart but if she ran she would probably go independent.' 'But she could do so well out of her media appearances, I think she should leave it for at least 10 years.' A Policy Exchange spokesman said: 'We're very glad she's doing it. It is always good to have a balance of people on the panel.'","Benefits Street star invited by Policy Exchange to speak at annual event .

"Losing your phone or keys is one thing, but losing your glasses - especially if you need them to be able to see what you’re looking for in the first place - can be stressful. To solve this problem, an Israeli design team has created a clip that attaches to the arm of any pair of glasses or sunglasses, and will beep when they are lost. It syncs with a smartphone via Bluetooth, or if wearers don’t have a smart device, they can choose to pair it with a keychain remote. Scroll down for video . The 1.5-inch (40mm) long clip was designed by Israel-based Dafna Ariely. It attaches to any standard arm on glasses (pictured) or sunglasses, and the clip connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone app or keychain . The clip is the brainchild of Israel-based Dafna Ariely, who has set up an Indiegogo campaign to raise $50,000 (£30,600) to fund production of the device. The clip weighs less than 20g, has a range of 50ft (15 metres). Look is small enough to clip onto the inside of the arm, without touching the wearer's face, and is just 0.4-inches (10mm) wide, 1.5-inches (40mm) long and 0.2-inches (6mm) thick. The clip attaches to glasses using adhesive. This means it can be removed easily, or placed on any other item that needs to be tracked. It is powered by two lightweight 399 batteries, and comes in black, red, silver and white, and brown. If the project is funded, the clip will cost $28 (£17) and the free app will be available on Android and iOS. It weighs less than 20g, has a range of 50ft (15 metres), and Ms Ariely claims, wearers will not feel any difference in the weight of their glasses when the clip is attached. 'The idea for Look came about when I couldn’t find my own reading glasses', said Ms Ariely. 'After all the time I spent and the long, frustrating experience of searching, I thought that if I had something to help me find my glasses, I could have avoided all the pressure and loss of time I experienced.

"Thomas Beatie, the transgender male who received international attention back in 2007 when he became pregnant through artificial insemination, has been arrested. Beatie is said to have been stalking an ex, going so far as to place a GPS device on her car. What's more, Beatie admits to putting the GPS device on the car, saying he even changed the batteries several times. Scroll down for video . Legal trouble: Thomas Beatie (above), the transgender male who received international attention back in 2007 when he became pregnant through artificial insemination, has been arrested for stalking . Reproductive: Beatie kept his reproductive organs when he had sex-reassignment surgery to become a male . Victim?: It seems that Thomas was likely stalking ex-wife Nancy (above), who he is in the process of divorcing . TMZ reports that Beatie was picked up Thursday morning in Phoenix, Arizona and is  currently being held in Maricopa County Jail without bail on one charge of stalking an ex. The ex is most likely his former wife, Nancy Beatie, who he filed for divorce from in 2012. Earlier this year Thomas had accused Nancy of verbally assaulting him and his new girlfriend, Amber Nicholas. Thomas and Nancy were married in Hawaii in 2003, and have three children, all of whom Thomas gave birth to. A judge just granted the two the right to get divorced in August of this year, a divorce that had previously been denied as it was not viewed as legal by some courts. GPS: Beatie is said to have been stalking an ex, going so far as to place a GPS device on her car, he said he even changed the  batteries several times . New lady: Beatie is now dating Amber Nicholas (above) Maricopa County Family Court Judge Douglas Gerlach had ruled that Arizona's ban on same-sex marriages prevented Mr Beatie's marriage from being recognized as valid. Gerlach said he had no jurisdiction to approve a divorce because there's insufficient evidence that Beatie was a man when he got married. The judge said the Beaties never provided records to fully explain what Mr Beatie actually had done and not done to become a man. The ruling also noted that Mr Beatie had halted the testosterone treatments. That all changed when Judge Kenton D. Jones said in a 12-page opinion, 'As the Beaties' Hawaii marriage was lawfully entered in Hawaii and is not deemed void by Arizona law, the marriage is valid within this state.' Had their appeal not gone through, the couple would have been forced to go to Hawaii to get a divorce.","Thomas Beatie, the transgender man who gained international fame when he became pregnant in 2007, was arrested for stalking .

"An elderly woman claims half her rectum was removed after a hospital mix up meant doctors misdiagnosed her with an aggressive form of cancer. The 68-year-old woman from Orlando in Florida, U.S, filed a lawsuit against the hospital on Tuesday demanding answers over the alleged mistake. She was led to believe she was dying of cancer for months after doctors told her she was suffering rectal cancer. They made the diagnosis after taking tissue samples from the woman during a colonoscopy - a procedure where a camera is used to investigate the bowel. But the 68-year-old, who asked not to be named, claims she was misdiagnosed, after her test results were mixed up with those of a man who had cancer. A 68-year-old woman from Orlando is suing the Florida Hospital after claiming staff removed half of her rectum after misdiagnosisng her with cancer . The diagnosis came as a shock because she had been in good health before, exercising regularly and taking no medication, she said. ‘I literally had my daughter drive down for Minnesota for Christmas because we all thought this was probably the last Christmas we would have together.’ she told the Orlando Sentinel. She said she felt there was a problem with the diagnosis, so she asked the hospital to double-check the labwork after further tests and biopsies to pinpoint the cancer’s location kept coming back negative. But doctors chose to go through with the operation, so in January she underwent surgery at Florida Hospital to have part of her rectum removed. After the operation, she was overjoyed to hear that lab work on the tissue the surgeon removed found it to be cancer-free. Her doctor called in May, and told her that DNA testing confirmed there had never been any cancer, she said. ‘I was euphoric. I felt like a big, heavy shroud had been taken away from me,’ she said. She said during a meeting with hospital managers they apologised to her. ‘They were all very sorry. They said it over and over and over,’ she said. The woman, who asked not to be named, claims the hospital diagnosed her with rectal cancer after mixing up her test results with those of a man suffering the disease. File picture . But the hospital did not provide detailed records documenting the mix up and the steps it took to determine she was cancer- free. As part of the lawsuit she has asked that a judge order the hospital to release all of the woman's medical records documenting the error. It also asks the judge to appoint a special master to handle the records. If the hospital is found to have violated federal and state laws, she will be able to sue for medical negligence. Florida Hospital spokesperson Samantha Kearns Olenick said she would not comment on the pending litigation.","68-year-old woman has filed a lawsuit against Florida Hospital, Orlando .

Stefan Maierhofer, the 6ft 7in Austrian striker who helped Millwall stay up last season, is looking for a return to London and Fulham are interested. Coach Felix Magath knows Maierhofer well from various spells in Germany and Austria and believes he could add a different dimension to Fulham's attack. The 32-year-old is a free agent and had also attracted interest from Crystal Palace. He had hoped to return to Millwall this season but failed to agree terms with the club. Liverpool are not pursuing interest in Barcelona's Alex Song. Reports have again linked the former Arsenal midfielder with a move to Anfield but manager Brendan Rodgers is happy to let the opportunity pass with Marseille keen to conclude a deal. Rodgers believes he is almost done spending. The one option that may return is that of a goalkeeper. Liverpool have not followed up interest in Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Ramos of Sampdoria but have considered others in Europe as they look to increase competition for Simon Mignolet. No interest: Liverpool are not pursuing Barcelona's Alex Song, who looks set for Marseille . Leeds United are in discussions to sign Paraguay striker Brian Montenegro. The 21-year-old may strike a chord with West Ham fans as he was with them on loan in 2011-12. Remember? No? He joined West Ham on August 29, 2011 where he signed a season-long loan contract saying: 'I am very excited to come here and play in England, especially for a club like West Ham. I am hoping to get a chance to show the fans what I can do.' Montenegro's debut game came on January 8 2012 in a 1–0 FA Cup third round away defeat by Sheffield Wednesday and that was that. At the end of the season, a new contract was not agreed and he returned to Paraguay. He has since played for another four clubs but that hasn't dissuaded Massimo Cellino, who is ready to give Montenegro another chance. Newcastle central defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa has agreed to join Marseille on loan after finding a salary agreement with the Ligue 1 side. Marseille have offered a loan with an option to buy and it is up to Newcastle to decide now. They have Mike Williamson suspended while Roma have an interest in Davide Santon. Newcastle have still to finish buying themselves with QPR's Loic Remy and Alexandre Lacazette of Lyon still in their sights.

"Nine out of ten medical entries on Wikipedia have factual inaccuracies, according to researchers . When you’re feeling under the weather, it’s only natural to want to find out what is wrong with you...fast. But turning to the internet to determine the cause of your symptoms can be a bad idea, according to a study by doctors. It found that nine in ten Wikipedia entries on common medical conditions contained factual errors. This is because, unlike a traditional encyclopedia, the hugely popular website lets ordinary users create, delete and edit entries – increasing the risk of mistakes. Lead author Robert Hasty of Campbell University in the US warned: ‘Researchers should not use [Wikipedia] as a primary resource because those articles do not go through the same peer-review process as medical journals. 'The best resource when looking for a diagnosis is to speak with your physician, who can take into account your medical history and other factors to determine the best course  of treatment.’ Since its launch in 2001, Wikipedia has become the most popular general reference site on the internet. It contains more than 31million entries in 285 languages. At least 20,000 are health-related. The team, who looked at information on conditions such as diabetes, lung cancer and back pain, said: ‘Wikipedia’s prominence has been made possible by its fundamental design as a collaborative database. ‘However, it is this very feature that has raised concern in the medical community regarding the reliability of the information it contains.’ Errors on Wikipedia included an entry which stated that to correctly diagnose high blood pressure, high readings must be obtained on three separate occasions. The researchers said that is not true and could lead to a dangerous delay in treatment. Another entry said antidepressants were not beneficial for children. Even medical staff are prone to checking a diagnosis or symptoms on Wikipedia, according to Dr Robert Hasty from Campbell University, US . But according to the researchers, this is incorrect and could prevent parents from allowing their children to be treated with medication. Drug companies have also been accused of editing Wikipedia to  remove references to harmful side effects. In 2009, employees at AstraZeneca allegedly deleted a sentence claiming that a treatment for manic depression made teenagers ‘more likely to think about harming or killing themselves.’ Worryingly, the researchers said that even medical staff turn to the site from time to time. Previous studies have shown up to 70 per cent of doctors and students of medicine admit using it as a reference. The researchers wrote: ‘Physicians and medical students who currently use Wikipedia as a medical reference should be discouraged from doing so because of the potential for errors.’ Dr Hasty said while many of the mistakes were relatively minor, some ‘could have clinical implications’. He urged fellow doctors to get involved in editing Wikipedia entries to improve their accuracy. The study, published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, backs up surveys showing as many as a quarter of women have misdiagnosed themselves on Google. A survey of 1,000 women in 2012 found they often wrongly diagnosed themselves as having breast cancer, thrush, diabetes, high blood pressure and asthma.","Problem caused by allowing ordinary users to create, delete and edit pages .

"A 26-year-old man snatched an eight-year-old girl in the middle of the night as he stayed at her family's home - before murdering her and leaving her body in a shallow grave, police have said. Justin James Rector was arrested on kidnapping and first-degree murder charges on Thursday morning after the body of Bella Grogan-Cannella was found in Bullhead City, Arizona on Wednesday. At a press conference on Thursday, Police Chief Brian Williamson would not reveal how Bella died or if she had been sexually assaulted. He said they are still trying to determine a motive for the murder. Rector, a family friend, had been staying with Bella's family for a few days before her death, he said. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Bella Grogan-Cannella, left, was reported missing on Tuesday morning after her family could not find her anywhere in her Arizona home. Justin James Rector, right, has now been arrested in her killing . Killed: Bella's body was found in a shallow grave near her family's home on Wednesday, police said . Her 10-year-old sister told authorities that she saw Bella with Rector when she went to the bathroom around 11.30pm on Monday, and when she returned to her room, her younger sister and the older man were gone, Williamson said. Bella's family reported her missing around 1.30am on Tuesday. Later that morning, Rector allegedly shoplifted clothing from Walmart and attempted to hide the clothes he'd been wearing at the time of the alleged murder, Williamson said. Cops arrested him for shoplifting that day and questioned him in relation to Bella's disappearance. Bizarre: The evening after she was reported missing, Rector posted this message to Facebook . Suspect: Rector, who is also from Bullhead City, is friends with some of Bella's family members . When her body was found on Wednesday, authorities also discovered 'unique' shoe prints that matched the shoes Rector had been wearing, Williamson said at the press conference. He was charged with kidnapping and murdering her on Thursday. Williamson said he has not ruled out the possibility of further charges or future arrests. 'My heart goes out to Bella, her family and this entire community,' Williamson said. 'We have completed the mission of bringing someone to justice for Bella's death.' Just hours after Bella was reported missing on Tuesday, Rector wrote a bizarre Facebook rant saying he was not a suspect. 'Everyone gonna believe what they chose but as of now shes still not home and talking s*** n making threats doesnt seem like a good strategy on getting her home to me,' he wrote at 8pm Tuesday. 'Everyones a suspect but ive been interrogated and cleared no charges and im still in touch with the authorities.' Facebook profiles reveal that he was friends with Bella's mother, Tania, and other relatives. Heartbroken: Bella's mother Tania was seen screaming at the scene where the body was found . Grieving: Bella poses for pictures with her mother, Tania, who had reported her missing on Tuesday . Found: A map shows where Bella was last seen and where the body was found, half a mile away . On Thursday, KNXV-TV reported that investigators served a search warrant at the family's home and could be heard telling people in the residence to come out with their arms up. Bella lived at the home with her mother, stepfather and other children who are not Isabella's siblings, said police Lieutenant Jerry Duke. Isabella's biological father is not in the area. Dozens of police, firefighters and volunteers have fanned out in Bullhead City neighborhoods, nearby parks and river areas to look for Isabella using ATVs and search dogs. On Wednesday night, Bella's mother, Tania, was seen sobbing and screaming 'No!' as relatives comforted her at the wash where the girl's body was found, ABC13 reported. Crosses and candles were placed at the scene where the body was found on Wednesday as relatives held each other and wiped away tears. 'Everybody has come together,' her grandmother Sue said through tears. 'It's been wonderful, so we appreciate everything.' Bullhead City, a city of about 40,000 people along the Colorado River some 100 miles southeast of Las Vegas.

"Mario Balotelli was typically good value during Liverpool's training session on Friday - and Sportsmail can reveal that the Italy striker is the Premier League's best value-for-money summer signing. The 24-year-old, who looks to make his  debut against Tottenham on Sunday, was bought by Liverpool for £16million and boffins reckon Brendan Rodgers got him on the cheap. Analysts at Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory have placed ‘market values’ on top players from around Europe and they calculate that Balotelli was worth £30m, £14m more than Liverpool paid for him.

Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp went further, saying Liverpool had a £45m player for £16m. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers called the deal ‘outstanding value’, despite admitting that it was a risk signing the 24-year-old striker. However, he took a punt due to Balotelli's age and match-winning ability. The striker looked to be getting along with his new team-mates, being hugged by new team-mate Lucas Leiva during the training session and was pictured on the ground having a laugh with more of his new team-mates.

"Falcao signs for Manchester United in £12m season-long loan . Follow all the movers and shakers here . Follow the latest on Falcao's move here . Cristiano Ronaldo has hailed Radamel Falcao's loan switch to Manchester United as a 'fantastic buy' for Louis van Gaal.

The 28-year-old Colombia star will earn around £200,000-a-week after touching down at Manchester Airport in a private jet to complete the deal on transfer deadline day. Ronaldo, speaking at a TAG Heuer event in Madrid, said: 'He is very good player. I think Manchester did very well. I don’t think he is the wrong type of player.

"Targeting the 'hunger' nerve may help obese people lose weight, according to scientists. Researchers from the University of Minneapolis have created a new device which uses electrodes to block the vagus nerve from communicating the feelings of hunger to the brain. Their aim was to develop a new treatment for obesity, as effective as bariatric surgery, but less invasive and without the  risks. Researchers found that blocking the vagus nerve- which communicates feelings of hunger- did lead to weight loss in a study of obese people, but wasn't as effective as hoped . The vagus nerve runs the length of a person's torso, from the brain to the abdomen and tells the body when it is full. But in obese people, studies have shown that the vagus nerve becomes desensitised, causing them to overeat. The U.S. researchers took 239 severely obese participants whose body mass index’s (BMI) were between 35 and 45, and who had one or more obesity-related condition. They implanted the device, blocking the vagus nerve in 162 of the participants. The other 77 participants had a ‘sham’ device implanted, which was inactive and did not block the vagus nerve. They were used as the control group. Both groups underwent a course on weight management. The vagus nerve runs from the brain to the abdomen and  regulates hunger by telling the body when it is full . The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that the device blocking the vagus nerve was mildly effective in reducing weight over the short term. After 12 months, those with the device fitted lost an average of 24 per cent of their excess weight, while those in the control group without the device fitted lost only 16 per cent. Looking specifically at the group with the device fitted, researchers found 52 per cent of these participants lost a fifth of their excess weight, while 38 per cent lost at least a quarter of their excess weight. Therefore though there was certainly weight loss, the procedure fell short of being as effective as the researchers had hoped. The study concluded: ‘Additional studies are needed to compare effectiveness of vagal nerve block with other obesity treatments and to assess long­ term durability of weight loss and safety.'","University of Minneapolis researchers developed a device which used electrodes to block the vagus nerve from communicating feelings of hunger .

"A Michigan man was on his way to pick up his two young children from school when he was shot dead in what police believe was a road-rage attack. Derek Flemming, 43, and his wife Amy Flemming had just had lunch together and were driving along Grand River Ave in Genoa Township to pick up their children after the first day back at school Tuesday when they encountered Martin Edward Zale, 69, in his 2012 Dodge pickup. Minutes later, Derek Flemming was shot in the head by Zale, police say. Victim: Derek Flemming, 43, was on his way to pick up his kids from school when he was shot in what police believe was a road rage incident . School run: Flemming was on his way to pick up his two kids, aged five and seven, from school with his wife when the attack happened . A representative for the Flemming family, attorney William Moore, says Zale was 'screaming down a side street' so fast that Amy Flemming believed he was going to hit their 2014 Ford Escape. He told the the Detroit Free Press that Zale then tailgated the couple, then as they tried to pull to the right to let him pass, he passed them in the right lane, forcing them to jerk back into the left. Amy Flemming told Moore that Zale then pulled in front of the couple and slammed on his brakes. When both cars pulled up at a set of traffic lights on Grand River at Chilson, Derek Flemming got out of his vehicle and approached Zale's window. 'What's your problem?' multiple witnesses report Flemming asked Zale. A loud argument ensued, witnesses told WXYZ, but it doesn't appear there was any physical contact between the men. Zale then wound down his window and shot Flemming once in the head. 'His wife was forced to witness this act from the front seat of her car,' Moore said in a statement on behalf of the family. Broad daylight: Flemming was allegedly shot by Martin Zale, 69, at 3:35pm in full view of many witnesses . 'Shock and extreme grief': Amy Flemming witnessed her husband's shooting as the couple went to pick up their children from the first day back at school . 'This man shot an unarmed man in broad daylight with multiple witnesses, including Ms. Flemming. He needs to be removed from our community and locked behind bars.' Witness Jenna St Clair told WXYZ that Amy Flemming was on the ground next to her stricken husband, begging him to live. 'She said, ""You've got to stay! You've got to stay alive. Stay alive for your kids. We need you, we need you!""' said St. Clair. Alleged killer Zale reportedly stood calmly by his car waiting for police to arrive after the shooting. Calls to 911 came thick and fast from people who had witnessed the altercation, which happened around 3:35pm. One 911 caller said she 'heard a large pop and somebody screaming.' 'Mrs. Flemming is overcome with many emotions, but primarily shock and extreme grief. In addition, her young children are asking where their father is,' the statement from Moore says. WXYZ reports that neither man had any criminal record. Flemming owned his own small landscaping business. It's unclear if Zale had a permit to carry a concealed weapon.","Derek Flemming, 43, was allegedly shot dead by Martin Zale, 69, Tuesday .

"Dramatic new footage shows the moment a small plane crashed in Hawaiian waters and resulted in the death of state health official Loretta Fuddy - the woman responsible for releasing President Barack Obama's longform birth certificate.

The other eight people on board, including the pilot, were rescued or swam to shore. She gained notoriety in 2011 for making President's Barack Obama's birth certificate public, attempting to squash rumors that he wasn't born in the country. Only victim: Hawaii Health Director Loretta Fuddy was the only death among nine aboard the Cessna Grand Caravan that crashed in the ocean near Molokai, Hawaii last month . Fuddy was on the flight from Molokai to Oahu after visiting a state-run leper colony on the smaller Hawaiian island. The incident occurred when the single engine of the 2002 Cessna Grand Caravan failed soon after it took off from Molokai and made its turn toward Honolulu, said Richard Schuman, owner of Makani Kai Air, operator of the plane. Fuddy made it out of the sinking plane fine, but died after escaping. In the water, Fuddy held hands with her deputy director Keith Yamamoto as he tried to help her relax, said the Rev. Patrick Killilea, who consoled Yamamoto after the ordeal. 'He recounted how he said he helped . Loretta into her life jacket and he held her hand for some time,' the . priest said. 'They were all floating together and she let go and there . was no response from her.' Coast . Guard rescuers who arrived after making the half-hour flight from Oahu . to the neighbor island said Thursday that the single-engine turboprop . aircraft wasn't visible when they got there, only the nine passengers . floating across about a half-mile of water littered with random debris . The rescuers in two helicopters and an HC-130 airplane said the people were in clusters and acted calm when help arrived.

We hit (the water) and it was all about getting the . belts off,' he said, describing how everyone started putting on life . jackets and remained on the plane until it seemed to start sinking.

"The pioneering women and men behind the invention of the pill risked being arrested, a new book reveals. The Birth of the Pill, which will be released on Monday, delves into the lives of the four 'crusaders' who brought the pill to fruition - feminist Margaret Sanger, scientist Gregory Pincus, OB-GYN John Rock and philanthropist Katharine McCormick, who funded most of the research. It explains how in the Pill's initial stages in the 1950s, before its approval, Pincus and Rock tested it on 50 unknowing patients in Massachusetts under the guise of a fertility study, so as not to interfere with the state's anti-birth control laws. Scroll down for video . History of birth control: The Birth of the Pill by Jonathan Eig, which will be released on Monday, delves into the lives of the four 'crusaders' who brought the Pill to fruition . The trial was successful - not one of the 50 women ovulated during the experiment - and the Pill went on to be one of the most important discoveries of the 20th century. But the ethically ambiguous way they made this discovery is undeniably a topic of interest. 'You can really have a wonderful ethical discussion and debate about whether it was worth it, whether they were doing things that were beyond the bounds,' author Jonathan Eig told NPR. 'The laws and the ethics of science were very different in the 1950s than they are today - you didn't have to give informed consent, you didn't have to have anybody sign forms giving away their rights, telling them about what these experiments are for. 'So in a way, we do have women being treated like lab animals so that we may find a form of birth control that frees them. There's a great irony there.' The 'pioneers' were also not afraid to cut corners when it came to having the Pill approved and then marketed to women, coming up with a genius way of masking its true purpose. 'They decide, ""We're not going to ask the FDA to approve it as birth control because that will raise a whole bunch of other issues. ... Let's just ask them to approve it for menstrual disorders,""' explains Mr Eig. So, in 1957, the Pill was sold as Enovid - an FDA-approved treatment of menstrual disorders, with a label on the packaging that read: 'Warning: This pill will likely prevent pregnancy'. 'And it's the greatest advertisement they could ever have,' says Mr Eig, 'because this is what women want.' The book chronicles the history of the birth control pill, from the idea's inception and its controversial inventors to the moment it hit shelves and ignited a sexual revolution. It explains how the group banded together in the Fifties to create a pill that would finally grant women sexual freedom. Teamwork: In the 1950s, Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger (left) and scientist Gregory Pincus (right) collaborated to create a pill that could grant women sexual liberation . When McCormick, a very wealthy early suffragist, and Sanger, who founded Planned Parenthood in the Twenties, first met Pincus in the early Fifties, selling contraception was still illegal in many states. So they had to be careful not to attract too much attention when their research into a contraceptive pill went underway. 'They absolutely could've been imprisoned for some of the work they were doing,' Mr Eig told NPR. Pincus had recently been fired from his job as assistant professor at Harvard for his experimentation with in-vitro fertilization, and he was something of an outcast in the science world. After the women approached him about inventing a 'miracle drug' that could stop ovulation, he became obsessed with the idea. The science was there, but research and experimentation would be expensive; that's where McCormick came in. Contributions: Catholic physician John Rock (left) carried out experiments, and philanthropist Katharine McCormick (right) provided almost all the funds needed for research . A prominent member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, McCormick had been campaigning for women's rights - including to her own body. According to PBS, at her very first meeting with Pincus, she wrote him a check for $40,000 - the first of many more to come. Indeed, with the inheritance she earned from her husband's death, McCormick funded nearly every dollar that went into making the Pill a reality. The fourth person credited with the 'birth of the pill' in the book is John Rock - a pioneer in sperm freezing and the only Catholic physician to sign a petition to legalize birth control in 1931. Uncovered: The book reveals how the Pill was tested on 50 unknowing patients in Massachusetts under the guise of a fertility study, so as not to interfere with the state's anti-birth control laws . Once the Pill was approved, Rock fought long and hard to convince the Catholic community to accept it. In 1988 the Pope officially condemned the Pill in the encyclical Humanae Vitae, prompting Rock to stop attending mass for the first time in his life. Mr Eig reveals how all four had to disguise the true purpose of their research and experimentation so as to keep naysayers away, which was the only way to make it a reality. 'These guys are like guerrilla warriors - they're always having to figure out ways to do this thing that will attract the least attention,' he explains. 'They can never really say they're testing birth control.' Mr Eig told NPR that he became inspired to write about this topic after he heard a rabbi say in his sermon that the Pill was the most important invention to come out of the 20th century. Skeptical at first, he soon realized it 'had changed more than just science, more than just medicine. It had changed human dynamics. It had changed the way men and women get along in the world.' He continued: 'It changed reproduction, obviously, but it also created all kinds of opportunities for women that weren't there before, it had spread democracy.'","In the 1950s, before the Pill was approved, doctors Gregory Pincus and John Rock tested it on 50 patients in Massachusetts under the guise of a fertility study, so as not to interfere with the state's anti-birth control laws .
And when it was first sold in 1957, it was marketed as a treatment  of menstrual disorders, with a label that read: 'Warning: This pill will likely prevent pregnancy'"

"For sale – a speedboat, one not-so-careful crime-fighting owner… . One of a pair of boats made for the 1966 Batman movie and the 1960s TV series was put up for auction at the weekend. The vessel, complete with tail fin and flashing beacon, was put up for sale by Batman collector and enthusiast Mark Perkins at Brooklands in Surrey. Caped crusaders: Mark Perkins and a friend riding the Batboat down the River Thames to shock passers-by . He has owned the Batboat, made by Glastron Industries, for four years but said he had now run out of space. ‘It’s not your everyday piece of machinery,’ he said. ‘It’s as good as new and ready to fight crime.’ The Batboat, was made from a standard Glastron V-174. The makers added a red flashing beacon, glowing eyes, ‘Bazooka hatches’, seats, twin windscreens, and an aft deck cover with a glowing Bat-Signal on the tail fin. A water squirter and jet nozzle were added to make the Batboat look as if it was nuclear-powered. It had been expected to fetch between £36,000 and £40,000 at the auction, but failed to sell. Iconic: The vessel was created for the 1966 Batman film starring Adam West and Burt Ward (pictured) Mr Perkins’ boat, which has all its original running gear and is sea-worthy, was never used for filming the movie starring Adam West and Burt Ward but as a promotional tool in the US. ‘When we roar down the River Thames the looks we get, especially dressed up as Batman and Robin on a Sunday afternoon, are just fantastic,’ said Mr Perkins, who lives in Berkshire. He said he’d thought the boat would go to a museum or private collector. A spokesman for auctioneers Historics said hundreds of people had attended the six-hour auction.","Vessel with tail fin and flashing beacon is up for sale at Surrey auction house .

"Study: Research suggests less invasive surgery for breast cancer could have a similar effect (file photo) Women with breast cancer do not increase their survival chances by having a double mastectomy, researchers claim. They found women who only had lumps taken out followed by radiotherapy lived just as long as those who had both breasts removed. Researchers also point out that double mastectomies are major operations that take two months to recover from. By comparison, women who have lumpectomies – where only the tumour and nearby tissue are removed – usually get back to their daily routines within a few days. Earlier this year surgeons reported a surge in British women opting to have double mastectomies after Angelina Jolie decided to have the procedure to prevent the illness. Miss Jolie, 39, had the operation in May last year after learning she carried a faulty gene that gave her an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer. British surgeons have since said higher numbers of young women with cancer want double mastectomies while charities have reported an increase in queries to their helpline. Double mastectomies are often recommended for women with the faulty genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 – like Miss Jolie – who are at very high risk of the illness. Other women with breast cancer may choose to have the procedure to minimise the chances of the illness returning as much as possible. But a study of 189,734 women with breast cancer in California found no difference in survival rates between those who had double mastectomies and lumpectomies. After ten years 81 per cent of women in both groups were still alive, according to the findings published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Dr Allison Kurian, lead researcher from Stanford University, said: ‘We can now say that the average breast cancer patient who has bilateral (double) mastectomy will have no better survival than the average patient who has lumpectomy plus radiation. Surgery: There have been increased requests for double mastectomies over the last decade (posed by model) ‘Furthermore, a mastectomy is a major procedure that can require significant recovery time and may entail breast reconstruction, whereas a lumpectomy is much less invasive with a shorter recovery period.’ The study also found that the numbers of American women opting to have double mastectomies had increased by an average of 14 per cent every year between 1998 and 2011. This increase had nothing to do with Miss Jolie as it occurred before she had the procedure but researchers think women are assuming it will minimise their risk. There are no figures for England but surgeons have noticed a similar trend. Professor Kefah Mokbel, who is based at St George’s Hospital, South London, said in May that over the past ten years there have been increasing requests for double mastectomies and reconstruction from young women diagnosed with cancer in one breast. He said: ‘They want to minimise the risk, but the study shows women who do not have a genetic predisposition or family history are being over-treated.’ Eluned Hughes, of the Breakthrough Breast Cancer charity, said: ‘Double mastectomies are not routinely offered to women with breast cancer in the UK unless they have a family history of the disease or a high risk of recurrence, as outside of these groups there is no evidence to suggest this would be of benefit.' Having a double mastectomy is a difficult decision…so it’s important every woman has all the information about the risks and benefits of the surgery for them.’","Study examined almost 200,000 women with breast cancer in California .

"A California TV journalist doing a live report on a violent mugging in Temescal has been robbed while live on-air. KTVU reporter Heather Holmes was reporting from outside the Oakland police headquarters on Monday about a young woman who was mugged nearby. Unbeknownst to Holmes, as she reported on the woman's terrifying ordeal her own purse was being swiped from the news van, which was parked just feet away. Brazen theft: As Heather Holmes reported on a violent daylight robbery, her own purse was stolen from the KTVU news crew's van . Spate of thefts: Holmes had been dispatched to report on the violent mugging of this young woman in the Temescal area . The van wasn't locked, reports SF Gate, because the crew had just arrived and it was close enough that they could keep an eye on it. Holmes was reporting on the violent daylight mugging of a woman, who was seen, bloodied and bandaged, being loaded into an ambulance in the KTVU report. The area has been plagued by burglaries and hold-ups recently, as residents explained to Holmes. 'Three to four times a day we're seeing people casing cars and breaking in,' an unnamed resident told Homes. 'We’re calling it in to the police every time and they are stretched very thin and so they often aren’t able to show up for at least half an hour.' Indignant: Holmes tweeted about the incident that occurred as she filmed a live spot for KTVU . Precautions: Holmes tweeted that she had changed locks and canceled her credit cards, after one of her cards was used just 20 minutes after the theft . It wasn't until after she had finished her live cross that Holmes realized she'd been robbed. 'Oh the irony of it all...while reporting on violent mugging, my purse is stolen. Thieves used my bank card 20 mins after swiping my bag,' she tweeted. She then had to undertake all the usual precautions, changing her locks and canceling her credit cards. But Holmes used the misfortune to return attention to her story. The area is experiencing a spate of burglaries, and residents say robbers are becoming ever-more confident - as evidenced by the theft of a TV reporter's belongings outside the police station . 'While it's a bummer that my purse was stolen, it doesn't compare to what purse snatcher's [sic] did to this woman,' she tweeted. 'She was beaten about the face & head for her purse in #Temescal. @oaklandpoliceca responds & says it will increase patrols in the area.' Holmes hasn't had a lot of luck while doing live reports. She became an inadvertant internet star after footage of her swallowing the results of her runny nose while live on-air went viral. And she's not the first reporter to have been robbed while doing her job in the area. In March, thieves stole KTVU camera equipment in Oakland's Fruitvale area, and The New York Times reported last year that every major Bay Area news station has been robbed while reporting from Oakland.","Heather  Holmes was reporting on a violent mugging in the Oakland area when she was robbed .

Jean-Eric Vergne (Toro Rosso) Nico Rosberg’s turquoise gloves waved defeat from the cockpit of his ailing Mercedes. And so, after four months of misfortune, hurt and rancour, Lewis Hamilton was handed the World Championship lead. Rosberg’s race-ending gesture while sitting in the pit lane having completed just 13 laps was the result of electrical problems that beset him from the moment he turned out of the Mercedes garage here under the floodlit splendour of Singapore. A broken steering column forced him to go straight back for a replacement even before the race had started, and he returned to the grid just in time for lights out. But that did him no good. He could not get going and remained glued to his grid place — second, behind Hamilton — as the formation lap began around him. Hamilton sprays champagne in second-placed Sebastian Vettel's face after he re-passed the four-times world champion to take the lead of the race . Hamilton celebrates his seventh win of the season in Singapore.  He is now three points clear of Nico Rosberg in the battle for the Formula One championship . The Briton turned in a gutsy display to claim the 29th victory of his career. He was forced to re-pass Sebastian Vettel after he stayed out during the safety car period . 1.

Valtteri Bottas (Williams) 122 . So the German’s mechanics wheeled him into the pit lane, from where he started. Still the gremlins continued to curse him. His gears were jumping about like a box of frogs. He was helpless as he went from third to fifth, from fifth to seventh, and so on. Mercedes had no choice but to call him into the pits, by which time he had gamely passed Max Chilton in his Marussia, but nobody else. He chugged in, needing to stall the car to stop it. His team had intended to fit his car with a new steering column but, unable to resuscitate him, he declared his afternoon’s driving over. Rosberg kept his helmet on as he trudged around the garage disconsolately, but that could only partly hide his emotions. Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team boss, consoled him. Nico Rosberg's car is wheeled away off the grid after he suffered a problem with the electronics on his Mercedes . Rosberg managed to get going, before calling it a day on lap 15 despite Mercedes' best efforts to rectify his problem . Hamilton, who started on pole in Singapore, sprints away from the pack. Fernando Alonso escaped a penalty despite cutting the corner . Hamilton, who for most of the season has trailed his Mercedes team-mate in the championship, now leads him by three points . Vivian Rosberg, wife of the Mercedes driver, provides some encouraging words for her husband following his retirement from the Singapore Grand Prix . So did Vivian, his wife of three months. He soon went to the pit wall to watch Hamilton win, his eyes beadily fixed on the screens. ‘It was the toughest day of the year,’ he said afterwards. ‘It was even worse than Silverstone (where his gear box broke when he was leading). ‘None of the steering wheel functions worked — so I had no DRS, and so on. The gears were all over the place. My brake balance was totally wrong. Everything was all over the place.’ Other than for the 28°C heat and 75 per cent humidity, it should have been a straightforward task for Hamilton to convert his chance of victory, which had been set up not only by Rosberg’s misfortune but by his own splendid qualifying lap that conjured pole position out of hot air. But it did not go quite so smoothly as that when the safety car was called into action halfway through the race, after Adrian Sutil of Sauber had hit Sergio Perez’s Force India. The interruption cut Hamilton’s lead, yet he still needed to change his tyres and get out ahead of his pursuers, who did not require new rubber. So he had to re-establish a big enough gap to Sebastian Vettel in second place — about 27 seconds — to pit and come out in front.

(rank: r = retired, nc = not classified) Fastest Lap: Lewis Hamilton,1:50.417, lap 39. Hamilton grew anxious as he tried to establish that impregnable margin. He told his engineer, Peter Bonnington, that his rear tyres might explode. Now, Bonnington has the reassuring tone of a nurse with a needle saying: ‘You’ll just feel a small prick.’ It was in those soothing tones he called in Hamilton, his tyres fading and his lead standing at just over 25 seconds. Hamilton came out behind Vettel but, in just over a lap, he had squeezed past him, victory now assured. He patted his car afterwards and was cheered by a crowd containing a rich smattering of expats employed in the skyscrapers that provide part of the evocative backdrop to the Marina Bay circuit. Plenty of Australian flags were waved for him as well. This was the perfect result for Hamilton: maximum points while Rosberg scored none. It gave the Briton a lead — three points — for the first time since before the Monaco Grand Prix at the end of May. ‘I was dreaming it last night but you never really think it’s going to happen,’ said Hamilton. After a tumultuous first half of the season, Hamilton has finally picked up some consistency and managed to rid himself of the mechanical problems that had plagued him . Current world champion Sebastian Vettel has struggled for form this season, and has often been outshone by team-mate Ricciardo . There is a serenity in Hamilton’s mood since he turned up in Monza, a race he also won. But experience tells us that his psyche is brittle. Can he ride out the inevitable stresses of the final five races? Upon the answer may hinge the destiny of the title. The presence of his father Anthony here for a second successive race may be the crucial fillip. He has never won a title without his dad and mainstay at his side. Anthony said: ‘He has the right perspective about where he is. Win, lose or draw it’s Formula One, the greatest sport on the planet. Just don’t take it too seriously. He’s very calm because he’s enjoying it. Everything comes to those who wait.’ Vettel took second place and Daniel Ricciardo third in a satisfying day for Red Bull, whose pre-season started so unpropitiously that they sat out virtually all the first test. Their reliability is now sometimes embarrassing the Mercedes super-team. But Red Bull boss Christian Horner said last night he still does not believe in favouring Ricciardo through the imposition of team orders, even though he is 60 points behind Hamilton and Vettel is 117 adrift. With the final race in Abu Dhabi worth double points, they may yet prevail if Mercedes keep conking out.

"At least 20 civilians have been killed during fighting in eastern Ukraine today despite calls from the international community for a ceasefire. Just hours after flight MH17 was shot down, the eastern city of Lugansk was hit by shelling leaving hundreds of residents wounded. Pictures show bodies lining the streets covered in blankets in the wake of the attack which was reportedly carried out by Ukrainian forces. Vladimir Putin has called for both sides to lay down their weapons after the Malaysian Airlines plane carrying 298 passengers was hit by a surface-to-air missile yesterday, but the request seemed to fall on deaf ears.

Fighting continues: An injured man receives medical treatment after a shelling attack on the city of Lugansk in eastern Ukraine . Scene: After being treated on the side of the road, he is loaded onto a stretcher. Another man with a cut on his arm walks passed . Attention: Medical officials treat him in the back of an ambulance before taking him to hospital . Rubble: Ukrainian soldiers walk in the debris-covered streets surrounding the buildings. Administration officials said railway stations and main roads had been targeted . The UN and ther international leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel also called for an end to the fighting so an investigation into yesterday's events can take place. Fighting is also said to have carried on to the north of the city, in the village of Metallist, 10km from Lugansk, and in the west, in Yubileynoye settlement. It also emerged that the The Lisichansk Oil Refinery has also been attacked and set on fire. The Russian President said he was in contact with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko after the Boeing 777 passenger airliner came down in an area under rebel control. He said: 'Direct talks between the opposing sides must be established as soon as possible. All sides in the conflict must swiftly halt fighting and begin peace negotiations. It is with great concern and sadness that we are watching what is happening in eastern Ukraine. It's awful, it's a tragedy.' Putin, who has blamed the airliner tragedy on Poroshenko for refusing to extend a shaky ceasefire with rebels in the region, said he hoped the Ukrainian president would be able to offer a peaceful way out of the conflict. Kiev accuses pro-Russian separatists of shooting down the airliner with help from Russian intelligence representatives. Ukraine premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk said pro-Moscow rebels are preventing emergency workers reaching the scene of the air crash, despite promises to the contrary. His allegation raises the fear that vital evidence could be tampered with. 'These bandits do not allow our national agencies investigating the plane crash to reach the scene of the tragedy,' he said. The Ukrainian authorities are working with the OSCE to resolve this problem, he said. 'We are doing our utmost together with the law enforcement authorities and the OSCE to bring the national commission investigating this tragedy to the scene.' Ukraine yesterday opened criminal proceedings into a 'terrorist attack' on the Boeing. Two Ukrainian soldiers run for cover during the attack which is said to have started overnight .

"The ‘miracle pine’ that survived the 2011 tsunami in Japan will be immortalised as a monument to the victims of the disaster as the nation marks the second anniversary today. The 88ft pine was the only surviving tree in a forest of 70,000 which was wiped out when the tsunami hit Rikuzentakata, Iwate prefecture. The disaster on March 11, 2011, left . nearly 19,000 people dead or missing and more than 300,000 without a . home, and many have yet to return. In memoriam: The 'miracle pine' pictured today after it has been  artificially restored as a monument marking the anniversary of the 2011 tsunami in  Rikuzentakata, Iwate Prefecture . The pine tree, which also survived major . tsunami in 1896 and 1933, died six months ago as a result of the . environmental changes in the area. The ‘miracle pine’ was felled soon afterwards and giant moulds were made in order to re-create the tree and raise the monument on the spot where it stood for 173 years. As Japan marked the second anniversary of the devastating earthquake and tsunami, it emerged that thousands of families remain displaced. There is growing dissatisfaction in the island nation as the population accuse the government of not putting enough effort into the recovery process. About half of those displaced are . evacuees from areas near the nuclear Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, . whose reactors melted down after its cooling systems were disabled by . the tsunami. I'm a survivor: The tree was the only to still stand in a forest where an estimated 70,000 stood before the tsunami moved on the small city and nearly wiped it off the map . Building memories: After the tree died it was cut up and partly re-created in order to create the monument . Pining for the past: As Japan marks the second anniversary of the disaster, the tree is one of the few things which has been fully restored in the aftermath of the tsunami . All by myself: What used to be a forest is now a beach with a lone tree, a large part of which is 'fake' as the real deal died six months ago as a result of the increased levels of saline in the ground . Made of stronger stuff: The tree was 173 years old before it died, 18 months after the disaster - which was the third tsunami it had survived . Today 800 of them filed a lawsuit demanding compensation from the government and the now-defunct plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), for their suffering and losses. ‘Two years after the disasters, neither the government nor TEPCO has clearly acknowledged their responsibility, nor have they provided sufficient support to cover the damages,’ said Izutaro Managi, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs. Japan’s new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that the government intends to make ‘visible’ reconstruction progress and accelerate resettlement of those left homeless by streamlining legal and administrative procedures many blame for the delays. ‘I pray that the peaceful lives of those affected can resume as soon as possible,’ Emperor Akihito said at a somber memorial service at Tokyo's National Theater earlier today.

After: Kesennuma, Miyagi prefecture pictured on March 4, 2013 ¿ the fishing vessel remains but the debris has been cleared . Before: A man takes a photograph of of Ishinomaki, Miyagi prefecture a week after the earthquake and the tsunami that followed . After: Two years later the area has been cleaned of debris, and the land is ready to be rebuilt . At observances in Tokyo and in still barren towns along the northeastern coast, those gathered bowed their heads in a moment of silence marking the moment, at 2:46 p.m. on March 11, 2011, when the magnitude 9.0 earthquake - the strongest recorded in Japan's history - struck off the coast. Throughout the disaster zone, the tens of thousands of survivors living in temporary housing are impatient to get resettled, a process that could take up to a decade, officials say. ‘What I really want is to once again have a ""my home,"" ‘ said Migaku Suzuki, a 69-year-old farm worker in Rikuzentakata, who lost his son and the house he had just finished building in the disaster. Further south, in Fukushima prefecture, some 160,000 evacuees are uncertain if they will ever be able to return to homes around the nuclear power plant, where the meltdowns in three reactors spewed radiation into the surrounding soil and water. Evacuees are anxious to return home but worried about the potential, still uncertain risks from exposure to the radiation from the disaster, the worst since Chernobyl in 1986. While there have been no clear cases of cancer linked to radiation from the plant, the upheaval in people's lives, uncertainty about the future and long-term health concerns, especially for children, have taken an immense psychological toll on thousands of residents. Devastating: The tsunami floods over the breakwater protecting the northwestern coastal city of Miyako on March 11, 2011 . Still in pain: As the country marks two years since the tsunami, many in Japan are complaining that the restoration work is too slow and many have yet to return to their homes . ‘I don't trust the government on anything related to health anymore,’ said Masaaki Watanabe, 42, who fled the nearby town of Minami-Soma and doesn't plan to return. A change of government late last year has raised hopes that authorities might move more quickly with the cleanup and reconstruction. Since taking office in late December, Abe has made a point of frequently visiting the disaster zone, promising faster action and plans to raise the long-term reconstruction budget to 25 trillion yen (£175 billion) from 19 trillion yen (£134 billion). ‘We cannot turn away from the harsh reality of the affected areas. The Great East Japan Earthquake still is an ongoing event,’ Abe said at the memorial gathering in Tokyo. ‘Many of those hit by the disaster are still facing uncertainty over their futures.’","Only surviving tree out of 70,000 after tsunami that struck Japan in 2011 .

"People living at Britain’s most exclusive addresses are just as likely to be drug addicts as those on Benefits Street, a Labour frontbencher has claimed. Chris Bryant, the shadow welfare minister, said there were as many addicts living on The Bishops Avenue in London – known as Billionaires' Row – as on James Turner Street in Birmingham. And he criticised the portrayal of people on the Channel 4 programme, insisting people on benefits are ‘not shoplifting’ but want to find work. Labour's shadow welfare minister Chris Bryant criticised the portrayal of residents of James Turner Street . Benefits Street has been a huge hit for Channel 4, featuring some of the residents living on the street in Birmingham. It has made stars of the likes of White Dee – a 42-year-old single mother who receives £200 a week in handouts and whose real is Deirdre Kelly. During a live TV debate she attacked the government for creating a claimant culture - and said it is not her fault how much she is given. She also accused Channel 4 of manipulating the residents of James Turner Street, in Birmingham. White Dee appeared to be backed up by Mr Bryant, who said the portrayal of those on benefits as drug addicts and criminals was at odds with the reality. Taking part in Mr Bryant said: ‘I thought to myself, if you went to the richest street in this country, which is Bishop’s Row [sic] in Hampstead, and there’s 99 houses, you’d find they have exactly the same number of people who are drug addicts, alcoholics and have exactly the same problems.’ The Bishop's Avenue in Hampstead is one of the most exclusive roads in Britain, home to leading businessmen and women, members of the Saudi royal family and the president of Kazakhstan. The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead is one of the most exclusive addresses in Britain . Some of the residents of James Turner Street in Birmingham have become TV stars after featuring on Channel 4's Benefits Street . Mr Bryant went on: 'There are 99 houses in that street and you would expect 50 of them would be pensioners. 'We didn't see them in the programme we just saw the people who were shoplifting. ‘My experience of people on benefits is they are not shoplifting they want to work.' Conservative minister Mike Penning also accused the broadcaster of being unrealistic in their portrayal of life on benefits. 'You were very selective in your cuts. You were very very selective about what you did there,' he said. 'You picked on a certain group of people and you didn't really tell them the full truth about what you were going to do, I don't think.' Millionairess Eva Rausing, 48 – the wife of Tetra Pak billionaire Hans Kristian Rausing – had been dead for eight weeks before her body was found in their £70 million London home in Cadogan Place, Belgravia, in July 2012. Mr Rausing, 49, was given a ten-month suspended custodial sentence after admitting he denied her ‘a decent and lawful burial’. He told a court he ‘suffered some sort of breakdown’ following her death. The 49-year-old, whose family is the 12th richest in Britain and whose fortune comes from the £4.5billion Tetra Pak drinks carton empire, told psychiatrists after his arrest: 'I know it is sad and selfish, but I just didn’t want her to leave.' Left, The Marquess of Blandford, otherwise known as Jamie Blandford. Right, the Earl of Cardigan at Swindon Crown Court . In July 2012 David Brudenell-Bruce, the 8th Earl of Cardigan, was deemed mentally unfit to face charges of theft and criminal damage and taken from court to hospital by ambulance. He was arrested for allegedly damaging pheasant feeders, stealing a battery and an electrical power unit. Brudenell-Bruce, 59, is alleged to have caused £66 damage to a number of pheasant feeders belonging to James Tilly. Marquis of Blandford Jamie Blandford, 57, was all but disinherited by his father the Duke of Marlborough after he battled addiction to heroin and cocaine – at one point spending £20,000 on cocaine in four months – and was twice imprisoned. His father was so worried that he took legal action to stop his son from inheriting the family’s 11,500-acre Oxfordshire estate that was the birthplace of Winston Churchill. A lengthy court battle led to a compromise that Blandford would inherit his father’s title on his death but a board of trustees, including his younger brother, would run the estate. But now Blandford has been drug-free for years and father and son have seemingly put their differences behind them. In 2012 the Marquess moved back on to the spectacular estate and been given a trusted role in its running. White Dee, from Channel 4's Benefits Street, has attacked the programme's makers for their portrayal of those on the now-famous street . Benefits Street explored day-to-day life in James Turner Street, Winson Green, where, it is claimed, as many as 90 per cent of people claim benefits. Many of the residents have become national celebrities as a result of the media coverage. But the series proved controversial and Channel 4 received more than 200 complaints after the first episode. It has attracted criticism for being ‘poverty porn’ and sensationalising the thorny issue of benefits, unemployment and housing. A Sunday newspaper recently claimed Kelly is now so prized by Channel 4 that they offered her ‘thousands of pounds’ as an inducement not to take part in Big Brother, a rival Channel 5 show, and secure her services exclusively. Ralph Lee, a Channel 4 producer, said: There are streets like James Turner streets up and down the country.'","Shadow welfare minister condemns coverage of people on benefits .

"World Cup dream: Headteacher Mark Williams has resigned his job at a Bolton school and has gone to Brazil . A headteacher has quit his job to travel to the World Cup in Brazil because he would not miss 'the trip off a lifetime'. England and West Ham fan Mark Williams told governors at High Lawn Primary School in Bolton he wanted to resign so he could go to the tournament in South America. Controversially they have given him two weeks off during term time to travel to Brazil. He will return in July for the remainder of the summer term before a new headteacher takes over in September. The decision could infuriate parents who would be punished if they took their children out of school outside holidays. They can can be fined £60 per child, which increases to £120 if it is not paid within 28 days. Failure to pay can result in court action and in extreme cases a short prison term. Mr Williams flew out to South America on Wednesday - the day before hosts Brazil beat Croatia 3-1 in the opening match of the tournament in Sao Paulo. Mr Williams said: 'I offered my resignation to governors so I could fulfil the trip of a lifetime. 'However, it was agreed with governors that it would be best for the school for me to continue until the end of the year. 'We agreed that I would be on unpaid leave of absence for the two-week period.' Bosses asked him to stay on at the school but he said he had already made the plans before being asked and confirmed a new head will take over in September. David Kay, chairman of governors, said: 'Earlier in the year, Mr Williams offered his resignation to the governing body so that he could attend the World Cup in Brazil. Scroll down for video . Time off: Controversially the head has been given two weeks off during term time - but if parents did the same they would be fined . Living the dream: Mr Williams would have been among the fans watching Brazil beat Croatia on screens like this one in Manaus last night after he flew out on Wednesday . 'He also informed us that he wanted to pursue alternative career opportunities. 'Governors agreed that it would be in the best interests of the school to grant unpaid leave of absence for this visit. 'We agreed that Mr Williams to stay on for the remainder of the summer term to ensure a smooth transition into the next academic year. 'It would not have been acceptable for governors to grant unpaid leave of absence without Mr Williams offering his resignation.' Mr Williams will share his experiences of the World Cup with his pupils when he returns before leaving his role in July. The teacher has been praised by the school for achieving a 'good with outstanding' Ofsted report on two occasions.","Mark Williams told governors at Bolton school he must go to South America .
