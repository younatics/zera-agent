"By . John Hall for MailOnline . A Norwegian man has taken part in what might be the craziest ice bucket challenge yet - using a huge cement mixer lorry to pour 7,000 litres of freezing water over his head. Lars Christian Rødal, a 29-year-old from the town of Hell, was nominated to take part in the charity challenge by a friend from Scotland, but described using a simple bucket as 'too wimpy' and so opted to organise his own extreme version of the stunt. It took Mr Rødal a full 30 minutes to fill the massive cement mixer with ice-cold water, but only 30 seconds for it to be flushed over him as he sat in a chair. The ice bucket challenge craze has already swept the world - with dozens of celebrities getting also involved in a stunt that requires participants to film themselves pouring freezing water over their heads before donating money to a charity that supports those suffering from motor neurone disease.

Extreme: Lars Christian Rødal, 29, used a huge cement mixer lorry to pour 7,000 litres of freezing water over his head. described using a simple bucket as 'too wimpy' Massive: The video begins with the fully-loaded cement mixer lorry being driven onto a construction site to the sound of a melancholy piano loop . Getting ready: As a cement mixer driver by trade, Mr Rødal said it was fairly easy to guess the method he would chose to take part in the challenge . Mr Rødal was nominated to take part by a friend who lives in Scotland, and decided to carry out the challenge in the most extreme way he could think of. Speaking to Norwegian television channel TV2, he said: 'A friend from Scotland challenged me to . do the Ice Bucket Challenge, but I thought a bucket was too wimpy. I . wanted something a little more extreme.' As a cement mixer driver by trade, the solution seemed fairly obvious - and so Mr Rødal spent a full 30 minutes filling his vehicle's storage tank with 7,000 litres of freezing water. The video begins with the huge, fully-loaded cement mixer lorry being driven onto a construction site to the sound of a melancholy piano loop. Mr Rødal is then seen taking up his position on a seat behind the vehicle and lighting a cigarette as the mechanism in the lorry begins to whir into life. Waiting: Mr Rødal is seen taking up his position on a seat behind the vehicle and lighting a cigarette as the mechanism in the lorry begins to whir into life . Brace: Mr Rødal winces in pain as the torrent of freezing cold water crashes over him . Seconds later freezing water begins gushing out of the lorry, with Mr Rødal wincing in pain as the torrent crashes over him. The 29-year-old leaps out of his seat before the load is fully flushed, but returns seconds later to ensure he is not accused of chickening out of the challenge. Unsurprisingly Mr Rødal said the stunt was incredibly painful, adding: 'It hurt. I lost feeling all over my body.' Having taken part, Mr Rødal - like millions of others around the world - made a donation to a local charity that supports those suffering from ALS, which also known as motor neurone disease. Brave: It took Mr Rødal a full 30 minutes to fill the massive cement mixer with ice-cold water, but only 30 seconds for it to be flushed over him as he sat in a chair . Coming back: At one point he 29-year-old leaps out of his seat in pain. He returns seconds later, however, to ensure he is not accused of chickening out of the challenge . Charitable: Unsurprisingly Mr Rødal said the stunt was incredibly painful, adding: 'It hurt. I lost feeling all over my body' Mr Rødal is far from the only Norwegian to embrace the ice bucket challenge. As a direct result of the ice bucket challenge, the Norwegian support group for sufferers of ALS said it raised 100,000 krone last week alone - the equivalent of £9,700. Head of the ALS group in Norway, Mona Bahus: 'I think this is completely unreal. I . felt everything was a bit slow because we are on the periphery to being . barely a group at all. 'It has completely taken off during the last 24 . hours and now I feel that we are something! And that means being . ""something"" for ALS in Norway,' she added.

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Werner Franz, the last surviving crew member of the Hindenburg disaster, has died aged 92 . It was a life that could quite literally have gone up in flames - Werner Franz was just a 14-year-old cabin boy when he was aboard the German airship Hindenburg, as it became engulfed by fire and crashed in New Jersey 77 years ago. His sharp young mind and a huge stroke of luck meant he spent those last 77 years alive, and not as a mere statistic in the tragedy which marked the end of the airship era. As the huge, hydrogen-filled Zeppelin burst into flames, Mr Franz happened to be cleaning up in the officers' mess, where a huge tank of water above him burst and protected him from the blaze. He was able to jump out of the ship as it fell devastatingly to the ground, and fled the wreckage to escape without so much as a scratch. He had the nous to run into the wind - if he had gone the other way he would have been swallowed up by the flames and become the 37th life claimed by the tragedy. Mr Franz certainly made the most of his lucky escape - he was 92 when he died from heart failure earlier this month - and was the last surviving crew member. He returned to Germany after the crash, and served as an aircraft technician during World War II. He went on to coach roller skating and ice skating later in life, and was never afraid to tell people about his experience, said Carl Jablonski, president of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society, who last met him at a 2004 event commemorating the disaster. The tragedy is particularly iconic in the history of aircraft, as photographers and film crews were able to capture the devastation as it unfolded. Today, photographs not only show us the enormity of the event, but also how fortunate Mr Franz and the airship's 61 other on-board survivors really were. Scroll down for video . The crash, which spelled the end of the airship era, killed 36 people including 22 members of the crew . The disaster is considered one of the most iconic air crashes in history due to the extensive media coverage . John Provan, a long -time friend, told of how the young Franz came to be on Hindenburg completely by chance. 'His older brother worked at a fancy hotel in Frankfurt where the passengers and the captain stayed overnight before the airship took off early in the morning,' he said. 'One of the captains said they were looking for a cabin boy and [his brother] heard about it.' He added: 'Werner was most fortunate because he was in the officers' mess cleaning up. Above him was a large tank of water that burst open and drenched him, which protected him a bit from the flames and the heat.' He was able to jump out of a cloth supply hatch onto the ground below and made the wise decision to run into the wind. 'He didn't make the mistake of going in the other direction or the flames would have caught him,' Mr Provan said. Mr Provan, quoting Mr Franz's widow Annerose, confirmed that he died in his home town of Frankfurt on August 13. There are believed to be three more survivors from the disaster still alive today - two passengers named Werner Doehner and Horst Schirmer, who were both children - and Robert Buchanan, a member of the ground crew that was waiting to moor the ship. The Hindenburg disaster happened on Thursday, May 6, 1937, when the German passenger airship LZ 129 Hindenburg caught fire and crashed at Lakehurst Naval Air Station in New Jersey as it tried to dock with its mooring mast. There were 97 people on board the ship, made up of 36 passengers and 61 members of crew. Of those, 35 died - 13 passengers and 22 crew - along with one worker on the ground. In total, 36 people were killed, though it could have been more, as the flight was only half booked. The huge airship - as long as three football fields and 15 stories tall - was considered the most luxurious means to cross the Atlantic at the time. Its loss - widely attributed to static electricity that ignited leaking hydrogen - was a heavy blow to the image of a resurgent Germany that the Nazis wanted to project to the world. The disaster was hugely covered in the media, as photographers and video artists were able to capture it from the ground - this helped make it one of the most iconic and highest profile aircraft crashes in history. The airship had left from Frankfurt three days earlier on May 3, for what was supposed to the the first of 10 trips between Europe and America. As it came to land it was hours behind schedule because of stormy weather. The captain diverted it towards Manhattan Island, which drew huge crowds of people who came to catch a glimpse of the vast ship. The craft came in to land at around 7.30pm, and witnesses recounted seeing what looked like a gas leak, and also what may have been static electricity. It is disputed where the fire started, but those on board heard an explosion, before the ship burst into flames. The back of the ship broke and the tail end crashed into the ground. This caused fire to fly through the nose and kill nine members of the crew. In total, the accident is believed to have lasted between just 32 and 37 second, with experts analysing that the fire spread at a rate of around 15m/s. There are other theories relating to how the fire came to start. These range from the idea that a gunshot was actually to blame, that it was struck by lightning or that the engine failed, though the static theory is considered to be the most likely.","Werner Franz was a 14-year-old cabin boy when the vast airship crashed .

"By . Rob Waugh . Payments via mobile systems such as NFC (near field communications) chips will overtake both cash AND cards by 2020, claims a new report . The pennies in our pockets could soon be consigned to the history books - along with debit and credit cards. A poll of technology experts by America's Pew Internet Research centre found that most predicted that mobile-phone payments would have overtaken both cash AND cards by 2020. Of the 1200 experts polled, 65% thought that cash and cards would be nearly wiped out by 2020. The poll included Harvard experts as well as engineers from companies such as Google and Microsoft. The need for either cash or cards will be 'eliminated' by chips in mobile phones. In shops, people will 'bump' their phones against tills to pay - or simply pay online via apps. Many tech experts also believe that the new systems will be MORE secure. Google chief economist Hal Varian said, 'Two-factor . authentication (secret number + physical device) is better than . one-factor authentication, and smart phones seem to have a natural role . here.' Microsoft  engineer Christian Huitema says, 'We have already witnessed the transition from cash to debit/credit . cards. The electronic wallet is not much more than a ‘virtual card,’ in . which near-field wireless communication replaces the reading of a . magnetic stripe.' The poll, which included experts from Harvard and Google, expected that 'near field communication' systems - where users 'bump' phones against tills to transfer funds, as well as online payments from phones, would have overtaken cash and cards in eight years time. Based on a technology known as near-field communication (NFC), Google Wallet allows users to store payment information in the cloud and pay for goods at participating retailers by tapping their phone at the point of purchase . 'Overall, a majority supported the scenario that by . 2020 most people will have embraced and fully adopted the use of . smart-device swiping for purchases they make, nearly eliminating the . need for cash or credit cards,' says Pew, a respected technology think tank. 'These experts feel that the explosive . growth in the use of smartphones and other mobile devices, makes these systems an obvious choice to replace established . modes of payment in day-to-day commerce.' The research found that the change is already happening - particularly in America, where phones using Google Wallet (a mobile payment system) and NFC payment chips are more common. A March 2012 Federal Reserve report found that 21% of mobile phone owners had used mobile banking services in the past year and that another 11% of mobile owners plan to use such services in the next 12 months. The study also found that some 12% of mobile phone owners have made payments—such as paying bills online or transferring money directly to another person’s account—via their phones. In the developing world, the figures are even higher - 20% of Kenya's GDP is sent via text message every year using the country's M-Pesa system. In late 2011, Google launched Google Wallet in partnership with Citibank and MasterCard. Based on a technology known as near-field communication (NFC), Google Wallet allows users to store payment information in the cloud and pay for goods at participating retailers by tapping their phone at the point of purchase. Many analysts predict that Apple will announce its own virtual wallet service in the near future.","Phone chips will become main method of payment .

"By . Thomas Burrows . An unwanted Rottweiler has been homeless for five months because her 'mournful face' puts off visitors to the kennels where she is staying. The six-year-old Rottweiler cross, Bless, has attracted no interest at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home and staff are convinced it is because she constantly looks gloomy. Bless was found on the streets of London as a stray. Despite a loving personality, Bless is always overlooked by visitors to the kennels and is the longest staying resident at the charity's south London Home. Scroll down for video . Bless, a six-year-old Rottweiler cross, is always overlooked by visitors to the Battersea Dogs & Cats Home and staff are convinced it is because of her sad face . Bless was found on the streets of London as a stray and is the longest staying resident at the charity's home. She is pictured with re-homing and Welfare Assistant Laura Lambert . The Rottweiler cross has attracted no interest from potential owners and has been at the home for five months . Despite a loving personality, Bless is always overlooked by visitors to the kennels in south London . Video courtesy of Battersea Dogs & Cats Home . Rob Young, Head of Dog re-homing, said: 'Bless has a mournful face but a heart of gold – anyone who meets her can't believe what a gentle giant she is. 'Although she looks sad she is an absolute joy to be around – that's why it's so sad for us that she's still in kennels rather than happily established in a loving home.' Rob Young, Head of dog re-homing at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home said Bless has a 'heart of gold' Staff at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home hope Bless will attract as much interest as the mournful kitten, who became an internet sensation this Summer. The sad cat is owned by Ashley Herring, 21, from New Orleans, and became popular after she posted photos to the internet. Elsewhere, pictures of a lonely polar bear, Arturo, that emerged last month led to a worldwide campaign to save it. Half a million people delivered a petition to Argentina’s President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner calling for Arturo to be moved to a cooler climate after photos emerged of him sitting in a concrete enclosure at Mendoza Zoo in Argentina in temperatures of up to 40C (104F). It was claimed the 29-year-old’s lonely life was causing him to display abnormal behaviour, including tilting his head and showing his teeth while pacing back and forth and rocking from side to side. He was said to have been depressed since his long-term friend Pelusa died two years ago. Despite that, Argentina refused to relocate its lonely polar bear, even though animal rights activists said it was showing signs of stress. But perhaps people are becoming more obsessed by their pets' image. Last month, the RSPCA announced a rise in the number of black cats being abandoned by their owners, and attributed it to them not photographing well for selfies. A spokesman for the animal welfare charity said: 'There are a number of reasons for us having so many black cats, including the fact that black animals tend not to photograph as well as other cats with more distinctive markings. 'We really are puzzled as to why this still happens but we would urge people to never judge a cat by its colour and look at its personality instead.'

"By . Steve Robson . and Alan Roden . Scottish nationalists are preparing to form a secret intelligence service in the style of MI5 once independence is secured, it has emerged. With Scotland preparing for a vote on separation in 2014, ministers have indicated that an independent country would require its own 'McMI5' spy agency. And security analysts believe such spymasters will target the brightest minds at St Andrews University, where Prince William and Kate Middleton studied, for the James Bonds of the future. Switching sides? The Sean Connerys of the future may work for 'McMI5' rather than Her Majesty's Secret Service . Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she expects that an 'independent domestic intelligence machinery' would be set up post-independence. But during a visit to Glasgow last week, the Home Secretary Theresa May said that if Scotland were to become a separate state it would not be guaranteed to have access to intelligence on terrorism and organised crime from the UK. She warned that as a new country, Scotland would have to gain trust before it could expect to share sensitive information. 'The point is that if Scotland is separate it becomes a separate state. So it is not the same as sharing intelligence across the UK,' she said. Stuart Crawford, a defence and . security analyst, told the Sunday Times: 'Intelligence needs the brightest and the best, . and that's what you can get from the top universities such as St Andrews . or Edinburgh. 'I know a . number of senior academics who work as talent spotters for the security . services and this is how any new agency in a post-independence Scotland . would operate.' The Scottish MI5 may recruit spies from students at St Andrews' university, it has been claimed . Clash: Home Secretary Theresa May, left, has criticised plans mooted by Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, right, to form a Scots version of MI5 . But the plans have been criticised by former top MI6 officer who warned that . an independent Scotland could not rely on the ‘umbrella’ of Britain’s . security agencies. Baroness Margaret ‘Meta’ Ramsay said the SNP needs to ‘think again’ if . it believes intelligence from MI6, MI5 and the UK’s communications . headquarters, GCHQ, would be shared. Alternative career paths: Spymasters could be recruiting from the alma mater of Prince William and Kate Middleton, who both attended St Andrews university . The Labour peer – once tipped as a future head of the Secret . Intelligence Service – also questioned whether Nationalist ministers . ‘realise the magnitude’ of providing Scotland with its own domestic . security body to replace MI5, not to mention an external agency to . replace MI6. Her comments came after Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was . challenged on the issue at a recent meeting of Westminster’s foreign . affairs committee. Miss Sturgeon struggled to outline the SNP’s plans and claimed there . would still be ‘very close intelligence sharing with the rest of the . UK’. MPs on the committee outlined the huge cost of gathering security data. The UK government is spending £650million to upgrade its systems to cope . with the growing threat of ‘cyber-terrorism’. The work of 14,000 UK diplomatic staff in 270 offices around the world . would also come to an end post-independence, with the Scottish . Government forced to set up its own embassies. Establishing just 100 . outposts has been estimated to cost around £1billion. Baroness Ramsay, a Glasgow University graduate who went on to become a . case officer with MI6, was head of station in Helsinki, Finland. She . left the intelligence service for politics and was foreign policy . adviser to John Smith, Labour leader from 1992 to 1994. In an opinion piece published yesterday, Baroness Ramsay wrote: ‘It can . never be assumed that diplomatic or historic friendships will result in . any intelligence liaison, other than the most basic and low grade, until . credentials have been established. Of course, it is not impossible to . begin a new security service, but it has to be realistically recognised . that it demands considerable resources both human and financial.' Asked at the recent committee meeting if Scotland would expect to be . able to read the rest of the UK’s secret intelligence, Miss Sturgeon . replied: ‘Scotland and the rest of the UK share an island. It would be . not just in Scotland’s interest for there to be very close . intelligence-sharing with the rest of the UK. It would clearly be in the . interest of the rest of the UK as well.’ A Scottish Government spokesman said last night: ‘The UK Government has . recently offered to share intelligence with Algeria, so if that is in . its interests it will be overwhelmingly in the interests of the rest of . the UK to share intelligence with counterparts in an independent . Scotland.’","Nationalists preparing to form 'McMI5' after referendum in 2014 .

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . Payout: EDF will pay £3million after a new IT system wreaked havoc with its complaints prodecures . Big Six energy giant EDF is paying out £3million to 'vulnerable customers' after a watchdog found it did not cope well enough with a huge surge of complaints. Gripes with the French-owned firm jumped more then 30 per cent when it was in the throes of introducing a new IT system in 2011. But frustrated customers faced 'unacceptably high' waiting times when they rang the company's call centre, the regulator Ofgem said. Many were not recorded properly on the system, while others gave up and hung up. Today's payout - which Ofgem agreed with EDF instead of a fine - will not be paid directly to customers because it was difficult to establish who was affected or how much money they lost. Instead the £3million will go to the Citizens' Advice Bureau's debt helpline, based in Plymouth, and the charity's Energy Best Deal Extra scheme to help other customers in future. Ofgem's investigation found that between May 2011 and January 2012, EDF Energy did not have appropriate procedures in place to properly receive, record and process all customers’ complaints. When callers eventually got through, there was evidence that the supplier failed to record all the required details for the complaints received. These included the date of receipt and a summary of the complaint and action taken, without which it was difficult to track complaints' progress. At times when the new systems were down, complaints were not logged until some time after they were received. But the regulator added that staff at the energy company took action quickly to rectify the problems and to mitigate the effects on consumers. Sarah Harrison, Ofgem’s senior partner with responsibility for enforcement, said: 'EDF Energy failed to have sufficiently robust processes in place when they introduced a new IT system and this led to the unacceptable handling of complaints. 'Their commitment to putting things right and paying £3million to the Citizens Advice Energy Best Deal Extra scheme and the Plymouth Citizen Advice Bureau’s Debt Helpline to benefit vulnerable customers is a step in the right direction to rebuilding consumer trust.' Fury: Many customers hung up and others did not have details recorded on the system (photo posed by model) An EDF spokesman said the errors happened during an 18-month transfer onto the new IT system 'despite careful planning and investment'. The spokesman added: 'As soon as the problems emerged, following a number of unforeseen technical system problems, EDF Energy suspended the transfer of customer accounts into the new system. Research in May found EDF was the third-most complained about Big Six firm, receiving 62 for every 100,000 customers, . The most complaints went to German-owned npower, which imposed the highest price hike last winter and received ten times as many complaints as its best performing rival. Data from the Citizens Advice Bureau showed that, between October and December last year, npower was inundated with 306 complaints for every 100,000 customers. That was three times as many as Scottish Power, which attracted 100.5 complaints per 100,000 customers. E.ON came fourth with 55.8, British Gas was fifth with 53.7 and Scottish and Southern Energy was the best performing of the firms with 31.5. 'Actions were taken to resolve these technical problems and hundreds of additional staff were recruited to restore service levels. 'EDF Energy has publicly acknowledged that the service to customers was not acceptable through this period and has co-operated fully with Ofgem throughout the investigation.' The payout follows Ofgem's announcement in June that a full investigation would be held into the Big Six after their retail profits quadrupled to £1.1billion in three years. The firms, which dominate the energy market, are British Gas, SSE, E.ON, EDF, npower and Scottish Power. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) inquiry, expected to take around 18 months, will look at the relationship between the supply businesses and generation arms of the six firms. The number of customers switching suppliers has fallen in recent years and 43 per cent of people say they do not trust energy suppliers to be open and transparent, according to Ofgem. EDF managing director Beatrice Bigois said: 'Despite our best efforts and extensive planning to manage this transition in 2011 without impacting our customers, we recognise that for a period of time the service to our customers was not up to the standards they deserve. We apologise to those customers who were impacted during this period. 'We have cooperated fully with Ofgem and have taken this matter very seriously. 'The £3m package that we are offering will ensure that thousands of vulnerable customers are provided with free, independent advice on debt, as well as information to help them manage their energy consumption and bills.' E.ON . The firm agreed to pay £12million to vulnerable customers in May after Ofgem's investigation found it had broken energy sales rules between 2010 and 2013. E.ON also committed to compensating any customer that it mis-sold to, including automatic payments to some vulnerable customers. Scottish and Southern Energy . SSE was fined £10.5million in May 2013 for numerous breaches of its obligations relating to telephone, in-store and doorstep sales activities. Ofgem found failings at all stages of SSE's sales processes, from the opening lines on the doorstep, in-store or over the phone through to the confirmation process which follows a sale. After a probe into how it handled last winter's storms, which saw a million homes lose power, SSE  paid out £4.6million this summer. This included £2.3million in guaranteed standards and goodwill payments and £2.3million to the British Red Cross, Age UK, National Energy Action, Macmillan Cancer Support, and to a new community fund. Scottish Power . In May, Scottish Power agreed to pay £750,000 to Energy Best Deal following Ofgem's investigation into price differences between its standard credit and direct debit tariffs. Under Ofgem rules, suppliers can only have different prices for different payment methods if the amount reflects the costs involved in supplying those accounts. These rules are designed to protect consumers and take into account that some payment methods are more expensive to administer than others. Ofgem's investigation found that between, September 2009 and December 2012, Scottish Power did not have a robust process in place to assess the costs associated with different payment types and set prices accordingly. British Gas . In April, Ofgem's investigations found that British Gas Business had incorrectly blocked business customers from switching to other suppliers and failed to notify customers when their contract was due to expire. In recognition of these failures, British Gas Business was set to pay £5.6 million in redress and penalty. In July, Ofgem secured a £1million package from British Gas after they mis-sold to customers in Sainsbury's stores nationwide and in Westfield shopping centre, Shepherds Bush, west London. npower . In December last year, npower agreed to pay a £3.5million package to help vulnerable consumers following an investigation which found it had breached marketing licence conditions. Ofgem's investigation centred on the sales processes and information used by npower when customers were making decisions about whether to switch supplies to them.","Regulator said complaints rose by 30% when new IT system installed in 2011 .

"By . Mark Prigg . Jupiter’s most distinctive feature – a giant red spot bigger than Earth – is shrinking, images from the Hubble Space Telescope released today have revealed. The so-called 'Great Red Spot' is a violent storm, which in the late 1800s was estimated to be about 25,000 miles (about 40,000 km) in diameter – wide enough for three Earths to fit side by side. The storm, which is the biggest in the solar system, appears as a deep red orb surrounded by layers of pale yellow, orange and white. Scroll down for video . Jupiter and the The Great Red Spot in 2014, left; in 1995, top right; 2009, center right; and  2014, bottom right. Nasa says Jupiter's signature Great Red Spot is on a cosmic diet, shrinking rapidly before our eyes. The spot is actually a violent storm. The biggest in the solar system, it appears as a deep red orb surrounded by layers of pale yellow, orange and white. Winds inside the storm have been measured at several hundreds of miles per hour, NASA astronomers said . Winds inside the storm have been measured at several hundreds of miles per hour, NASA astronomers said. By the time NASA’s Voyager space probes flew by in 1979 and 1980, the spot was down to about 14,500 miles (22,500 km) across. Now, new pictures taken by the Earth-orbiting Hubble space telescope show Jupiter's red spot is smaller than it has ever been, measuring just under 10,250 miles (16,100 kilometers) in diameter. It also appears more circular in shape. Scientists aren’t sure why the Great Red Spot is shrinking by about 621 miles (1,000 km) a year. 'It is apparent that very small eddies are feeding into the storm. 'These may be responsible for the accelerated change by altering the (storm’s) internal dynamics,' Amy Simon, an astronomer with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in a statement. Simon and colleagues plan follow-up studies to try to figure out what is happening in Jupiter’s atmosphere that is draining the storm of energy and causing it to shrink. These two frames of composit images taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft show the same cloud patterns on Jupiter both in natural color (left) and in a false-color combination (right) selected to show differences in the clouds' height. The white spots in the right frame are storms high in the atmosphere. Beginning in 2012, amateur observations revealed a noticeable increase in the rate at which the spot is shrinking -- by 580 miles per year -- changing its shape from an oval to a circle. 'In our new observations it is apparent very small eddies are feeding into the storm,' said Simon. 'We hypothesized these may be responsible for the accelerated change by altering the internal dynamics and energy of the Great Red Spot.'","Spot is a violent storm .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Outspoken MP George Galloway has left hospital with severe bruising after he was punched repeatedly in the face and called 'Hitler' in a west London street attack, says spokesman. The Respect MP for Bradford West was posing for pictures in Notting Hill when he was 'leapt on' and assaulted last night by a man yelling comments about the Holocaust. He has been receiving death threats and hate mail after calling for Bradford to be 'declared an Israel-free zone' three weeks ago, according to his spokesman. Scroll down for video . MP George Galloway was taken to hospital for a suspected broken jaw after being attacked . The Respect Party tweeted this along with the picture of a battered and bruised George Galloway at 2am . He said: 'George was posing for pictures with people and this guy just attacked him, leapt on him and started punching him and calling him Hitler. 'It appears to be connected with his comments about Israel because the guy was shouting about the Holocaust. 'He has been receiving a huge amount of death threats and hate mail since saying this.' Police arrested a 39-year-old man on suspicion of assault and he remains in police custody. The spokesman did not know whether the attacker was an Israeli, an EDL-supporter or had some other motivation for attacking the Bradford West MP. They said Mr Galloway had described himself as being 'in a pretty bad shape'. The MP had been posing for pictures with residents in Notting Hill, west London, when the attack took place . The incident took place on Golborne Road, Notting Hill, when Mr Galloway was posing for photos . The Respect MP was interviewed earlier this month by West Yorkshire Police following a speech in Leeds, in which he claimed that Bradford was an Israel-free area. Mr Galloway, who campaigns in support of Palestine, made the comments at a meeting in Leeds. A clip was later posted on the video-sharing website YouTube. He told the meeting: 'We have declared Bradford an Israel-free zone. We don't want any Israeli goods; we don't want any Israeli services; we don't want any Israeli academics coming to the university or the college. We don't even want any Israeli tourists to come to Bradford even if any of them had thought of doing so. 'We reject this illegal, barbarous, savage state that calls itself Israel – and you have to do the same.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman said police were called to the scene of Mr Galloway's attack at around 7.40pm. 'Officers attended the scene. The suspect, a 39-year-old man, was found a short time later and stopped by police. 'He was arrested on suspicion of assault (ABH) and taken to a south London police station and subsequently transferred to a west London police station. 'The victim of the assault was taken to a central London hospital for treatment to his injuries. He was discharged from hospital this morning, The 39-year-old man remains in police custody.' Mr Galloway, who campaigns in support of Palestine, was attacked after the assailant made a comment about the Holocaust, his spokesman said . George Galloway, 60, has attracted intense controversy since the early years of his political career. He was  first elected as a Labour Party MP in 1987 representing Glasgow Hillhead. But he faced an almost immediate scandal that earned him the nickname 'Gorgeous George'. When asked about a conference in Mykonos, he replied: 'I travelled and spent lots of time with people in Greece, many of whom were women, some of whom were known carnally to me. I actually had sexual intercourse with some of the people in Greece.' This placed him on all the front pages and the executive committee of his local party passed a vote of no confidence in him in February 1988. In 1994 he was vilified after meeting Saddam and being shown on television telling the Iraqi leader: 'Sir, I salute your courage, your strength and your indefatigability.' He attracted more favourable headlines in 1998 when he set up the Mariam Appeal to fly young Iraqi leukaemia sufferer Mariam Hamza to Britain for treatment. But he was expelled from the Labour Party in October 2003 in the wake of his outspoken comments on the Iraq war. Labour chairman Ian McCartney said he, 'incited foreign forces to rise up against British troops'. In December 2004, Mr Galloway was awarded £150,000 in libel damages from the Daily Telegraph over articles published in April 2003 claiming he had received money from Saddam Hussein's regime. He became a leading member of Respect Party in 2004 and was elected as the MP for Bethnal Green and Bow at the general election the following year. At the start of 2006, Mr Galloway's appearance on reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother introduced him to a whole new generation. Not many can forget the sight of him licking milk out of the lap of actress Rula Lenska pretending to be a cat during the show, but many would like to. In 2008, Mr Galloway was pelted with a rubber stress ball as he was campaigning on an open-top bus in London. The firebrand politician received medical treatment but was not taken to hospital. He unsuccessfully contested the seat of Poplar and Limehouse in 2010, but returned as a Westminster MP following the Bradford West by-election in March 2012. Galloway won with a 10,140 majority, claiming 'the most sensational victory in British political history'. He shocked an Oxford University audience by refusing to debate with an opponent because he was Israeli in February 2013. A man, aged in his fifties,  was stabbed and killed a few streets away from where George Galloway was assaulted on the same night. Police were called to Portobello Road, Notting Hill, at 11.49 last night, just a few hours after the outspoken MP was attacked. The man was treated by London Ambulance Service, but died at the scene an hour later. A murder investigation has been launched and a post-mortem  will be held in due course. Police believe they know the identity of the deceased, but are awaiting formal identification. Officers from the Homicide and Major Crime Command are leading the investigation into the murder and there have not been any arrests. Anyone with information that may assist the investigation should call the incident room on 020 8785 8963. To remain anonymous call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Bradford West is the fourth constituency to have Mr Galloway for its MP. The politician was expelled from the Labour Party in 2003 over his stance on Iraq, but made a comeback with the Respect Party at the 2005 general election in Bethnal Green and Bow.

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Supermarkets, football clubs, airports and major utilities companies are still using costly 08 numbers two months after they were banned. Fair Telecoms Campaign has named and shamed hundreds of companies dragging their feet over the new rules, including National Rail, Heathrow Airport, Lidl and Tottenham Hotspur. New regulations came into force on June 13 this year, prohibiting use of numbers not charged at the 'basic rate' for contact from consumers. Scroll down for video . Fair Telecoms Campaign has named and shamed hundreds of companies  still using costly 08 numbers . Calls to all numbers beginning 07, 08 and 09 are not charged at the 'basic rate', as special charges are imposed, so companies have been told to offer 01, 02 or 03 numbers. Dave Hickson from the Fair Telecoms Campaign said: 'We want to get rid of these numbers once and for all.' Consumer watchdog Which? said that people should not be expected to pay a premium to ask a question or complain. Executive Director Richard Lloyd said: 'If they haven't already all companies and public bodies should now do the right thing by consumers and drop high rate numbers without delay.' The 084 and 087 lines can cost up to 15p a minute from a landline and 41p from mobile phones. Most leading firms including Sky and Morrisons have switched to basic rate 03 numbers, which are normally included in phone users' monthly calls allowance. Any company which fails to comply with the new law and still offers a premium-rate number for their customer service line will be putting themselves at risk of court action. Customers will be within their rights to take such companies to court and successfully reclaim the excessive charges made to them. Trading Standards are also able to get involved in bringing companies to justice. A Gatwick spokesman said: 'Gatwick Airport does not charge the premium rate from its side when customers call our main customer contact number. To this end, we will be adding a voicemail up-front so passengers are aware that they will only be charged the basic rate from a landline.' A Tottenham Hotspur FC spokesman said: 'All of our phone lines tariffs are in line with the new legal requirements, with the charges for our 0844 numbers being dependent on the callers 'personal call plan with their Telecoms or mobile supplier and up to a maximum of 10 pence per minute from a landline.

Despite plenty of celebrity . billionaire interest, 80-year-old Mr Sterling is still refusing to sell the team he bought for just $12 million in 1982, signalling a . lengthy and costly legal battle with the NBA. Earlier this week Clippers president Andy Roeser took an indefinite leave of absence as the league prepared to force a sale. A spokesman for the National Basketball Association said Mr Roeser's departure from the club after 30 years would allow a new executive to 'begin on a clean slate'. However the forced sale of the Clippers will require the approval of at least 21 owners of the NBA's other 28 clubs - and could even then still be opposed by Mr Sterling in court.

At the end of last month, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced a lifetime suspension and a $2.5million fine for Mr Sterling after audio recordings of him making racist comments came to light. In the recorded conversations he could be heard telling his female friend V. Stiviano not to bring black friends to Clippers games or post photographs of herself with black people on Instagram. 'We stand together in condemning Mr. Sterling's views... They simply have no place in the NBA,' Silver said in a press conference to announce the lifetime ban. The punishment is believed to be one of the most severe ever imposed on the owner of a professional sports team. Based in celebrity-packed LA, the Clippers have no shortage of famous admirers. And since the NBA announcement that it is preparing to force the sale of the basketball team, many of their well-known fans have been linked with the purchase of the club. Earlier this week Canadian pop star Justin Bieber emerged as a potential candidate to lead a consortium that also includes boxer Floyd Mayweather and retired LA Lakers star Earvin 'Magic' Johnson. Who will it be? Canadian pop star Justin Bieber (left) and rapper P Diddy (right) are among the many well-known names thought to be interested in purchasing the LA Clippers . Mayweather isn't the only boxer allegedly hoping to grab a piece of the Clippers, however. LA-born Oscar De La Hoya recently came out publically to announce he wants a piece of the franchise. 'To be an owner of an LA-based team would be a dream come true,' he told NBC4. Also in the mix is the billionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso, who is understood to be putting together his own consortium to purchase the Clippers. 'Whether it’s me or somebody else, clearly there needs to be new ownership,' he told the LA Times. Other big names linked to the purchase include the rappers Sean Combs, commonly known as P Diddy or Puff Daddy, and Rick Ross. In the aftermath of Sterling's suspension, both men took to Twitter to state their interest in buying the club. 'I will always be a Knicks fan, but I am a business man. #DiddyBuyTheClippers #NameYourPrice',' said Combs, who is believed to be worth $700million.

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Associated Press Reporter . NFL officials sparked outrage Thursday when it was revealed star Baltimore running back Ray Rice would receive just a two-game suspension after punching his then-fiancee so hard she lost consciousness. Rice is seen in surveillance footage dragging a limp Janay Palmer from the Revel casino elevator in Atlantic City last February. He's since entered a treatment program and the two are said to be in counseling. However, the NFL's announcement surprised many since other players have faced far worse punishments, often for non-violent offenses. Scroll down for video...

Rice will miss the season opener against AFC North champion Cincinnati on Sept. 7 and the Sept. 11 game on Thursday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The 27-year-old Rice has been accepted into a diversion program, which upon completion could lead to the charges being expunged. As part of his announcement Thursday afternoon, NFL Commissioner Goodell told Rice: . 'I believe that you are sincere in your desire to learn from this matter and move forward toward a healthy relationship and successful career.'

Rice met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last month after joining the diversion program. Goodell ultimately decided to suspend the running back for two games without pay and fine him an additional game check 'for conduct detrimental to the NFL in violation of the league's Personal Conduct Policy.' Goodell also wrote, 'Despite the court's decision not to impose criminal punishment, the Commissioner determined, as he advised Rice, that the conduct was incompatible with NFL policies and warranted disciplinary action.

"By . Aap . Des Campbell leaves NSW Supreme Court in Sydney in April 2010 . Wife killer Des Campbell has lost his bid to overturn his conviction almost four years to the day that he was sentenced for murder. Campbell was jailed for at least 24 years in September 2010 after he was found guilty of murdering his wife Janet Campbell, 49, by pushing her off a 50-metre cliff in the Royal National Park, south of Sydney, in March 2005. The former policeman, soldier and paramedic claimed his wife accidentally fell during their camping trip after leaving their tent to go to the toilet. But the crown said Campbell preyed on the somewhat naive middle-aged country woman and six months after they were secretly married, killed her to get her money. Earlier this year Campbell appealed the conviction on four grounds, including that the 'prejudicial' evidence of controversial retired physics professor Rod Cross should not have been allowed. Associate Professor Cross was also used by the crown during the trial of Gordon Wood, who was convicted of spear-throwing his girlfriend Caroline Byrne off The Gap in Sydney in 1995. This conviction was later overturned on appeal in 2012 with the court finding that Assoc Prof Cross's crucial evidence was unsophisticated and lacking impartiality. On Monday, the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal found there had also been a miscarriage of justice in relation to Assoc Prof Cross's evidence at Campbell's trial. But Chief Justice Tom Bathurst dismissed the other three grounds of the appeal, saying Campbell's conduct during the fatal camping trip and his behaviour before and after his wife's death meant he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Campbell deliberately pushed her off the cliff. Campbell was jailed for at least 24 years in September 2010 after he was found guilty of murdering his wife Janet Campbell (pictured), 49, by pushing her off a 50-metre cliff in the Royal National Park, south of Sydney, in March 2005 . The former policeman, soldier and paramedic claimed his wife accidentally fell during their camping trip after leaving their tent (pictured) to go to the toilet . Campbell, he said, had 'little or no affection' for his wife, had described her in derogatory terms to others, had taken steps to conceal their marriage and did not attend her funeral. Therefore he said no 'substantial injustice' was caused by the erroneous admission of Assoc Prof Cross's evidence and that Campbell's appeal should be dismissed. During his trial, the jury heard Campbell was a debt-riddled Casanova who, by the time his wealthy wife died, had gained $255,000 from the marriage and expected a further $127,000 to follow after her death.

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . In every pair of siblings there is always a good one and a bad one, and it seems the same is true of bear cubs. Wildlife photographer Greg Harvey, 43, captured one male brown bear cub picking on his sister while he was on a visit to Alaska. Mr Harvey, who lives in Alberta, Canada, says: 'I could see the male tormenting the female every chance he got. How rude: A male brown bear cub appears to stick his tongue out at his sister after the pair were pictured play fighting with each other in Alaska . Wildlife photographer Greg Harvey, 43, said the male cub kept picking on his sister, and even bit her on the backside after chasing her . Mr Harvey said the female cub was rarely the aggressor and even ran to her mother for safety after her brother kept on biting her . 'While she held her own, she was rarely the aggressor and from time to time would get mad at her brother and would try to hide  by cuddling  her mom.' 'When she had enough she tried to run away, but the little boy wasn't having any of that. He chased after her and bit her on the bum.' The brown bear cubs are only 15-months-old and eager to play with each other; however it seems the brother bear often takes it a little too far. Mr Harvey estimates that the two cubs were only 15 months old when he photographed them in 2011, and were still keen on playing together . The misbehaving male brown bear climbs on the back of his long-suffering sister in Alaska as photographer Greg Harvey captured images . Mr Harvey said he likes anthropomorphic images, in which the animals seem to be carrying out human actions suck as sticking their tongues out . Mr Harvey, a self-taught photographer, said: 'The funny thing about anthropomorphism is it can happen at any time. People often ask about the story behind the images. Truthfully, the stories of any interest are normally what happens behind the scenes in a strange country. 'A brown bear cub wets his lips or tastes the air, and it looks like he is sticking his tongue out at his sister because of her body language as she cuddles up to her mom. I enjoy anthropomorphic images and am over the moon when I am lucky enough to acquire these kinds of images.' The photographer explained that many of his colleagues are in the field taking pictures up to 200 days per year. He added: 'I have to find a way to compete with them with only 14 days on safari per year.' Unlike many of his colleagues who can spend up to 200 days in the field every year, Mr Harvey only spends 14 days on safari . While these young bear cubs are small, they will eventually weigh up to 700lbs as adults, eat up to 90lb of food each day and measure up to 8ft long .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott for MailOnline . A new mother who went into labor just as July's 4th Hurricane Arthur left her stranded from the nearest hospital, has told her story. Wendy Garcia was already two weeks overdue with her first child when the treacherous storm - and her labor pains - hit her hometown of Roanoke Island Manteo, North Carolina; forcing the only route to hospital, a main highway overpass, underwater. 'It looked like waves in there,' Mrs Garcia told Today. 'It looked bad.' Stranded: Wendy Garcia, already two weeks overdue, went into labor just as July 4th's Hurricane Arthur hit her hometown of Roanoke Island Manteo, North Carolina, where she was cut off from the mainland . Perhaps they should have called him North West? Wendy's son Mialan is now two months old . Because she was so overdue, doctors had advised Mrs Garcia to rush to hospital if she felt 'any pains at all,' she told The Outer Banks Voice. Her contractions kicked in at 4am on Friday July 4, just as the hurricane was hurtling towards shore from the sea. 'The pains were so bad I couldn't stand it anymore and so my mom decided to drive me to the hospital,' she said. Once they reached the flooded overpass, which had been blocked by police, an ambulance was called to the scene. As soon as it arrived, however, it was clear amid the howling winds and gushing water that crossing would be impossible. Happy family: Wendy poses with her son Mialan and the boy's father . Flooded: The only route to hospital was a main highway overpass (pictured), which was dangerously waterlogged, and which the ambulance they had summoned couldn't cross . From there, a five-ton 'military-type' truck was summoned, which was just high enough to navigate the waterlogged overpass. Too high, however, for Mrs Garcia to reach; heavily pregnant and standing at only 4ft 11in tall. In the end, she scaled the back of a first responder and scrambled into the truck, which sped off before she could even tell whether her husband Eduardo had joined her. He had, and by the time they finally reached the hospital, the story was already circulating and the media had beat them to it. To the rescue: A five-ton 'military-type' truck (pictured) was then summoned, which was just high enough to navigate the gushing water, if a little tricky for Mrs Garcia to climb up into at only 4ft 11in tall . Happy ending: Mrs Garcia reached hospital safely and after a 14-hour labor, gave birth to Mialan at 6.30am the following morning. Pictured, the truck crossing the overpass (top) and the stranded ambulance (far right) 'The doctor comes in and he's like, ""Do you know you're famous?""' Mrs Garcia told Today. 'And I'm like, ""why?""' Mrs Garcia had more important things to concern herself with, of course: the difficult 14-hour labor that lay ahead of her. Her son Mialan was born at 6.30am on Saturday July 5, weighing in at a healthy 7.7lbs. 'The first time they put him on top of me, he looked at me, and I looked at him, and it was the best part ever,' she recalls. New mother: Mrs Garcia couldn't be happier with her first child (pictured) - 'The first time they put him on top of me, he looked at me, and I looked at him, and it was the best part ever,' she recalls . The crossing: Hurricane Arthur forced water up to where this man is standing, several feet above its normal levels (pictured) Mrs Garcia adds that this wasn't Mialan's first brush with bad weather. She had her very first ultrasound the day of a huge January snow storm. 'We’ll have lots of stories to tell him when he’s big about storms and his birth,' she told OuterBanksVoice. Perhaps they should have called him North West.","Wendy Garcia went into labor just as the hurricane hit Manteo, North Carolina .

"By . Madlen Davies for MailOnline . Mr John Ward, 50, turned up at hospital expecting minor surgery on his thumb when a plastic surgeon told him he  needed surgery for cancer on his nose . A patient going into hospital thinking he was scheduled to have a thumb operation was shocked to discover he had cancer. John Ward, 50, went to Blackpool Victoria Hospital in July to sign permission forms for the procedure to remove a lump developed on his thumb. But a mix-up meant he turned up to the appointment and was told by a consultant the operation was to remove the skin cancer on his nose. Mr Ward thought the mole on his nose, which he didn't believe to be cancerous, had been dealt with when it was cut out in April and claims he wasn't told it was being sent off for a biopsy. When he arrived at the hospital expecting minor surgery on his thumb, he was given the news that he needed surgery to remove a rodent ulcer, a form of cancer which if left for years, can eventually erode the skin. ‘The surgeon just kept on saying he was going to remove the cancer,’ Mr Ward said. ‘I told him I didn't know what he was talking about.’ ‘I couldn't cope with it; it was a shock. I told him to stop saying the word cancer and just said I had to leave. It pushed me over the edge.’ He left in shock without receiving any treatment, but says he has now has lost trust in the doctors charged with treating him. ‘I left without having any procedure,' he said. 'And I'm still waiting to hear from them about any treatment I need. ‘Now I just don't trust them and I don't want them touching my nose.’ he added. Former construction worker Mr Ward, from Bispham, Lancashire, said he previously asked for the mole, which had developed six years earlier, to be removed when it became itchy. He complained   to Virgin Healthcare, responsible for dermatology care at the hospital, and was told a letter was sent to his home informing him about the cancerous growth. Mr Ward claims he never received the letter, which he was told made reference to a ‘skin cancer meeting’. Scroll down for video . Virgin Healthcare, who run dermatology services at Blackpool Victoria Hospital (pictured above) where Mr Ward was treated, said they sent him a letter informing him about a 'skin cancer meeting', but Mr Ward claims he never received it and wasn't contacted about the cancer by any other means . He said he felt disappointed he wasn't contacted as a matter of urgency. ‘No-one phoned me about this or called me in at all,’ he said, adding he would have acted immediately had he received the letter. ‘I had an appointment with [my dermatologist] two days after this letter was meant to have been sent, and he didn't mention the fact that I had cancer at all.’ A spokesperson for the Blackpool Dermatology Service said: ‘We are unable to comment on the specifics of Mr Ward's case, however, all biopsies are sent for pathology assessment in line with clinical best practice. ‘Following pathology testing we update all patients on their results in the most appropriate way depending on the specifics of their condition. ‘Any patients who are found to have a cancerous growth on their skin, that is a squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, are informed personally by a clinician in safest, quickest and most sensitive way possible.’ Virgin Healthcare was unable to confirm whether Mr Ward had been contacted about the cancer ahead of the letter. Blackpool Victoria Hospital told MailOnline all dermatology services on their premises are operated by Virgin Healthcare. There are two main types of skin cancer, melanoma and non-melanoma. A basal skin carcinoma is a non-melanoma skin cancer, and is the most common form of the disease. It accounts for 80 per cent of all cases in the UK.The cancer is often refered to as 'rodent ulcers'. The commonest cause of a basal cell carcinoma is too much exposure to UV light from the sun or sunbeds. There are two types of skin cancer, pictured, melanoma and non-melanoma . They can occur anywhere on the body, but are most common in areas exposed to the sun, including your face, head, neck and ears.BCC mainly affect fair-skinned adults and are more common in men than women. Those at highest risk are: . Most are painless, and often first appear as a scab that bleeds and does not fully heal. Some BCCs are very superficial and look like a scaly red flat mark, others have a pearl-like rim surrounding a central crater. If left for years, the latter, can erode the skin causing an ulcer. BCCs can be cured in almost every case. Source: British Skin Foundation .","John Ward, 50, thought he was going to a hospital appointment to have a lump removed from his thumb .

"By . Sally Lee . Housemates of a Peeping Tom are fearful their landlord may strike again if he isn't punished and locked up in jail for filming them secretly in their bathroom. Tristan Wootton was sentenced a minimum two years behind bars last December for installing an elaborate hidden-camera system in an air vent of his home, which he then shared with two other females. But the Central Coast electrician, from north of Sydney, is trying avoid jail time by appealing for his sentence to be reduced to home detention. Tristan Wootton installed a small camera in the ceiling air vent of his bathroom . Victims Amy (left) and Natina (right) believe the Central Coast electrician, north of Sydney, should be locked up . The ironically camera-shy landlord ran from A Current Affair when he was questioned for his shameful actions. Victims Amy and Natina feel violated and traumatised by the whole ordeal. 'You feel disgusted, you think that it'll never happen to you but it does,' Natina told A Current Affair. The palm-size camera was found by Amy in the bathroom ceiling. When she called police, they then discovered the cables led to Wootton's garage. She says Wootton should suffer behind bars - where he belongs. The palm-size camera was set up inside a ceiling air vent in the bathroom used by two female housemates . Police later found the elaborate spy camera system led to Wootton's garage . 'He needs to have his rights taken away from him like I had mine,' Amy said. 'He needs to be taught a lesson and home detention is not going to teach him anything.' Amy says she hasn't been able to move on with her life. 'I need to put this behind me and I need him to be put away for that to happen,' she said. While Wootton has been convicted for the crime, he is currently out on bail and the District Court judge has ordered that he be assessed for home detention suitability. 'I would be pleading to the judge about how he would deal with this situation if it was his family member, his daughter, his niece, his mother or his wife,' Amy said. A decision is expected to be handed down in November.","Tristan Wootton installed a small camera in the ceiling air vent of his bathroom .

"By . James Salmon, Daily Mail Banking Correspondent . You might have hoped Britain’s scandal-hit banks would be offering a more sympathetic ear to unhappy customers. But a damning report published today by the Financial Ombudsman Services show customers are being ‘industrially processed’ like ‘numbers’, and seeing a growing number of legitimate complaints rejected by their bank. The Ombudsman handles complaints when they have been rejected by a bank or other financial company. Ombudsman's latest figures show most of the big banks are taking an increasingly hard line on complaints, with HSBC replacing Barclays as the worst offender . Its latest figures show most of the big banks are taking an increasingly hard line on complaints, with HSBC replacing Barclays as the worst offender. The Ombudsman said it received 12,429 complaints about the High Street giant and upheld 78 per cent in favour of the customer. This compares with an uphold rate of 46 per cent in the second half of last year. The same pattern can be seen at Lloyds, with the Ombudsman upholding 66 per cent of 30,768 complaints about the state backed lender in the first half. This compares with 54 per cent in the second half of last year. The ‘uphold rate’ with Royal Bank of Scotland complaints also increased from 33 per cent to 38 per cent. Barclays was the only big bank to show an improvement although it still has one of the worst records. The Ombudsman upheld 66 per cent of complaints about the banking giant, although this was a fall from 77 per cent. Chief ombudsman Caroline Wayman said: ‘We’re seeing more and more people turn to us in frustration where they deal their bank of insurer simply doesn’t understand or really care. And we’re hearing growing dis-satisfaction from people about being processed industrially as a number rather than being listened to as an individual customer.’ Last night one MP accused banks of ‘cynically offloading’ complaints on the Ombudsman to save money. The ‘uphold rate’ with Royal Bank of Scotland complaints also increased from 33 per cent to 38 per cent . Mark Garnier, a Conservative member of the influential Treasury Select Committee said: ‘These figures suggest banks are still cynically offloading responsibility for handling complaints to the Financial Ombudsman because it’s cheaper than doing it themselves.’ The Ombudsman received 191,129 new cases about financial firms in the first six months of the year – down from 248,801 in the second half of last year. This was mainly due to a fall in disputes about Payment Protection Insurance, which still account for seven in ten disputes the Ombudsman deals with. But banking complaints – which include grievances about credit cards, overdrafts and customer service - jumped 7 per cent from 23,088 to 24,724. The proportion of complaints upheld by the Ombudsman is often seen as a more reliable gauge of how banks treat their customers today. Overall the Ombudsman upheld 57 per cent of complaints about banks and other financial companies in the first half of the year, up from 51 per cent.. The figures from the Ombudsman come just days after City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority revealed it had ordered banks to re-open 2.5 million old PPI complaints that it believes may have been rejected unfairly. Banks are also being forced to contact another two million ‘high risk’ customers that it believes may have been mis-sold PPI. An HSBC spokesman said: ‘We work hard to ensure all of our customers receive a high level of service, but we know we don’t always get things right. Over past twelve months we have made a number of changes in response to the issues our customers have raised in their comments and complaints.’ If you're fed up with your bank there are plenty of reasons why now is a good time to switch to another provider.

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . St John Ambulance have said lawyer Alan Blacker is not a member of their Order and they've reported him to the police . A lawyer accused by a judge of looking like a character from Harry Potter is being investigated over claims he pinned fake medals to his court robes. Judge David Wynn Morgan tore into solicitor-advocate Alan Blacker for wearing a set of ceremonial St John Ambulance medals sewn onto his barrister's gown during a trial at Cardiff Crown Court. But it emerged today that Blacker is not a member of the Order of St John and the ambulance charity has reported him to police. Keith Dunn OBE, Chief Executive for St John in Wales, said: 'We would like to confirm that Lord Harley - Alan Blacker - is not a member of the Order of St John. 'His name does not appear on the roles of the Priory for Wales or England and he is therefore not a member of our Order. 'He is not entitled to say that he is a Knight of the Order of St John and the dignities that appertain to being a Knight of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem. 'We have asked the Chief Constable for South Wales Police to investigate this matter and St John will be taking legal action if necessary.' Mr Blacker, 42, wore his medals on brightly coloured ribbons while representing a minibus driver accused of causing the death of a cyclist. After the case, Judge David Wynn Morgan slammed legal advocate Mr Blacker, who it is said bears a striking resemblance to Harry Potter character, Hagrid. Judge Morgan told him: 'If you want look like something out of Harry Potter you can forget coming to this court ever again. 'I have been practising in these courts since 1978 and I have never seen a barrister or solicitor appear before these courts wearing a medal or with badges sewn onto his gown. 'If you ever appear before this court again dressed as you are I shall exercise my right to decline to hear you.' Barrister Mr Blacker goes by the full name of Dr The Right Honourable The Lord Harley of Counsel of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. Alan Blacker (pictured, left) says his 'bona fides are beyond reproach' after he was given a dressing down over his courtroom clothing by judge Judge David Wynn Morgan (right) Mr Blacker, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, explained he earned the title Lord Harley by inheriting an ancient Irish peerage from his father and was a fully qualified solicitor advocate allowed to wear the robes of a barrister. Judge Morgan questioned who gave him permission to wear the medals and ribbons on his gown. Mr Blacker told the judge 'Lord Chief Justice Thompson' had told him it would be 'appropriate' to do so. But Judge Morgan replied: 'Since I started practicing in 1978 there has been no Lord Chief Justice of England or Wales by the name of Lord Thompson.' Outside the court Mr Blacker said he pinned medals and ribbons to his gown to make himself appear more qualified in front of a jury. He said: 'The medals are there to balance the playing field. My medals were awarded to me - they may be for voluntary medical service but they bear the face of the Queen. They are not some poxy swimming badge.' A judge tore into legal advocate Alan Blacker (left) who, it has been suggested, bears a similarity to Hagrid in the Harry Potter films (right) He added: 'They are very discreet and are there for when I appear in superior courts - it has never been an issue before.' Mr Blacker said he represented people who cannot afford representation and often received little or no payment for his services. He added: 'My reputation is widely known. I come from Lancashire, I speak with a Lancashire accent and work with Lancashire folk - I am nothing special.' Mr Blacker's client, minibus driver Andrzej Wojcicki, 45, was jailed for five years after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. Polish-born Wojcicki was looking at photographs on his mobile phone when he collided with cyclist Owain James, 30, at Newbridge, South Wales.","Alan Blacker had sewn ceremonial medals and colourful ribbons on gown .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Dale Wynne, 55, from Five Roads, near Llanelli, West Wales, died on the A370 at Bristol . A boyfriend died after crashing the BMW convertible which he had bought for his girlfriend as a surprise present. Dale Wynne, from Five Roads, near Llanelli, West Wales, was driving on the A370 Long Ashton bypass near Bristol when the sports car came off the road. It smashed through trees and a large sign before landing on its roof. Mr Wynne was prounounced dead at the scene. The 55-year-old had been doing up the car since February for Gillian Birthwright, 45, his partner of eight years. He was taking it for a test drive when the crash took place. He was never able to give Ms Birthwright the surprise present. She said: 'When I got the call I didn't believe it as his car was with me, but it turns out he had bought the BMW in February and may have been doing it up for me as he knew I liked fast cars. 'He had been an undertaker and dealt with many car crashes so was always a really careful driver. 'He was my world and meant everything to me. I have no idea how I will carry on without him.' Mr Wynne worked in Bristol during the week as a building facilities manager but his girlfriend said they would speak ten times a day. The couple had been due to move into a new house together the day after he died. They shared a passion for abandoned pets and worked in their spare time to rehome dogs. The father-of-two had helped save 160 pets during his life, working alongside Ms Birthwright. She said: 'He was always bubbly, with a great sense of humour. He was just a jolly chap, with a twinkle in his eye. 'He looked after me so well and this has left me devastated. It still hasn't fully sunk in. Mr Wynne, who was restoring up the car for his girlfriend Gillian Birthwright, is pictured above, reportedly at his home in Five Roads, Carmarthenshire . He died on the A370 near Bristol, pictured, where he worked during the week as a building facilities manager . 'We laughed together, every day, and would shed tears together too. He was much-loved and will be sorely missed.' Mr Wynne loved country singing and had travelled around Britain performing when he was younger. The couple moved to Five Roads two-and-a-half years ago where they quickly got into re-homing abandoned dogs. Mr Wynne leaves behind children Ryan and Trish, and Gillian's children Michael and Sheryl and her grandchildren Katie and Amie.","Dale Wynne, 55, was doing up the car for his partner Gillian Birthwright, 45 .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . New footage has emerged showing Joran van der Sloot, the prime suspect in the disappearance of American teen Natalee Holloway, in his Peruvian maximum-security prison. In one shot, the 27-year-old Dutch national, who has gone on hunger strike to protest the conditions in the prison, shows off his new Mohawk hairstyle and beard as he explains he is filming 'for my own security'. Another scene on the video, which was released by Reuters on Tuesday, shows him being patted down by guards against a wall and having his blood pressure tested. The footage is from inside the Challapalca Maximum Security Prison, near the Bolivian border, where van der Sloot was sent  10 days ago after allegedly threatening a guard for confiscating his phone. Scroll down for video . Locked up: Van der Sloot, who is protesting against the conditions in the prison, said in the newly-released footage that he is filming 'for my own security'.

Surveillance: In another shot, a medic checks his blood pressure as van der Sloot stays silent . Last week, he reportedly went on hunger strike to protest conditions,NBC reported as it shared the video. He is serving a 28-year sentence after admitting to the murder of Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old Peruvian business student in 2010. He was also the last person seen with Alabama high school student Natalee Holloway, who vanished while on a graduation trip to Aruba in 2005. No charges have been filed against him in the case. Van der Sloot is expected to remain in prison until 2038 and then be extradited to the U.S. to face charges of extortion and fraud for allegedly falsely promising to lead Holloway's mother to the girl's body in exchange for payment.

The teenager's body has never been found. In July, the killer married his heavily-pregnant Peruvian, Leidy Figueroa, girlfriend in a prison ceremony. The couple met in prison, where Figueroa, a trained accountant with a young son from a previous relationship, sells candy and cigarettes to inmates. 'They became friends and spent a lot of time together in his cell,' his attorney Maximo Altez told CNN. 'Unlike the United States, here in Peru, loved ones or relatives can see inmates inside their jails.' Prison officials prohibited video and photos during their midday nuptials and none of the groom's relatives attended, Altez said.

Van der Sloot told his bride that when he gets out of prison, 'I want to marry you again,' and she told him the same,' said John Barrera, who officiated the wedding. Figueroa is due to give birth to Van der Sloot's child in September. All prisoners at the penitentiary are allowed conjugal visits, explaining Figueroa's pregnancy. She told CBS News' Crimesider earlier this year that she usually visits Van der Sloot twice a week and brings him home-cooked meals.

'Anyone who has seen them since Tuesday August 26 or knows of their present whereabouts is asked to contact Pollok police office on 101.' David Hauberts, eight, and his four-year-old brother Danius, four, disappeared with their mother at about 4pm . Nine-month-old Zana Hauberts (pictured) was wearing a white dress with a Minnie Mouse on it and a pink cardigan when she went missing. The family are believed to have been travelling to Blackburn in Lancashire . The family were last seen on Brockburn Road, in the Pollok area of Glasgow (circled) and were believed to be travelling to Blackburn in Lancashire (circled below). Police say they have been unable to trace them since . Miss Pikse, who also appears to spell her name Kristine, is thought to originally be from Riga, in Latvia. Her Facebook page shows dozens of pictures of herself, family and friends. Most focus on her children, with happy snaps of christenings, days out and holidays. Last night, concerned readers from across the country left messages on the Daily Mail website. SJ, from Yorkshire, said: 'Hope everything is well and there is a happy ending.' Kate, from Newcastle, wrote: 'What beautiful looking children, I hope they turn up safe and well', while Claremorris, posting from Ireland, said simply: 'Please find them!' Latest figures, from 2011-12, showed around 313,000 people were reported missing in the UK – about 280,000 in England and Wales and 33,000 in Scotland. Officers are also trying to trace a 78-year-old woman who is missing from Aberdeen. Mary Ryan was last seen at the Bus Station at Guild Street around 12.30pm on Monday. She is 5ft 4in with long, white hair which is usually tied back. When last seen, she was wearing a floral dress, blue or green cardigan and furry boots. She was carrying a shopping bag and may have been using a walking stick as an aid. It is believed that she has boarded a bus and may be in the Aberdeenshire or Moray area, possibly Elgin.","Kristina Pikse, 28, went missing with her children from Glasgow last week .

Black Rock, which covers much of Geelong, showed 17.6 doses per 1000 people on a Sunday, and 14.7 doses per 1000 on a Wednesday. Penington Institute acting CEO Wendy Dodd says the tests showed there was an issue in relation to methamphetamines. 'From the data, it has demonstrated that it's higher on weekends and it's supporting the view that there is a high proportion of occasional, recreational users,' she told Fairfax Radio. Black Rock, which covers much of Geelong, showed 17.6 doses per 1000 people on a Sunday, and 14.7 doses per 1000 on a Wednesday . The report also found that there had been more than a 250 per cent increase in the number of fatal overdoses involving methamphetamine since 2010. It also found that methamphetamine purity has risen in Victoria, from an approximately 20 per cent in 2010-2011 to more than 75 per cent in 2012-2013. A state parliamentary inquiry will release its findings into the supply and use of the drug on Wednesday, while the Victorian government has announced 11 police drug dogs will be sent across the state, including eight in major regional centres.","Waste from Melbourne Water's western treatment plant tested strongly for levels of methamphetamine, suggesting highest usage is in the CBD .

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . A nurse who was taunted for being fat when she reached nearly 15st aged 15 has beaten the bullies to become a beauty queen. Emma Day, now 19, competed in her first national pageant on Sunday after slimming down to  8st 9lb. Her night on the runway marked an incredible transformation from the former size 22 schoolgirl who was teased and even attacked by fellow pupils over her weight. Scroll down for video . Emma dropped over 6st, dropping from 15st (left at her heaviest aged 15) to a slim 8st 9lb and size eight (right) The trainee nurse, from Dewsbury, West Yorks, said she was often beaten up and even had objects thrown at her by cruel school bullies. She was so embarrassed by her size she refused to go the gym and started working out in her bedroom. When friends began noticing Emma's slimmer figure last year she decided to compete in a local beauty pageant. She went on to become Miss Teen Leeds and competed at Miss Teen Great Britain in Blackpool on Sunday. Emma, pictured age 15, used to eat twice most evenings and snacked extensively on biscuits and other treats . Emma was often beaten up and even had objects thrown at her by cruel school bullies over her size . Emma, who now weighs 8st 9lb, said: 'When I was younger I'd go to see my grandparents and have tea with them before going back home and scoffing another portion of food. 'I really loved biscuits too and I nearly always had a packet in my hand. My school years were absolutely horrific at times. 'I weighed almost 15st at my heaviest and other kids would throw stuff at me, hit me and call me all sorts of names because of my size. Originally too embarrassed to go to a gym Emma began exercising in her bedroom and the weight began to fall off (left, overweight aged 14, right, pictured now) 'I got to a point where I thought enough was enough so I bought a stack of workout DVDs and started training in my bedroom. 'After a few months people started to notice I had lost weight and it gave me a real confidence boost. 'I kept on going with the sit-ups, press-ups, running and everything else and I seriously got hooked on training. 'I'm so glad I did it and I've never looked back since.' When friends began to notice the change in her appearance they suggested Emma entered a pageant . The inspirational beauty queen, who is now a size eight, cleaned up her diet of junk food and started training for more than an hour every day in a bid to shed the pounds. Her gruelling training regime soon paid dividends and before long she found herself competing at Miss Teen UK. Since making her beauty pageant debut, Emma has gone on to claim second prize at the Face of the Globe beauty contest and cruised to victory in the Miss True Beauty event. She said: 'The first time I went up on stage at the Miss Teen UK contest was incredible. Emma cleaned up her diet of junk food and started training for an hour every day in a bid to shed the pounds . Emma was crowned Miss Teen Leeds and competed at Miss Teen Great Britain on Sunday . 'I was so nervous as I'd never done anything like that before but it gave me so much confidence that I was desperate to do it all over again. 'Being crowned Miss Teen Leeds this years was an amazing feeling and I'm hoping I can have some success at the national competition in Blackpool. 'It's just incredible to look at pictures of myself when I was 15 and then look in the mirror at how I am now. 'It took around two-and-a-half-years of really hard graft to get to where I am but it was well worth it. 'I feel like a completely new person.'","Used to secretly eat dinner at her grandparents before eating again at home .

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Three quarters of the public believe there will be a further terrorist attack on Britain - while almost one in 10 fear for their family and friends, a poll has revealed today. The revelation comes after the Prime Minister unveiled a host of anti-terror measures to target extremists in the UK yesterday. He said a terror attack on Britain was now ‘highly likely’ after the threat level was raised to ‘severe’ last week. But Mr Cameron’s proposed crackdown was thrown into disarray last night after the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted one of the key proposals could be illegal. Threee quarters of the public now believe a terror attack on the UK is 'likely', amid evidence of growing alarm over the extremist threat to Britain . While many people believe the threat to Britain has not changed, almost half the public believe it has increased . Speaking to the BBC this morning, Mr Clegg repeatedly sidestepped questions over whether stripping suspected British jihadis of their citizenship was now effectively dead in the water after blocking the proposal over fears it would break international law. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ‘It's not a question of whether I will or won't let it happen. We are not going to do something which flouts international and domestic law. We must act within the law.’ Mr Clegg’s opposition to the measure risks allowing the Conservatives to claim they are being held back from passing tougher anti-terror measures. But the Deputy Prime Minister insisted the Government ‘can square the circle’ of filling the gaps in Britain's terror laws while remaining within international obligations. It comes amid growing concern in Britain over the threat posed by Islamist extremists fighting for ISIS. A new poll released this morning for the Times newspaper revealed Britons believe the threat of terrorism has increased over the past five years. The YouGov survey found 45 per cent felt more endangered than before – with just 13 per cent saying the threat has decreased. A further four in 10 said the threat had not changed. Britons travelling abroad are ever more in danger, the public now believe. Some 67 per cent believe the threat posed to Britons overseas has increased. Just five per cent think this is not the case. David Cameron yesterday announced a raft of new measures to tackle the extremist threat to Britain, but the Lib Dems have raised concerns over whether one key proposal could be illegal . Nick Clegg visited a school in London this morning to promote the signature Lib Dem policy to provide free school meals for under sevens. The Deputy Prime Minister is at loggerheads with Mr Cameron  over plans to tighten restrictions on extremists . The public are overwhelmingly of the view that a terrorist attack on Britain is likely. Some 74 per cent think it likely there will be further attack on British citizens – compared to just 15 per cent who think it unlikely. Almost one in 10 Britons also believe there is a ‘good chance’ that their circle of friends and family are at risk.","Three quarters  believe  further terrorist attack on Britain is now 'likely'

"By . Matt Chorley, MailOnline Political Editor . Boris Johnson today launched a furious attack on a government adviser for rejecting his dream of a brand new four-runway airport in the Thames Estuary. The London Mayor said the rebuttal of his Boris Island plan meant the debate about how to increase flights capacity in and out of Britain had been set back 'by half a century', and claimed the report would simply 'gather dust on a shelf in Whitehall'. But he insisted the plan was not dead, as it emerged Sir Howard Davies's commission will now consider just three options - two additional runway plans at Heathrow and one at Gatwick. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson today accused the Airports Commission of setting the aviation debate back by a decade . Mr Johnson said his Thames Estuary plan was no more dead than 'the Channel Tunnel was dead 100 years' ago when it was first rejected' Boris Island would have seen a new four-runway hub airport built in the Thames estuary with high-speed rail links to London. The London mayor argued that, with expansion at Heathrow constrained, the idea was the only way to keep the UK competitive in terms of airport capacity. But the independent Airports Commission, which was set up to tackle the need for increased airport capacity and is led by Sir Howard, is to urge ministers to focus instead on expansion at either Heathrow or Gatwick. Pre-empting the commission's official announcement, Mr Johnson issues a strongly-worded statement condemning Sir Howard's decision to turn his back on Boris Island. Mr Johnson said: 'In one myopic stroke the Airports Commission has set the debate back by half a century and consigned their work to the long list of vertically filed reports on aviation expansion that are gathering dust on a shelf in Whitehall.' He insisted the Thames Estuary plan 'remains the only credible solution, any process that fails to include it renders itself pretty much irrelevant, and I'm absolutely certain that it is the option that will eventually be chosen'. Speaking later on his LBC radio phone-in, he condemned the idea of further expansion of Heathrow. 'With the best will in the world, expanding Heathrow is going to compound a planning error of the 1950s and 1960s; it's going to make life worse for London, it's going to make things pretty well intolerable for people in parts of the city that don't even know they're going to be under the new flight paths.' Defending his Boris Island plan, he added: 'What this lacks is not planning ability; what this lacks is political will. 'What's happened this morning is basically that Sir Howard has decided that he's simply not finding enough support in Whitehall for an idea that is as adventurous and as risky, as he puts it, as the Estuary solution.' He insisted the idea was not now dead. 'No, not at all, no more than, say, the Channel Tunnel was dead 100 years' ago when it was first rejected.' Mr Johnson wanted to see a new four-runway airport built in the Thames Estuary, which would have cost tens of billions of pounds . This artist impression by architect Lord Foster shows what a four-runway Thames Estuary airport capable of handling 150 million passengers a year would haved looked like . These are the remaining shortlisted options: . But Labour said the plan would never have got off the ground. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: 'Boris Johnson's fantasy island airport plan which would have closed Heathrow and caused longer passenger journeys has finally been dashed. 'Time and public money should never have been spent on his vanity project whose costs have been put at up to £100 billion. 'This back of a fag packet scheme was designed less for the country's economic future and more for the omnishables Mayor's political ambitions.' Dale Keller, chief executive of the Board of Airline Representatives, said: 'Airlines were never convinced that the Thames Estuary was either affordable or a convenient location for the majority of their customers. 'Since airlines and their passengers will ultimately have to pay for the development costs of the selected expansion site then the business case must stack up in order for the UK to remain globally competitive. 'We call upon Boris to support the important work of the Airports Commission and ensure that the right decisions are made about Heathrow and Gatwick.' The rejection of the estuary scheme will leave just three options - two additional runway plans at Heathrow and one at Gatwick - still on the table for consideration by the commission, which is charged with recommending where airport expansion should come. Headed by former Financial Services Authority chief Sir Howard Davies, the commission is due to make its final report to ministers in summer 2015 - after the general election. For many, the favourite option is expansion at Heathrow - an idea that has been totally rejected by Mr Johnson. The added complication for Mr Johnson is that he is now seeking the Tory 2015 general election candidacy at Uxbridge and South Ruislip - a constituency that borders on Heathrow and which contains many people who depend on the west London airport for their livelihood. Last December the commission shortlisted the Heathrow and Gatwick options and said it would look further at the estuary option while admitting that it was extremely expensive. Since then the commission has published reports showing the possible environment cost of the estuary plan. Mr Johnson's chief aviation adviser Daniel Moylan said yesterday that not short-listing the estuary option would be 'a sadly short-sighted decision but far from the end of the process'. He went on: 'Airports policy has been stalled for nearly five decades, ricocheting like a billiard ball between Heathrow and Gatwick. 'We have one opportunity to break out of that but it seems the commission has taken us back to the same old, failed choice. But the final decision will lie with the Government and a key question now is whether the commission will play much of a role in that.' An extra runway at Heathrow could spell more problems for people living under flight paths in West London . Responding to the Airport Commission's decision to rule out the inner Thames estuary option, Nathan Stower, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association (Bata), said: 'Britain needs additional runway capacity in the South East of England, but not at any price. 'With the Thames estuary option sensibly ruled out for good, the Airports Commission is free now to concentrate on scrutinising the business cases of the three shortlisted options. 'The proposals must be cost-effective and offer value for money. There needs to be a credible funding mechanism based on realistic forecasts and today's passengers must not be expected to pay for tomorrow's infrastructure.'","Boris Johnson's dream of £100billion Thames Estuary airport in tatters .

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . Running a marathon is a momentous effort for most people - a once-in-a-lifetime event to tick off the bucket list. But for Rob Young, 31, from Richmond, south London, it's a daily occurrence. He gets up at 2.45am every morning to run a whole marathon course around Richmond Park before he starts his working day as the manager of a specialist car parts company. What makes this all the more impressive is that Rob has had to overcome an incredibly abusive childhood with a father who beat him regularly, followed by a period in care homes, in order to get to this place. Rob Young taking part in one of his 367 marathons planned for this year . Until the age of six, Rob lived in Yorkshire with his mother and sister under his father's reign of terror - not even the family dog was safe from the daily violent outbursts, which saw his sister sexually abused and him thrown down stairs in a suitcase. He said: 'As a young child I was witness to some terrible things, which most people would find hard to imagine or understand. 'I was beaten pretty much every day, with anything that easily came to my father's hand. 'It could be a slipper, a stick or a plank of wood, today I still have quite a number of scars on my body from these beatings. 'Sometimes my father would zip me into a suitcase and push me down the stairs, this was one of the milder things I had to endure, though. 'The worst thing was being dangled over the banister at the top of the stairs by one leg - he used to tell me that if I made any noise at all or if I cried he would drop me.' The breaking point came one evening when Rob was six years old - his father returned home and started a bout of violence that ended with Rob being hung with a rope. He said: 'He tied a rope around my neck from which he hung me on an old-fashioned coat hanger near the front door. Happily ever after: Rob Young now lives in Richmond, south London, with his fiancée Joanna Hanasz, 26, and son Alexander-Lui Julian Young, 21 months . 'I remember the feeling of having no air to breathe and I struggled as my father held my legs, it became very scary until he decided to let me down.' Rob's mother decided that enough was enough and fled the family home with her two children in tow. Sadly, she was unable to care for them and while Rob's sister was sent to live with an aunt, he was put in a care home. What followed was an incredibly tough few years, as he struggled to make his voice heard among hundreds of other lost children while being passed from care home to care home. Rob said: 'That was very difficult, because I was lumped in there with a lot of other children, very troubled children who  were often a lot older than me, who bullied each other and who are from very disruptive backgrounds. 'The people who work in these places often don’t know how to cope and many also just see it as a job. 'The reason that a lot of these children behave the way they do is because the only way to get attention is by acting up - by getting into trouble - that’s the only way anyone will ever notice you. Rob Young runs a marathon every day and takes part in group marathons most weekends . 'I was like that too for a while, but then I remember the moment that I switched – I must have been about eight or nine years old and someone said to me: ""You’re going to turn out just like your dad."" 'It was like a switch flipped in my head, I thought: ""I’m not going to be like him, I’m never going to end up like that."" 'From then on I just decided to throw myself into school and sport. 'Around that time I had just started going to school properly, I hadn't been sent that often until then, and I really enjoyed all of the sports lessons.' The real moment of change in Rob's life came when he was around 11 years old and he was fostered by the deputy headmaster of a top private school. From that day, he was given a second chance at life - learning behavioural and academic skills that would help him to pave his way through life. He said: 'When I was in year seven, this wonderful man – a head teacher of a private school - came and took me in. 'He totally changed my life. 'He taught me everything; from how to set a table, to how to eat a six-course meal, to holding an adult conversation and helped me to get all of my exams, which include good GCSEs and A-Levels. Rob Young decided to try and run 367 marathons in 365 days while watching television with his with his fiancée Joanna Hanasz one evening earlier this year - he had never run a marathon until then . 'I think of him as my real father.' 'To this day I believe he enabled me to be the person I am today - all my best aspects derived from his tutorage.' Fast-forward more than a decade and Rob lives in Richmond with his fiancée Joanna Hanasz, 26, and his son Alexander-Lui Julian Young, 21 months. He also has a five-year-old daughter called Olivia from a previous relationship. After landing on his feet, the 31-year-old made a decision earlier this year to give something back to children who find themselves in the situation he was once in. While watching television with Joanna one evening, Rob decided to take on the humongous challenge of completing 367 marathons in 365 days. So every morning he gets out of bed at 2.45am and heads down to the marathon track at Richmond park to run 26.2 miles before heading back home to shower and change before work. And although many would struggle to find any silver lining in waking before dawn to run such a long way, unlike the rest of us, Rob can eat what he wants, whenever he wants. Rob Young takes part in so many marathons these days that he has spare energy that he uses to sing and encourage fellow runners . He said: 'People tell me that I should probably start eating a certain diet - really healthy food, but to be honest, eating what I fancy has worked for me so far. 'I just eat anything I can get my hands on really - I really like chocolate eclairs, I love Doritos, cakes, biscuits, lots of pasta, I’ll have anything really. 'I eat my recommended 2,500 calories a day and then I also have the 4,000 calories that you should eat when doing a marathon.' And the most galling part for anybody who as ever limped through a marathon, wondering if they'll ever manage to make the finishing line, is that Rob quite literally takes them in his stride these days. He said: 'They say that you have to slow down your time drastically if you are doing back-to-back marathons, so I have slowed my time to four hours. 'But four hours means that I am pretty much walking over the finish line and can go and play a game of football straight afterwards. Rob credits his 21-month-old son Alexander-Liu with helping to inspire him on the early mornings . 'I take part in official marathons regularly as well as doing the Richmond course and I like to sing and  dance to encourage other marathon runners when I’m doing those, because that keeps spirits up when people are flagging. 'I also pick up a few bottles of water at the water stations and then carry them round to other runners.' And while Rob is planning on slowing down the number of marathons he takes part in once he reaches his 367 mark, he has also jokingly tried to convince his fiancée that they should get married during one. He said: 'I did suggest to my partner that we should get married and then run a marathon, then everyone from the wedding party could run with us and we could stop for a drink and photos at the different drinks stations and have a party afterwards.' But saving that, his main aim is just to raise as much money as possible for charity. He said: 'If I can help young people in similar situations and encourage them to make peace with their pasts, then I feel something good has come out of all I have had to endure.'

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . For many, diving into a shark tank and spending hours every day among the deadly creatures would be a terrifying thought. But for one man, spending up to seven hours a day swimming with more than 10 sharks is just part of his daily work schedule. That's because Matt Martin, 35, is a professional shark tank cleaner at the Blue Planet Aquarium in Cheshire and heads up a team which takes more than 1,000 dives in the 3.4million litre tank every year. Matt Martin, 35, is a professional shark tank cleaner at the Blue Planet Aquarium in Cheshire and heads up a team which takes more than 1,000 dives in the 3.4million litre shark tank every year to carry out maintenance . Mr Martin, armed with just a wetsuit and a brush, spends up to seven hours every single day in the shark tank . He is a highly-experienced diver and has undergone rigorous training to ensure he is safe in the shark tank . With just a wet suit and a brush, Mr Martin and his team bravely spend up to seven hours a day in the depths of the tank which is home to an array of shark species including nurse, zebra, bamboo and six deadly sand tiger sharks. The biggest of them all is a sand tiger called 'Storm' who weighs a massive 650lb and is more than 12ft long. Mr Martin said: 'I was petrified of sharks as a kid mainly because of the Jaws films and they are large potentially dangerous animals. 'We wear wet suits, mainly to stop hypothermia and to prevent grazes. The way we train minimises the risk to us in the tanks. 'The times when the sharks can be potentially disruptive to our dives is during mating season, that's when there is a lot of sexual energy around and they can be unpredictable. 'Storm is the biggest shark we have, she's a sand tiger and about 300kgs and 12-feet nose to tip, and could be a bit longer. 'In the wild, there have been a fair few incidents with sand tigers responsible for attacks, mainly in shallow waters in accidents when people have irritated them or with spear fishermen. 'There's always an element of danger.' One of the biggest sharks in the tank is a Tiger shark called Storm which weighs 650lb and is more than 12ft . Mr Martin, who has worked at the aquarium for the last two years, said there is 'always an element of danger' with his job but has been trained to recognise and understand the sharks' behaviour so he knows when to stop . But Mr Martin - who has worked at the aquarium for the last two years - said rigorous training minimised the danger to him and other divers. The have all undergone a specially-adapted training plan, which takes up to six months to complete and teaches them how to dive among the animals and recognise and understand the sharks' behaviour. Blue Planet Aquarium curator David Wolfenden said each shark tank cleaner is a highly-experienced diver who has undergone specific training and medical checks. He said that while there is the potential dangerous threat to divers, the hazards are minimalised by their extensive training and the fact the sharks are used to people being in the tanks. He said: 'It can be potentially quite dangerous but if it is done properly it's actually a pretty safe job. It's all about recognising the behaviour of the sharks and knowing how to dive safely. 'The divers always have a safety diver with them and a dive supervisor at the top of the tank, as well as intercom to talk to each other. He said: 'We joke that cleaning the tank is a bit like cleaning the Forth Road Bridge, it's continually ongoing' The sharks are  said to be used to the divers and tend to go about their business without any cause for concern . 'But the sharks aren't that interested in them to be honest, the sharks are used to people being in the water. 'We have divers in there every single day. We take members of the public in there every week so there's someone in the tank pretty much all day every day. 'They get very well fed so it's not like they're going to get peckish. 'There is always the potential when you're doing that kind of job of being bitten if you're careless or if they are excitable but part of the training divers have is recognising those behaviours and knowing when to stop if necessary. 'Sometimes we do stop all diving and underwater cleaning and maintenance if the divers feel things are getting a bit lively in there.' Mr Martin added: 'We are in there for about 1,000 dives a year, we joke that cleaning the tank is a bit like cleaning the Forth Road Bridge, it's continually ongoing.'","Matt Martin, 35, spends hours cleaning shark tanks at Blue Planet Aquarium .

"By . Ashley Collman . A teen who went missing in Los Angeles in April was discovered a month later in Northern California, having been kidnapped and used as a sex slave on a marijuana farm. The Los Angeles Police Department decribed the 15-year-old girl as a runaway. They believe she was kidnapped by Ryan Balletto, 30, and his associate Patrick Pearmain, 25, and taken to their growing operation in Lake County, California. According to a criminal complaint, when the girl wasn't being used to harvest marijuana she was locked for days at a time in a 4-foot by 2-foot metal toolbox. Captors: 30-year-old Ryan Balletto, left, and 25-year-old Patrick Pearmain, right, were arrested in May after the girl they kidnapped called police, and authorities traced the call to a motel in Sacramento . Kidnapped: A girl who went missing in April in Los Angeles ended up being used as a sex slave on a marijuana farm in Northern California until she was rescued on May 1 . Prisoner: Balletto and Pearmain kept the girl locked in a 4-foot by 2-foot metal toolbox, sometimes for days at a time . Trooper: According to the criminal complaint, Balletto called the girl a 'trooper' for not screaming in the box . The toolbox had holes punched in it so she could breathe, and a blanket. Another hole was drilled into the box so they could a run a hose through it to clean out human waste without letting her out. It was spray-painted with 'an animal skull surrounding the shadow image of a human skull with the logo ""bone collector.""' After her rescue the girl recalled two occasions where she was in the box for three days. Apparently Balletto called her a 'trooper' for not screaming in the box. She was also told 'not to (expletive) up' because the men had a 'whole lot of money on the (marijuana) grow.' In addition to the toolbox, police found a homemade wooden rack used for sexual bondage, a noose , two dildos, and a white towel with blood stains on it. LAPD contacted the Lake County Police Department, saying Balletto may have been responsible for the girl's kidnapping. Officers showed up at Balletto's house on April 29, asking about the teen. The next day the girl called the police to report that she was okay. Authorities were able to trace that call to the girls location at a west Sacramento motel, where the two men were arrested and the teen transferred to protective custody. While arresting the men, police found a notebook with what seems to be a script written for the girl for her phone call to police. 'They think I'm missing' and 'I just want to make sure Ryan Balletto doesn't get in any trouble' are two of the lines from the script. The girl told investigators that both men had sex with her, and that it was consensual with Pearmain. Since she is a minor, officers informed her that she is 'legally unable' to consent to sex with an adult. The sex with Balletto, she said, was 'not as consensual' and that she did it to 'help him out.' Federal investigators believe there may be more victims. Police later raided Balletto's grow operation and home where they found 1,400 pot plants, $4,000 in cash, and 'the largest and most sophisticated bulk of weapons seized in recent (department) history.' They found a cache of 22 firearms, including high-powered military-grade sniper and assault rifles, automatic assault rifles and pistols. Many of the firearms were already loaded. Along with the firearms they found military-grade body armor and scopes, high-capacity magazines and ammunition. Horde: Police found a huge arsenal of weapons during a raid on the growing operation and Balletto's home . Girlfriend arrested: Balletto's girlfriend Christa McConnell was also arrested. She faces child endangerment charges for leaving loaded weapons within reach of her five children . Authorities found most of the firearms in a safe at Balletto's house. A ponytail of hair was also found in the safe. Balletto's girlfriend, 27-year-old Christa McConnell, was arrested during the raid on the home. McConnell has five children with Balletto, according to the criminal complaint. During their raid they found a 7-month-old baby sleeping on the master bed with a loaded gun only two-feet away from the headboard. All five children were placed in the custody of Lake County Child Protective Services. McConnell faces child-endangerment and weapons charges. Last year, Lake County had 87 cases of residents cultivating marijuana. According to public information releases posted on the Sheriff's Office website, police have already eradicated nearly 60,000 pot plants just this month. 'Some in our community believe that marijuana grow operations are run by compassionate caregivers interested only in supplying medicine to the sick, U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag said in a written statement. 'Unfortunately, this case illustrates what we in law enforcement see - marijuana grow operations that include heavily armed, violent individuals, motivated by profit, carrying out abuse of vulnerable victims.'","The 15-year-old went missing in April from the Los Angeles area .

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . An alleged brothel is in operation a short distance from the council children's welfare department at the centre of the Baby P scandal. Police are investigating the site after residents of Cumberland Road in north London complained about men loitering in the street before being allowed into the flat. The property is close to the building housing Haringey Council’s adult, culture and community services and children and young people’s services departments. Haringey social workers failed to save the life of 17-month-old Peter Connelly. Graffiti was spray-painted outside the property in an apparent effort to shame those running the brothel, which is close to the building housing Haringey Council’s  children and young people’s services departments . Furore: Residents of Cumberland Road in north London have complained about men loitering in the street before being allowed into the flat . Peter Connelly, who was just 17 months old when he died in 2007. Haringey Council was heavily criticised after it emerged that social workers had visited the family a number of times before he died . The toddler died in 2007 after suffering months of abuse from his mother, her boyfriend and his brother, even though the family had been seen on 60 occasions by social workers, health workers and others. Tony McLoughlin, a father-of-two who lives on the street, told the Evening Standard: 'It’s men banging on the wrong doors, saying: ""I’m here for my appointment, my massage"".' 'There’s almost a queue of men outside. 'On Sunday the kids were out playing and there was a guy just stood there.' The word 'brothel' was spray-painted outside the property in an apparent effort to shame those running it. It was also reported that an 83-year-old woman opened the door to a man who wanted a massage. The property is close to the building housing Haringey Council’s adult, culture and community services and children and young people’s services departments . A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Officers from Woodside Safer Neighbourhoods Team (SNT) became aware of a brothel in Cumberland Road. 'After receiving the information they visited the address and spoke with two female occupants, to check on their welfare. 'Details of those present were taken and relevant enquires were made. 'The landlord of the premises has now been located and informed that the property was being used as a brothel. He has been made aware of the offence under Section 34 of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 of letting premises for use as a brothel. 'Officers are continuing to work with the landlord and Haringey Council to formulate a long-term solution.' Anger: The toodler's death caused  outrage, not only because of the horrific nature of his injuries but because he was repeatedly let down by the social services. Pictured, tributes laid in tribute at Islington Crematorium . Sergeant Jon Bosustow, from Woodside SNT, said: 'My team and I will continue to take immediate action to close brothels wherever we find them on our ward.' Local constable Jack Morris e-mailed residents and said the ladies working there are not being held captive and that closing the alleged brothel is their priority. A Haringey council spokeswoman said: 'We share residents concerns about this property. Local councillors first raised this issue with police in July and are continuing to press police to take action. 'Powers to close suspected brothels lie with the police.' Baby P's Mother Tracey Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009, with a minimum five-year tariff, for causing or allowing the toddler’s death, along with her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen, who were convicted of the same offence. She was let out in October following a second Parole Board review of her case, a move that even her own father condemned. Peter's death caused widespread outrage, not only because of the horrific nature of his injuries but because he was repeatedly let down by the social services which were supposed to ensure his wellbeing. Sharon Shoesmith, the head of Haringey's children's services during the scandal, was sacked after a damning report into the death. However, Shoesmith won an unfair dismissal case in October and was awarded a payout of £679,452.","Residents are unhappy about men loitering in north London street .

In the fashion competition, that is.

Another $10 million from the state will mean 600 more workers will be lining the streets within the next several weeks . Children and parents made their way past security guards whose bright neon vests served as a reminder of the city's efforts to combat crime. Keonya Wells walks her son Joseph Toney to school along a safe passage route as Chicago Public School community watch person Keisha Powe stands guard today . It comes a year after hundreds more 'Safe Passage' workers were hired to keep children from harm, an infusion of city money has allowed Chicago to increase the number of workers. The city is also raising from 93 to 120 the number of schools with Safe Passage routes, said Jadine Chou, the chief safety and security officer for the Chicago Public Schools. Parents welcomed the sight of the Safe Passage workers. 'I like them on every corner, the police, too,' said Shamika Bennett, who was walking her five-year-old daughter, Dasia, to school, the girl sporting a new Dora the Explorer backpack and Nike shoes. 'You feel a little safer.' The first day of school did not receive nearly as much media attention as last fall, when Mayor Rahm Emanuel's shuttering of some 50 schools before the school year began sparked concerns that some students would be at increased risk of violence because they were required to cross into rival gang territories. The last school year ended, according to the school district, without a single student being seriously injured along any of the Safe Passage routes while guards were on duty in the nation's third-largest city.

Shamika Bennett,left, and her daughter Dasia Bennett walk a safe passage route along 63rd Street on Dasia's first day of kindergarten in Chicago . At the same time, a number of factors this year — from troubling crime statistics to the upcoming mayor's race — will ensure that the program remains under a microscope. On Tuesday, a day after the police department reported that the number of shooting incidents had climbed in the first eight months of the year compared to the same period last year, one mother said she worries that violence might erupt from the crowded street corners and bus stops she must negotiate to take her two young sons to school every day. 'There's no telling who's out there,' said Keonya Wells on her way to a train that she will ride with them for more than 20 blocks to their school. Similar concerns were voiced by Jeffery Currie, who was walking his nine-year-old son to nearby Dulles School of Excellence, almost exactly a year after officials at the school took the unusual step of responding to shootings in the area and a gang member's funeral by rushing students and staff off the property as soon as classes ended for five days. School Children walk a safe passage route along 63rd Street on Tuesday in Chicago .

'I make sure I walk him (because) I know about the streets, what happens,' Currie said. Some worry that the city is not doing enough to keep students from harm, particularly students who must leave for school early in the morning, well before the Safe Passage workers take their posts less than an hour before classes begin. Last December, a 15-year-old girl who left her home before dawn to get to a school on the city's North Side was beaten and raped less than a half block from a Safe Passage route. 'She had to get to school earlier than the Safe Passage (workers) were on duty,' said state Rep. LaShawn Ford, who said he will push to use some of the $10 million from the state to extend the guards' hours. All this could pose a political risk for Emanuel, who is up for re-election next year. His most-talked-about potential rival, Chicago Teachers Union president Karen Lewis, has criticized Emanuel for closing neighborhood schools and dubbed him the 'murder mayor' because of the city's violence. Any violence that occurs on a student's walk to and from school could become fodder for Lewis — or any other opponent — to use against Emanuel, whose popularity has fallen over the last year.

"By . James Chapman, Daily Mail Political Editor . The pound tumbled yesterday as a surge in support for Scottish independence rocked financial markets and Westminster. Sterling dropped to nearly a five-month low and shares in some of Scotland’s largest firms, including Royal Bank of Scotland and energy giant SSE, slid after a poll showed support for breaking up the Union has risen dramatically. The YouGov survey put the lead for the No campaign at six points, down from 14 points in the middle of August and 22 points early last month. Scroll down for video . The pound tumbled to a near five-month low on the shock poll showing a narrowing in the No campaign's lead . The latest YouGov poll shows a sharp narrowing in the lead for the No campaign ahead of the independence referendum on September 18 . First Minister Alex Salmond has seized on the latest polls as proof his campaign for independence is building momentum, after his victory in a TV debate against Better Together leader Alistair Darling (right) However, a former EU commissioner has said that an independent Scotland would not be able to keep the pound if it wished to be part of the EU. There has been a growing backlash against the No campaign’s leaders, with calls for Labour, the SNP’s main opposition, to ‘get a grip’. Ed Miliband, under fire for his absence, will this week divert a trip to Aberdeen to visit Glasgow, while strategists plan to send ‘big beasts’ Gordon Brown and former home secretary John Reid to party heartlands. First Minister Alex Salmond said independence is ‘closer than it’s ever been’. The SNP has previously benefited from a late pro-nationalist surge in Holyrood elections. In Westminster, senior figures are starting to discuss the huge potential impact of a Yes win. One Labour source attacked Douglas Alexander, effective leader of the No campaign, for recent difficulties including ‘patronising’ adverts. David Cameron insists he will not resign if the referendum he helped set up leads to the end of the Union. But top Tories say he would face a clamour to quit. There are also questions over the validity of a Labour government elected in 2015 with a small majority. Scots are likely to be able to take part in the general election of MPs to Westminster, a boost for Labour due to its strength in Scotland. But all the Scottish MPs could be swept away if the country becomes independent in March 2016. Many Tories say it would be unacceptable for Scottish MPs to hold seats in Westminster while London and Edinburgh set out a break-up of the UK. Ed Miliband, under fire for his absence, will this week divert a trip to Aberdeen to visit Glasgow, while strategists plan to send ‘big beasts’ Gordon Brown  (left) and former home secretary John Reid (right) to party heartlands . George Doig from Staffin on the Isle of Skye puts up his Yes signs in his garden ahead of the Scottish Referendum on September 18 . Mr Cameron’s spokesman said yesterday there were ‘no contingency plans’ for independence. But Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the senior Treasury civil servant, said he was forming a team to deal with a possible Yes vote. Former Scottish Secretary Lord Forsyth said the No campaign must be ‘more robust’ and convince voters it would be ‘a disaster’ to break the Union. He also claimed No supporters are being intimidated in Scotland. The pound fell almost a cent against the US dollar to $1.6510, close to a five-month low of $1.6501. It also slipped against the euro, and traders warned it is likely to weaken further. David Buik, of broker Panmure Gordon, said: ‘This latest poll has fired a shot across the bows and the markets have expressed their concern.’ It came as Olli Rehn, the former European Commissioner for monetary affairs, warned Mr Salmond’s plan to use the pound in defiance of Westminster will see Scotland rejected from the EU. Mr Salmond has claimed ‘it’s our pound and we’re keeping it’. Mr Rehn told Lib Dem Danny Alexander this would mean an EU veto. He said it would ‘simply not be possible’ for a country with no monetary authority of its own to be an EU member. Fate of the Union may be in the hands of older women says JAMES CHAPMAN . If the 307-year-old Union is preserved in the referendum, it may be older Scottish women who save it. The dramatic poll that sent shudders through Westminster and financial markets shows the Yes campaign has moved into a lead in all age groups except the over-60s. And though the gender gap is being narrowed, women are still more likely to oppose independence than men. The YouGov poll released on Monday – the first since a second TV debate between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling, which the Scottish First Minister was seen to have won comprehensively – showed a significant shift towards Yes. The YouGov poll released on Monday – the first since a second TV debate between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling, which the Scottish First Minister was seen to have won comprehensively – showed a significant shift towards Yes . Over the space of just a month, YouGov surveys, which have traditionally been the most unfavourable to the Yes campaign, indicate a slump in the No lead from around 20 points to just six. Once ‘don’t knows’ are excluded Yes is on 47 percentage points, a record from YouGov, with No on 53. That means Mr Salmond needs a shift of just three points to clinch victory – something that appears achievable, given that previously undecided voters now making up their minds appear to be breaking for Yes by around two to one. Crucially, the Yes campaign appears to be winning over more voters on the economic implications of independence. Before the summer, YouGov had never found more than 30 per cent saying Scotland would be financially better off on its own – but now the figure has risen to 35 per cent. Over the space of just a month, YouGov surveys, which have traditionally been the most unfavourable to the Yes campaign, indicate a slump in the No lead from around 20 points to just six . Mr Salmond is also winning over more of the less well-off social groups, where support for independence is up nine points on a month ago. Support for Yes among those who voted Labour in the last round of Holyrood elections in 2011 has also increased sharply – from 18 per cent to 30 per cent. Mr Salmond is also winning over more of the less well-off social groups, where support for independence is up nine points on a month ago . John Curtice, professor of Politics at Strathclyde University, said: ‘Just one group of voters appear to have resisted the tide towards a higher Yes vote – older voters. At 31 per cent, support for Yes among the over-60s is actually slightly down on a month ago.’ YouGov’s Anthony Wells said: ‘As ever, we should be careful of reading too much into a single poll but it looks like this may go down to the wire.’","The YouGov survey put the lead for No campaign at 6pts, down from 14 in middle of August and 22 early last month .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary for MailOnline . The Washington Post is ending 80 years of being led by the Graham family with the departure of Publisher Katharine Weymouth. The newspaper said Tuesday that Weymouth, the granddaughter of longtime Washington Post Co. CEO Katharine Graham, is stepping down. She will be replaced by Frederick Ryan, who previously ran the political website and newspaper Politico. Weymouth announced Tuesday that she will leave the Post after serving for 17 years in various roles. She has been publisher for seven years. New publisher: Frederick Ryan, seen in this 2012 file photo, will become publisher of The Washington Post starting October 1 . 'This is just the beginning of a wonderful new chapter for The Post,' she said in a statement. She also described her successor as 'a seasoned and well-respected executive with a track record of success at the helm of Politico and Allbritton Communications. He knows Washington, and he knows media. Fred is excited to take the helm and to meet all of you.' Weymer's statement said Ryan will become publisher October 1, though she revealed 'I will remain available as an advisor to him and to The Post through the end of the year.' The change follows the sale of the publication last year to Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos for $250 million. On Tuesday, Bezos announced the appointment of Ryan as the new publisher. Ryan had served as president and CEO of Politico since its inception in 2007. In the 1980s, Ryan was chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan. In a statement, Ryan called The Post a 'crown jewel' of journalistic values. Stepping down: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, left, bought The Washington Post for $250 million last year. Katherine Weymouth, right, is stepping down as publisher but has said she will be an adviser to help with the leadership transitoin . The Washington Post reported that Ryan, while speaking to the paper's newsroom, only said of his new job 'I decided I’m not going to get into the play-by-play. But I will say, I’ve known Jeff for a while. He is passionate about The Post and about journalism and about the premier role The Post has played and can play going forward. 'And we had a lot of exciting conversations about opportunities that are available in media today, challenges of course, innovative ways forward. And I was honored that he selected me to take on this role. '[Ryan] has never asked us to do or not do a story,' Bill Lord, Ryan's colleague at Albritton Communications, told The Post. 'He’s never tried to influence the news one way or another.' Politico, which is based in Arlington, Va., was launched by two former Washington Post reporters, John Harris and Jim VandeHei, in January 2007. It is known for hard-hitting, sometimes irreverent reporting on campaigns, rhetoric and scandal, and is one of The Washington Post's strongest competitors. Weymouth's great-grandfather, Eugene Meyer, bought the Post at a bankruptcy auction in 1933. Meyer's daughter, Katharine Graham, oversaw the paper through some of its most important stories, including the Watergate scandal.","The Washington Post is ending 80 years of being led by the Graham family with the departure of Publisher Katharine Weymouth .

"By . Kieran Gill for MailOnline . Follow @@kie1410 . Read Sportsmail's Graham Poll's damning verdict of the officiating during Chelsea and Everton clash at Goodison Park in August. Linesman Ron Ganfield has been dropped from this weekend’s Barclays Premier League fixture list, less than a fortnight after being heavily criticised for his part in Chelsea’s 6-3 win over Everton. Ganfield missed a series of key incidents in the match at Goodison Park, including a blatant handball outside of the area by Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard. He also failed to flag an offside that should have seen Chelsea’s second goal by Branislav Ivanovic dismissed. Errors: Assistant referee Ron Ganfield missed several key incidents at Goodison Park during Chelsea's win . Clear: Everton's keeper Tim Howard evidently held the ball outside the box but Ganfield missed the moment . Key mistake: Chelsea’s second goal by Branislav Ivanovic should have been dismissed for offside . The errors led Sportsmail’s Graham Poll to describe it as ‘the worst assistant refereeing performance I have ever seen’. The Professional Game Match Officials Limited have not selected Ganfield for any top flight games after the international break on September 14, 15 and 16, but insist the decision has nothing to do with his performance on Merseyside. ‘We have 17 Select Group referees and 36 assistant referees, so there will always be rotation of them from week to week,' a PGMOL official told Sportsmail. Dropped: Ganfield (left) has been left out of assisting at Premier League matches this weekend . Huge win: Summer signing Diego Costa was instrumental with two goals as Chelsea won 6-3 at Everton . Appointments are pencilled in weeks ahead and routinely made available to the public on the Monday before the weekend’s fixtures. Jon Moss, the referee from Chelsea's emphatic win over Everton on August 30, will act as fourth official for Arsenal's match with Manchester City once the Premier League football returns.","Chelsea left Goodison Park with a 6-3 victory over Everton last month .

"By . Jack Doyle for the Daily Mail . More than 100 Labour Parliamentary candidates are linked to the giant left-wing Unite union prompting new questions about the influence wielded by the union and its leader 'Red' Len McCluskey . More than 100 Labour Parliamentary candidates are linked to the giant left-wing Unite union, it emerged last night. The total has increased nearly four-fold in just 12 months and nearly one in three prospective MPs now has ties to Unite. The figures last night prompted new questions about the influence over Labour party policy wielded by the union and its leader ‘Red’ Len McCluskey. The Tories said they showed Unite was ‘buying up’ Labour candidates and ‘dancing to Len McCluskey’s tune’. But Labour insisted union support does not lead to ‘undue influence’. The union, which supported Ed Miliband in his Labour leadership bid, has since donated more than £12million to the party. Mr McCluskey has also pledged to spend millions more in the run-up to the General Election – while telling Mr Miliband to 'bring home the bacon' for union members. Unite has also drawn up a list of demands for an incoming Labour government - including higher taxes, huge spending increases, an end to 'austerity' and a ditching of all anti-union laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s. And one senior Unite figure has revealed the union is demanding Mr Miliband appoint a ‘Secretary of State for Unions’ if he wins next year’s General Election. The revelations will also resurrect the Falkirk scandal over attempts by the union to ‘fix’ the selection of the Scottish town’s general election candidate. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘These astonishing figures lay bare just how deep into Len McCluskey’s clutches Labour have sunk. ‘Ed  Miliband's chief union paymaster installed him as leader and is now buying-up Labour candidates across the country. ‘And we know, just like the Labour leader, they all dance to Len McCluskey's ruinous tune: more spending, more borrowing and more debt than future generations can ever hope to repay.’ The figures, which were uncovered by the Conservatives, showed 101 out of the 301 parliamentary candidates have ties to Unite – or nearly one in three. That compares to just 27 candidates a year ago. And in around 100 target seats, nearly half of all candidates have a link to Unite. The union, which supported Ed Miliband in his Labour leadership bid, has since donated more than £12million to the party . A total of 190 prospective Labour MPs have links to any trade union. Among those selected include Christian Matheson, for the City of Chester, who works as an industrial officer for Unite. Another is Nancy Platts, who is the candidate in Brighton Kempton, who has described the Labour Party as ‘a route into government for the union movement’. And one candidate, Jo Stevens in Cardiff, is backed by a staggering nine unions. Unite donations make up 29 per cent of all the money received by Labour since Ed Miliband was elected Labour leader in 2010. In Falkirk, people were signed up to be Labour members so they could vote for the Unite candidate – at least one without their consent. One Labour MP, Austin Mitchell, has described how seats are ‘sewn up’ for union candidates or those preferred by party HQ. He described how the number of candidates is deliberately whittled down, making it easier to ‘indulge in the type of manipulation for union favourites, relatives or partners seen most notoriously in Falkirk.’ A Labour spokesman said: ‘We are proud to have selected a wide range of candidates with varying backgrounds including carers, military personnel and business people. ‘One Nation Labour is a party that stands for the whole country. ‘Our affiliates' support does not get them any undue influence over our candidate selection process. ‘Labour’s individual members give the largest proportion of all our donations, and Labour stands up for the millions David Cameron is asking to pay more, while he is giving 13,000 millionaires an average £100,000 tax cut.’","Nearly one in three prospective MPs now has ties to the left-wing union .

"By . Gaurav C. Sawant . PM Narendra Modi beating a traditional Taiko drum in Tokyo . On the fourth day of his Japanese visit, he turned on the charm. Prime Minister Narendra Modi displayed his softer side - playing traditional Japanese Taiko drums, humming Vande Mataram, addressing scholars at the Sacred Heart University on women’s empowerment, and posing for selfies with students - to conquer hearts and minds in Japan on Tuesday. Modi also addressed four different gatherings, pitching India as the perfect investment destination for Japanese business and industry leaders. Modi began his day with an address to women scholars at the Sacred Heart University in Tokyo, even letting some of the overjoyed students take selfies with him. Later, chants of ‘Har Har Modi’ went up outside the Indian Embassy in Tokyo moments after the prime minister arrived to inaugurate the Vivekanand Centre there. School and college students skipped classes and waited hours to catch a glimpse of Modi, who left his security cordon later to mingle with them, signing autographs left and right. The headline event, of course, was when Modi tried his hand at playing traditional Japanese drums (Taiko) at the launch of Tata Consultancy Service’s (TCS) new programme for Japanese students, and excelled. Business mantras . The business part of Modi’s Japan campaign was replete with punchy mantras. “There is no red tape, only a red carpet,” he declared to the who’s who of Japanese business and industry in a packed-to-capacity hall that had many listeners standing in the corridor. Modi delivered a “3D formula” for investment. “We are a vibrant democracy; our demography ensures the youngest workforce in the world, and there is great demand–India is the biggest market for Japan,’’ he told a gathering organised by the Nikkei Inc and Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO). Modi told the captains of industry that investing in India would be a win-win situation for them, and that India is a land of tremendous advantage for Japan. “The cost of manufacturing is very high in Japan. Move to India to cut costs of manufacturing and aim for returns within two years that you would have got after 10 years in Japan,’’ he said. PM Modi meeting students during the inauguration of the TCS Japan Technology and Culture Academy in Tokyo. The capacity of the hall at Tokyo’s Okura hotel was 2,000, but Modi was told over 4,000 had applied to listen to him and half had to be turned down. Modi remarked that this was an indication of Japan’s keenness to engage more deeply with India. He spelt out details of how Japan could earn tremendous returns on its investments given the size of the markets in India. “Take for example the metro train (mass rapid transport system). Fifty cities in India are waiting for the Metro. Imagine the size of investment, manufacturing and return for those engaged in this line of manufacturing,’’ he said. Modi said India would be the centre of the global economy in times to come. Embellishing his “Make in India” line, Modi held up Maruti Suzuki as an example. “Try your luck in India. It is the land of opportunity. Invest in India because of the ease of business,’’ he told the audience, promising not just single window clearance but any other facilities that manufacturers may need. PM wonders if presenting Gita will become a 'secular' issue . PM Modi on Tuesday took a dig at the ‘seculars’ in the country and wondered if there would be debates on the issue of his presenting the Srimad Bhagwat Gita to Japan’s Emperor Akihito and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Speaking to the Indian diaspora in Tokyo in his fifth address of the day, Modi, tongue firmly in cheek, said he had no problems with such issues being debated on TV as everyone had to earn a living. He insisted he was firm in his convictions and would continue to pass on the message of the Bhagwat Gita to the world. PM Modi took a dig at the ""seculars"" in the country as he addressed Indians in Tokyo. 'Har Har Modi in Tokyo' Chants of Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi rang outside the Indian Embassy in Tokyo moments after PM Narendra Modi arrived to inaugurate the Vivekanand Centre. School and college students had been waiting since 2pm as the Embassy chose to keep the exact time of Modi’s arrival a secret. “We love you Modi ji,” screamed schoolchildren as Modi walked out breaking security cordon to meet them. “He asked me what class was I in. I told him I had cut classes just to catch a glimpse of him. He told me to do well at school,” said Meenakshi, one of the children. Spending a few moments with Indian community members, PM Modi returned to his cavalcade for his next engagement. Chants of ""Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi"" rang outside the Indian Embassy in Tokyo moments after PM Narendra Modi arrived. Goddess tales . PM Modi’s day began early as he addressed women scholars at the Sacred Heart University in Tokyo. This was an attempt to reach out to the next generation in Japan. Modi told the girls how women were compared to Goddesses in India and gave them examples of Goddess Saraswati worshiped for education, Goddess Lakshmi for wealth, Goddess Annapoorna for food and Goddess Kali for safety. He elaborated on special schemes for the education of the girl child, giving details of how he auctioned all the gifts he got as Gujarat CM for 14 years and presented the Gujarat government with a cheque of Rs 78 crore for the education of the girls. After the address, several girls clicked photographs with him. A day earlier Modi played a flute at the Taimei Elementary School in Tokyo. In fact he gave the children a little explanation about the flute, narrating the story of Lord Krishna and his ability to mesmerise the world, including animals with his flute. Modi said Lord Krishna was a cowherd and would take cows into the forest but the moment he began playing the flute at dusk the cows would immediately come to him and he would shepherd them back to Gokul. Another feather in Modi's cap . PM Modi playing the traditional Japanese drums (Taiko) was the last thing on the mind of the organisers of the launch of Tata Consultancy Service’s (TCS) new programme for Japanese students. Welcoming an honoured guest by playing the Taiko is a traditional Japanese form. PM Modi listened to the drummer couple in rapt attention before taking the drum sticks and playing the drums like an expert. The Japanese drummer initially watched and then suddenly joined Prime Minister Modi as the two belted out a fast rhythm for a minute or so before thunderous applause broke out. PM Modi listened to the drummer couple with rapt attention before taking the drum sticks up himself. Netaji's associate . Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday met Saichiro Misumi, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s oldest living associate in Japan, at a function in Tokyo. Modi met Misumi, 99, at a reception hosted by India-Japan Association and Japan-India Parliamentary Friendship League. At the function, Modi noted that the 93- year-old man remembers details about Subhash Chandra Bose and said he has asked Indian Ambassador to Japan Deepa Wadhwa to depute a highly professional video team to be with him for a month and interview him.

"By . Mark Prigg . Researchers have uncovered a series of major security holes in traffic light systems that allowed them to to control 100 signals in Michigan. Researchers say there were major flaws in the system, which is used in 40 states across America.. They worked with a local road agency to investigate the problems - and say they found a 'systemic lack of security' that allowed them to control lights. Scroll down for video . University of Michigan researchers hacked into nearly 100 wirelessly networked traffic lights - and were able to control every light on the system from a single laptop. Wirelessly networked traffic lights have four key components. There are sensors that detect cars, controllers that use the sensor data to control the lights at a given intersection, radios for wireless communication among intersections, and malfunction management units (MMUs), which return lights to safe fallback configurations if an 'invalid' configuration occurs. For example, if somehow every light at an intersection is green, the system might fall back to having them all become flashing red lights. With permission from a local road agency, the University of Michigan researchers hacked into nearly 100 wirelessly networked traffic lights. The team say the flaws they uncovered - which included the use of unsecured wireless networks and default passwords were used - are likely to be founds across the country. 'The vulnerabilities we discover in the infrastructure are not a fault of any one device or design choice, but rather show a systemic lack of security consciousness,' the researchers report in a paper. After gaining access to one of the controllers in their target network, the researchers were able to turn all lights red or alter the timing of neighboring intersections—for example, to make sure someone hit all green lights on a given route. They did not disclose exactly where in Michigan they did the research. The team, led by University of Michigan computer scientist J. Alex Halderman, said there were three major weaknesses in the traffic light system: unencrypted wireless connections, the use of default usernames and passwords that could be found online, and a debugging port that is easy to attack. 'The safety critical nature of traffic infrastructure requires that it be secure against computer-based attacks, but this is not always the case,' the team said. 'We investigate a networked traffic signal system currently deployed in the United States and discover a number of security flaws that exist due to systemic failures by the designers. 'We leveraged these flaws to create attacks which gain control of the system, and we successfully demonstrate them on the deployment.' 'The safety critical nature of traffic infrastructure requires that it be secure against computer-based attacks, but this is not always the case,' the team said. The team called for manufacturers and operators to improve their systems. 'Our attacks show that  an adversary can control traffic infrastructure to cause disruption, degrade safety, or gain an unfair advantage.' 'They need to be worrying about this and think about security - it needs to be one of their top priorities,' Branden Ghena, a graduate student who worked on the project told MIT Technology Review. 'It's hard to get people to care about these things in the same way that it's hard to get people to change their passwords.' Researchers said traffic-system administrators should not use default usernames and passwords, and should stop broadcasting communications unencrypted for 'casual observers and curious teenagers' to see. They also warned that devices like voting machines and even connected cars could suffer similar flaws.","Claims of a 'systemic lack of security' in traffic light system .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . Illinois Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, a double amputee, has revealed that she is pregnant. The 46-year-old Iraq veteran, who lost both of her legs and suffered serious injuries to her right arm while serving in 2004, announced she and her husband will welcome a baby girl in December. 'Bryan and I are expecting!' she wrote on her Facebook page on Monday. 'Thank you for your support and kind words during this exciting time in our lives.' In a segment on the Today show on Monday, Duckworth revealed that she 'went through all the different varieties of IVF' before conceiving and admitted it was hard to keep the process quiet. Good news: Iraq veteran and Illinois Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, pictured left and right with her husband Bryan Bowlsbey, has announced that they are expecting their first baby - a girl - this December . The baby girl will be her first child with husband Bryan Bowlsbey, whom she met at George Washington University and married in 1993. He is a Major in the National Guard. Due to her age, her pregnancy is considered high risk, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Duckworth was flying a Black Hawk helicopter over Iraq on November 12, 2004 when she was shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade, losing both of her legs and shattering her right arm. After returning to the U.S. and learning how to walk with the help of prosthetics, she worked for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and as the Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs between 2006 and 2009. She was elected to Congress in 2012. Service: Duckworth is pictured serving with the Illinois Army National Guard during her tour of duty in Iraq. In 2004, she lost both legs when the helicopter she was in was shot down on a mission near Baghdad . Fighter: She is pictured wearing her Purple Heart medal at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 2004 . Duckworth, who was born in Thailand to an American U.S. Marine Corps father, is the first disabled female veteran and the first female Asian American from Illinois to serve in the House. She is also one of five female veterans who lost limbs in Iraq and, coincidentally, four of them are pregnant or recently gave birth, the Today show reported. Melissa Stockwell, who lost most of her left leg from a roadside bomb in 2004 before going on to compete in the 2008 Paralympics, also appeared on the show. Her son is due in November. 'Tammy and I as being lower limb amputees I think very initially wondered if it would be possible to have children and learned pretty quickly you can still have children and provide, but I think you have to find yourself first,' Stockwell said. Band of mothers: On Monday, she appeared on the Today show with fellow veteran amputees, Melissa Stockwell, left, who is also expecting a baby, and Dawn Halfaker, right, who gave birth four months ago . They appeared on the show beside Dawn Halfaker, who lost an arm in Iraq, and who is now mother to a four-month-old boy. Then finally, Danielle Green-Byrd, who lost an arm during combat in 2004 before helping vets with PTSD, gave birth to a son 10 days ago. 'These women were there for me as the band of sisters when I went through the greatest pain, the greatest trauma in my life,' Duckworth said. 'And now we get to be together for the time of greatest joy.' See below for video .","Duckworth and her husband Bryan will welcome a baby girl in December .

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . Following the news that an Australian aircraft was fired at delivering aid packages in northern Iraq last week, a Royal Australian Airforce plane has successfully handed a delivery of weapons to Kurdish forces in the region. In a bid to arm residents against the advances of Islamic State militants, Defence said the latest operation was completed without incident before the plane returned to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates. 'The aircraft's crew has confirmed that no shots were fired at the aircraft and that their mission was carried out without incident,' Defence said in a statement early on Wednesday. The C-17A Globemaster aircraft flew to Tirana in Albania over the weekend where it was loaded before delivering the ammunition to the Kurdish town of Erbil via Baghdad. Scroll down for video . After an Australian C-130 Hercules aircraft was shot at by IS militants last week, an RAAF plane has successfully delivered supplies to Kurds in northern Iraq . Chief of Joint Operations, Vice Admiral David Johnston said further aid, stores and support flights may be planned to assist the people of northern Iraq, who remain under threat from extremist Islamic State fighters. 'The aircrew and support staff at Joint Task Force 633 have done a great job to successfully coordinate this mission to assist the people of northern Iraq,' he said. 'The cargo, in this case ammunition, was first inspected and cleared by Iraqi officials onboard the aircraft in Baghdad before the aircraft landed in Erbil. Prime Minister Tony Abbot, seen here during a press conference on Sunday, warned of the risk involved in the operation . RAAF C130 Hercules aircraft have already made some aid drops to communities in northern Iraq as part of a US-led effort to fend off the IS militants, and on Tuesday received the support of UN chief Ban Ki-moon. He said it was important that nations such as Australia help address the situation in Iraq. 'Without addressing this issue through certain means, including some military and counter-terrorist actions, we will just end up allowing these terrorist activities to continue,' he said speaking in Auckland. Meantime, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has warned of further risks involved in the Iraq mission. Opposition leader Bill Shorten, seen here speaking at Parliament House last week, has reinstated his support for the airdrops . 'Obviously, flying humanitarian air drops into combat zones are full of risk. But the risks are reasonable given the importance of the missions they're flying,' he said on Tuesday. Labor leader Bill Shorten restated his support for the airdrops and weapons airlift but acknowledged there were easy options there. 'Providing the Kurds with light weapons, the opportunity to defend themselves against people who would kill their families, to me is the only logical choice here,' Mr Shorten said.","An Australian aircraft was shot at while delivering aid packages last week .

A 13-year-old boy has escaped serious injury after putting his right arm through a glass window during a failed ice bucket challenge. Victorian teenager Levi Childe was preparing to perform his nominated deed for charity when his younger brother, Nevada, distracted him during filming outside his Geelong home. Upset by his brother's attempts to foil his challenge, Levi turned and tried to punch him only to have his arm go straight through the glass pane. Paramedics were called to the Geelong home after his mother, Clare, stormed out of the shower naked when she heard a 'massive crash.' 'I didn't know whether to put clothes on, call 000 or put his arm back together,' she told 9NEWS. Reacting to the 'terror screams' she and a neighbour came running to the boy's aid after he fled screaming in horror while his brother laughed. Ms Childe said her neighbour managed to stay calm enough to follow the instructions of the Triple Zero operator. 'She heard all the screams and she fell over on the grass out the front she was running so fast,' Ms Childe said. Levi will need to wear a cast for at least six weeks after severing three tendons in his wrist and fingers . 'We both were ringing Triple zero, they managed to calm her down, so she could save the situation. Levi was operated on the next day with doctors confirming he had severed tendons in his wrist and two fingers, narrowly avoiding nerve damage. Nevada also suffered cuts to his leg from the broken glass which fell inside the room he was standing. Levi can be overheard telling his brother in the grainy footage filmed on a mobile phone that he is going to 'smack' him just moments before he puts his arm through the window. The 13-year-old will have to wear a cast for up to six weeks and is undergoing hand therapy treatment as part of his recovery.

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . A driver punched a pensioner unconscious, leaving him with a broken jaw, after the 71-year-old gestured at him to slow down in a quiet suburban street. Peter Stringer was taking his mother-in-law's dog for a walk on Sunday evening when he was brutally attacked near a golf course in Walkden, Greater Manchester. Police said a black Mercedes Saloon car came screeching to a halt after he gestured for it to slow down, before reversing back towards him. Shaken: Peter Stringer, 71, was attacked while walking his mother-in-law's dog in a quiet suburban street . The driver then jumped out of the car and punched the pensioner hard in the face, fracturing his jaw and leaving him unconscious. He was left lying on the ground as the thug then drove away from the scene. Only later was he discovered and taken to hospital. Officers are appealing for anyone with information on the attack, which happened at around 7.30pm, to contact police. The offender is described as an Asian male, around 30 years old and between 5ft 8ins and 5ft 9ins tall. He has a sallow complexion, short, black hair and a short, trimmed beard and wore smart casual clothing. Scene: The assault happened at this junction in Walkden, Greater Manchester. Police appealed for witnesses . Detective Constable Paul Davies from Greater Manchester Police said: 'The victim has been left understandably shaken by this unprovoked assault. 'I believe the injuries would have been more severe had the victim not fallen onto a grass verge. 'The offender has thought nothing of fleeing the scene and did not even call an ambulance. 'Unfortunately no witnesses to this assault have come forward and the victim came too on the grass verge alone, with no one around to check on his welfare. 'It was a cowardly act and I ask for anybody with information about this incident or think they may have seen a vehicle matching that description driving erratically in the area at the time to contact Police.'","Peter Stringer, 71, was walking in-laws' dog in Walkden, Greater Manchester .

"By . Kieran Corcoran for MailOnline . A rare transcript of the conversation between NASA's mission control and the ill-fated crew of the Apollo 13, including the famous line 'Houston, we've had a problem', has been put up for sale. Every last word transmitted between the moon landing mission and ground control in the U.S. was recorded for use by journalists covering the six-day mission, which had to be aborted after a dangerous explosion on the rocket. Much of the conversation was of little interest until two days into the mission, the third Moon landing attempt, when commander Jim Lovell reported an explosion on-board. Scroll down for video . Famous words: The transcript, featuring an Apollo 13 astronaut informing ground control of the famous 'problem', is expected to fetch £5,000 at auction . Ill-fated: Apollo 13, pictured taking off from Cape Canaveral on April 11, 1970, never landed on the moon . Lovell contacted mission control in Houston, Texas, at 9pm on April 13, 1970 saying: 'Okay Houston. Hey, we've got a problem here.' Asked to repeat the message, Lovell replied with the famous line: 'Houston, we've had a problem.' An oxygen tank in the service module had exploded while en route to the Moon around 200,000 miles from Earth, sparking a fire which ripped through the spacecraft. Lovell and his crew Jack Swiggert and Fred Haise had no choice but to abort the mission. With the service module so badly damaged their chances of making it back to Earth safely had also suffered a huge blow. They risked everything by shutting down the service module, on which the command module relied, and moving to the lunar module for the majority of the return journey. The risk paid off and the crew successfully landed safely in the South Pacific Ocean where they were picked up by a US Navy ship. Recovery: After the accident in space the capsule managed to land in the Pacific Ocean, and was recovered . Out and safe: Fred Haise, left, is pictured after emerging from the capsule which landed in the sea . Memorabilia: Press packs from several Apollo missions are part of the auction lot . The real-life drama was immortalised in the 1995 movie Apollo 13 starring Tom Hanks. The 1,000-page transcript covers every moment from lift off to re-entry and belonged to British journalist John B. Phillips, who worked for the European Broadcasting Corporation. It is tipped to fetch £5,000 when it goes under the hammer at London auction house Christie's. James Hyslop, an expert at Christie's, said: 'This document is incredibly important because of the human story behind it. 'The Apollo 13 mission is one of the most famous of all time because of its edge-of-the-seat drama. 'NASA had invited about 40 journalists to their headquarters to report on the mission and provided each one with the transcript of the conversations between the astronauts and mission control. 'There are thousands of pages of fairly mundane transcript but just one that jumps off the page. Home safe: Apollo 13 astronauts wave for the cameras after being recovered by a U.S. Navy vessel . 'Aside from Neil Armstrong's moon landings, those fateful words 'Houston, we've had a problem' are the best known from any space mission and here they are in paper. 'The incredible thing that comes across is the calmness of the astronauts on board. There are no raised voices, no signs of panic, just sheer professionalism. 'This copy of the transcript, which is kept in two ring binders, belonged to a British journalist from the European Broadcasting Corporation.

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . A talented student doctor at the University of Oxford died from a heroin overdose after he turned to the drug to cope with the stress of his studies, a coroner heard today. Paul Robertson, 26, was conducting pioneering research into Parkinson’s Disease and was just months from being awarded his doctorate when he was found dead at home. Mr Robertson was on a scholarship at Christchurch College to advance scientists’ understanding of the illness. Paul Robertson was found dead in his room in this Oxford street by his girlfriend Sophie Bocksberger after she became concerned about him . However, he was unable to cope with the pressure he placed on himself and turned to the drug to combat anxiety and insomnia. At 3pm on May 17 he saw his girlfriend Sophie Bocksberger, an Oxford Classics graduate, but she became concerned the next day when she did not hear from him. She found him dead at 7.30pm, slumped in a chair in the bedroom of his student flat in Oxford. A statement read on her behalf said rigor mortis had set in and there was a used syringe in the academic’s right arm with a spoon and other drug paraphernalia nearby. In the statement she wrote: ‘He placed a lot of pressure on himself and he was something of a perfectionist and a hard worker and was very careful about his work. He had high expectations of himself.’ She added that she knew that her boyfriend had started taking heroin in August 2013. A report from his GP, Dr Hugo Hammersley, said Mr Robertson had suffered from sleeplessness and anxiety due to 'stress with his research' and he was prescribed with sleeping tablets and anti-depressants. His father Robert Robertson told the coroner in Oxford: 'It was clear sleep was an issue for a long time. He found it hard to switch off. 'He had reached a critical stage in his research and had submitted the first part of his thesis. He was almost close to coasting downhill. It is just strange.' Paul Robertson was on a scholarship at Christchurch College, Oxford (above) to advance scientists’ understanding of Parkinson's disease . The inquest was told that Mr Robertson had sought for his drug abuse but was told that because he was not an addict it was not available to him. A post mortem examination toxicology test revealed a 'very high' morphine level of 1,006mg per litre of blood - almost three times the recognised fatal level. Alison Thompson, the assistant coroner for Oxfordshire, recorded a verdict of a drug-related death. She said: 'He was a likeable, intelligent young man. The only problem he had was this anxiety which sometimes goes hand-in-hand with somebody who is intelligent, working hard and has set their sights on something, as they do. 'He had taken this [drug] to have a calming effect. There is absolutely no suggestion he intended to harm himself. This was clearly an unintended outcome.' Mr Robertson’s parents, Robert and Jacqueline, declined to comment after the hearing in Oxford.","Paul Robertson, 26, was found slumped in a chair with a needle in his arm .

"By . Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . A mother called police to a children's playground after getting into a heated row with another parent over whose child's turn it was to use a swing. The unnamed mother claims she was approached by a father who wanted to use a swing her daughter was playing on at Livvi's Place, a park in Ryde, Sydney. She alleges that when she replied that they would be another five minutes, the dad  stopped the swing which was still in motion, before trying to forcibly lift her child out of it so his own toddler could play on it. The outraged mother then called police over the incident - saying she felt 'intimidated' by the man's actions. Another mother who witnessed the incident posted the details online which has now sparked a furious debate over who was in the right. The scene of the playground stoush : Livvi's Place in Ryde, Sydney.  A mother called the police after getting into a heated row with another parent over whose child's turn it was to use a swing. Playground battle: A mother playing with her daughter at a busy playground in Ryde, Sydney, claims a father tried to remove her daughter from a swing so his own child could play on it . Witness: Elaine Stack (pictured) talked to the mother after the incident and decided to post the story on her facebook page and gauge responses from other parents . Witness Elaine Stack revealed on Facebook how she was with a group of other mums at the park when the police arrived. 'The police spoke to the father for a few minutes and left', she said. 'The police just said to father, you never put a hand on another persons child.' The 37-year-old said she then spoke to the mother involved and decided to put details of the incident online to see what other parents thought. She wrote: 'A Mother was pushing her little girl on a swing when a Father approached and said he was also waiting for the swing'. 'The Mother replied that they would be another five minutes or so. The Father proceeded to stop the swing in motion and tried to lift the daughter out'. 'The Mother was very upset and called the police. Another parent in the park thought this was a little overboard. What would you do? Would you call the police?' Debate: Elaine Stack posted details of the incident online which then sparked a furious debate between parents . Concerned mum: Elaine Stack (pictured) said she agreed with the mother calling the police but had admitted not to hearing the father's side of the story . Ms Stack said the mother told her she felt intimidated by the actions of the father and was left very upset by the whole incident. She said: 'She takes her little girl to the park most days and wanted to feel that it was a safe place to go in the future. She felt the man had really over stepped the mark.' But the owner of Nell and Oll, an online boutique children's store, says while she didn't know either parents she decided to post the incident to a Facebook page in a bid to gauge what others parents would do in that situation. Ms Stack's post received an overwhelming response and had more than 100 comments with parents split over who was in the right. 'It was something I knew there'd be a response to, people were very passionate.' Ms Stack said. 'It was interesting to see it was 50/50. I'm surprised how it snowballed so quickly.' Some parents backed the mother's actions, with one writing: 'How dare he touch another persons child'. Talking point: Ms Stack wrote that putting your hands on anyone else's child is a 'huge no no' but she did not get hear the father's side of the story . Who was in the right?The row over the playground swing has left parents divided on whether the mother was correct to call the police or if she was overreacting . But others thought it was unnecessary to call the police with one person commenting: 'Having to call the police over a swing is ridiculous.' Ms Stack, who has a newborn baby, described Livvi's Place as a busy playground that was suitable for all ages of children and was left surprised by the incident. She said: 'I hear everyone's point of view and understand the outrage. 'I think it is clear to everyone that putting your hands on anyone else's child is a huge no no'. 'I was not involved in this situation and therefore do not know all the details. I do know that the Mother was very upset as I spoke to her as she left the park'. Ms Stack  admits she thought the mother had done the right thing for herself and her little girl, but added she didn't hear the father's point of view. Police have confirmed that they spoke to both parents following the incident and no arrests were made. 'Police were called yesterday, police attended a dispute in the playground', said a police media spokesman. She said 'police spoke to both parties and neither wanted to make a further complain. No offence was detected.'","A Sydney mum claims a father tried to forcibly remove her daughter from a playground swing in Ryde, Sydney, so his own child could use it .

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . A teenager says he's grateful for 'a second chance in life' after breaking his neck in a freak swimming pool accident. Tristan Green, 18, of Colchester, Essex, was paralysed from the chest down after he dived into a 4ft pool and hit his head on the bottom. He said: 'Some days I don't like the sound of being in a wheelchair but, at the end of the day, I have been given a second chance in life. I could have died.' 'I could have died': Tristan, pictured with his father James, has endured his injuries with stoicism and optimism. The 18-year-old is able to speak about his accident for the first time following windpipe surgery . Tristan with his grandmother. He is set to start a rehabilitation programme that could last nine months . He added: 'It is hard keeping a positive attitude and sometimes I have down days. 'I want to be the big brother my little brother can look up to and I feel like I am not going to be that big brother any more, but that is life.' Tristan has been able to speak about the accident for the first time, after surgeons performed a tracheostomy to put a hole in his windpipe. Speaking from his bed at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, he described what happene on the day of the accident, July 26. He was at a friend's house with his girlfriend and they had been swimming in a pool in the back garden in  Colchester . Optimism: The teenager is being fed liquefied food through a tube and admitted he cannot wait to eat a Big Mac as soon as his body is ready to take on solids. Pictured with parents James and Dawn . Tristan  pictured before the accident with girlfriend Lauren Faulkner. The full extent of his injuries, which included breaking his neck in two places, and a bruised spinal cord, will not be known for about a year . Tristan said: 'I climbed the ladder up the side to dive into the pool. 'My head hit the bottom of the pool, I jolted my neck, that's when I broke it. 'It didn't hurt. I floated to the top of the water face down and was shaking my head to try and get some attention. 'I couldn't move, I thought I was going to drown.' Sense of humor: Tristan gurns for the camera despite his predicament . Tristan's girlfriend Lauren Faulkner, 18, turned him over and along with her friend and his mother, pulled Tristan from the water and put him in a garden chair. Lauren's father arrived, and spotting a lump on the back of Tristan's neck, decided an ambulance was needed. Medics called the fire brigade because Tristan was sitting in a chair and needed to be moved onto a spine board. Tristan had been trying to get on a plumbing and electrical course before the accident happened . They cut him out and he was flown to Addenbrooke's. Tristan said.'The best part about it was having a helicopter ride up to the hospital.' The full extent of his injuries, which included breaking his neck in two places and a bruised spinal cord, will not be known for about a year. He is on a waiting list for Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire where he could spend up to nine months on a rehabilitation programme. He is being fed liquefied food through a tube and admitted he cannot wait to eat a Big Mac as soon as his body is ready to take on solids. His weight has plummeted 22lbs to 9st. Tristan, who can drink his favourites - Dr Pepper or orange Lucozade - also undergoes daily physiotherapy and is visited every other day by parents James, 38, and Dawn, 42. He also has four siblings, Scott, 25, Zoe, 23, Jodie, 22, and Harvey, two. The nurses have become his friends, keeping his morale going on the days his family have not been able to visit and occupying him with conversation, TV, music and DVDs. Speaking last month, his father, James, 38, said: 'Unless there is a complete miracle, he will be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.' He told the Colchester Gazette: 'I look at pictures of me and him playing football and break down. 'We have had some hope because he wiggled his left toe and moved his right foot but it could be 18 months before we know the full effects. 'We need to be supportive for him to get through this.' The Facebook page his family set up, Tristan's Road to Recovery, has more than 2,000 'Likes' and has had global messages of support. Tristan said: 'I am still here and hopefully I can walk again but there is the possibility I am not going to. 'I said to my mum and dad: 'As long as it's a pukka wheelchair. 'I hope I can get some feeling in my legs so I can still play football with my little brother when he is older.' Colchester United gave fan Tristan a signed shirt and he thanked the club and said: 'I want to say a massive thank you to my girlfriend and everyone who has supported me. 'My family, my girlfriend's friend and his mother for helping me out of the pool, the air ambulance and the fire brigade.' Tristan had been trying to get on a plumbing and electrical course before the accident happened.","Tristan Green, 18, hit his head on bottom of pool in freak accident .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . Angel Sanches, 17, has been arrested on suspicion of strangling cousin Katherine Gonzalez, five, to death and hanging her body in a closet . A 17-year-old illegal immigrant has been arrested on suspicion of strangling his five-year-old cousin to death before leaving her body hanging in a closet. Angel Sanches was arrested after the Katherine Gonzalez's body was found inside a vacant apartment in Lake Highlands, Dallas, on Sunday afternoon. Sanches has denied the accusations, telling police that he was merely an accomplice. The boy allegedly told officers his cousin followed him into the building after he was taken hostage by a man named 'Carlos'. According to police, Sanches claimed 'Carlos' forced him into the building at gunpoint before shutting him in the closet. Sanches says he then heard his cousin crying before leaving the apartment to check that neighbors were searching for the girl. His arrest warrant says: 'He also explained that he is an ""accomplice"" but did not see the juvenile in the apartment after he exited the closet.' After being arrested, Sanches apparently told detectives 'I did not rape her' in Spanish. Witness Freddie Washington says he saw Sanches lure Gonzalez into the abandoned housing block, telling the girl 'Come on, come on,' before the pair disappeared inside. Mr Washington told WFAA 8: 'I think he waited for me to leave around the corner and then took her into the vacant apartment.' According to reports, Gonzalez was staying with her uncle at the time of the attack because both of her parents were at work. Officers were called to reports that Gonzalez had gone missing, and after a thorough search found her body hanging in the closet. Gonzalez' body was found in an abandoned property in this block of apartments on Sunday. Sanches claims he was taken hostage by a man named 'Carlos' before his cousin followed him in and he escaped . Investigators say they have taken mouth swabs and fingernail clippings from Sanches to compare to DNA found at the scene. Sanches has been charged with capital murder though he is not eligible for the death penalty as he is only 17. Police said he is an undocumented immigrant who has lived in the U.S. for six months to a year.","Angel Sanches, 17, arrested after Katherine Gonzalez's body found  Sunday .

"By . Madlen Davies for MailOnline . A ten-year-old boy who can barely walk due to a rare spine condition is hoping to complete a 4km run - and step out of his wheelchair to walk across the finish line. Dylan Marshall will join thousands of other children tackling the Junior Great North run in Newcastle this weekend . But for the 10-year-old, just reaching the start line is an achievement. Dylan, from Lynemouth in Northumberland, was born with Larsen’s syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes dislocation of the bones. Dylan Marshall, 10, can barely walk due to Larsen's syndrome - which causes dislocation of bones - but that won't stop him completing the 4k Junior Great North Run this weekend, and stepping out of his wheelchair to cross the finish line . His mother Victoria Marshall (pictured left) was terrified when Dylan (pictured left and right) had to undergo a seven-hour operation in which doctors predicted there was just a 15 per cent chance he would survive without dying, being paralysed, or requiring a ventilator for the rest of his life . After seeing his mother Victoria Marshall, 33, complete the Great North Run last year he decided that although he may finish last, his condition would not stop him stepping over the finish line. 'I love the Great North Run,' he said. ‘On Saturday I’ll come in last - I hope I still get a medal - but I want to get up and go across the finish line.’ At just 14 months old Dylan’s spine became dislocated and his vertebrae began pushing down on his spinal cord, threatening to paralyse him. He underwent pioneering surgery at Newcastle General Hospital, in which four of his neck bones were removed and replaced with one of his lower left ribs. A second operation then attempted to fuse the rib to the rest of his spine, meaning he was forced to wear a ‘halo’ to ensure he could not move his head for months on end. Larsen syndrome is a rare genetic condition that affects the development of bones throughout the body. Affected individuals are usually born with inward and upward turning feet and dislocations of the hips, knees and elbows and flexible joints. Some people with the condition experience respiratory problems as a reuslt of weakness of the airways, that can lead to partial closing and short pauses in breath. The condition affects around one in 100,000 newborns. Other symptoms of the disease include: . His neck became so fragile that, aged three, he tripped over a plant pot and snapped the newly-grafted rib. Doctors fitted him with metal rods to support his head, but the procedure led to further problems. ‘When he broke the rib doctors put in metal rods at the front of his neck to support it, but when he grew the metal couldn’t change and he ended up with both a compression and decompression of his neck,’ said Mrs Marshall. He went under the knife again, with surgeons at London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital predicting just a 15 per cent chance that he would survive the procedure without dying, being paralysed or requiring a ventilator for the rest of his life. Mrs Marshall said she was terified, not knowing what would happen to her son. She said: ‘The operation took seven-and-a-half hours and when he came out he couldn’t move - we didn’t know what would happen.’ Months of physiotherapy and orthopaedic therapy followed, with support from friends and his family. Now Dylan is all set for the run this weekend. He is fundraising to say thank you to the Sick Children’s Trust, which in both Newcastle and London provided a ‘home away from home’ for his mum and dad while he was undergoing treatment. He has already raised £500 smashing his fundraising target of £150. By the time he steps out of his chair on Saturday, he hopes to have raised hundreds more.

"By . Freya Noble . and Nelson Groom For Daily Mail Australia . Police can not confirm whether any of the five men who were interviewed over an alleged gang rape which took place in a Melbourne lane at the weekend were the same individuals seen in CCTV footage officers released in relation to the vicious attack. On Tuesday evening the men handed themselves into police following an appear for information about the early morning attack, which saw a 47-year-old woman's feet bound with masking tape while she was raped by five men in Snowball Lane, South Yarra, in Melbourne's inner city. The men, three 20-year-olds  from Bentleigh, a 19-year-old also from Bentleigh, and a 21-year-old from Dandenong presented to police at 9pm last night. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage released by police of a man they wish to identify in relation to the brutal gang rape of a woman in inner Melbourne . A Victorian Police spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Australia they have been interviewed and released pending further investigations. However the spokesperson could not confirm whether the men who were interviewed were the same individuals who appeared in the CCTV footage. The interviews follow the release of security footage by police help them identify men they wanted to speak to over the alleged gang rape and bashing. After the incident, the victim ran naked to nearby Chapel Street where she raised the alarm. Chapel Street is a well-known entertainment strip in Melbourne and is considered one of the city's most exclusive areas. Another suspect police are looking to to identify over the attack that took place in South Yarra, Melbourne . Police described the attack as 'traumatic' for the woman, who was taken to hospital for treatments afterwards. Detectives from the Sexual Crimes Squad are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident and will review all CCTV footage in the area in an attempt to identify those involved. Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Michael Phyland said all five men sexually assaulted the woman, whose ankles were bound with masking tape during the attack. 'It's been a very traumatic occurrence for the victim,' he said. Det Sen Sgt Phyland said some of the details of the attack were still unclear and it was too early to tell if it was planned. 'At this stage it may appear more of an opportunistic situation,' Det Sen Sgt Phyland said on Tuesday. 'She was on her own and she had been in that area,' he said. The two men (above) police want to speak to over the attack. Officers cannot confirm whether the men showen in the footage were the same individuals interviewed by police on Tuesday evening . Investigators are still appealing for anyone with information to come forward and assist them with their investigation.

"By . Dan Bloom . and Will Stewart In Moscow . Pro-Russian rebels claim to have shot down a Ukrainian spy drone just a few miles from the site of the MH17 disaster. The footage released on Youtube by the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples' Republic - which has not been independently verified - shows a military craft lying in a field near the rebel-dominated city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Fighters posted an image  posing next to the device and making the peace sign on the Russian equivalent of Facebook, declaring themselves 'heroes'. Scroll down for video . Peace: This photograph posted on Russian-language social media showed a member of the Donetsk People's Republic standing next to what separatists said was a Ukrainian spy drone dating back to the Soviet era . Heroes: The footage was posted along with a message proclaiming the fighters were heroes . If the footage's description is genuine, the site of the drone crash near the city of Shakhtars’k is just 15 miles from where MH17 was shot down over the village of Hrabove. And the rebels claimed it happened at 1.30pm local time yesterday, just as international experts gathered at the MH17 crash site to search for evidence. In a statement yesterday on vk.com, Russia's equivalent of Facebook, the separatists wrote: 'According to a report from military correspondents to the ministry of information, at approximately 13.30 near Shaktersk fighters of Motorola unit from number 20 check point on the Donetsk-Snezhnoe highway detected and shot down a Ukrainian flying object, supposedly a drone. 'Corsair reconnaissance group found the spot where it fell; right now the object is still at the crash site.' Investigation: International experts were at long last allowed to access the MH17 crash site, even as another aircraft was shot down . Dutch experts collect evidence as they examine the area of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 plane crash in the village of Hrabove (Grabovo), some 80km east of Donetsk . Wreckage: The experts are pictured yesterday at the crash site, where they have begun their recovery work . A team of Dutch experts examines a waterway as they scour the MH17 crash site. Their efforts were brought to a halt due to shelling nearby . Sniffer dogs working on the vast crash site in eastern Ukraine helped uncover the remains of more victims of the MH17 attack today . The claim appeared to be backed up by Ukraine's military, according to the respected AFP news agency. It reported Ukraine's military as saying separatists had hit an army drone with a missile similar to the type of system it alleges was used to strike MH17. The claim prompted scorn on social media, though - as unlike the passenger jet, the drone appeared remarkably intact. And because the unmanned craft are rocket-launched, it could have come to earth following its mission using a parachute, as is normal for the same type of drone. Still open: People were pictured today walking through the crash site area, which has been opened to experts . Parked behind the aircraft, which carried the blue and yellow trident emblem of the Ukrainian military on its tail (far right), was parked a truck spray-painted with the Russian flag. It came as the MH17 probe continued . Communication: The image of the craft in a field near Donetsk was posted on vk.com, the 'Russian Facebook' Comparison: One user of the social networking site posted this photograph of a Soviet-era Tu-143 drone . Close: The rebels said the site was near Shakhtars'k, about 15 miles from the MH17 crash site . Entered service: Late 1970s . Use: Soviet Union, East Germany . Crew: Unmanned . Length: 26ft . Wingspan: 7ft . Weight: 1.2 tonnes . Top speed: 590mph . Range: 124 miles . Service ceiling (high altitude): 16,400ft . Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down on July 17, killing all 298 people on board. It has still not been established how it was destroyed, though many politicians laid the blame at pro-Russian rebels which hold the area. But the circumstances are mired in confusion and even if rebels were to blame, it is not known if they knew what they were shooting. Pro-Russians on the social networking site identified the downed drone, which bore the blue and yellow trident emblem of the Ukrainian military, as a Soviet-era spy craft. They said it was a Tu-143 drone, a claim repeated by the Russian news outlet Russia Today, which reported on the video earlier today. There are huge differences between the craft pictured and the passenger airliner. It would have been flying much lower than the 33,000ft at which MH17 was flying, and unlike the passenger jet, it appeared unusually - remarkably - intact in the field, leading some to doubt the rebels' claims that they shot it down. A rocket-launched short-range craft, Tu-143s were used by the Soviet Red Army in the 1970s and 1980s, and Russia Today claimed units were kept in use by Ukraine after the Soviet Union collapsed. Footage of the craft posted by rebels showed its ageing machinery lying in the field near Donetsk . A statement by the rebels said: 'According to a report from military correspondents to the ministry of information, at approximately 13.30 near Shaktersk fighters shot down a Ukrainian flying object' The footage was posted yesterday as the largest team of experts yet gathered at the site of the MH17 disaster. Using sniffer dogs, the 101 experts - many of them from Australia and the Netherlands, where many victims hailed from - found new evidence including human remains. Roads had for days been too dangerous to use because of heavy fighting, which frustrated the efforts to move an investigation forward. And today the investigators were forced to seek cover again because of shelling, according to AFP.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said yesterday: 'The security situation at the site is unstable and unpredictable.' In clashes near the site of the drone crash, Ukraine said separatists killed at least 10 of its paratroopers in an ambush in the early hours of yesterday. A Ukrainian military official said a further 13 troops were wounded and 11 unaccounted for.

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Fed-up Scottish voters have flocked to a new art exhibition lampooning the warring independence camps, with just two weeks to go before the historic September 18 poll. Glasgow's Veneer Gallery has been taken aback by the public interest in a new show featuring tongue-in-cheek images mocking the Yes and No teams. It comes as Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling ramp up their campaigns to win over the remaining undecided voters. The paintings, by Scottish artist Dominic Currie, 56, are inspired by cult pop artist Roy Liechtenstein and American comic books. They include a unique take on Liechtenstein's Drowning Girl, with the speech bubble altered to say: ‘Ah dinnae care. I'd rether sink than vote yes!’ Referendum-inspired Scottish Pop Art by Fife artist Dominic Currie is being displayed at the Veneer Gallery, Glasgow . Another features Margaret Thatcher's face with the slogan 'Better To Get Her'. Another depicts a group of young boys urinating on a wall beneath a window from which Alistair Darling is watching. Mr Currie said he decided to create his artwork because he was ‘absolutely fed up of the Punch and Judy show’ involving Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond. He said: ‘I would say for the average punter in the street it's been a total turn-off. It's not been any advert for empowering people. ‘The whole campaign has been absolutely negative and throwing insults. Nobody knows what's going to happen. ‘I thought to myself what you need is a bit of tongue-in-cheek satire and maybe even give people a bit of something to think about.’ The Methil artist said the Margaret Thatcher image came to him as he felt no matter who Scotland voted for in past elections, they always got ‘Margaret Thatcher politics’. And according to Mr Currie, the urinating boys picture is ‘Better Together in action’. He said: ‘It's just taken off. I never thought I would do this in any serious way.’ Mr Currie’s referendum series is currently on display in Glasgow's Veneer Gallery and he has already sold a huge number of prints. His original Drowning Girl painting was snapped up on the launch night. One of the images depicts a group of young boys urinating on a wall below a window where Alistair Darling is standing . Currie used the Pop Art images to poke fun at both sides in the referendum debate . The images are inspired by American-pop artist Roy Lichtenstein and characters from comic books . It comes as Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond goes head to head with the No campaign over threats to the economy. Mr Salmond will set out his vision of the gains of independence for the food and drink industry on a visit to Eden Mill distillery and brewery in Guardbridge, Fife. Meanwhile, shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran and Labour MSP Iain Gray will be at Glasgow's Tennent Caledonian Breweries to highlight jobs and opportunities they say will be available as part of the UK. Today is the deadline for Scots to register to vote in the referendum on September 18. The latest YouGov poll shows support for independence has risen eight points in a month, with the No camp now six points ahead of the Yes campaign. Excluding undecided voters, 53 per cent plan to vote No, while 47 per cent would back Yes. Speaking ahead of his visit, Mr Salmond said: ‘Scotland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and our booming food and drink industry is just one of our remarkable success stories in recent years. ‘More and more people are waking up to the fact that Scotland has a strong and diverse economy on which we can build a more prosperous future with control of key economic levers. ‘Scotland is currently in the international spotlight like never before, but the huge publicity generated by a Yes vote - and the transition to independence - will be the opportunity of a lifetime for our food and drink sector to extend its global reach even further.’ Mr Salmond said the Scottish Government had been working with the industry on a £4.5 million food and drink export plan. He added: ‘Following a Yes vote, we will sit down with industry and Food and Drink Scotland to discuss how we can supplement that plan to take full advantage of the unprecedented global publicity, creating thousands of jobs in Scotland and boosting our exports.’ Fife-based painter Dominic Currie has put together 11 individual pieces - including a take on Liechtenstein's Drowning Girl, with the speech bubble altered to say: 'Ah dinnae care. I'd rether sink than vote yes!' Ms Curran argued that young people in Scotland would benefit from more job opportunities within the UK. She said: ‘Around one million jobs in Scotland rely on companies based elsewhere in the UK and many more are with companies that rely on trade with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. ‘Young people across Scotland can't afford to have opportunities cut off. ‘'We want a strong Scotland backed up by a strong United Kingdom. Being part of the UK means that we can share our resources across the country. 'Scots are squeezed between two governments with the wrong priorities. Neither the Tories nor the SNP are giving our young people the chances they need to succeed.’ Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Labour MP Jim Murphy is due to resume his 100 streets in 100 days tour in Edinburgh's Princes Street.","Glasgow's Veneer Gallery taken aback by public interest in a new show .

"By . Chris Spargo for MailOnline . J.J. Watt is already one of the best defensive players in the NFL, and now he is set to become the highest paid, as he has reportedly signed a six-year contract extension with the Houston Texans worth $100 million. The 25-year-old, born Justin James Watt in Waukesha, Wisconsin, had 31 sacks for the Texans the past two seasons, and was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2012. Watt had two years left on his rookie contract before negotiations began, and was set to earn $1.9 million in base salary this season. Loaded: J.J. Watt is set to earn $100 million over six-years, and a guarantee of $51.8 million, thanks to a new contract extension with the Houston Texans . ESPN Senior NFL Insider Chris Mortensen broke the news last night on Twitter, writing, 'Texans made it an even $100 million with $51.8 million guaranteed for JJ Watt, who was set to make $1.9 million this year, per source.' Once confirmed, this would exceed the $96 million, six-year contract that the Buffalo Bills gave former Texans defensive end Mario Williams. He has a guarantee of $50 million. This comes after several weeks of contract negotiations between Watt's agent, Tom Condon, and the Texans general manager, Rick Smith, who has a policy of not negotiating contracts once regular season play begins. Watt has remained quiet on the situation, and when asked whether or not a new deal would get done before the season began just a few days ago, KHOU reports that he simply said, 'I would like it very much if it did.' A star athlete at Pewaukee High School in Pewaukee, Wisconcin, Watt began his college career in 2007 at Central Michigan University, transferring after just one year to the University of Wisconsin. Redshirted his first year at Wisconsin, he went on to start all 13 games at defensive end in 2009. Then, after a 2010 season that included 59 tackles and seven sacks, he was selected as the No. 11 pick in that year's draft, signing a four-year deal worth $11.3 million with the Texans. Going down: The 2012 NFL Defensive Player of the Year had 31 sacks for the Texans the past two seasons . According to Forbes, Watt will receive a $10 million signing bonus with this new contract, and his base salary this year will be $907,385. That will then jump to $9.969 million in 2015. There is expected to be a news conference today at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, to announce the signing. In just two seasons of NFL play, Watt has become known and admired by most in the league for his commitment to working hard and his dedication to the game, gladly giving up any sort of personal life in the process. No distractions: Watt, seen here with actress Naomi Watts, has said he will 'sacrifice' his personal life to be the best possible football player he can be . Retired linebacker Ben Leber posted a quote attributed to Watt on his Twitter last month that read, 'I have a limited amount of time to build a career out of football and be the best that I can be at this job. When this job is over, I have the rest of my life to do what I want with my time.' The quote, which was reportedly in response to his teammates constant questions as to why he has no personal life, went on to say, 'Right now I am a football player and I will sacrifice whatever is necessary to be the best.' The footballer did however find time to start the Justin J. Watt Foundation, which supports after-school athletic programs in his home state of Wisconsin, and the state he now calls home, Texas.","J.J.

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . Avoided jail: Lisa Morris was told to remove her son's Xbox and get him out of bed in the morning . A mother has been ordered by a court to send her 13-year-old truanting son to school after he turned up for just 40 days in seven months of classes. Lisa Morris was told to remove her son Liam Foster’s Xbox, send him on a stop-smoking course, and get him out of a bed in the morning. She avoided jail despite him turning up for school on 40 days out of a possible 150 - while the attendance record of her other son, Callum Barks, 15, was also of concern, Cannock Magistrates’ Court in Staffordshire was told. Morris admitted she had failed to make sure both boys were turning up at Abbot Beyne School in Burton between January 1 and May 13 this year. Staffordshire County Council said Liam had only attended school on 40 days out of 150. His absence was unauthorised on 86 of those days. The court was told that Callum’s attendance record was also of concern, but particular attention was drawn to that of Liam. Khalid Mahmood, prosecuting on behalf of the council, said education welfare officers had carried out a number of home visits at Morris’s address to try to resolve the situation. He said: ‘Lisa Morris was advised by the education welfare officer to exercise parental controls such as removing Liam’s Xbox and TV controls. ‘Liam was also told to attend meetings with the smoking cessation service and Miss Morris was told to make sure he was awake at 7.30 each morning. Scroll down for video . Truancy: Her son Liam Foster turned up for lessons at at Abbot Beyne School (pictured) in Burton on 40 days out of a possible 150 - while the attendance record of her other son, Callum Barks, 15, was also of concern . ‘Liam’s attendance levels did improve as a result, but there were problems again in June when Miss Morris went on holiday.’ Mr Mahmood also told magistrates that Morris had a previous conviction for failing to make sure her daughter was regularly attending school in 2008. Morris said that she had found it very difficult to make sure that both Liam and Callum were attending school on a regular basis. She told the court that Callum now took a taxi to school each day in order to make sure that he got there on time. Prior to sentencing, magistrates told Morris that they took absence from school very seriously and had taken her previous conviction into account. The chair of the bench told her: ‘We have . listened to what has been said and attendance at school is something . that is very important to the bench. Lessons: Morris said that she had found it very difficult to make sure that both Liam and Callum were attending Abbot Beyne School on a regular basis . ‘We do take non-attendance at school seriously and have taken into account the previous conviction. ‘We hope that Liam in particular . continues to engage with professionals. It is important that he starts . the beginning of the new school year.’ Magistrates . handed Morris a six-week jail sentence, suspended for 12 months, with . 12 months supervision. She was also ordered to pay costs of £250 and a . victim surcharge of £80. 'Lisa Morris was advised by the education welfare officer to exercise parental controls such as removing Liam's Xbox and TV controls' Khalid Mahmood, prosecuting . They warned her that should she commit any other offence during this time, then the terms of the suspended sentence could be activated in another court. A court order preventing the naming of Morris and her sons was lifted following an application to magistrates by the Burton Mail newspaper. Abbot Beyne School is a comprehensive school catering for about 750 pupils aged between 11 and 18. The attendance rate at the school in 2013 was 94.2 per cent, which fell 0.4 per cent on 2012. This rate is about average for the country. In its last Ofsted inspection, the school was told it 'requires improvement'. Main criticisms included weak teaching and poor attainment in the sixth form.","Lisa Morris told to remove son Liam Foster's Xbox and get him out of bed .

"By . Francesca Chambers for MailOnline . The federal government has let more than 6,000 foreigners on student visas who represent a national security threat slip through the cracks, according to a news report released Tuesday. The Department of Homeland Security lost contact with the foreigners, who ABC News says are of 'heightened concern,' after they overstayed their visas and has been unable to reestablish contact. 'My greatest concern is that they could be doing anything,' Peter . Edge, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, told ABC News. 'Some of them could be here to do . us harm.' The Department of Homeland Security has lost track of roughly 58,000 foreigners here on expired student visas. More than 6,000 of them are considered high-risk for terrorism related activities . While only 6,000 of the expired visa holders are considered subjects of interest, DHS says it has lost track of a total of 58,000 foreigners who entered the U.S. on student visas but appear not to have left. 'They just disappear,' Sen. Tom Coburn, a leading advocate of student visa reform told ABC News. 'They get the visas and they disappear.' Tracking down foreigners who have overstayed their student visas has become an issue of increased concern after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Virgina. One of the hijackers of the plane that crashed into the Pentagon, Hani Hanjour, entered the U.S. on a student visa. At a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing in 2011, Sen. Rand Paul re-raised the concern that foreign students could be a threat to the U.S. 'We have 40,000 students coming to this country from all over the world,' he said. 'Are they would-be attackers?' The Kentucky Senator's concerns were validated after a student from Kazakhstan on an expired visa, Azamat Tazhayakov, was arrested and charged for hiding the backpack of a Boston bombing suspect from police. Paul has been a vocal advocate of changes to the student visa system ever since. The Kentucky Senator refused to vote in favor of immigration reform in 2013 because the Obama-backed Gang of Eight legislation did not place new restrictions on the student visa program. 'If we had a more competent visa program, we might have prevented . 9/11,' he said in an op-ed for Politico explaining his opposition to the comprehensive immigration reform bill. 'If we had more thorough screening of refugees, we might have . prevented the Boston bombing,' he continued. Tazhayakov was convicted in July of obstructing a terrorism investigation for hiding evidence for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who has been accused on perpetrating the bombing. Tsarnaev will face trial in November. Sen. Coburn told ABC News that since the September 11 attacks the government had arrested 26 foreigners with student visas for terrorism related activities. Coburn and Sens. Chuck Grassley and Charles Schumer have tried in the past to change student visa laws with no success. Thomas Kean, a co-chair of the 9/11 Commission, which first recommended changes to the student visa program, told ABC he was amazed that the government still hadn't adopted the commission's recommended changes to the program. 'It's been pointed out over and over and over again and the fact that . nothing has been done about it yet... it's a very dangerous thing for . all of us,' Kean said. 'The fact that there's been no action on this is . very bothersome.' Kean pointed out that the man who attacked the World Trade Center in 1993, years before September 11, was also a student visa holder who skipped out on school. ABC News said it discovered in its investigation that more than a million foreigners currently hold student visas from across 9,000 schools, making it difficult for the government to keep track of every visa holder. Students can enter the U.S. now to study almost any trade on a visa, including hairbraiding and massage therapy, ABC found. Many of the for-profit programs that provide such courses abusing the visa system, Coburn said, which is another reason why reforms are necessary. 'We know we have a lot of non-accredited universities that are using . this system to bring people in, collect money, and not educate them at . all,' he said. 'To me, it’s a . mess.' Janice Kephart, a counselor to the 9/11 Commission, told ABC the government was creating an opening for terrorists to take advantage of the lax oversight of student visa programs by accrediting suspect schools. 'When schools are not legitimate that enables terrorists to come here . under a fraudulent basis and disappear into the fabric of society . without anybody knowing that they are here for illegitimate reason because the system itself will say they're here . legitimately when in fact they're not,' she said. Edge, the ICE official who handles student visa investigations, admitted . to ABC that 'we really have a lot more work to do' to make sure that the government is keeping student visa holders in check. Government oversight reports show that it's not just expired student visas that the government has been sloppy at regulating. As of June 2013, DHS had a backlog of 1 . million cases in which a foreigner had potentially overstayed any type . of visa, a Government Accountability Office report filed in July of last year . revealed. GAO was asked to access DHS' management of the . visa system after it received a series of complaints from lawmakers in 2011  It . originally found that Homeland Security had 1.6 million cases open, including . thousands of students. That number had whittled down to just north of 1 million by the time it reaccessed the issue two years later. In it's 2013 report GAO cited persisting concerns that DHS was still losing too many foreign nationals, however, and strongly encouraged the government agency to provide stricter oversight of visa holders.","'Some of them could be here to do .

"By . Emily Crane for Daily Mail Australia . Ben Ivey has spent more than $20,000 wooing lovers he met online but every time  it ends in heartbreak when he realises he has become yet another victim of an online scammer. The 32-year-old from Sydney has been scammed a total of three times since 2011 after meeting and interacting with women on dating websites and social media. 'I was heartbroken after every one ended. I thought what the scammers were telling me was the truth. I was blinded by my love for them,' Mr Ivey told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Ben Ivey, 32, has been scammed more than $20,000 since 2011 by three women he has met online . He went online in search for love in January 2011 after a failed relationship when he was at the University of Western Sydney and an unsuccessful attempt to a girlfriend through his local church. 'I think the reason why I got scammed three times was because of my loneliness and I just wanted to have someone to love and I was prepared to do what I could to make the women happy,' he said. Mr Ivey is the first to admit being duped three times is 'crazy' and has now put his parents in control of his bank accounts to ensure it doesn't happen again. 'Every time the scammer asked me for money I told them about the previous scammer and how upset I was by that. But they assured me it wouldn't happen again. I believed every time this would come true, but it didn't,' he said. Mr Ivey, who volunteers at a Christian radio station on Sydney's north shore, was scammed for the first time in January 2011 after meeting Michele Raymond on a website called benaughty.com. The 32-year-old from Sydney went online in search for love in January 2011 after a failed relationship at university and an unsuccessful attempt to a girlfriend through his local church . She told him she was an actress in London and said she needed money because her handbag had been stolen, she had been jailed for drug use and her plane was delayed while she was en route to see him. After 17 days and finding himself $1,965 out of pocket, Mr Ivey realised it was a scam. Just a few months later, Mr Ivey met Brenda Campbell via a Facebook dating group. They spoke over Facebook and she told him she lived near him at Mona Vale in Sydney's north and owned an online jewellery store. Mr Ivey, who attended Knox Grammar School in Sydney, sent her a total of $11,433 via Western Union after hearing she had to fly interstate urgently with her dog. He contacted police immediately after realising it was yet another scam and was forced to delete his social media accounts, cancel his ATM cards and open new bank accounts. Despite three failed online attempts, Mr Ivey says he has finally found love and plans to propose to his girlfriend Thei when he can travel to the Philippines to meet her for the first time . In September 2012, Mr Ivey placed a dating advertisement on sydney.craiglist.com.au and was contacted by Annie - another woman living in London. She told him she wanted to come to Sydney to marry him but had to first pay legal fees on a property she had inherited in order to own it. Mr Ivey sent across $8,024 via Western Union. 'Like all of the previous scams, I kept this one hidden from my parents and friends for the fear of rejection and hurt,' he said. He told his parents of his misfortune in October 2012 and they have since monitored all of his spending and have access to his bank accounts. Despite three failed online attempts, Mr Ivey says he has finally found love and plans to propose to his girlfriend when he can travel to the Philippines to meet her for the first time. n a bid to stamp out further scams, Mr Ivey has put his parents in charge of his bank accounts and now deletes any emails Facebook friend requests from people he hasn't met in person . He believes his new partner Thei, who he met via a dating app in May last year, 'is the real thing' because he has chatted with her over a Skype - something not pursued by the other three women. 'I told her about the scams and she assured me that she wasn't a scammer herself and would never ask me for money,' he said. 'I video chatted with her on Skype and spoke with her family. This proved to me that she was the real thing. I never video chatted with any of the scammers. 'I have never met Thei in person and I am hoping to meet her when I can afford it. Once I have a plane ticket to the Philippines I will propose to Thei.' In a bid to stamp out further scams, Mr Ivey now deletes any emails Facebook friend requests from people he hasn't met in person.

"A Chinese mother who claimed she was tricked into smuggling more than three kilograms of methamphetamine into Brisbane will spend at least five years in an Australian prison. Wan Hao Wu, a 47-year-old widow, was arrested at the airport after travelling to Brisbane with her 17-year-old son in June 2013. Authorities had inspected her two suitcases and found 3.17kg of pure methamphetamine concealed in hidden compartments. Wan Hao Wu, a 47-year-old Chinese widow, was arrested after she was found trying to smuggle Ice into Brisbane airport . The haul was more than four times the commercial threshold set out in federal legislation. Ms Wu pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug. On Tuesday, prosecutor Glen Rice, QC, told the Brisbane Supreme Court Ms Wu initially declined to be interviewed by federal police, but was more forthcoming with Hong Kong police in March this year. Ms Wu claimed she was offered a lucrative deal to smuggle diamonds into Australia by an acquaintance. 'The arrangements were that she pay the travel agent 15,000 Hong Kong dollars for each of the defendant's trip and her son's trip,' Mr Rice told the court. Authorities had inspected her two suitcases and found 3.17kg of pure methamphetamine concealed in hidden compartments . 'Ms Wu also said she was promised, upon her return, 35,000 Hong Kong dollars for ... herself and her son.' Mr Rice submitted that the diamond story was 'lacking in credibility', and the defendant made no attempt to investigate it. Defence barrister Peter Nolan said Ms Wu had co-operated with authorities once she fully understood the situation. She changed her plea to guilty on Tuesday morning, after finding out her son had been flown home. Through an interpreter, Ms Wu told justice Ann Lyons that she wished to return to Hong Kong as soon as possible to care for her son. Ms Wu pleaded guilty at the Brisbane Supreme Court and was sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in an Australian prison . In sentencing, Justice Lyons said Ms Wu's change of plea had removed the need for a trial and therefore delivered a significant saving to the administration of justice. But the judge also said the defendant had acted with a 'high degree of recklessness'. Justice Lyons imposed a 10-year jail sentence with a non-parole period of five years. The judge took into account that Ms Wu's prospects of rehabilitation were good and her risk of reoffending was low. Ms Wu was told if she is released on parole after five years, she may be deported to China.","Wan Hao Wu was found trying to smuggle the methamphetamines into Brisbane in June last year .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Katie Hopkins has come under fire for 'fatshaming' after revealing how she put on four stone just to prove she can lose it again. The controversial columnist went on TV yesterday morning to tell how she has gone from from 8st 8lb to 12st so she can attempt to show how easy it is for overweight people to diet. But her latest project has been met with outrage - with many hoping the 39-year-old will never be able to lose the extra pounds. Katie Hopkins, 39, has piled on the pounds over the last three months and now weights 12st . Katie has always been slim and healthy but ate 6,500 calories per day so she could put on the weight . Several viewers took to Twitter to criticise Katie Hopkins for her . weight-loss experiment. One said she was 'ignorant' and that not . all weight gain is intentional or avoidable . After her appearance on yesterday's This Morning, others took to Twitter to criticise ITV for . allowing her 'fattist' attitude to be 'sensationalised' on air. The backlash even led to a group hashtag, #jogonKatieHopkins, being set up on the social networking site, under which viewers told the outspoken columnist exactly what they thought of her. Meanwhile, weight loss expert Steve Miller, who fronts TV show Fat Families, said Katie's latest project shows a 'shallow' approach to weightloss and does not take into account the emotional mindset of those who struggle to lose weight. He said: 'Katie has a point, that a lot of people make excuses about why they can't lose weight. And it's not expensive to lose weight. 'But it is very shallow to think it is just about food and that you can just put weight on and off. There are emotional undercurrents that have to be dealt with when someone is trying to lose weight. 'The biggest factor is the mindset and motivation, not the food. I don't think this latest project is helping anyone.' Caroline Nokes, Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image is as follows, added that Katie had taken a 'simplistic view'. She told MailOnline: ‘Whilst I certainly wish Ms . Hopkins well in her endeavours I do think she is taking a very . simplistic view of weight and is making the issue all about food. Her TV project - called To Fat And Back - will see her try to lose the weight again, in a bid to prove it is easy for those who are overweight to diet . 'Anyone . who has spent any time working with those struggling with eating . disorders knows that many people have complex and difficult . relationships with food and exercise. 'To . try to define all those who are overweight as somehow lazy or lacking . in will power does a huge disservice to the experts who have made . tackling obesity their focus. 'Whilst . I do think this project has challenged Ms Hopkins’ views as to what it . is like to be overweight, generally she has played down the emotional . aspects of gaining weight which can then lead to negative body image, . lack of self-esteem and confidence. 'However, . I do hope this publicity stunt does something to highlight the problems . we face as a nation in addressing some of the very serious issues . surrounding weight and body image.’ Katie . revealed on the show how she embarked on the scheme - 'To Fat . and Back' - after becoming sick of hearing excuses thrown around by . overweight people for their size. She is now planning on losing the weight for a TV documentary on TLC that . will air next year. Others were supportive of Katie's campaign, agreeing with her point that there should be 'no excuses' After her plans were revealed, Twitter user Molly . Mayhem wrote: 'Ignorant sow, not all weight gain is intentional/avoidable #thyroid and other illnesses play a pary #boreoff' While . Heather Lewis said: 'Shocked at sensationalising of that woman's . attitude to weight. Weight loss is a struggle. Fact. #jogonKatieHopkins'. The former Apprentice contestant is well-known for her outspoken views. She previously told an obese woman on This Morning  that . she wouldn't employ her because fat people give off the impression that . they are lazy. 'People have always said to me, ""You're lucky, you're skinny,"" and I just don't think these excuses are cutting it any more. 'I saw a . story the other day about how the curtains in your bedroom not being . thick enough could be making you fat. I just thought, we have to put an . end to this.' Some have said Katie's latest project - which saw her consume a high fat and sugar diet - is not helping anyone . Her comments led to a wave of Twitter users urging Katie to fail in her attempt to lose weight. One . user wrote: 'I'm praying to all the Gods that Katie Hopkins doesn't . manage to lose weight' while another said: 'God I hope she struggles to . lose it.' But although several viewers were offended by her comments, there were some who supported Katie's view. Kirsty Oldfield took to Twitter to say she 'couldn't agree more', while another said Katie Hopkins had come across as 'compassionate and relatively understanding'. Another said it was 'important' for the obesity crisis in the UK that Katie carries out this experiment. But . Ilona Burton, a mental health campaigner, warned in an article in the . Radio Times that the 'experimental' challenge-based weight loss would . not address the . issue behind obesity. She said it was about those who have 'struggled for years' or feel 'hopeless or depressed'. She wrote: 'Hopkins might dip her foot . in but she'll quickly pull it out and shake it off. In a clip shown on the programme, the columnist is seen breaking down in . tears and saying 'I hate fat people for making me do this' - which . provoked a lot of angry reaction. Others said she could be doing more worthwhile projects, pictured top . 'We need to listen . to those who have struggled for years, who can't afford to buy fresh . fruit and vegetables, who don't have the provisions or services they . need to help them along the way, who might have given up trying and feel . hopeless or depressed.' Writing in the Huffington Post, writer Julie Creffield also criticised Katie Hopkins' latest project. She said: 'I can't speak on behalf of fat people because I . am only one of them, but in my own current state of fatness I can tell . you this: I am fully aware of the excuses we sometimes use and I am . actually an advocate of dropping the excuses too, but not in terms of . weightloss or overeating but rather in terms of living a happier more . healthier life where food isn't the enemy, and allowing fat people who . chose to remain fat to be allowed to do so.' Speaking on the programme, Katie defended what she was doing and said it had even helped her see things from a different perspective. She said: 'It turns out that the reason I like to stay super strong and very slim is that I suffer from epilepsy. Jess Bevan said she agreed with the controversial columnist, top, and Kirsty Oldfield, bottom, also said she 'couldn't agree more' with Katie Hopkins's view . 'So . I want to be able to show I'm still as strong as the next person, that . just because my arm dislocates 36 times a year because I have fits, I am . still fit and able. 'So it's actually a similar reason for being thin to other people's reasons for being fat. It's about me now saying that I realise my skinny self was my armour. 'So . for me so far, halfway through this project the conclusion has been . that there are reasons for being overweight, but there are still no . excuses. 'But . also, I want to say let's recognise that I'm not lucky to be skinny, . it's eating too much and no exercise that make you like that.' She added: 'I'm sick of being like this - I'm sick of the feeling of my . stomach sitting on my legs - it's tiring being this fat, carrying all of . this around. Katie said piling on the weight has been a traumatic experience for her and said it made her cry for the first time in years . 'My idea is . not to lose weight like one of those celeb people - I'm not going to . have a nutritionist, a trainer or access to a posh gym - I'm just going . to put my old trainers on and get to it. 'We can all come up with excuses. I'm just trying to say, have you actually got excuses? 'What's . so great about this whole project is that there's a whole league of men . and women who want to come on this journey to lose the weight with me . now. Kind of like a ""Lose it with Katie.""' In . her column for the Sun at the weekend, Katie revealed that being . overweight was the first thing to make her cry for a long time. She said: 'I didn’t . cry at my weddings. I didn’t cry giving birth. But gaining weight . reduced me to a blubbering wreck. Katie has made no secret of the fact she struggles to sympathise with those who are overweight . 'I hate everything about being . fat. I hate the way it feels. My thighs chafe against each other and are . sore, my belly sits on top of my thighs and my boobs get in the way.' A spokeswoman for the channel which will be airing the programme said: 'Katie has been very outspoken about her prejudices towards overweight people. 'This . documentary will confront her attitudes and put her beliefs to the . test, by following her own physical and emotional journey as she gains . and loses weight, whilst exploring the broader issues of body image in . our society.'

"By . Associated Press . An Ohio National Guardsman suspected of sexually abusing three adopted daughters and his stepdaughter also is accused of abruptly sending a fourth adopted daughter out of state and threatening the children in the family with a similar fate to keep them from talking about what they knew, according to court documents. The 41-year-old Marysville man, who told a military publication years ago that he wanted to adopt a girl from Africa to protect her from rape, was originally charged last year. He is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Union County court on an updated indictment with 35 counts, including rape, sexual battery, gross sexual imposition, intimidation and tampering with evidence. Shocking: An active Ohio National Guardsman has pleaded not guilty to charges he sexually molested three of his adopted daughter and a stepdaughter over the course of years. Prosecutors said the children ranged in age from 2 to 8. Up to 11 children at some point lived with the man and his wife at their home in Marysville, Ohio . Court documents indicate the girls were under 13 at the time, with one as young as 5. Messages seeking comment were left for the man's attorney E. Darren McNeal, whose legal assistant said McNeal won't discuss the case. The defendant and his wife, who is accused of intimidation and obstruction but not abuse, entered not-guilty pleas to the initial charges against them. The Associated Press isn't naming them to protect the children's identities. Prosecutors allege in court documents that the man touched the girls in inappropriate, sexual ways at different times and forced two of them to perform sex acts on him. Prosecutors say the girls reported abuse to a different adoptive daughter who shared that information with relatives and was sent away in July 2012. The man and his wife picked up the girl from a volunteering shift and put her on a flight to Idaho against her will, without a chance to get her belongings, according to the limited details described in court documents. Coercion: The Guardsman not only is accused of sex crimes, but also of using one of his adopted daughter's fear of being sent away by yet another family to coerce her into not telling anyone what she knew. The wife, too, is believed by prosecutors to have helped coerce the child. The girl, a native of Haiti, eventually revealed what she allegedly knew to family members . At a park before church the following Sunday, the couple gathered the remaining children — nine of them, include the four accusers — and told them that there were false statements being made about the man and that any child who discussed those matters 'would go away' like the other girl, prosecutors said in court documents. An updated indictment filed this summer against the man's wife includes 13 intimidation-related charges and an evidence-tampering count related to the girl who was sent out of state. The 37-year-old woman also is charged with a single count of obstructing justice; prosecutors say she falsely told police that the children denied the sexual assault allegations and that she intimidated one of the girls so she would write a letter to that effect. The wife's attorney, Jason Despetorich, also said he isn't commenting on the case while it is pending. Terry Hord, the Union County chief assistant prosecuting attorney handling the case, said he couldn't provide an update on the status of the children or where they live, but he said none now lives with the father who is charged. The Guardsman remains a major with an Ohio National Guard unit out of Springfield and works one weekend per month, according to the organization's community relations office. Sick crimes: The man is charged with nearly three dozen crimes including rape and tampering with evidence. His wife is charged with intimidation and obstruction. Neither he nor the wife are being named in this report in order to protect the identity of the children .","The Marysville, Ohio man, 41, is charged with 35 counts including rape and tampering with evidence - one victim was as young as 5 .

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . Shocking: Cynthia Bell, 66, was stabbed with a pen by a thug while on a day out at the seaside . A 66-year-old wife was stabbed with a pen by a thug while on a day out at the seaside. Cynthia Bell, whose husband runs a coach tour firm, was waiting alone on the bus in Blackpool, when two women and a man climbed on board. The mother-of-two, from County Durham, was left terrified and protected her face with her arms when the man plunged the pen deep into her right arm, narrowly missing her vital arteries. Retired administration worker Mrs Bell was left in agony on the coach as the thugs fled from the scene. She was given gas and air as paramedics prised the pen from her arm - leaving her with a nasty wound and severe bruising. She said: ‘I decided to go with (my husband) Norman on the trip to Blackpool and we’d pulled over while waiting for passengers. We had the engine running so we could keep the air conditioning on because it was a really hot day. ‘Then I saw these three people walking on and I honestly thought they were going to steal the bus - it was absolutely frightening. The man came up to me so I lifted my arms up to protect myself but he stabbed me with the pen. It went right through my skin and narrowly missed my vital arteries. If it had been an inch further up or down who knows what would have happened?’ The thugs ran off empty-handed as Mrs Bell was left in agony on the coach for 15 minutes while waiting for paramedics to arrive. Mr Bell, 69, has been running Bell Brothers coaches for 42 years - and his wife only went on the trip to enjoy a day out. Agony: Mrs Bell, a retired administration worker, was given gas and air as paramedics prised the pen from her arm - leaving her with a nasty wound and severe bruising . She said: ‘It was a really bizarre . attack. They just shouted at me then the man grabbed the pen and stabbed . me with it. It was incredibly painful and it was very sore for days . after it was taken out. ‘I just hope the police manage to track these thugs down before they do anything else.’ In a later interview, Mrs Bell said from her home in Spennymoor: ‘The picture is horrible but it could have been worse. It was lucky that it missed all the veins and didn't do any internal damage. ‘At the moment it is still scabbed and scarred but I hope it will be fine.’ Officers are now on the hunt for the three thugs and are calling for anyone with information about the attack, on August 24 at about 5pm, to come forward. DS Mark Dickinson from Blackpool CID said: ‘As you can see from Mrs Bell’s photograph, significant force must have been used by offender who stabbed her. Seaside visit: Mrs Bell only went on the trip to Blackpool (file pictured) in Lancashire to enjoy a day out . ‘She was lucky to have escaped without serious blood loss or any nerve damage. We are pursuing a number of lines of enquiry including CCTV and forensic opportunities. 'It went right through my skin and narrowly missed my vital arteries. If it had been an inch further up or down who knows what would have happened?' Cynthia Bell . ‘I am particularly keen to identify and speak with two young women who were with the offender and I would ask them, or anyone who recognises them from their descriptions, to contact me as soon as possible.’ The male offender is described as being white, 6ft, of stocky build and in his late teens or early twenties with short dark hair. Police described one of the women as a white female who was wearing a pink top with a floral pattern. She was said to be pushing a pram or pushchair and walked with a limp. The other woman was described as having blonde hair, wearing a cream jumper and had a tattoo on the right side of her lower stomach.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Matt Chorley, MailOnline Political Editor . The 'mob mentality' which has blighted the Scottish independence debate has been turned off, senior Labour MP Jim Murphy claimed today as he returned to the campaign trail for this first time since being pelted with eggs. The Labour frontbencher, addressing a crowd in Edinburgh today, accused the Yes campaign of 'co-ordinating' attacks and intimidation against those opposed to breaking up the UK. As the polls narrow, to give the No campaign a slender six-point lead, both sides in the debate have pleaded for calm after physical and verbal attacks on leading political figures and activists. Labour MP Jim Murphy was handed a dozen eggs as he returned to the campaign trail, after being egged last week . Arriving in Edinburgh with his Irn Bru crates, which he stands on to address crowds, he was welcomed by a newspaper reporter dressed as a chicken clutching eggs . Mr Murphy gave a passionate defence of the union to the waiting crowds, as he warned the vote on independence is 'the most important decision we're ever going to take' Alistair Darling, who is leading the Better Together campaign against independence, is to hold talks with police about the risk of intimidation before and on polling day. It follows a turbulent week on the campaign trail which saw senior Mr Murphy suspend his nationwide tour amid claims of organised intimidation by Yes supporters after being pelted with eggs. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond was also involved in a 'road rage' incident, where he was chased in his car by someone waving a No sign at him. Today Mr Murphy returned to his pro-Union 100 Streets In 100 Days tour, claiming the 'noisy tap of mob mentality' has been turned off. A kilted No supporter played the pipes as he mounted his Irn-Bru crates to cheers outside the Royal Scottish Academy Building off the city's Princes Street. Mr Murphy, who was pelted with eggs as he spoke in Kirkcaldy, Fife, last week, was also greeted by a tabloid reporter dressed as a chicken and brandishing two dozen eggs. He was heckled only once as he addressed the crowd of about 300 supporters, many sporting No Thanks badges and signs. There was a noticeable police presence at the event, with two police cars and four officers visible. Speaking after addressing the crowd, Mr Murphy said: 'Whoever turned on the noisy tap of that kind of mob mentality over the past fortnight has quietly turned it off over the weekend and I think that's good for the referendum, and it's great for the campaign because we can now have a really passionate debate about the future of our country. 'We can get back to talking about the pound, pensions, who's going to pay for our public services with independence.' Mr Murphy denied he had overreacted by cancelling his tour and insisted that he had been the subject of co-ordinated attacks. He said: 'It's clear in the past fortnight - you can see on all the social media sites - that that was co-ordinated by the Yes Scotland offices at a local level.' He said he was looking forward to the remaining stops on his journey but refused to comment on whether the police presence would continue. Mr Murphy added: 'Everyone on both sides of this argument should be able to passionately argue their case because this is the biggest decision we're going to take as a country. 'This is the most important decision we're ever going to take. It's irreversible. Once it's done, it's done, there's no going back and if it doesn't work out the way that nice man Mr Salmond tells us, we can't take it back to the shops. 'There's absolutely no guarantees with independence, which is why it's important to have this style of politics and make sure all our questions are answered.' There were amicable scenes today as pro-independence campaigners clutching a Yes flag stood in front of pro-unionists who want to keep the UK together . A kilted No supporter played the pipes as Mr Murphy mounted his Irn-Bru crates to cheers outside the Royal Scottish Academy Building off Princes Street in Edinburgh . He dismissed the suggestion that the Yes campaign has the momentum in the debate, with a new poll showing support for Scottish independence has risen eight points in a month . Mr Murphy said: 'The No campaign is in the lead and if you ask me which campaign I'd rather be with - the No or the Yes campaign - then I'd rather be with the leading campaign, the patriotic No campaign. 'The thing that worries me isn't the opinion polls, it's the fact that with a fortnight to go we still don't know what currency Scotland would use if we're independent. Those are real worries.' Election officials say they are braced for a huge turnout on September 18, and plans are being drawn up to cope with large crowds and the threat of trouble at some polling stations. Mr Muprhy was egged last week and forced to suspend his '100 Streets' tour after clashing with crowds in Kirkaldy . Mr Murphy accused Yes Scotland of 'organising for mobs to turn up at each meeting to try and intimidate me, which won't work, and to try and silence undecided voters' Mr Darling said yesterday: 'In a campaign such as this, we need to ensure the debate is conducted in a reasonable way. 'The eyes of the world are on Scotland for the next two and a half weeks. 'Intimidation, whether it is on the internet or on the street, or making people afraid to say what they think, it's got no place in any democratic society and we should have absolutely zero tolerance of it.' He added: 'I want this to be a debate that is argued with passion, there are passions on both sides of the argument, quite rightly so. 'But it has to be argued in a way that is reasonable. Then we will decide on September 18 in which way the future of Scotland lies.' The former chancellor spoke out on the issue as he launched a new Better Together poster campaign in Greenock, Inverclyde. 'We've had discussions with the police, I think they are very conscious that people have got to be allowed to have their say, but there is a mark over which you should not step,' he added. 'I don't care where it comes from, which side it's from, it has got no place in the referendum debate.' Better Together leader Alistair Darling and his opponent, First Minister Alex Salmond, have both issued public pleas for calm and an end to threats . The latest YouGov poll shows a sharp narrowing in the lead for the No campaign ahead of the independence referendum on September 18 . The Yes campaign is now just six points behind in the battle for independence, suggesting Alex Salmond has the momentum . Mr Salmond also condemned any intimidation from any side. The First Minister said: 'Somebody was convicted, of course, of online threats against me. Somebody thought his car should be a political weapon. There was a woman, a Yes campaigner, assaulted on the streets of Glasgow. 'I don't hold press conferences accusing Mr Murphy of orchestrating these events, because I know that would be ridiculous to do so.' Mary Pitcaithly, the Chief Counting Officer overseeing the referendum, has discussed security with Police Scotland, given the prospect of a high turnout for the vote. Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins told the Herald newspaper: 'The referendum is a significant event which is expected to attract a higher than normal turnout. 'Policing arrangements for the referendum are well in hand and will be appropriate and proportionate.'","Yes and No campaigns both appeal for calm and an end to intimidation .

"By . Matt Chorley, MailOnline Political Editor . An independent Scotland would be blocked from joining the European Union if Alex Salmond ploughs ahead with his 'bonkers idea' of using the pound, it emerged tonight. Brussels chief Olli Rehn warned it 'would simply not be possible' to become an EU nation if Edinburgh did not have control of its own currency. Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander said the revelation meant an independent Scotland would have to choose between 'using the pound like Panama uses the dollar, or joining the EU'. Scroll down for video . Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro until July this year, warned it 'would simply not be possible' to become an EU nation if Edinburgh did not have control of its own currency . In his letter to Treasury minister Danny Alexander, Mr Rehn said a country wanting to join the EU would need to have an independent central bank and the 'will and expected capacity' to join the euro . Doubts about the currency Scotland would use if it leaves the UK have dominated the debate ahead of the independence referendum on September 18. Mr Salmond has insisted it would continue to use the pound, entering a currency union with the remaining countries in the Union. But Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems have all ruled out the plan, making it impossible whoever wins next year's Westminister general election. In a speech tonight Mr Alexander released details of a letter from Mr Rehn, who spent a decade as a European Commissioner, including four years as European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro until July this year. Mr Rehn insisted that any country which wants to join the EU must be 'committed' to the Economic and Monetary Union of the EU. It means they must have the 'will and expected capacity to meet the convergence criteria of euro membership in due course' as well as their own independent central bank. But if Scotland is using the pound governed from London, it will not have control of bits own currency. Mr Rehn added: 'As to the question whether 'sterlingisation' were compatible with EU membership, the answer is that this would simply not be possible, since that would obviously imply a situation where the candidate country concerned would not have a monetary authority of its own and thus no necessary instruments of the EMU.' Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander said the revelation meant an independent Scotland would have to choose between 'using the pound like Panama uses the dollar, or joining the EU' The revelation from a senior Eurocrat will be seized on by opponents of independence as proof Scotland would be cut adrift from Europe if Mr Salmond goes it alone. In a speech to Chatham House this evening on Scotland's place in the world, Mr Alexander said: 'No country has ever joined the EU while using only the currency of another country at the point of accession. 'Today we learn that that option is incompatible with EU Membership. 'So an independent Scotland would face a simple choice – using the pound like Panama uses the dollar, or joining the EU. 'It can't have both. This shows yet again the nationalists failure to put forward a credible currency plan and the dangers it poses to the people of Scotland.' First Minister Alex Salmond, on a visit to the Eden Brewery in Guardbridge, near St Andrews in Fife, said the latest polls were 'very encouraging' The latest YouGov poll shows a sharp narrowing in the lead for the No campaign ahead of the independence referendum on September 18 . The Yes campaign is now just six points behind in the battle for independence, suggesting Alex Salmond has the momentum . It marks an escalation in the bitter row over the future of the Scottish currency, with Mr Salmond toasting a 'very encouraging' opinion poll which shows the gap between the Yes and No campaigns has narrowed to just six points. Support for the Yes vote has surged following the First Minister's triumph in last week's TV debate against former Chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of the Better Together campaign. The YouGov survey for The Times and The Sun showed 48 per cent plan to vote No, 42 per cent back the Yes campaign and 10 per cent remain undecided.","Olli Rehn insists countries joining the EU must have own central bank .

"By . Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . and Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . The bisexual soldier involved in the topless barmaids controversy has spoken out, in an attempt to 'set the record straight' and stop the military from 'screwing over another great soldier' by fixing a system 'willing to manipulate and lie to get rid of those they don't like'. Following a sexual encounter with an another solider, Corporal Ezekiel Wilkinson's sexuality became widely known in the Defence Force, which he believes prompted an investigation into him allegedly dealing peptides, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Mr Wilkinson insists the intimacy between him and the other soldier was consensual, despite text messages he received. Angered by the investigation, Mr Wilkinson's mother, without her son's knowledge, exposed photos of topless barmaids from a base in WA in an attempt to prove 'double standards' in Defence's attitude to her son's bisexuality. The bisexual solder involved in the topless barmaids controversy has spoken out, in an attempted to 'set the record straight' Corporal Ezekiel Wilinson said once his relationship between him and the other solider became public, complaints about his alleged dealing of peptides began . 'What you did was so wrong on so many levels... what you did to me when I was trying to go to bed was f**ked-up.' He said once his relationship between him and the other solider became public, complaints about his alleged dealing of peptides began. 'I have been isolated from my military friends... I am being discriminated against,' he said. But a Defence spokesman said, 'Defence maintains its commitment to an inclusive and diverse workplace and does not investigate matters based on member's sexual orientation.' The 29-year-old Afghanistan veteran denied dealing in peptides, and said he bought them legally in Australia to treat his neck injury he suffered in Afghanistan, after an improvised explosive blew up near him. The controversial barmaid photos, which appeared on ninemsn, show soldiers in the company of topless women, one of whom is tattooed and blonde. Defence banned the barmaids from attending the Gratwick Club which is located next to the Special Air Service Regiment barracks in Swanbourne, Western Australia. A soldier's mother exposed photos of topless barmaids at Gratwick Club in Western Australia in an attempt to prove 'double standards' in Defence's attitude to her son's bisexuality . Defence has since banned the barmaids from attending the Gratwick Club . Another photo shows a brunette woman with pink nail polish holding up a peace sign in the foreground of a photo, with uniformed soldiers pictured sitting at tables in the background. The mother of a former special forces soldier, who uncovered the photos, claims her son has been mistreated over his sexuality. He's being investigated  by Defence over allegations he bought illegal medicine. She says the allegations are false and only occurred after officers discovered her son was bisexual in April, and show a 'double standard' in the defence force because topless barmaids are allowed in government-owned clubs. 'The actual allegations (about the medicine) themselves have come from a person who had issues with my son's sexuality,' she told the Herald. 'He is being discriminated against because of his sexuality, about which he was open, by the same management that condones women being exploited in the manner of those photographs.' This comes amid mounting calls for a royal commission into the military's handling of abuse claims and the abolition of the Australian Defence Force Academy following a number of claims over the past two decades that cadets and soldiers were assaulted and raped. Recently ABC TV's Four Corners program aired fresh stories from four former female cadets who claim to have been raped, sexually assaulted or denigrated while at ADFA in the 1990s and 2009. The women criticised the military's response to abuse claims - the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce - as inadequate. They have also been joined by former Australian Defence Force magistrate Ken Northwood, Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie and lawyer Gary Rumble - who led a review into ADFA abuse allegations - in calling for a royal commission to fully uncover the extent of abuse and hold the perpetrators to account. The Gratwick Club is next to the Campbell Barracks, located in Swanbourne in WA .","The bisexual solider at the centre of the topless barmaid row has spoken out to 'set the record straight'

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . Popular: Boxer Dale Lincoln, 21, from South Shields, had defended a regional title three years in a row . A talented boxer has been found dead after a member of the public saw a car dropping from the top of a cliff. The alarm was sounded yesterday just two hours after the man was reported missing from his home in South Shields, South Tyneside. A volunteer lifeboat crew found the body of a man, named locally as popular regional title winner Dale Lincoln, 21, along with a Citroen car near the beach in the suburb of Marsden. The driver had been reported missing to Northumbria Police at 7.45am yesterday, a spokesman said. The car was then seen falling from the top of the cliffs at 10am near the local Grotto pub. Police, paramedics, fire crews, the coastguard and the RNLI attended the scene, but the driver was found dead. A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: 'Police received a report that a car had gone over the cliffs at just after 10am. 'Emergency services were sent to the scene, where the driver of the car was found dead. 'It is believed to be linked to an earlier report of a missing person from South Shields. Officers have informed the next of kin and are providing support to them at this time.' The car was lifted from the beach and recovered as part of the investigation. Police are still investigating the circumstances around the death but said there is not thought to have been any third-party involvement. A spokesman for Tynemouth RNLI added: 'The body was recovered by emergency services and the volunteer lifeboat crew took him to South Shields ferry landing, where they were met by funeral directors.' Nicknamed The Kid, Mr Lincoln had successfully defended the regional Tyne Tees and Wear 57 kilo title for three years in a row. In a tragic coincidence, he was the second member of South Shields' Horsley Hill Amateur Boxing Club to die in just three months. Picturesque: Emergency services including the RNLI at the scene of the incident yesterday in South Shields . Police are still investigating the circumstances around the death but said there is not thought to have been any third-party involvement. South Shields' Horsley Hill Amateur Boxing Club was closed as a mark of respect . Fellow fighter Grant Adams, 17, fatally cut his throat in June after falling onto a sunbed in a freak accident at his home. Last week members of the club raised £3,500 for Grant's newborn daughter and the Great North Air Ambulance in his memory. The club's gym was shut yesterday as a mark of respect. The cause of the latest death is still being investigated. However, other people have died at the same range of cliffs, sparking renewed calls for more to be done to stop tragedies happening. Police, paramedics, fire crews, the coastguard and the RNLI attended the scene, but the driver was found dead . South Shields resident and campaigner Jean Costello, whose son Stephen Heslop took his own life at the same cliffs in 2007, said: 'There are too many deaths happening here. 'Someone, somewhere has to take a look at it. I don’t know what can be done, but surely there has to be something. 'My heart goes out to his family - it’s just a tragedy.' There was also a death at the same range in July, when 26-year-old Karl Carson's body was found after he 'escaped' from a police vehicle near the clifftop where he was being held after an arrest.","Man had been reported missing just two hours earlier in South Shields .

"By . Matt Chorley, MailOnline Political Editor . David Cameron today revealed how the pictures of critically ill Ashya King alone in a Spanish hospital have brought back memories of his own son Ivan, who died at the age of just six. The Prime Minister urged a 'rapid outbreak of common sense' to reunite five-year-old Ashya with his family, as his parents Brett and Naghmeh King were being held in a Madrid high security prison. Spanish prosecutors said this afternoon they will argue the couple should be released and a judge is likely to agree to free them when they appear before a Madrid court tomorrow morning. Scroll down for video . David and Samantha Cameron with their disabled son Ivan, who died in 2009 at the age of six . Alone: Ashya King has been separated from his family and remains under police guard in a hospital hundreds of miles from his parents . In a rare personal reflection, Mr Cameron said images of Ashya being treated in hospital had revived memories of Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and epilepsy. He died in 2009. In an interview with LBC, Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'I obviously, like everyone else in the country, want to see this poor little boy re-united with his parents. 'Watching the pictures of him brought back memories of my desperately ill young boy, Ivan, and I remember him endlessly sitting on my lap and having to feed him through a tube and having to deal with all of the difficulties of having a desperately ill child.' Ashya's parents took him to Spain from Southampton General Hospital without consent last Thursday in the hope they could sell their holiday home on the Costa del Sol to raise money for specialist brain cancer treatment not available on the NHS. Since Saturday night the five-year-old has been separated from his family and only his older brother Danny, 23, has been able to see him at Málaga's Hospital Materno-Infanti, where the brain cancer patient is being guarded by armed police. The Crown Prosecution Service told the High Court this afternoon they will withdraw their European Arrest Warrant, drop child cruelty charges and also abandon plans to force them to return to the UK. Mr Cameron said: 'I welcome the prosecution against Ashya King's parents being dropped. It's important this little boy gets treatment and the love of his family.' More than 110,000 people have signed a petition demanding that Mr Cameron intervene to have the King's released. Supporters today went to Downing Street to hand in the petition at Number 10. Direct action: Family campaigner Sanjay Ganatra and the King's friend Ethan hand a petition into Downing Street asking the PM to reunite Ashya with his parents . Extraordinary support: More than 110,000 people have signed a petition demanding that David Cameron intervenes to have King's released . Ashya King is in the Materno Infantil Hospital in Malaga, southern Spain, and has only been able to see his oldest brother . Mr Cameron insisted: 'The Government must not tell the police how to act or what to do, nor can we interfere in processes in other countries. 'I just hope there'll be an outbreak of common sense and a rapid outbreak of common sense so that the family can be re-united with this young boy and the best treatment can be given to him either in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.' He insisted the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is 'doing his bit to make sure we examine our own procedures here in the UK'. It comes as a political chorus grew calling for the King family to be reunited. Nick Clegg said today it is 'not appropriate' to 'throw the full force of the law' at the case and Boris Johnson blasted the 'potty' decision because 'parents and a suffering child should be united'. Former children's minister Tim Loughton said the biggest outrage was that Ashya's case had almost become a child protection issue and his parents were being criminalised when that was 'clearly not the case'. The Tory MP said an arrest warrant should not have been issued and that Mr and Mrs King should not be in custody. He said: 'The CPS needs to drop this and make sure the parents come out and go and see their child. 'A very urgent conversation needs to be had with the NHS as to whether they will entertain grounds of them coming back here and going to a private clinic for proton beam treatment, which should be NHS or privately funded, or they should be allowed to take Ashya to Prague.' Tory chairman Grant Shapps wrote on Twitter: 'Have to say that if my child was in hospital and I wanted them treated elsewhere, I would hope that the courts would not intervene.'","Prime Minister recalls his own 'desperately ill young boy' who died in 2009 .

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . Ted Smith thinks it was fate that first brought him to Tukurua. He started renting a room at the sprawling beachfront estate in Cottesloe, Perth in the 1970s and struck up a great friendship with its owner, Dorothea Cass, and for years he helped her take care of the 5000 sq m property and gardens. When Miss Cass died in 1994 she had never married or had children and she left the entire heritage-listed estate to him. Now he's put it on the market and the iconic property is set to sell for more than $50 million. Mr Smith, now 80, has been taking care of the property on his own for two decades and he's ready to move on. Ted Smith, 80, is set to make more than $50 million when he sells the historic Tukurua mansion on the beachfront in Cottesloe, Perth . The property's previous owner Dorothea Cass, pictured right with Mr Smith in the 1980s, left the historic mansion to him when she died in 1994 . Real Estate agent Frank Torre said the property had had a lot of interest from Chinese and local investors . 'I've been here for 43 years so I think it's time to down size,' Mr Smith told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Smith, who was born in Ireland in 1934, moved into the house aged 37. He had moved to Australia some years earlier because he suffered from emphysema and asthma and wanted to be in a warmer, drier climate. 'I never got married because I left Ireland and I was in very poor health and that's why I came to Australia,' he said. He spent time in various parts of WA working in agriculture and catering while also trading shares on the side, but in 1971 he wanted to get more involved in the share market so he moved back to Perth and got a job in the old Swan Brewery's share registry. Mr Smith started renting a room at the sprawling beachfront estate in Cottesloe, Perth in the 1970s and struck up a great friendship with Miss Cass . For 23 years Mr Smith helped Miss Cass take care of the sprawling gardens and do repairs around the estate . At the same time he moved into Tukurua, leasing a room off Miss Cass, who was about 63 at the time. Miss Cass had inherited the property from her parents Berry and Catherine Cass, who ran the property as a boarding house and military headquarters throughout World War II. Heritage listing documents state that when the property passed to Miss Cass in 1943 'a condition of inheritance was that Miss Cass did not marry'. Mr Smith said he wasn't sure it that was true. 'I don't know about that, she never told me,' he said. 'But I've heard that rumour… rumours can be good and bad. She never did get married.' Mr Smith says it's time for him to downsize from the sprawling property . The property at 1-9 Rosendo Street, Cottesloe is 5001 sq m and has had a lot of interest from Chinese and local investors . Mr Smith spent six years and more than $5 million restoring Tukurua . After Mr Smith moved in the pair soon struck up a friendship. He was studying metaphysics at night school and Miss Cass, one of the first women in WA to get a university degree, loved talking about religion. 'That's where Dorothea and I had a bond, she was very interested in religious studies and metaphysics and I was too,' he said. 'It was a very interesting time, she was very, very well-educated and very qualified in English. 'So that was a bond for us both. We had a lot of discussion in the evenings and at weekends.' Miss Cass (pictured left aged 18) was one of the first women in WA to graduate from university. Pictured right is her UWA Bachelor of Arts certificate from 1945 . Tukurua is of great cultural significance to WA, as it was built in 1896 by WA's first attorney general Sir Septimus Burt to be his holiday home . Humble beginnings: This is how the property looked before extensive restoration . When Alan Bond purchased the Swan Brewery in 1981 Mr Smith stopped working there, but continued trading shares as well as helping Miss Cass with the upkeep of the estate. 'After the brewery I did share trading and as time went on, when Dorothea got more feeble, there was more to be done as far as minding the property and doing repairs,' he said. 'And of course with 5000 sq m it's quite a large piece of land and there were always things to do, repairs to be done.' Miss Cass moved into a nursing home in 1993, and Mr Smith stayed to take care of Tukurua. Miss Cass had inherited the property from her parents Berry and Catherine Cass, who ran the property as a boarding house and military headquarters throughout World War II . Heritage listing documents state that when the property passed to Miss Cass in 1943 'a condition of inheritance was that Miss Cass did not marry' When she died the next year, aged 86, she left the entire property to him, which he said was a 'big surprise' and something he only found out Miss Cass was planning to do very late in her life. 'Because, like us all, she couldn't take it with her,' he said. 'And because she trusted me and she always recognised that I was good with finances and I didn't squander money and I didn't drink alcohol.' In 1994 it was valued at $4 million. Now, it is set to sell for well over $50 million. Mr Smith spent six years between 2003 and 2009 restoring the historic property at a cost of more than $5 million. Mr Smith, who was born in Ireland in 1934, moved into the house aged 37. He and Miss Cass, then aged about 64, soon struck up a friendship . Miss Cass moved into a nursing home in 1993, and Mr Smith stayed to take care of Tukurua. When she died the next year, aged 84, she left the entire property to him . Tukurua is of great cultural significance to WA, as it was built in 1896 by WA's first attorney general Sir Septimus Burt to be his holiday home. 'I didn't have any option, the house was in very, very bad disrepair,' Mr Smith said of the restoration. 'I started with the roof which was in appalling condition and we had put a whole new roof on and then we couldn't stop, one thing led to another. 'I didn't start out with the intention of a complete rebuild but it went on and on and on.' At the time it was valued at $4 million. Now, it is set to sell for well over $50 million . When Mr Smith moves out after 43 years he hopes to find a place to live nearby in Cottesloe with a big garden . Mr Smith said there were lots of different things that could happen to the house when it sold – including it being broken up into 10 separate blocks of land and developed. 'Definitely there are lots of options and it could be a beautiful home for some wealthy people or it could be developed with quite a lot of apartments, all depending on who the buyer is,' he said. 'I can't control that aspect when it's out of my hands but it would be very nice to see say a wealthy family and big family, hopefully, having a very beautiful home.' When Mr Smith moves out after 43 years he hopes to find a place to live nearby in Cottesloe with a big garden. 'I live a very simple, humble life and I like it that way because too many people are making too much noise,' he said. 'I like to study and read and listen to classical music, which Dorothea liked very much too.'","Ted Smith, 80, started renting a room at Tukurua in Cottesloe in the 1970s .

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . Barrister Simon Watters is now banned from hosting future events at North Cottesloe primary school . A Perth barrister, who allegedly mocked homosexuals, ethnic groups and billionaire Gina Rinehart at a primary school quiz night, is now banned from being the MC at future events, but he doesn't see what all of the fuss is about. Simon Watters shocked some attendees at the North Cottesloe Primary School event on Friday with 'a relentless bombardment of sexist, racist, homophobic and xenophobic utterances', according to local website The Starfish. Many guests reportedly booed as he used the terms `f**gots' and `frogs, wogs and Nazis', and asked the crowd if any of them was 'a Thalidomide child'. He is also reported to have made an insulting comment about Australian mining heiress Gina Rinehart's appearance to the startled 250-odd crowd. Mr Watters said it was upsetting that people on one table didn't see the humour as it was intended. 'No comments were made to offend anyone,' Mr Watters told AAP. 'In fact, much of the humour was directed at myself and friends in the audience.' 'The next day, so many people rang me to say that they had not laughed so much for a long time.' Mr Watters said he was bewildered by the focus on his comments, which he thought were 'quite tame' compared to many stand-up comedy acts. The barrister said he did his best to coax as much money as possible from the audience during the event, which raised about $50,000 for the school. P&C president Celia Patrick said the barrister had hosted the event two years prior and was a popular choice for quizmaster, and had apologised to those he may have offended. Ms Patrick said it was only a small group of guests that were upset by some of the comments and the P&C had only received positive feedback about the evening, which was attended by about 260 people. One parent who attended the night told AAP the barrister was joking among friends and they did not hear him make any racist comments. North Cottesloe Primary School principal Wayne Press said Mr Watters would not be hosting events for the school (pictured) in the future . Mr Watters described his comments as tame compared to many other comedy acts . However, Principal Wayne Press, who was there on the night, said in a statement that the barrister made several deeply offensive and hurtful remarks, and would not be invited to MC future school events. 'Many members of the school community worked extremely hard to organise the event,' Mr Press said. 'Unfortunately, the MC, who is not a member of our school community and was invited by the P&C, made a number of remarks during the evening which were deeply offensive and hurtful. 'I would like to state clearly that these offensive comments in no way reflect the values of our school.' Mr Press said the barrister would not be invited to MC any events at the school in the future. 'I will be working with the school board and the P&C to develop stronger protocols for the hosting, compering and running of future events so these unacceptable actions do not occur,' he said. Mr Press added while some humour is appropriate at a primary school quiz night, some of the comments went beyond what would be deemed reasonable.","A barrister has offended people at a school trivia night in Perth .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . Steven Lumb, 56, from Stackstead, Lancashire, has carried out 162 offences over the last 43 years and committed his first burglary when he was just 13 . A criminal who has spent 44 years committing crimes but managing to avoid jail with an array of excuses has escaped prison again – by claiming he stole Marks & Spencer steaks to feed his dog because his benefits were cut. Steven Lumb, 56, from Stackstead, Lancashire, has carried out a total of 162 offences over the last four decades and committed his first burglary when he was just 13. However, despite his prolific history, he has regularly been given 'chances' by courts after blaming his crimes on an array of excuses. Over the years he has come up with a string of excuses including a drink and drugs habit, a claim he had been committing crime for so long it was 'difficult' to give it up, warning judges that going to prison would mean losing his home - and even blaming one theft on a bout of 'insomnia.' Last July, just four months after being given a further suspended jail term imposed for yet another raid, he was caught stealing three steaks from his local Marks and Spencer store. But at Burnley Crown Court, jobless Lumb was spared jail again after claiming he was stealing the £6 steaks to feed his new pet dog as his state benefits had been cut. Instead of being jailed, his 12-month suspended sentence was extended by six months and he was ordered to attend a drug rehabilitation programme. Passing sentence Judge Simon Newell told Lumb: 'Nobody wants to send you to prison for something like that, but if you carry on doing it, that's what's going to happen. You've got to take this as a warning.' Previous court hearings were told how Lumb had a 'lamentable' criminal record with his first offence being a burglary in 1970. After racking up a string of motoring convictions after failing to pass his driving test, he was jailed in 2002 for 15 months for dangerous driving after embarking on a driving jaunt which culminated in him ploughing his car into a telegraph pole while fleeing police. In 2004, he was back in court after he broke into the garage of a retired teacher and walked off with a box tools. The victim and a friend tried to carry out a citizen's arrest but Lumb tried to bite one of them on the arm in a bid to break free. Burnley Crown and County Combined Court heard how Lumb blamed his latest crime - in which he stole steaks worth £6 from Marks & Spencer - on the fact he needed to feed his dog because his benefits had been cut . He was later given an 18 month community rehabilitation order by magistrates and warned 'it was his last chance' after he told how his best friend had died in his arms and he wanted to attend the funeral. He also claimed it had been 'difficult' to give up his life of crime due to his 'unsettled' home life. But, in June 2007, he was back in court after police found him pulling a wheelie bin along the street which had a haul of lead inside. Despite admitting theft and being in breach of a court order, he went free again with a conditional discharge after blaming his offending on 'insomnia'. In January last year, he was given another conditional discharge after stealing meat products worth £24 from the Co-op, in Bacup, and abstracting £60 worth of electricity. And last November he was arrested again after he was caught drunkenly trying to raid the home of another victim in Stacksteads, Lancashire - only to fall down a flight of steps while trying to escape. Over the years, 56-year-old Lumb has used an array of excuses to avoid prison including blaming his crimes on insomnia and a drink and drugs habit . The 63-year-old victim was awoken by the sound of what he thought was clanging steel from outside only to see the front living room window had been smashed and Lumb staggering away from his front garden. The occupant tried to follow but lost sight of Lumb who climbed over a fence into a neighbouring property and made off. Lumb was later arrested and picked out on a video identity parade. In March last year, he went to court and insisted he had been attending counselling session for his drink and drug problems and walked free after a different judge told him: 'I find myself persuaded to give you another chance.' The latest offence took place at the Burnley branch of M&S on July 16. Lumb was due to be sentenced at Pennine Magistrates' Court after admitting theft but his case was transferred Burnley Crown Court where a judge's sentencing powers would have been greater. The court heard how Lumb's motivation to beat his criminal behaviour had improved 'massively' while on a drugs programme and it appeared he was getting on top of his heroin use. Previously, he was on four or five bags of drugs a day, but he was now down to two a week and was 'smoking rather than injecting'. Probation officer Nicholas Powell said Lumb had got the dog so he could get out more by taking it for walks and to help 'remove himself' from other drug users. He told how Lumb committed the theft after he went out visiting his family and said: 'It would appear there are elements of stability in his life at the moment.' As well as an extended suspended sentence, Lumb was also given a six month supervision order.","Steven Lumb, 56, has committed total of 162 offences over the last 44 years .

Ismail Gunduz was playing for SK Rum when, incensed at being shown a second yellow card in the 86th minute, he headbutted the referee.

'We distance ourselves from Ismail Gunduz's behaviour. He was thrown out of the club with immediate effect.' However, the player himself labelled the ban 'madness', and in a defence similar to Barcelona striker Luis Suarez, claims he merely slipped. 'This sentence is madness,' said Gunduz, citing a misunderstanding. 'I will do all I can to return to the pitch.'

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A young cancer victim took the brave but life-saving decision to amputate her leg below the knee after doctors warned the disease could spread. Sophie Walton, from Upminster in Havering, was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2011. By the time the disease was detected it had already spread to her lungs. Specialists told the now 21-year-old, her only chance of survival was to remove her right leg below the knee. Without hesitation Miss Walton  agreed, putting her faith in her medical team, and has since been told she is free of the disease. Scroll down for video . Sophie Walton, 21, from Upminster, was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2011. By the time the disease was detected it had already spread to her lungs . Specialists told Miss Walton her only chance of survival was to amputate her right leg below the knee . She said: 'I underwent a high dose of chemo but after seven rounds I was told it wasn't effective. 'My surgeon called me in and said, ""how would you feel if I said you need your leg amputated?"" 'I was shocked, the lump I'd initially found was on my foot so it didn't cross my mind that I might lose my leg. 'I completely trusted my surgeon and I didn't have any other choice. 'My first concern was, 'how am I going to wear a bikini or dresses on holiday?' 'I was devastated but I tried not to think about it.' Miss Walton first spotted a lump on her right foot after a night out with friends. Doctors thought she had broken her foot - something an X-ray later confirmed, but when the bone failed to heal properly, she was given an MRI scan which highlighted an abnormal growth. By the time her bone cancer was diagnosed it had already spread to her lungs . Just one week after her surgeon delivered the shocking news that she may need her leg amputation, the operation went ahead. She said: 'I was pain free when I woke up but I didn't feel relieved. 'I remember looking down and being able to see and feel one leg but not the other. 'It was hard at first but as soon as I got home we moved my room downstairs and I used a wheelchair to get around. 'It took a few weeks for my stump to heal properly and for my prosthesis to be fitted.' Before having her amputation the 21-year-old had gruelling rounds of chemotherapy to try and shrink the cancer in her lungs. She said: 'It was really scary when we were told it had spread to my lungs as I knew that would be hard to treat.' She said: 'I was shocked, the lump I'd initially found was on my foot so it didn't cross my mind that I might lose my leg. I completely trusted my surgeon and I didn't have any other choice' Miss Walton made the brave decision to trial a new drug - a stronger form of chemotherapy, that could save her life but would leave her infertile. 'I had to give myself the best chance of survival,' she said. 'I had plenty of time in the future to think about how I would have children. 'I'd already lost my thick, long blonde hair with the first lot of chemotherapy.' After finishing her trial drug treatment Miss Walton's health took another turn for the worst. She had a low liver function and her gull bladder had become inflamed. Doctors diagnosed her with veno-occlusive disease (VOD) - a condition in which some of the small veins in the liver are obstructed and is a known complication of high-dose chemotherapy. She said: 'It's a rare complication but it turned my eyes yellow and I was in hospital for around six weeks before being released.' But after a year of operations and treatment, in January 2013, Miss Walton was given the amazing news that the trial chemotherapy drug had worked, 90 per cent of the cancer in her lungs had disappeared. In February, she underwent an operation to remove the remaining cancer nobles from her lungs. Two weeks later she was given the all clear. 'I had check-ups every two months to begin with but now it's every three,' she said. 'I also see a reproductive doctor as the chemo has left me completely infertile. 'The year I had cancer was definitely easier than the past year. I was left with no leg, no hair and I had to drop out of university. 'I felt as though I was starting everything from scratch.' But with the support of her mother, Debra, 53, father, Steve, 59, step-dad, Richard, 52, and her two sisters, Rhyanna, 26 and Lara, 28, Miss Walton is now looking forward to the future. She said: 'I've enrolled to do veterinary care at college this month which I can't wait to start. 'I have been on holiday a few times since losing my leg too. I know I'll be back wearing shorter dresses in no time.' Julie Harrington, Bone Cancer Research Trust chief executive officer said: 'Sophie's fight back to fitness after her bone cancer diagnosis and amputation is a real triumph and inspiration, not only for her friend Mark, who will run in her honour, but also for others facing bone cancer. 'All funds raised by Team Bones participants in the Great North Run on Sunday, will help us ensure this charity drives forward even more research that will make this rare and devastating cancer a curable disease. 'Primary bone cancer is a cruel and degrading disease which affects 600 people in the UK and Ireland every year. Only half of these will survive and those who do are left with long-lasting physical and emotional scars.

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . Gold Coast masseuse Arshareeya Wajadee says she's sick of male clients who expect an extra hands-on experience . A qualified traditional Thai masseuse has repeatedly had her business mistaken for a house of pleasure by prospective male clients. Very much to the point where she's been forced to add 'no sexual services' on the pricing menu of her Thai massage parlour business in Gold Coast, southeastern Queensland. Owner Arshareeya Wajadee says her genuine business is being mistaken for illegal brothels and she isn't alone, reported Gold Coast Bulletin. Other therapists say they receive calls every week from male clients who ask for a happy ending. A nearby parlour, across the road from Ms Wajadee's Sabai Traditional Thai Massage and Spa, erected a two metre sign in their shop front. 'Please Read!!! Strictly NO sexual services. Please Do Not Ask Anymore!' it reads. In some instances, wives request to have the curtain open when their husbands go in for a massage in order to monitor both the masseuse and partner. Ms Wajadee says she has a firm policy against sexual services at her workplace. 'Everyone here knows that if they're asked to say ""get out"",' she told Gold Coast Bulletin. 'I'm very strong with that. Everyone here is fully qualified in original Thai massage.' Gold Coast councillor Margaret Grummit says Australians automatically associate massage parlours as brothels and perhaps some education is required. Ms Wajadee hopes with some government intervention, laws can be changed to protect therapists from sexual harassment in the workplace.

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . It's not something you ever expect to see waiting for you in bed. The large four metre snake was found atop a bed in a home in Morayfield, north of Brisbane in Australia. The residents were aware the snake lived on their property but had never come this close to the slippery reptile. 'They [the residents] have watched it grow up, they knew all about the snake, it probably just snuck into their house if the door was left open,' Julia Baker a snake wrangler in Brisbane told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Julia Baker known as the Snake Sheila wrangles a four metre snake that fell asleep on a bed . 'They're used to it, I think they called me because it was in a bedroom and they weren't sure how to get it out,' she said. Ms Baker described the carpet python as 'not dangerous' but also advised not to touch or threaten snakes as they will attack in defense. She removed the large non-venomous snake from the Morayfield home using a large hook and a canvas bag. 'I have to report every snake I capture, it's a very regulated business but I love it,' said Ms Baker known as the Snake Sheila. Ms Baker caught the snake that snuck into the Morayfield home last week . Ms Baker became a snake catcher after painful divorce she decided to focus on the things that brought her happiness - one of them being snakes. About 10 years ago the serpant professional discovered her love for snakes when at Australia Zoo. 'I just fell in love, I felt so differently to everyone else getting a photo with the snakes, they all walked away saying 'yuck! they feel so gross' but I found them to be so beautiful and misunderstood.' It was then that Ms Baker set in motion what would become her snake capturing business. Not the face you want to see greeting you from the other side of the door . Julia Baker a British expat has become a snake catcher after falling in love with the reptiles she saw at Australia Zoo 10 years ago . 'I get to meet people and see so much incredible wildlife, it's a dream for me,' she explained, 'I particularly like educating people on snakes and converting them into snake lovers too.' The UK- expat is keen to spread the word that snakes shouldn't be feared. 'They're not dangerous. They will never chase a person, that's just an urban myth,' Ms Baker said, 'They won't attack unless they feel threatened.' The snake captured in the Morayfield home was released back on the resident's acreage. 'I really love that they have embraced the fact that their home is also the snakes home, they can live together and not fear one another, it truly is a beautiful thing.' 'I'm on a mission to get rid of this 'a good snake's a dead snake' attitude. It's crap. We need snakes. They play and important part in our ecosystem,' she told Nine News. Ms Baker is passionate about educating children about our wildlife and helping prevent hatred and fear towards reptiles.

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . and James Chapman, Daily Mail Political Editor . Tory defector Douglas Carswell is on course to romp home as Ukip’s first Member of Parliament, a new poll suggested last night. A survey of more than 1,000 voters in the Essex constituency of Clacton put support for Mr Carswell – who quit as its Conservative MP last week to stand for Ukip – on 56 percentage points, well ahead of the Tories on 24 points. Labour is on 16 points while the Liberal Democrats are on a miserable two percentage points, according to the poll commissioned by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft. Former Tory MP Douglas Carswell (right) is runaway favourite to retain his Clacton seat in Parliament for Ukip . ‘Even allowing for some movement in vote shares as the campaign unfolds, the likely outcome is clear,’ said Lord Ashcroft. ‘What happens to the seat at the general election seven months later is rather less settled. As things stand, the indication is that Carswell could hold the seat, but perhaps with a reduced majority.’ Mr Carswell has claimed it does not matter if his defection to Ukip helps Ed Miliband into Downing Street – because there is no difference between Labour and the Tories. Mr Carswell, who shocked Westminster by calling a snap by-election after leaving the Tories last week, said Mr Miliband would not be ‘that different’ from David Cameron as Prime Minister. His remarks, amid Tory anger over his defection to Ukip, came after it was announced the by-election in Clacton would take place on October 9 – Mr Cameron’s 48th birthday. A poll released today suggested Mr Carswell will easily hold the Essex seat. The Ukip candidate is backed by 56 per cent of voters in the constituency - 32 points ahead of the Tories. The crunch electoral test comes just a week after the Tories' annual conference in Birmingham. Mr Carswell will be the first person elected to Parliament for Ukip. The party's only previous MP, Bob Spink, did not seek a fresh mandate when he defected from the Tories in 2008. He lost his seat at Castle Point, Essex in 2010. Mr Carswell had been Conservative MP for Clacton since 2010, having previously served as MP for Harwich from 2005 to 2010 before boundary changes. Ukip leader Nigel Farage has said a by-election win for his party in Clacton would signal a ‘landslide in British politics’. A Survation poll for The Mail On Sunday gave Ukip a massive 44-point lead over David Cameron's party. But Mr Carswell said he was not concerned that his defection would damage the Tories. He said: ‘I don’t fundamentally believe that on most of the macro issues, an Ed Miliband government would be that different from a Cameron government. Different cliques, same sofa.’ He said the former Labour minister James Purnell ‘started welfare’ and the Government’s education reforms were actually initiated by Labour peer Lord Adonis. Mr Carswell added: ‘There are some very nice socialists. If it wasn’t for socialism we wouldn’t have the NHS. They have done some good things, the Left in this country.’ Mr Carswell also pledged to vote for a referendum if Mr Cameron was Prime Minister. He said: ‘I can promise you if I’m a Member of Parliament in the run-up to 2017, Mr Cameron and his Whips if he’s still Prime Minister can count on me to help ensure the legislation goes through. ‘I give him that guarantee now. The Carswell guarantee. As for letting Labour in: in Clacton if you vote Ukip you’re going to get Ukip. So that argument doesn’t stack up here.’ A Government under Ed Miliband would not be 'that different' to one ran by David Cameron, Mr Carswell has claimed . Mr Carswell said he would not have left the Tories if he thought the party leadership was serious about change. He said the Tory Party had become the ‘property of a small clique’. He said he visited a conference in March, attended by senior Government officials, who were dismissive of serious reform of the EU. Mr Carswell said: ‘I thought the Government was serious about change. And I sat in rooms listening to some very senior people, who unlike me are not democratically accountable, who clearly decide things, and who were just contemptuously dismissive. ‘And when I raised very mild suggestions and put some questions, or even when I was just listening, they were smirkingly, eyeball-rollingly contemptuous of even the most modest treaty reforms. ‘There was almost a sense of ‘we know best’. And yes we’ve got to say these things to the voters because of course you know the Prime Minister has got to win the next election, because you know, rest assured, we don’t mean it and it’s not going to happen. ‘That was a key moment, and it’s a key moment I can talk about in fairly specific terms without breaching confidences. If I give you other key moments you’ll know who I’m talking about and that wouldn’t be fair.’ Mr Carswell holds a 44 point lead over the Conservatives in the former Tory safe seat of Clacton . The Tories have yet to announce their candidate for next month’s by-election. London Mayor Boris Johnson brushed off suggestions he should put his name forward, telling LBC radio: ‘The first objection really, is that I've already whacked in the CV for Uxbridge. It would seem a bit eccentric.’","Mr Carswell shocked Westminster by calling a snap by-election last week .

"By . Matt Chorley, MailOnline Political Editor . Pupils at a Birmingham school were shown a violent, extremist film promoting jihadism, MPs were told today. Ian Kershaw, who led an inquiry into the 'Trojan Horse' allegations, told the education select committee about the video as an example of 'bad behaviour' he had come across during his investigation. It came amid claims that other English schools could have seen attempts to impose a hardline Muslim agenda on pupils. Ian Kershaw, who led an inquiry into the 'Trojan Horse' allegations, told the education select committee about the video . The education select committee is carrying out its own inquiry into allegations of extremism in schools. It follows reports by Ofsted, the Education Funding Agency, ex-terror chief Peter Clarke and Mr Kershaw. Today Mr Kershaw insisted he had not been presented with any evidence of attempts to coerce young people into 'extremist, violent, jihadist activity'. But he added: 'That's not to say that there weren't examples of very bad behaviour by some individuals in schools that needed to be corrected and addressed.' Pressed to give examples, Mr Kershaw said: 'One would be the showing of a film which is completely inappropriate to young people, that was known by a senior member of staff to have happened and that member of staff in a senior position did not address that as a disciplinary matter.' He described this film as a 'violent, extremist video', and when committee chairman Graham Stuart asked if it was 'jihadist, violent, extremist promotional video', Mr Kershaw indicated that it was. 'It was shown in one classroom at one moment and that should have been stopped and that should not have happened,' Mr Kershaw said, who was asked to carry out his inquiry by Birmingham City Council. Ex-terror chief Peter Clarke said he would be 'surprised' if moves to gain control and influence were only restricted to a few schools in east Birmingham . Mr Clarke also said he had heard of the video. 'There were some suggestions that that sort of film had been shown or copied by a technician within one of the schools,' he said. 'But I did not come across direct evidence of the promotion of direct extremism, no.' Mr Clarke also told the committee that there had been clear evidence of people who had espoused, were sympathetic to, or did not challenge extremist views. He said he would be 'surprised' if moves to gain control and influence were only restricted to a few schools in east Birmingham. Giving evidence to the Commons education select committee, he said it was incumbent on the government to investigate the situation. 'I'm not a great believer in coincidence and I would find it very surprising if this was only happening in the few schools that we had the time and opportunity to look at in east Birmingham,' Mr Clarke told the cross-party group of MPs. 'Some of the people who were involved in promulgating these techniques of gaining control and influence in schools have had national roles in various educational bodies and I know have lectured and taken part in conferences in other cities. 'So I think it is incumbent on the Department for Education and others to take a very careful look now to see whether the sorts of things we found in Birmingham are indeed happening elsewhere. 'I don't know, I haven't looked, but I'd be, I suppose in a way surprised, if there weren't, at least, some symptoms elsewhere.' The former head of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit was asked by former Education Secretary Michael Gove in April to lead an inquiry in allegations that a number of Birmingham schools have been targeted by individuals pushing a hardline Islamist agenda. His report, published in July, concluded that there was 'clear evidence' that there were a number of people, associated with each other and in positions of authority within schools who 'espouse, endorse or fail to challenge extremist views'. The damning document was highly critical of Birmingham City Council, accusing the authority of failing to support under-pressure headteachers dealing with inappropriate behaviour by governors. In his report, Mr Clarke said he 'neither specifically looked for, nor found, evidence of terrorism, radicalisation or violent extremism in the schools of concern in Birmingham'. Four different investigations into the Trojan Horse allegations of a hardline Muslim takeover plot at a number of Birmingham schools have reported back. Here are the main findings of each: . Ian Kershaw report, ordered by Birmingham City Council . Found no evidence of a 'conspiracy to promote an anti-British agenda, violent extremism or radicalisation in schools in east Birmingham'. It concluded that key individuals were 'promoting and encouraging certain Islamic principles' in Birmingham classrooms amid poor oversight from education chiefs. He suggested problems were allowed to run 'unchecked' due to what he branded 'weaknesses in the system and poor oversight of governance' mainly by the city council, but also by Ofsted, the Education Funding Agency and the Department for Education. Peter Clarke report, ordered by former education secretary Michael Gove . Mr Clarke’s inquiry did not look for, or find, evidence of terrorism, radicalisation or violent extremism in the schools of concern. It concluded there was a deliberate effort by a number of individuals to introduce an 'intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos' into a number of Birmingham schools. This was achieved in some schools by gaining influence on governing bodies, installing 'sympathetic' head teachers and senior staff, appointing 'like-minded' people to key positions, and removing heads who were not 'compliant' with a particular agenda. The 129-page report was highly critical of Birmingham City Council, accusing the authority of failing to support under-pressure head teachers who were dealing with inappropriate behaviour by governors. Ofsted . The watchdog inspected 21 schools in the city, concluding that a 'culture of fear and intimidation' had developed in some schools. Warned that Birmingham City Council failed to support a number of schools in the area in their efforts to protect pupils from the 'risks of radicalisation and extremism'. Five schools placed in special measures as a result: Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School and Park View Academy - all run by the Park View Educational Trust (PVET) - as well as Oldknow Academy and Saltley School. A sixth - Alston Primary - was already in special measures. Education Funding Agency . The EFA, which oversees academies, published highly critical reports on PVET and Oldknow Academy at the same time as the Ofsted findings were made public. It said PVET had 'many weaknesses', breached its funding agreement, and had restricted its curriculum to a 'conservative Islamic perspective'. A separate report following the inspection of Oldknow Academy in Small Heath found it was 'taking on the practices of an Islamic faith school' and had excluded non-Muslim staff and pupils from an annual trip to Saudi Arabia for three years running.","Ian Kershaw, who led inquiry into Trojan Horse claims, reveals video incident .

"By . Martyn Ziegler . David Gill, the Football Association vice-chairman, has ruled himself out of standing for the British FIFA vice-presidency following Michel Platini's decision not to run against Sepp Blatter. Gill, the former Manchester United chief executive who is now a UEFA executive committee member, was the leading candidate for the post but it is understood he has told senior figures at the FA that it is 'very unlikely' that he will allow his name to be put forward. Gill's move comes after UEFA president Platini's decision last week not to challenge Blatter for the FIFA presidency. Out of the running: Football Association vice-chairman David Gill will not run for British FIFA vice-presidency . Dedicated: The former Manchester United chief executive still regularly attends their matches . It is understood that Gill, 57, has also told Platini of his intentions to remain at UEFA but not stand for FIFA as he does not want to work under Blatter. The incumbent president appears virtually assured of winning a fifth term in office with splits among UEFA counties meaning there is no likelihood of a credible challenger being put forward from the European confederation. Gill's decision is a big blow to the FA as he was the outstanding English candidate for the position, which is to be voted on by UEFA associations in March and is expected to be contested by Scottish FA president Campbell Ogilvie and Welsh FA president Trefor Lloyd Hughes. Gill would have been tempted if Platini was in office but is believed to feel that FIFA executive committee members wield too little decision-making power and often merely rubber-stamp Blatter's wishes. No go: UEFA president Michel Platini has ruled himself out of challenging Sepp Blatter to become FIFA president . Candidate: David Dein is very well-connected in international football circles and is thought to be a candidate . The FA will now be under pressure to come up with another candidate, but it would need to be someone with a significant presence. One possibility would be Sir Trevor Brooking, who has retired from his job as the FA's director of football development. Brooking has profile as a former England player and experience of administration from his FA role and as a past chairman of Sport England. An obvious choice would be former Arsenal and FA vice-chairman David Dein, who is well-connected in international football circles but the fact he does not have an official FA role currently prevents him from standing. Stepping down: Jim Boyce, the current British FIFA vice-president (right), has insisted he will step down in May . Northern Ireland's Jim Boyce, the current British FIFA vice-president, is due to step down next May and insists he will not change his mind due to family reasons. Boyce told Press Association Sport: 'I have made it abundantly clear, despite having been asked by many people to continue, that I will be stepping down. 'It is up to the British associations to make sure they send the best candidates they can for the election for this very important position.'

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . Sylvia Pritchard, a grandmother to six, died while on a golfing holiday in Turkey . A grandmother holidaying in Turkey died from a brain bleed after she hit her head on a jetty while jumping into the sea. Sylvia Pritchard, 68, was staying in the Belek region of Turkey when the accident occurred in May. An inquest heard how the grandmother from Oswestry, Shropshire, was on a golfing holiday with her husband John and four friends. North Shropshire coroner John Ellery recorded a conclusion of accidental death. He said: 'I do not believe this was drowning. I believe the head injury came after hitting her head on something hard below the water.' A post-mortem examination in Turkey had ruled Mrs Pritchard died from drowning. But Mr Ellery overruled that based on a second post-mortem examination held in the UK. Her friend Beryl Aubrey, who was on holiday with her at the time, recalled: 'I watched her climb down the steps before dropping into the water. 'She surfaced, she took a stroke which was very weak and then she flipped over face down.' She added: 'Mrs Pritchard was rushed to Serik Hospital where she died.' Mrs Pritchard's husband, a Vale of Llangollen Golf Club member, said: 'I never saw Sylvia go into the water. I heard Beryl ask if she was okay when she was in the water. 'I went to look and asked if she was okay. I told her to come out of the water and then she flipped over.' He continued: 'She went into the water and the jetty was quite a long way out. There was a bit of a swell and I think she has gone in and banged her head on something.' Mrs Pritchard had four children and six grandchildren.

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . A Florida woman accused of stabbing her neighbor in the eye with an ice pick and then strangling him to death is claiming self-defense under the state's controversial 'stand your ground' law. Angela Stoldt, of Deltona, has been charged with second-degree murder in the April 2013 killing of 36-year-old James Sheaffer. The 42-year-old suspect also has been accused of abusing the victim's body and tampering with evidence. Slaying: Angela Stoldt, 42 (left), is accused of killing neighbor James Sheaffer, 36 (right), with an ice pick last year - but she claims self-defense under Florida's 'stand your ground' law . Crime scene: Stoldt got into an argument with Sheaffer while sitting in her car at the Osteen Cemetery in Deltona in April 2013 . A motion filed by Stoldt's attorney, and cited by The Daytona Beach News-Journal, claimed that the woman stabbed Sheaffer as the two sat in her car at a cemetery because he was threatening to kill her and her children. Even after he was stabbed in the face, according to the defense, Sheaffer kept coming at Stoldt, who was in fear for her life. At least 22 states, among them Florida, have laws on the books that allow that 'there is no duty to retreat (from) an attacker in any place in which one is lawfully present.' These laws generally cancel a person's duty to retreat in the face of a serious physical attack. The 2012 Florida shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin and the acquittal of neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman sparked debate over 'stand your ground' laws around the country. James Sheaffer, a limousine driver and a married father of three, had reportedly asked his neighbor, Ms Stoldt, to act as the payee on his Social Security disability benefits, but the 36-year-old kept overdrawing the account. On the morning of April 3, 2013, Stoldt, with her two children in tow, picked up her neighbor from work and drove to the Osteen Cemetery after dropping the kids off at her parents'. Husband and father: Sheaffer, who was married with three kids, was stabbed in the eye and then strangled; police were never able to locate all of his remains . Life and death situation: Stoldt's attorney filed a motion claiming that the woman was in fear for her life because Sheaffer was threatening to kill her and her two children . On their way to the cemetery, Mr Sheaffer reportedly asked Stoldt if he could borrow $2,000 to $4,000 from her father. By the time the two reached the burial ground, Sheaffer and Stoldt got into a heated dispute over the money. ‘Sheaffer said that he was going to kill Ms. Stoldt as well as her children,’ the stand-you-ground motion stated. The limo driver then allegedly came at his neighbor swinging and grabbed her, refusing to let go. ‘She grabbed the first thing she could, which was an ice pick, to protect herself. The ice pick was in a box of camping supplies that was in the backseat of her car behind her,’ the motion stated. The mother of two plunged the sharp instrument into Shaeffer's eye, but the man allegedly kept coming at her. The woman, described as fearful for her life, grabbed a cord, wrapped it tightly around the man's neck and continued pulling until he stopped attacking her. Ms Stoldt then covered Sheaffer’s head with Saran Wrap and disposed of his body. The victim was reported missing by his father the following day, but it was not until nearly three weeks later that a suicidal Ms Stoldt confessed to killing her neighbor and led sheriff's deputies to various locations around Volusia County to help recover his remains. Officials said they were never able to locate all of Sheaffer's body parts. Confrontation: Sheaffer, a limo driver, allegedly attacked Stoldt while sitting in her car and would not let go of her until she wrapped a cord around his neck . Investigators who canvassed Sheaffer’s Deltona neighborhood before Stoldt’s confession had talked to the woman on more than one occasion. She acknowledged being friends with Sheaffer and said she handled some of his financial affairs for him. She told investigators that she last saw Sheaffer on April 5 and 15, even though family members hadn’t seen him since April 2. The investigation took a turn April 20 when Stoldt’s sister called 911 saying that the mother of two was acting suicidal and had admitted to killing James Sheaffer. The caller told the Sheriff’s office that Stoldt was hugging her children and saying goodbye. ‘Why’s she hugging her kids goodbye?’ the emergency dispatcher asked. ‘Because she came to the house and she told my parents that she committed a crime and that she’s being investigated for it,’ the woman’s sister replied. Ms Stoldt initially declined to talk to investigators and was taken in for a mental health evaluation. But officials were able to obtain a search warrant to enter her house, where they came upon evidence indicating a crime had been committed there. A short time later, Angela Stoldt confessed to stabbing and strangling Sheaffer, and then disposing of his body. Stoldt then led investigators to a location where human remains were recovered. Ms Stoldt is being held without bond on charges of second-degree murder, abuse of a dead human body and tampering with physical evidence.","Angela Stoldt, 42, confessed to killing limo driver James Sheaffer, 36, in April 2013 by stabbing him in the face and strangling him with a cord .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . A person was paid $477,00 for tripping down a flight of stairs in Canada . Australian travellers getting  in to tricky situations overseas are bailing themselves out with the help of six figure insurance claims. Medical mishaps caused by accident-prone travellers are seeing the number of claims  rise, and it appears there's a widening disparity between the accident itself and the sums paid. Figures released by Southern Cross Travel Insurance show some of the staggering claims Australians have made overseas, which include a holiday maker's $447,000 win for tripping down a flight of stairs. The traveller required multiple surgeries for a broken black an internal bleeding - a much larger procedure than a  holiday maker to Hawaii who was paid $82,000 to treat sand fly bites in a local hospital. Other accident-prone travellers making hefty claims include one who was paid $70,000 for falling in a US car park and was taken to hospital for a broken wrist. The victim was taken to a local clinic but needed to be evacuated to a secondary hospital by air, resulting in compounding medical costs. Fracture ankles, requiring surgery, have also accounted for large insurance payouts overseas . 1. $447,000 - fell down stairs in Canada suffering subdural hematoma and an unstable fracture of a cervical vertebrae requiring multiple surgeries. 2. $176,000 - suffered aspiration pneumonia secondary to an epileptic seizure in China. 3. $137,000 - heart attack in Canada requiring bypass surgery. 4. $107,000 - suffered a fractured ankle requiring surgery in USA. 5. $62,400 - on a motorbike travelling in Thailand and hit by truck. 6. $82,000 - hospitalisation required after being bitten by sand flies in Hawaii . 7. $74,000 - admitted to hospital in USA suffering vomiting and diarrhoea. 8. $79,000 - suffered a stroke while travelling in USA and admitted to hospital. 9. $70,000 - fell in a car park in USA and suffered a fractured wrist which necessitated an air evacuation to a second hospital for surgery . 10. $40,000 - admitted to hospital in Singapore suffering a subarachnoid haemorrhage. A pneumonia patient who fell ill and started suffering epileptic seizures in china cost their travel company $176,000, while a heart attack patient requiring bypass surgery was issued a $136,000 lump sum. Mitchell Watson from financial research firm Canstar said paying less than   $50 for travel insurance was a no 'brainer' considering the amount it covers. 'Small accidents can result in big claims,' Mr Watson told The Australian. Craig Morrison, SCTI CEO, said any requirement for medical attention overseas can quickly add up, particularly in the US and Canada. The US, followed by Thailand, England, France and Canada were the most expensive countries for claims lodged by Australian travellers.

'Sometimes hospitals in US request a deposit prior to treatment and this can be several thousand dollars, sometimes as high as $10,000,' he said. 'This is one of the key areas where having travel insurance is really important as we can try to help eliminate the need to pay this deposit.'

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . Police officers investigating the Plebgate scandal secretly obtained the telephone records of the senior Fleet Street journalist who first broke the story, it has been revealed. A Metropolitan police report into the ongoing saga, which was published yesterday, revealed that the force arrested an officer on suspicion of leaking information to the Sun after analysing the phone records of the newspaper's political editor Tom Newton Dunn. Scotland Yard also obtained call records to the Sun to try to identify a second potential source providing information about the Plebgate row in which the former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell was accused of swearing at police officers guarding Downing Street. Police officers secretly obtained the phone records of the Sun's political editor Tom Newton Dunn . The National Union of Journalists have accused the police of an ‘outrageous abuse’ of their position, while Tory MP Mark Reckless today demanded to know if journalists’ sources were safe. Mr Newton Dunn did not know that his phone records had been secretly obtained by the police. Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act police have to go to court to ask a judge’s permission to get records belonging to a journalist. Journalists are then notified to give them the chance to fight against their records being investigated. Michelle Stanistreet, of the National Union of Journalists, said: ‘Instances like this amount to the outrageous criminalisation of sources who have taken the decision that information they are in receipt of deserves to come to the attention of the public.' She added: ‘If whistleblowers believe that material they pass to journalists can be accessed in this way – without even the journalists and newspaper knowing about it – they will understandably think twice about making that call.' A Sun spokesman said the newspaper was 'concerned' about the revelation. He said the Sun understood the intrusion 'was authorised by a police officer rather than a judge, for the apparent purpose of exposing a whistle-blower who was ultimately shown to have committed no criminal offence'. The spokesman added: 'We understand this was achieved, without our knowledge, by the use of police powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. 'This circumvented the normal safeguards in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which was designed to give proper protection to journalists and their sources. 'We will be writing to Lord Justice May, the Interception of Communications Commissioner, to ask him to examine how many times and with what justification these authorisations have been made against the media and whether he intends to issue any guidance on the media’s right to keep their phone records safe.' The Sun first published a front-page story on September 21, 2012, revealing Mr Mitchell had clashed with armed officers at Downing Street after they refused to let him cycle out of the main gate. The revelation sparked a political row, eventually forcing Mr Mitchell to resign from the Cabinet. But the Tory MP has consistently denied calling the police officers 'plebs'. It has since emerged that officers 'conspired' to undermine Mr Mitchell. The revelation that police secretly obtained Mr Newton Dunn's phone records emerged after the Met published a series of documents summarising its inquiry into the aftermath of the plebgate incident, which resulted in four police officers being sacked. Yesterday's report identified a female officer who texted a colleague two days after the incident to declare that she could ‘topple’ the Tory government. The report also contained new CCTV footage of the heated disagreement between diplomatic protection officer Toby Rowland and then Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell at the gates of Downing Street in September 2012. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage of the plebgate row shows a passer-by watching as the then Tory chief whip attempts to cycle out of the main gates of Downing Street . The new material - released by Scotland Yard from its investigation into the Plebgate affair 'dubbed Operation Alice' - shows the witness stopping to watch the confrontation . The witness turns back on himself after seeing Mr Mitchell told by police officers to wheel his bike through the side entrance . Previously-unseen CCTV images of the Plebgate row reveal that a passer-by witnessed the confrontation between police and Mr Mitchell. The man, who is clearly seen following the exchange, has never been traced. Today’s CCTV footage shows Mr Mitchell cycling down the middle of the street and then talking to three officers at the gate while a fourth stands nearby outside. In the original police account, several members of the public are said to have witnessed the exchange and were ‘visibly shocked’. A Dispatches documentary for Channel 4 challenged this with images obtained from CCTV shot from within Downing Street. But today's separate CCTV footage shows there were at least three members of the public outside the gates at the time of the row. At least one appeared to be listening to the exchange. PC Rowland alleges Mr Mitchell called police officers ‘****ing plebs’ during their exchange. Mr Mitchell denies he used the word ‘pleb’ but has apologised for swearing. Tory MPs and supporters of Mr Mitchell said that, despite the report being a ‘police report into the police’, it still showed dishonesty by officers working in Downing Street. They said serious questions must now be asked about whether the Diplomatic Protection Group in charge of guarding No. 10 was fit for purpose. Mr Davis, a former shadow Home Secretary, said: ‘What we have got here is evidence of industrial-scale dishonesty. There was a pack of policemen telling a pack of lies. This involved serious collusion between police officers who set out to harm the democratically elected Government. ‘Despite their attempts to justify their action on security grounds, it transpires that the only written guidance was that ministers should have ‘unfettered access at any time of day or night and at any entry point’. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This overdue report offers further evidence of the concerted deception used by police officers to stitch up Andrew Mitchell. ‘It’s shocking that specialist officers recruited to protect Downing Street saw fit to engage in such an outrageous plan to topple a senior minister. It’s a serious blow to public confidence in the police.’ Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell was targeted by a police conspiracy after swearing when blocked from cycling through the main Downing Street gates .","Police probing Plebgate saga accessed phone records of Tom Newton Dunn .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans for MailOnline . An experienced skydiver has died in a freak collision after he was knocked out by a fellow jumper in mid-air and failed to deploy his parachute. Donnie Bragg, 27, had around 350 jumps under his belt when he and two others leapt out of a plane above Polk County, Georgia, on Saturday afternoon. But just seconds later, he collided with one of the pair, Tracy Sutherland, at 13,000 feet, knocking them both unconscious. Tragic: Donnie Bragg, 27, died in a freak collision after he was knocked out by a fellow jumper in mid-air and failed to deploy his parachute. The incident happened above SkyDive the Farm's facility in Polk County, Georgia . Mr Bragg, who was engaged and had a newborn son, was instantly killed when he crashed into the ground without deploying his parachute. Mr Sutherland suffered several broken bones and is currently recovering in hospital in Rome, while the third jumper was not injured. Today, instructor Steve Haseman, of SkyDive the Farm in Polk County, said Mr Bragg had been a dedicated worker at the firm, with whom he carried out the skydive. He added that the company was now trying to piece together what had happened during the jump. Location: Today, instructor Steve Haseman, of SkyDive the Farm (pictured) in Polk County, said Mr Bragg had been a dedicated worker at the firm. He said: 'He was very passionate about life, about skydiving' 'We have an idea of what happened, but we don't know exactly,' he told 11Alive.com.  'The . collision between the two of them rendered both of them unconscious. 'And because of that, they weren't able to land their . parachute properly and safely.' Although two cameras had been filming during the jump, one did not capture the incident, while the other was knocked off in the collision and lost, he said. Mr Haseman described Mr Bragg, who had just graduated from Southern Ploytechnic State University in Marietta with an engineering degree, as a 'really good guy' with a passion for life. He said: 'He had a huge heart, very outgoing, very passionate about life, about skydiving, about family. He's touched everybody's life, for sure.' The Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Parachuting Associated are investigating. The incident comes just months after a British skydiver narrowly escaped death when another skydiver crashed into him at 12,500ft. James Lee, 25, was filmed hurtling towards the ground unconscious after being knocked out by the jumper above Netheravon in Wiltshire. He was only saved when two other skydivers saw what had happened and postponed pulling their own cords. Instead, they dived towards Mr Lee and managed to deploy his parachute for him.","Donnie Bragg, 27, jumped out of plane with two others above Polk County .

"By . Kieran Corcoran for MailOnline . A couple have been forced out of their home after its damp and mouse infestation allegedly made their children sick. Rachel Murdoch, 23, and Jason Taylor, 35, have repeatedly complained about the vermin, slugs and severe damp in their home, where they raise their two children Marcus, two, and seven-month-old Lilly. But they say their landlord and housing association have failed to fix the problem, despite endless requests, which has put their family under strain. Scroll down for video . Filth: Rachel Murdoch, 23, centre, and her children Marcus, left, and Lilly, right, have been suffering thanks to mould and vermin in their home . The pair moved into the house in Sheffield a year ago, and soon experienced problems with unwanted guests. But despite several complaints to their housing provider, they say little action has been taken. Now Mr Taylor says the catalogue of problems, the stress of which has caused him and his partner to break up, are even making his children ill and aggravating their asthma. Mr Taylor, a removal man, said: 'We are at breaking point over this. Me and my partner broke up over this it's caused that much stress.' They now plan to move out this weekend - Miss Murdoch and the children with her parents and Mr Taylor to a hostel. Miss Murdoch added: 'We'd spent four happy years together before this, but when you're watching your children getting ill, you're sending them to school smelling of damp every day and you're living with constant mice and droppings in the house and dead rats outside - even the strongest relationships would break down.' Rodent: A mouse can be seen dead on the carpet, inches from one of the children's cots . Decay: Damp has caused parts of the wall to crumble away in the home in Sheffield, Yorkshire . 'This horrible house, and the fact that nobody seems to care about us, has nearly caused our family to break down,' she added. 'The landlord takes his money every month, and doesn't seem to bother about the conditions we are living in. Nobody should have to clean up mice corpses and droppings all the time.' Miss Murdoch said her children, who both suffer from asthma, have experienced breathing problems in the house. She said: 'The children play about like mad outside - but in this damp house, they're out of breath in a few minutes and need a puff on the inhaler. I am surprised that the state of the house hasn't caused a serious attack in one of them yet.' Miss Murdoch also believes the droppings may have caused stomach upsets in her children. She said: 'No matter how hard you try and clean up all the droppings, it's a never-ending task and there'll always be more the next day. Signs: Mouse droppings are seen above on work surfaces in the kitchen. Miss Murdoch and Mr Taylor spoke of the strain their condition have placed on the family . 'Both the children have been getting ill, not just with the breathing difficulties, but with stomach upsets a lot more than you would expect and we believe it is because of this house.' She added: 'But you see mice everywhere - all the time. 'One even ran right past Marcus when he was sat playing on the kitchen floor and scared the life out of him. No child should have to live in these conditions for a year.' Mr Taylor said that their housing provider had promised to fix the catalogue of problems, but the work never materialised. 'They came down and they promised all this stuff they were going to do and then they did nothing. 'Social services kept giving them deadlines to get this stuff done but they never did. They kept doing small stuff as to look like they are doing something. He added: 'They have left us in that house for a year now. The kids have to sleep with us because in Marcus' room there are mice.' But now the family have decided that enough is enough. Miss Murdoch said: 'We're moving out this weekend. Me and the children are moving in with my mum and Jason is going to move to a hostel for the time being - we just can't take any more of this.' Desperate: Miss Murdoch says that they will move out of the house this week and stay with her parents . Mould: Walls in one of the bedroom (pictured) and elsewhere in the home, as well as damp, are said to be aggravating the children's asthma . The house, which also homes mouse corpses and an infestation of droppings, is owned by a private landlord and rented by housing company Metropolitan. A spokesman for Sheffield Council said: 'The council's private housing standards team has been working with partner agencies to ensure required works are carried out by the landlord to address the issues present here - this is a complex case with a number of relevant factors. 'A number of repairs have been completed already, and we have agreed with Metropolitan and the landlord that further works will be finalised by the end of August.' 'The council will continue to monitor progress and take any further action deemed necessary.' Cramped: Miss Murdoch and her daughter Lilly pose in their damp and mould-ridden stairway . A spokesman for the housing association said: 'Metropolitan does not own the property, but provides support to the family living there. 'When the family moved in we ensured that it met all relevant health and safety standards and Sheffield Council's private housing standards team has assessed the property following the concerns raised. 'The owner of the property has dealt with all of the key issues, including replacement of the boiler, and all relevant safety certification is in place. Our team continues to provide the family with support alongside a number of other agencies.'","Family in Sheffield, Yorkshire, say infestations and mould forced them out .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Darren Weatherston, 33, from Byker, Newcastle, tortured and stabbed his girlfriend during a frightening two-hour ordeal . A manipulative boyfriend smeared butter and orange juice in his girlfriend's face before torturing and stabbing her during a horrific two-hour attack. Darren Weatherston, from Byker, Newcastle, warned Crystal Dixon she would need a 'closed casket' by the time he had finished with her. He then stabbed her in the neck with a fork, before using a Stanley knife to stab her in the thigh. The 33-year-old also threatened to give Miss Dixon a 'Chelsea smile' - a cut from the ears to the lips. Weatherston was jailed at Newcastle Crown Court for four-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to making a threat to kill, wounding with intent, false imprisonment and witness intimidation. The court heard how Weatherston threatened to torture Miss Dixon 'until the night is out'. He also told her she would have to urinate herself when she needed the toilet. When she tried to flee the flat where she was being held, Weatherston chased after her, holding a knife to her throat as he led her back. It was only when two strangers walked past and punched Weatherston to the ground that Miss Dixon was able to escape. Judge John Evans said: 'You are a danger to the public, essentially people with whom you form a close relationship. That is a danger I have to address. 'There is no doubt that your behaviour on that day was appalling and she was terrified as a result.' The court heard the attack happened at a friend's home where the pair were staying. Prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw said: 'They were both sitting on the settee in the living area and the defendant had a fork in his hand and began to stab her neck, ear and jaw. 'She had butter smeared around her face. She needed to use the toilet but he told her she would have to urinate herself. 'He threw a bottle of orange at her and refused to allow her to change. He was hitting her legs and arms with his fists. 'He said when she did finally leave the house he would give her a 'Chelsea smile', which she knew was a cut from the lips to ear.' Weatherston was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Newcastle Crown Court, pictured, after pleading guilty to making a threat to kill, wounding with intent, false imprisonment and witness intimidation . The court heard  Miss Dixon managed to dial 999 from her mobile. Operators were able to hear Weatherston say 'get off the floor' and 'you are going nowhere'. But when Weatherston realised his victim was trying to get help, the call was disconnected and police were unable to trace her location. Weatherston went on to cut Miss Dixon on her thigh with a Stanley knife. Mr Wardlaw added: 'He said by the time she left she would give her daughter nightmares, would need a closed casket and he said he would stab her.' Geoff Knowles, defending, said Weatherston has a history of drink and drug misuse and had been taken wrongly-prescribed medication for many years. The judge also gave Wetherston a two-and-a-half-year extended licence period on top of his prison sentence.","Darren Weatherston smeared butter and orange juice in Crystal Dixon's face .

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . Keepers at Sydney's Taronga Zoo have named the newest member of their chimpanzee brood. The gorgeous month old chimp has has been named 'Sudi' the Swahili word for luck or success. The name was selected by the zoo's primate keepers and reflects the chimp's Afircan origins. Scroll down for video . Taronga Zoo's baby chimp has been named Sudi . All the chimpanzees in the Taronga group have names starting with S. His mother's name is Shiba and his father is Samaki. Sudi is Shiba's fourth baby and the whole family live in the chimpanzee enclosure with their father Shabani too. 'Shabani and Samaki have shown their softer side since Sudi’s birth, staying close to their mother and monitoring the visits of the rest of the group, ensuring that mum and baby enjoy these first weeks together in relative peace and quiet,' said Lou Grossfeldt the Primate Supervisor at Taronga Zoo. Cards close to her chest: Mum Shiba, 33, is keeping the baby so close that zookeepers have been unable to determine the bub's gender. Sudi has quickly become a favourite with Zoo visitors since his birth on 9 August. Keen-eyed visitors will spot the baby’s head or hands and feet occasionally poking out from Shiba’s protective embrace. 'Sudi’s name means success and he’s certainly enjoyed a successful start to life in our chimp community,' said Mr Grossfeldt. The tiny chimpanzee sparked curiosity after it's birth as it clung tightly to its mother making it hard to figure out it's gender. Sudi made quite the impression on visitors and zookeepers as he was very chatty letting his fellow chimps know he had arrived. 'The youngster is quite vocal when not dozing in its mother’s arms and appears very healthy,' Mr Grossfeldt said. Chimpanzees are the closest relative to humans and share over 98 per cent of the same DNA. The beautiful animals have become endangered in the wild due to poaching and the destruction of their habitats.

"By . Stephen Brough . Nevis does not have a harbour for cruise ships and air services are limited - which is terrific news. Most people get to it by boat from neighbouring St Kitts, and this relative inaccessibility has made sure it remains largely undeveloped. Christopher Columbus, inspired by the clouds shrouding the mountain, called it Nuestra Senora de las Nieves (Our Lady Of The Snows), which became Nevis. No sign of the madding crowds: Tranquility reigns at Nevis's Oualie Beach . Fittingly, there are more than 50 churches, one for every 250 people. Outside shops in Charlestown, the tiny capital, you come across blackboards chalked with Bible texts for each day. Meanwhile, to put you on the right spiritual track, there are roadside signs that ask, ‘Will it do harm?’ or, as I spotted on the route that leads to the depot where everyone stocks up with booze, ‘Will it bring good fellowship?’ Nevis’s history involves Nelson and slavery, which feature on the signposted heritage trail that takes in three sugar plantation hotels. We stayed at one of these, the Golden Rock Inn, run by my wife’s cousin and owned by New Yorker Brice Marden, one of America’s most highly regarded abstract artists. Sotheby’s sold his work, The Attended, for more than $10 million last year. But let’s not dwell on envy - as one of those signs might say. Soul food: Stephen spent a happy evening at Pinney's Beach (left), where Sunshine's (right) is an institution . Marden and his artist wife Helen have spent lavishly on landscaping the Golden Rock terraces and gardens, and on buying colourful ‘art’ furniture, which everyone who comes for lunch makes a point of being photographed sitting on. Golden Rock has a relaxed charm, while the Montpelier, a member of Relais & Chateaux on the estate where Nelson married Frances Nisbet on March 11, 1787, is more self-consciously chic, and is not shy about mentioning that Princess Diana holidayed there with the two young Princes in 1992. The third plantation hotel, The Hermitage, dates from 1640 and claims to be the oldest wooden house in the Lesser Antilles. It doesn’t have the views the other two enjoy, but it is the one that feels most like a plantation house, thanks to the efforts of the Lupinacci family, who bought it in 1971 to furnish it in period style. If you want to be right on the beach, the somewhat louche Oualie Beach hotel is your best bet. Generally, the superior beaches are on the western, calmer Caribbean side of the island. We especially enjoyed Pinney’s, a long stretch of glorious sand and home to Sunshine’s bar, whose eponymous owner created the Killer Bee cocktail, the ingredients of which remain a secret. I don’t drink, but I was keen to watch the reaction of a man called Richard, an advertising copywriter from London, as he ordered a second one of these lethal concoctions. Small but perfectly formed: Charlestown, Nevis's tiny capital, lurks in the south-west of the island . But we didn’t hang around long enough to see how he fared because two catamarans carrying 80 rum punch-fuelled day trippers from St Kitts suddenly arrived. My wife and I decided to pack up and escape the lurching tattoos. We drove north where Chrishi and Oualie beaches always offer peace and quiet, and, further along, Sea Heaven and Herbert’s beach, where you can find total solitude. Nevis has a warm and gentle gregariousness, and we ran into all sorts of genial regulars — from an Old Bailey judge to retired American hippies. Judith and her husband Norman Miller, who is an expert in witchcraft and the first journalist to interview Idi Amin after he seized power in Uganda in 1971, have been coming to Nevis for years to escape the Vermont winter. ‘What is it that brings you back?’ I asked Norman, as we sat looking across to Montserrat on the verandah of their rented house in the hills.

"By . Madlen Davies for MailOnline . A veterinary student whose face was paralysed in a car crash can today show her emotions again after having pioneering 'smile transplant' surgery. Bethan Robertson-Smith, 29, woke from a 13-day coma to discover every muscle in her face had been paralysed and all her nerves were damaged. She was left with her mouth permanently open, unable to blink or produce tears, with one eye stuck open and the other closed. But after years of being unable to raise a smile she tracked down a plastic reconstructive surgeon who carried out an incredible operation to attach a muscle from her temple to her mouth muscles. Bethan Robertson-Smith, 29, from St Andrews in Bristol underwent a 'smile transplant' (pictured right) after being left with her face paralysed (pictured left) after a car crash . The crash happened as she was driving to family home in Trefeglwys, mid-Wales, after her second term at university in February 2008. She skidded on water and lost control of the car . The ten-and-a-half hour 'smile transplant' means she can now smile, blink, cry and frown. Although she had survived the car crash, Ms Robertson-Smith, from St Andrews in Bristol, said losing the ability to communicate using normal facial expressions was extremely difficult. ‘I was always told I was lucky to be alive, letting alone walking and talking,’ she said. ‘But I didn't feel lucky. It wasn't very nice to be a 22 or 23-year-old girl walking out into the world like that everyday. ‘It wasn't just not being able to smile - it was all the other emotions too. I couldn't even look angry. I couldn't cry.’ The crash happened as she was driving to family home in Trefeglwys, mid-Wales, after her second term at university in February 2008. She skidded on water and lost control of the car. Another vehicle smashed into her passenger side, ramming the door into her head and crushing the bone canal containing the facial nerves. The crash left her with five skull fractures, a bleed on the brain and traumatic injuries to the base of her skull. The crash left her with five skull fractures, a bleed on the brain and traumatic injuries to the base of her skull . The term facial palsy generally refers to weakness of the facial muscles, mainly resulting from temporary or permanent damage to the facial nerve. When a facial nerve is either non-functioning or missing, the muscles in the face do not receive the necessary signals in order to function properly. This results in paralysis of the affected part of the face, which can affect movement of the eye(s) and/or the mouth, as well as other areas. There are different degrees of facial paralysis: sometimes only the lower half of the face is affected, sometimes one whole side of the face is affected and in some cases both sides of the face are affected. Source: Facial Palsy UK . Her family feared she would never pull through, but after a 13-day induced coma she came round. After three months in hospital she was finally discharged, with doctors reassuring her that her face would eventually recover. But while she learned to walk and talk the paralysis of her face, known as ‘bilateral facial palsy’ did not improve and she still could not show any emotion. She said it was difficult  to have to re-learn how to carry out basic tasks, and her determination to get back to normal. ‘When I woke up I was like a small child. I had to learn to walk and talk and eat again.’ she said. ‘But my first words I spoke were ""I can"".' Doctors told her there was nothing they could do for her face, but her mother saw a programme on TV where pioneering surgeon Charles Nduka explained his first 'smile transplant'. Ms Robertson-Smith (pictured left and right before the accident) helped launch charity Facial Palsy in 2012 . Ms Robertson-Smith, said: 'When I woke up I was like a small child. I had to learn to walk and talk and eat again.’ she said. But my first words I spoke were ""I can""' Last month the 29-year-old, pictured left after the operation, was given one of David Cameron's Points of Light awards, which honours volunteers,  right . In February 2011, a doctor at Queen Victoria Hospital in West Sussex carried out the complex Labbe procedure - where the muscles which ran from Ms Robertson-Smith's temple to her jaw were detached at the bottom. They were then flipped over, her jaw was removed, and the muscles were attached to her smile muscles, allowing her to pull up the corners of her mouth. A week later she had surgery to insert small platinum chains in her eye lids to make them weighted to help them close. She had to work hard in physiotherapy sessions to strengthen the two muscles in her face - which now have to do the work of 14 muscles - but after eight weeks she could raise a small smile. Just last month she had a further operation to adjust the tightness of the muscles. Wanting to share her experience with others, Ms Robertson-Smith helped launch the charity Facial Palsy UK in 2012 and last month was given David Cameron's Point of Light award, which honours volunteers. Although her brain injury means she can't work because she suffers from migraines, depression and exhaustion, she feels her operation was life-changing. ‘Now I like to test it.’ she said. ‘When I used to go out and about people would stare and I would look away. Now I catch someone's eye and try and smile at them, and now, unlike before, they smile back.’","Bethan Robertson-Smith was left with a 'bilateral facial palsy' following a serious car crash after waking from a 13-day coma .

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . She's a champion pole vaulter who's represented Australia at the Olympics and Commonwealth Games. But now 20-year-old athlete Liz Parnov is forging a second career in modelling after she was approached by a talent agent while at a 21st birthday party in Perth. The beautiful pole vaulter recently suffered a heart-breaking defeat at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games after she failed to register a mark in the final, slipping on the wet track. That pain is now being channeled into her pursuits in front of the camera after being scouted by renowned starmaker Christine Fox, who has helped launch the careers of Gemma Ward and Nicole Trunfio. Pole vaulter turned model, Liz Parnov is ready to take on the modelling world . Although she'd always dreamed of such an opportunity, she never thought it would become a reality. Now she's setting her sights on a different kind of spotlight - with WA agency Vivien's Model Management. 'I've always wanted to try it but I didn't think my body type would be right because I have more of an athletic body,' she told Daily Mail Australia, 'so when Christine [Fox] approached me I was in shock.' 'I think the more athletic body type is coming in,' she said. Originally from Russia, Ms Parnov is all too grateful for the opportunities her life in Australia has given her. 'I go back to Russia every year and everytime I'm there, I just think how lucky I am to live in Australia and get to do what I love,' she said, 'specially with this new opportunity, it's unreal.' The Olympic athlete never thought that modelling would be a career move due to her athletic build . The multi-talented beauty has already gone to a casting with her portfolio filled with stunning photos from her test shoot. 'I've only really done one photo shoot, for my test shots so the casting for Perth Fashion Festival was nerve wracking,' she explains. 'I got a call back so hopefully it all goes well and I get to do my first runway.' When asked if the modelling world is anything like television shows such as Australia's Next Top Model or The Face, she laughs: 'I suppose it is and it isn't.' Liz hopes to break into fitness, swimsuit and commercial modelling all while training for her main passion pole vaulting and also going to university . 'The first time I walked into the agency and saw the lobby with all the girls comp cards and editorials I thought it was.' And although she's used to the rigours of training for professional sport, she admits she finds preparing for life on the catwalk just as challenging. 'I think it's great that I get to go to healthy eating and fitness classes with the younger girls from Vivien's. It teaches them how to look after their bodies and go into modelling the right way by eating right and keeping fit.' Australia's Liz Parnov in action in the women's pole vault final at Hampden Park during the XX Commonwealth Games, in Glasgow . From training sneakers to stilettos, Liz Parnov is prepared for the gruelling training involved in becoming a fashion model . The young Olympian has just started her pre-season training for the World Championships in Athletics held in Beijing next year. She doesn't at all seem phased by having to add to her already busy schedule. 'I started my pre-season training yesterday and I'm also back at uni. I think like anything adding modelling into the mix. I'll need to find a balance and it will be fine. I'll take it as it comes.' Australian athlete Liz Parnov competes during the Women's Pole Vault qualification round at the Olympic Games in London . Liz's sister Vicky (back) is very supportive of her new career path as a model and even joins in when she practices her runway walk .","Liz Parnov is a champion pole vaulter who competed in the 2012 London Olympics who has turned fashion model .

"By . Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . Eight exotic bee-eater birds have hatched in Britain, an extraordinary feat that has only been recorded twice in the last 60 years. A colony of the sun-loving birds has established on the Isle of Wight, the largest ever breeding group seen in the country. Two colourful adult pairs arrived from southern Africa early this summer and between them they have successfully hatched eight chicks. Eight exotic bee-eater birds have hatched in Britain, an extraordinary feat that has only been recorded twice in the last 60 years . The birds, which normally spend their summers in the Mediterranean, were last recorded breeding in Britain in 2002. That attempt in County Durham produced two chicks and was the first for 50 years. Before that two pairs raised seven young in Sussex in 1955. The birds are expected to leave for southern Africa within the week, flying thousands of miles to reach their winter feeding site. But they - and other exotic species - could be increasingly seen in the UK as we get warmer summers, experts say. The long spell of warm weather this spring and summer has already led to an abundance of migratory animals we would not usually see in the UK. In July a number of yellow-legged tortoiseshell butterflies were spotted along the east coast, the first time since 1953 the insects had been seen in Britain. The butterflies, which are usually only seen in Eastern Europe, had been blown in on warm easterly winds. It has also been an excellent year for bees, dragonflies and all manner of other warmth-loving insects and birds. A colony of the sun-loving birds has established on the Isle of Wight, the largest ever breeding group seen in the country . Bee-eaters, with their kaleidoscopic and very colourful plumage, are considered one of the world’s most beautiful birds, and a very rare visitor to the UK. The animals, which are related to kingfishers, feed in mid-flight by snatching bees, wasps, flying ants and other stinging insects out of the air. The birds perch on telegraph wires and tree branches until they see their prey, then leap into the air and grasp the insect with their beaks. They get rid of the insect’s sting by rubbing it against a hard surface, squeezing the venom out of its body as they do so. Three chicks fledged from one nest on National Trust land, in a small valley on the Wydcombe Estate, and another five from a second nest. An adult bee-eater was first spotted at Wydcombe in mid-July by dragonfly survey volunteer Dave Dana. A nest - a burrow in the ground - on the estate was located and a 24-hour operation to protect the site from egg thieves was launched by the National Trust, RSPB and Isle of Wight naturalists. Their efforts paid off, with chicks first sighted on August 15. The second nest, on nearby farmland, went undiscovered until last week. Mr Dana said of his sighting of the adult bird: ‘I’d just come from counting golden-ringed dragonflies at a stream and I thought, “that bird looks a bit different!”. Bee-eaters, with their kaleidoscopic and very colourful plumage, are considered one of the world's most beautiful birds, and a very rare visitor to the UK . ‘Its flight path seemed almost triangular. I didn’t really appreciate the bird until I got home and looked at the photos. ‘I’d always wanted to see a bee-eater in this country but I never thought it would turn out to be a major wildlife event.’ More than 3,000 people have come to see the bee-eaters since news of their nesting attempt broke, with part of the site opened to public viewing once the eggs had hatched and the threat from egg collectors had subsided. National Trust wildlife adviser Matthew Oates said: ‘Bee-eaters are usually faithful to breeding sites so we’re hoping that they return in 2015, but this will be dependent on weather and other perils of migration that birds face. ‘Climate change may well lure other Mediterranean birds, and migratory insects, to our shores. There are exciting times ahead for UK nature lovers.’ Keith Ballard, site manager at the RSPB’s Brading Marshes reserves on the Isle of Wight, added: ‘To have four bee-eaters arrive on the Isle of Wight, nest safely, and return as 12 is a fantastic result, exceeding all expectations. ‘It’s been hard work but a great pleasure protecting these birds whilst allowing people to enjoy seeing them as well.’","A colony of the sun-loving birds has established on the Isle of Wight .

"By . Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . The father of notorious suspected terrorist Mohamed Elomar has spoken out for the first time, saying he is ashamed of his son. Lebanese immigrant Mamdouh Elomar - who came to Australian shores 40 years ago - said Mohamed had always been a devout Muslim, but his jump into jihad was only recent. Mamdouh is also close friends with the man his son threatened on Twitter, Dr Jamal Rifi - who condemned the younger Elomar for his role as a fighter for terror group Islamic State in Syria. Scroll down for video . Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar posed holding two decapitated heads in a disgusting display posted on social media in July . Mohamed's father Mamdouh Elomar is friends with Dr Jamal Rifi (pictured) who has denounced the actions of the younger Elomar . Coincidentally, the friends grew up on the same street as the father of Mohamed's Islamic State brother-in-arms, convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, in Tripoli, The Australian revealed. Mohamed targeted Dr Rifi - who lives in Sydney - on August 13 in a tweet that read: 'Anyone in Sydney who can give me the details of Habashi dog Dr Jamal Rifi, anything, house details, wat (sic) area am willing to pay $1000'. In a further tweet, he asked: 'Any details were he works or knows if his (sic) got kids which school they attend.' Dr Rifi's comments came after pictures posted by Mohamed's fellow Islamic State brother-in-arms, convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, showed a boy believed to be his son holding up a severed head as well as others of young children brandishing weapons. Mamdouh said every time he saw his son on the news he could not help but feel ashamed by Mohamed's actions. The senior Elomar has not heard from his son in two years after he kicked him out of his western Sydney home when his son was caught shoplifting at Sydney Airport. Before taking up with Islamic State, Mohamed was a boxer and worked as a surveyor or a draftsman at his father's business. These images of Khaled Sharrouf's son holding a severed head (left) and Sharrouf with young children holding weapons sparked condemnation world-wide, including from Dr Rifi . 'I haven't heard from him for two years, only what I have seen on the TV,' Mamdouh told The Daily Telegraph. 'I cannot understand what my son did, it makes me want to vomit.' To restore Australians' goodwill in the religion that has been smeared by the likes of Mohamed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf, Mamdouh and Dr Rifi are holding a 'Muslims 4 Australia' barbecue on September 14 in Lakemba 'to show the rest of society that Muslims view ourselves as part of Australia'. Despite having threats levelled at him, Dr Rifi has previously told Daily Mail Australia he was not afraid. 'Their actions shouldn't instil fear among us to the point where that fear will paralyse us,' he said. 'And that's why I would refuse to be fearful of their threats'. Dr Rifi made a number of public statements where he denounced the actions of the Australian terrorists. 'What we saw to be honest, (is) very disturbing, especially when it's done in the name of Islam,' Dr Rifi said. 'And it can only be done by a very sick person'. Sharrouf fled Australia on his brother's passport to Syria last year to fight for ISIS. Mohamed Elomar (pictured) threatened Dr Rifi but Mohamed's father has stood by the Sydney doctor . Sharrouf's (pictured) father, Dr Rifi and Mamdouh all grew up on the same street on Tripoli in Lebanon . Dr Rifi, a prominent member of Sydney's Islamic community, was a finalist in the 2009 Australian Local Hero awards. Dr Rifi said he was familiar with Khaled Sharrouf's father, but had never met the younger Sharrouf who has turned to terrorism. He has played an instrumental part in forging positive relationships between the Muslim and wider Australian communities. He was a founding member of Muslim Doctors Against Violence and the Christian Muslim Friendship Society. He helped recruit and train Muslim youth as surf lifesavers at Cronulla beach following riots in the Sydney Shire suburb in 2005.","Mamdouh Elomar has not talked to his son in two years after a falling out .

In the dark: The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that photos of Mohammed al-Qahtani should remain classified in the interest of national security. Al-Qahtani is pictured here in this undated photo. A federal appeals court on . Tuesday said that photos of a Saudi man accused of being the '20th hijacker' in the Sept. 11 attacks should remain classified to protect national security. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the . government plausibly showed that releasing images of Mohammed . al-Qahtani, who was subject to interrogation techniques that a . government official likened to torture, could endanger military . personnel, diplomats and workers in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents . al-Qahtani in a federal lawsuit in Washington, D.C. over his . treatment, had sought the disclosure of photographs, videos and . other audiovisual evidence of his confinement conditions under . the federal Freedom of Information Act. Writing for a three-judge panel, however, Circuit Judge José . Cabranes said the release 'could logically and plausibly harm . national security because these images are uniquely susceptible . to use by anti-American extremists as propaganda to incite . violence against United States interests domestically and . abroad.' Al-Qahtani has been held since February 2002 at the U.S. prison camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He had been the target of a 'special interrogation plan' that included 20-hour interrogations, sleep deprivation, . prolonged exposure to cold temperatures, forced nudity, . performance of dog tricks while wearing a dog collar, and sexual . humiliation, according to publicly leaked interrogation logs. Lawrence Lustberg, a lawyer representing the CCR, had no . immediate comment. A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara . in Manhattan declined to comment. A top Bush administration official overseeing practices at . Guantanamo declined to recommend that al-Qahtani be prosecuted, . telling the Washington Post in 2009 that his treatment 'met the . legal definition of torture.' The case was dismissed without . prejudice, meaning charges could be brought again. Classified: Photos from Mohammed al-Qahtani's confinement in Guantanamo Bay, the detention center pictured here in 2004, will remain classified . Nearly 3,000 people died in the Sept. 11 attacks. Four planes were hijacked, with two crashing into the World . Trade Center in New York, a third into the Pentagon near . Washington, and a fourth in a western Pennsylvania field.

"By . Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . A Queensland school has sparked outrage from parents - and even criticism from the state's local government minister - after they banned students from doing handstands, cartwheels and other 'cheerleading-style' stunts. Peregian Springs State School parents were advised in a recent school newsletter by deputy principal Sandy Cathcart that the activities were not allowed unless children were under supervision of a trained physical education teacher. The move has caused a stir among the school community, with some parents saying it placed an unneccesary restriction on their children's play time. Parents of Peregian Springs State School are outraged that the school has banned cartwheels, handstands and other gymnastic stunts . According to 9News, parents are asking why Peregian Springs will not just let children to be children and let them continue doing what they had been doing for many years. The Department of Education says it was up to the school to make individual decisions but Queensland's Local Government Minister David Crisafulli has criticised the school for imposing the ban. 'We believe in empowering the school and the principal to make those decisions, but I will say as an observation, when are we going to let kids just be kids?' he told 9News. 'When are we going to allow people to be able to just live their life as we have lived our lives for generations.' In a further statement to parents, principal Gwen Sands said they made the decision after students were injured while doing 'cheerleading-style' stunts . But not all parents are unhappy with the decision. Justin Dalbins' son attends the school and he has used social media to voice his support for the 'fantastic school'. 'There are many areas where it is concrete and we received a newsletter from the school this morning explaining that they had a few children who have already seriously hurt themselves doing these sort of things,' he wrote on Facebook. Another parent Russ Krause said the school and its staff had his full support on the matter. 'The initiatives and programmes that [principal Gwen] Sands has implemented into Peregian Springs SS, not only for students but for parents and the wider school community as well, only serve to prove her commitment to teaching and learning excellence,' he said. 'Dr. Sands and her staff have our children's welfare and safety uppermost in their minds.' The principal sent out a further statement to parents, saying the school had decided to impose the ban after some students were injured while doing 'cheerleading-style' stunts.","Queensland's Peregian Springs State School banned the gymnastic moves .

"By . Matt Chorley, MailOnline Political Editor . Giving schoolchildren hot lunches can be better for their learning than extra English and maths lessons, Nick Clegg claimed today. The Deputy Prime Minister said it was not surprising that children with packed lunches consisting of 'a slice of white bread with some chocolate spread in it and a fizzy drink' struggled to concentrate. He hailed a scheme offering almost 2million children aged under-7 who will be given free school meals which begins today. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg, visiting Clapham Manor Primary School in London today, said school meals were better than packed lunches . The Deputy Prime Minister launched the policy which will see 2million children aged under 7 receive free school lunches from this week . Almost two million infants will be fed at their primary school at no cost to their parents from today under the Liberal Democrat policy, saving families up to £400 per year. Mr Clegg insists offering free meals to all pupils, not just those from low income families, will make them healthier and improve academic attainment. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The evidence, and this has been exhaustively analysed, piloted, examined, is that giving a healthy hot meal at lunchtime is as, if not more, effective than many of the, say, literacy and numeracy initiatives which have been undertaken in the past in the classroom. It has a dramatic effect.' Mr Clegg today visited a school in London to launch the free meals scheme. He added: 'The evidence quite simply shows that this not only has a dramatic effect on those four in ten children who are in poverty but presently don't receive free school meals, the evidence also shows it's a great help to household budgets. 'It helps families save £400 per child for meal costs every year, but in the school where we piloted this...the children who were receiving a healthy meal at lunchtime are generally doing better - two months in advance in English and maths compared to their classmates. 'If you have children, and this does unfortunately happen, who turn up with a lunch box with a slice of white bread with some chocolate spread in it and a fizzy drink, it's not surprising they don't concentrate well in the afternoon.' He insisted that providing lunch for every five to seven-year-old at England's 16,500 primary schools will be more beneficial than some attempts to boost academic achievements. As the programme was launched, Mr Clegg vowed not to let critics 'cloud' his goal of creating a level playing field for all children, adding that the scheme is 'one of the most progressive changes to our school system for a long time'. The offer of free school meals for all infant pupils in England was announced by Mr Clegg at last year's Lib Dem conference, at a cost of £600million a year. Mr Clegg argued the policy would improve children's health and academic attainment, and help parents struggling with the cost of food . From this month an extra 1.89million children will qualify for the meals, regardless of their parents' income. It is expected to save even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child. But the policy has caused huge rows in the coalition, with Lib Dems accusing Tory Michael Gove of 'lying' about its implementation. Mr Clegg was forced to announce an extra £150million to build and extend kitchens to cope with the expected demand. The Local Government Association survey of 75 councils found that nearly half (47 per cent) said they had not received enough money from the Department for Education (DfE) to cover the full cost of the work they needed to do to ensure that schools in their area were ready to provide universal free meals for infants. The policy is expected to save even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child . Councils have complained that they have struggled to find the money to expand kitchens and dining halls to implement the policy . The shortfall across those councils that responded totals around £25.9 million, the association estimated. Of those that said that they did not have enough money, 49 per cent said that the council would help to make up the difference, with just over a third (37 per cent) saying at least some of the cash would come from school funds. Authorities had also reported that money could be taken from general school funding intended for school repairs and maintenance, the association said. The LGA said it had calculated that councils without enough money for the scheme have had to find an estimated £488,000 on average to ensure that pupils will get the meals they will be entitled to. It added that some schools will give pupils packed lunches and others will use portable kitchens to ensure they can offer the free lunches when the new school year starts, and work will continue on options for providing hot meals.","1.89million under-sevens to get free school lunches from this week .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A van driver who threw his hands in the air in disbelief after getting caught speeding was hauled before the courts for letting go of the wheel and not being in control of his car. Dean Kenworthy, 50, already had 11 points on his driving licence and realised he faced disqualification when he was caught travelling at 7mph over the speed limit on the A614 near Shiptonthorpe, East Yorkshire. However, the painter and decorator was prosecuted for 'failing to have proper control of a vehicle', in addition to the speeding offence, after he raised his arms upon realising he had been clocked by the speed camera. Scroll down for video . Dean Kenworthy, 50, threw his hands in the air in disbelief when he was caught speeding on the A614 in East Yorkshire. However, his actions saw him hauled before court for 'failing to have proper control of a vehicle' Prosecutor John Thirkettle told Hull Magistrates' Court: 'There are two matters, which both occurred at the same time. 'This gentleman has fallen foul of a speed enforcement van that has recorded him travelling at 57mph. 'Kenworthy has, for some reason, lifted both hands off the steering wheel as if portraying an expression of surprise.' Magistrates were shown a still image taken from the speed camera, which is operated by Safer Roads Humber, . Monique Jarvis-Legg, defending, said her client had not realised the van, which he leased, was limited to 50mph in 60mph zones. She said: 'My client accepts responsibility. He was raising his hands in disbelief, because he thought he was doing the right thing in keeping within the national speed limit.' Courts are obliged to consider disqualifying drivers who have 12 penalty points on their licence. However, Miss Jarvis-Legg said her client would 'essentially be bankrupt' if magistrates were to exercise their powers and disqualify him. Kenworthy, of Castleford, West Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to both offences and was fined £250, ordered to pay £85 in costs and a £25 victim surcharge . 'Mr Kenworthy cannot do his job using public transport,' she said. 'He does not have any formal qualifications. He has no other skills. He could not move happily into another job.' Magistrates also heard about Kenworthy's previous motoring offences, including being handed three penalty points for driving while using a mobile phone in March 2011. In June 2012, he was handed another three points for speeding and last October he was given five points for speeding. Miss Jarvis-Legg said: 'One more offence and he would be disqualified. He is aware of that. 'He assures me he will look up relevant speed limits and print out a list that he can readily refer to. 'My client is of good character and he does not trouble the courts.' Graham Barnett, chairman of the bench, said he accepted Miss Jarvis-Legg's claim that disqualification would cause Kenworthy exceptional hardship. Addressing the defendant, Mr Barnett said: 'In this case, there will be three penalty points added to his licence. There will be no disqualification. 'You are now on a knife's edge. If you come to the attention of a court again in the short future you will be disqualified.' Kenworthy, of Castleford, West Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to both offences and was fined £250, ordered to pay £85 in costs and a £25 victim surcharge. No separate penalty was given for the 'failing to have proper control of a vehicle' charge. A Safer Roads Humber spokesman said: 'The officers in the safety camera vehicles are able to enforce a range of traffic offences, including exceeding the speed limit. 'Offences like using a hand-held mobile phone, not wearing a seatbelt or not being in proper control of a vehicle are just some of the offences detected and will be prosecuted accordingly. 'Safer Roads Humber urgers motorist to drive safely at all times.'","Painter Dean Kenworthy, 50, broke speed limit on A614 in East Yorkshire .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A multimillionaire CEO who was caught repeatedly kicking a puppy on camera has resigned from his food service company after it was boycotted by customers. Surveillance cameras in the elevator of a Vancouver apartment building filmed Des Hague kicking the one-year-old Doberman pinscher, Sade, in the stomach in July. On Tuesday it emerged that Hague had resigned from Centerplate Inc., a $6 billion-dollar company that provides snacks at sports and entertainment arenas across the U.S., including Providence Park in Portland, the Superdome in New Orleans and the Javits Center in New York City . After the video emerged, sports teams pressured Centerplate to make a decision about Hague and urged fans to boycott the concession stands until he was removed,The Oregonian reported. Scroll down for video . Ousted: Des Hague has resigned from his CEO role at Centerplate, Inc., which provides snacks at sports and entertainment arenas across the U.S. It comes after he was caught on camera kicking a dog . Instead of stepping down, Hague initially agreed to attend counseling to address his anger management issues - but fans continued to demand his firing. Centerplate's board of directors have now played ball, announcing that they have replaced Hague, Global News reported. 'We want to reiterate that we do not condone nor would we ever overlook the abuse of animals,' Centerplate board chairman Joe O'Donnell said in a statement. 'Following an extended review of the incident involving Mr. Hague, I'd like to apologize for the distress that this situation has cause for so many; but also thank our employees, clients and guests who expressed their feelings about this incident. Disturbing: The footage showed Hague kicking a friend's Doberman pinscher in an elevator in July . Cruel: Another image from the footage shows him yanking the dog off the ground by its leash . 'Their voices helped us to frame our deliberations during this very unusual and unfortunate set of circumstances.' Chris Verros, the company's chief operating officer since 2010, will now be acting president and chief executive. The shocking video showed Hague kicking the dog as it cowered in the elevator before yanking its leash and swinging it around, in scenes that are hard to watch. After the video emerged Hague, who had been CEO of the company since 2009, said the dog belonged to a friend and apologized for his actions. 'This incident is completely and utterly out of character and I am ashamed and deeply embarrassed,' he said in a statement. He blamed his outburst on 'a minor frustration' with the dog. Terrified: The dog is seen cowering from Hague as he repeatedly kicks him. Hague later apologized for the outburst and vowed to donate money to animal charities - but sports fans demanded he stepped down . 'Unfortunately, I acted inappropriately, and I am deeply sorry for that and am very grateful that no harm was caused to the animal,' he said. Following the July incident, the BC SPCA removed the dog and Hague still faces the possibility of criminal charges, the Oregonian reported. The company has more than 30,000 employees and clients, including the Superdome in New Orleans, the Javits Center in New York City and college sports arenas like Notre Dame. Des Hague had been at the top for Centerplate since 2009. He is a veteran of the food-service industry having held senior positions at IHOP, Safeway and Taco Bell, according toFortune.","Des Hague was filmed repeatedly kicking the Doberman pinscher puppy in the elevator of a Vancouver apartment block in July .

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . A police community support officer who was accused of spanking a male colleague's backside while he moved a filing cabinet has been cleared of sexual assault. A trial heard Josephine Browne, 50, had developed an 'unhealthy interest' with the fellow officer at a London police station, spying on him in a locker room and flashing her bra at him. But today the jury at Southwark Crown Court took less than an hour to clear Browne of sexual assault. Cleared: PCSO Josephine Browne, 50, has been cleared of sexual assault after a colleague accused her of spanking his backside six times. Tonight jurors were still undecided on a lesser charge of common assault . They were still considering a lesser charge of common assault, on which she could still be found guilty tomorrow if the jury decide she struck the young man on the backside without sexual intent. During her two-day trial, it was also claimed Browne offered to massage the PCSO and behaved provocatively towards him in a lift during months of . harassment. Her accuser compared the alleged . peeping incident as 'like something out of Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho . movie' and said he felt more comfortable dealing with criminals. He said the spanking incident, alleged . to have occurred while he carried a filing cabinet through the . building with a colleague, was 'the final straw' after months of . harassment. Defendant: Browne was accused of flashing her bra at an officer and 'seductively' leaned towards him . He was supported by a third PCSO who said she had witnessed the alleged slapping last year. Prosecutor Leo Seelig, said previously: ‘All . this attention was completely unwanted by him. As it happens, he is gay . and it was upsetting and intimidating for him... Everyone, their . colleagues, knew about it. That attention upset and intimidated him’. But Browne, of Regents Park, north London, denied the allegations, insisting the incidents in question did not happen. The former professional gardener denied having any sexual interest in her accuser, telling the court when she took the stand: 'I don’t find him attractive at all.' She insisted she had a good relationship with the man and had 'no idea' why the allegations had been made. Browne said she had 'banter' with other male officers in the shared locker room but remained adamant she had never behaved inappropriately towards or spied on her colleague. Tessa Shroff, defending, told the jury today: 'Let’s be blunt about it. What the prosecution is alleging is that Miss Browne is a sex offender. 'None of this happened - it is absolute nonsense. That is what she (Browne) told you and she has nothing to prove. 'The prosecution has criticised her for being forgetful about whether she was ever on the same side of the locker room as (her accuser). 'If this is really the worst she has done, if that is the strength of the case against her then I would suggest to you that even the prosecution know this case is starting to slip.' The court heard the changing room was split into male and . female areas, and Browne would peer around a locker door and stare at the . complainant while he was changing. ‘Male’ and ‘female’ signs were then put up in the changing rooms after the officer . complained about Browne’s alleged behaviour. Prosecution barrister Leo Seelig insisted the incidents were real and distressing, adding: 'That is the reason (the . accuser) went to tell his supervisor having thought about it and that is . why he was concerned and upset. 'He’s . told you the truth from the witness box - he’s not an actor, he’s not . come to lie about what has happened. He was slapped and if you’re sure . about that she is guilty. Trial: Browne denied sexual assault and an alternative count of common at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) 'There . was a whole lot of sexual intent, a whole lot of provocative behaviour. It doesn’t matter whether he is gay, it was what she was doing.' Speaking from the witness stand, Browne's accuser said: 'I was really shocked and I was like “oh . my god” under my breath. I told her “stop, can you just stop and open . the doors” and she continued - and I think there was about two or three . more afterwards.' But Ms Shoroff told the jury the alleged victim and the witness had both initially said the incident happened in February last year, though Browne did not join the same police station until two months later. It was later alleged the incident happened on August 18 last year. She said: 'For one witness to get that wrong is one thing but for another to come up with the same incorrect month may give you concern. 'If you have doubt about the truthfulness of that, how do you feel about accepting their evidence about anything else?' The jury will return to continue deliberating on the common assault charge tomorrow.

A newlywed couple revealed today how they had the flight from hell on the way to their honeymoon - watching cabin crew flung to the ceiling in ‘terrifying’ turbulence. Lucy, 30, and David Westbrooke, 31, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, told MailOnline they were on an easyJet flight from London Gatwick to Naples, Italy, when it hit a fierce thunderstorm. The couple, who married just three days ago in Sevenoaks, claimed three air stewards hit the ceiling - with one knocked unconscious and another suffering a suspected broken hip. Scroll down for video . Newlywed couple: Lucy, 30, and David Westbrooke, 31, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, told MailOnline they were on an easyJet flight from London Gatwick to Naples, Italy, when it hit a fierce thunderstorm . 'Terrifying' turbulence: Damage to the interior of the plane can be seen where easyJet staff were thrown into the ceiling. The steward on the left is seen taking a photograph of the section he hit . Mr and Mrs Westbrooke were wearing . their seatbelts, but the bride suffered a sore neck. Several other . people were said to have been hurt when the plane apparently hit an air . pocket and dropped. The . airline has apologised to the 154 passengers on board ‘for any . inconvenience caused’. The flight, also carrying six crew, was diverted . almost 150 miles away to Rome for an emergency landing. Mrs . Westbrooke spoke to MailOnline today from Capri, having reached their . mini-moon destination. She said: ‘There was an announcement saying that . we’d be starting our descent into Naples. ‘The . flight had been fine until then. My husband noticed the seatbelt sign . went on. Most people had them off. Suddenly people were being thrown out . of their seats and hitting their heads. ‘Suitcases . were being thrown out of the lockers overhead. There was just utter . panic. People were screaming. There was a baby thrown up in the air and . the mother was just beside herself. ‘The . crew didn’t really know what was going on. Some of the Italians on . board were praying.

Naples (right) Mr Westbrooke added: ‘It was the worst air turbulence I’ve ever felt. You could just feel the plane nosedive. The air stewards and stewardesses were telling people to put on their seatbelts. ‘All three of them went up to the ceiling, and damaged the ceiling. All three knocked the panels out, and one stewardess was knocked out. There were a few nurses on doctors on board. 'Suitcases were being thrown out of the lockers overhead. There was just utter panic. People were screaming. There was a baby thrown up in the air and the mother was just beside herself' Lucy Westbrooke . ‘The main focus was on the stewardess. They were going round making round everyone was okay. Lots of people were being sick. They ran out of sick bags.’ He added that the pilot said the plane would have to make an emergency landing to Rome instead of Naples – and when they got there, passengers were given the opportunity to get off the plane before it went on to Naples. However, engineers then declared the plane unfit to fly on to Naples - so all the passengers had to disembark, and were transported by bus. The couple made it to Capri at 7pm yesterday - eight hours later than planned. Mrs Westbrooke said: ‘The crew were as terrified as us. Happy day: The couple married just three days ago at The New School at West Heath in Sevenoaks, Kent . Wedding: Mrs Westbrooke is assistant editor at Panini UK, while her husband is an exhibition organiser . 'No-one knew what was going on. In those moments, the plane was nosediving, I thought “This is it - we only got married on Saturday and haven’t even made it to our mini-moon”. It was terrifying.’ 'The air stewards and stewardesses were telling people to put on their seatbelts. All three of them went up to the ceiling, and damaged the ceiling. All three knocked the panels out, and one stewardess was knocked out' David Westbrooke . The couple - who married at The New School at West Heath in Sevenoaks, where Princess Diana was educated in its former guise as West Heath Girls' School - had earlier described the experience on social media as ‘too scary’. Mrs Westbrooke told her 2,000 followers on Twitter yesterday: ‘Mini-moon not off to best start. Emergency landing at Rome after hitting thunder storm and severe turbulence, member of crew knocked unconscious. ‘People thrown out of seats repeatedly and plane nosedived at speed. Screams and crying and throwing up from passengers. Too scary.’ She later added: ‘Never been so terrified.’ An EasyJet spokesman told MailOnline: ‘easyJet can confirm that flight EZY8529 from London Gatwick to Naples on September 1 diverted to Rome Fiumicino due to thunderstorms over Naples. 'Scary': Coffee stains on the ceiling after cups were thrown up during turbulence (left), and a view of the easyJet plane on the tarmac at Rome Airport after the passengers had disembarked (right) ‘The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is easyJet’s highest priority and our pilots are highly trained to manage turbulence. ‘Unfortunately due to the turbulence one of our crew sustained an injury, and as such were met by paramedics upon arrival at Rome Fiumicino airport in line with our procedures. 'In those moments, the plane was nosediving, I thought ""This is it - we only got married on Saturday and haven’t even made it to our mini-moon"". It was terrifying' Lucy Westbrooke . ‘The aircraft landed safely and routinely and all passengers disembarked normally and were transported to Naples by coach. ‘easyJet would like to apologise to passengers for any inconvenience caused. The aircraft was carrying 154 passengers and six crew.’ Mrs Westbrooke, who has degrees from the universities of Sheffield and Leicester, is assistant editor at Panini UK in Tunbridge Wells, and has worked for Teen Beach Movie, Just Pop, Mizz and Disney Animals magazines.

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Robots which can open doors and operate lifts without any help from humans are being used to deliver food to almost 1,000 patients around a new £430m hospital. Southmead Hospital in Bristol has brought in a the fleet of Automatic Guided Vehicles to pick up food and deliver them to patients. The droids, which start work every day at 10.15am, are even able to do the preparation work, by transferring chilled dishes to kitchens and heating up the food. These robots are being used to deliver food to almost 1,000 patients at Southmead Hospital, Bristol . The hospital has deployed a fleet of Automatic Guided Vehicles which start work at 10.15am each day to deliver meals to patients. This is the robots having picking up the food, ready to take to the wards . After completing their rounds, the 1ft tall machines return to their charging stations until they need to be used again for dinner. Catering manager Gary Wilkins said it was as simple as pressing a button and the machines did the rest. He said: 'They (the robots) are very slick and very quick. At first you are a bit worried about whether it is all going to work, but they are amazing.' The AGVs are also used to transport waste, linen, supplies, sterile instruments, endoscopes and pharmacy items around the building. The droids are capable of opening doors, operating lifts and picking up food without any human assistance . The machines operate in designated areas, which are primarily staff only, and have safety features including the ability to stop if something gets in the way. They are able to navigate their way along 'virtual tracks' using infra-red laser scanners and comparing what they sense with an in-built map. The machines served the heated-up prepared meals to patients at the hospital . It is hoped that the machines will soon be introduced in other parts of the hospital. The newly-built Southmead Hospital was recently criticised for its food, after one patient took pictures of poor portions. But Sharon Fortune, head of facilities for hospitality, defended the food available to patients. She said: 'We never run out of food on the wards, people can always ask for extra. It is up to the staff on the ward to judge it. 'We don't know if it is a frail old man we are serving or a large rugby player so it's up to each ward to know their patient's and serve food accordingly.' There has been growing pressure on hospitals around the UK to improve their menus. Last week, MailOnline published a series of photos of patients' sub-standard meals at hospitals around the country. The campaign was backed by TV chef James Martin, a hospital food standards campaigner. Doctors are also expressing concerns about the food served to hospital patients. The Government now says it is going to take action to help ensure that all hospitals serve good-quality food. Last week, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that, for the first time, there would be 'mandatory food standards' enforced through legally-binding NHS contracts. Hospitals that don't provide good enough food could be fined. Food will be rated on criteria such as quality and choice of meals and published in a league table on the NHS Choices website. It's not the first time a government has tried to improve hospital food. Since 1992, £54 million has been 'wasted' on 21 initiatives to try to raise standards, according to the Campaign for Better Hospital Food.","Bristol's Southmead Hospital has introduced Automatic Guided Vehicles .

"By . Melissa Hills For Daily Mail Australia . The text message sent to 120 miners . A mine operator has been forced to apologise to about 120 workers who they sacked by text message.

Thiess sent out the text messages last week telling them their positions had been terminated. Workers and union reps have slammed the action as 'disgusting'. The sacked workers used Thiess's Facebook page to vent their frustration and disappointment. 'What a bunch of dogs, sacking people by text How safe do you reckon these people felt driving home. Good work guys,' Bob Down wrote. David Ferguson said he was disgusted at the lack of respect the company had shown by sacking people by SMS. 'An employee, a human being, deserves far more respect when letting them know such a significant decision. Shame, Thiess, shame,' he said. 'Sacking people by SMS or automated message at best reeks of callousness and at worst of cowardice.' Thiess said workers had been told the mine would be scaled down in early August and that phone calls and SMS would be used to communicate developments. 'However, the use of SMS in this instance was an error and we apologise,' the company said in a statement on Tuesday. The mine is located between about 150km insland  south west of Mackay .

Australia's latest role in Iraq has received the backing of UN chief Ban Ki-moon, as the prime minister warns the ongoing mission carries risks. Within days RAAF aircraft will fly to the Kurdish capital Erbil to provide small arms, ammunition and aid as part of a US-led effort to fend off Islamic State militants. The UN Secretary-General says it's important nations such as Australia help address the situation in Iraq. Scroll down for video . UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has announced his support for Australia's military involvement in Iraq . Prime Minister Tony Abbott defended the risks associated with the mission by stating they 'are reasonable given the importance of the missions' 'Without addressing this issue through certain means, including some military and counter-terrorist actions, we will just end up allowing these terrorist activities to continue,' he told reporters in Auckland on Tuesday. Australia's international standing will go up a notch when Foreign Minister Julie Bishop accepts this week a formal invitation for the nation to become an 'enhanced partner' of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Although not a member, Australia's engagement with NATO has grown steadily in recent years especially through the mission in Afghanistan. Within days RAAF aircraft will fly to the Kurdish capital Erbil to provide small arms, ammunition and aid to Kurdish Peshmerga forces (pictured) fighting ISIS militants . This group, located in Mosel Iraq, is located only three kilometres from the ISIS front line . Ms Bishop is heading to the NATO summit in Wales as Prime Minister Tony Abbott warns of further risks involved in the Iraq mission. However he talked down reports of an Australian C-130 Hercules aircraft undertaking the country's second humanitarian airdrop to the town of Amerli, being shot at by extremists last weekend. The C-130 Hercules had been flying as low as 300 metres above the ground to deliver 15 packages of water, food and hygiene parcels, when it was shot at by both heavy machine guns as well as smaller arms, News Corp Australia had reported. Opposition leader, Bill Shorten has also expressed his support saying 'providing the Kurds with light weapons, the opportunity to defend themselves against people who would kill their families, to me is the only logical choice here,' A small ISIS compound: Nine news has reported that Britain will also consider airstrikes against he ISIS forces at a NATO summit this week . However Mr Abbott said: 'I'm not advised that they came under direct fire themselves'. Defence chief Mark Binskin tweeted there were no reports the transport came under fire, but ground fire was 'not unusual in a war zone'. Mr Abbott said risks should be expected. 'Obviously, flying humanitarian air drops into combat zones are full of risk. But the risks are reasonable given the importance of the missions they're flying.' Mr Abbott also talked down reports of an Australian C-130 Hercules aircraft being fired at by extresmists last weekend saying he was not advised that they had directly come under fire . The plane had been flying as low as 300 metres above the ground to deliver 15 packages of water, food and hygiene parcels, when it was shot at, News Corp Australia had reported . The US Defence Department said in a statement US aircraft had conducted three air strikes against nearby Islamic State terrorists in support of the Amerli airdrop, but all aircraft safely exited the area. Labor leader Bill Shorten restated his support for the airdrops and weapons airlift but acknowledged there were easy options there. 'Providing the Kurds with light weapons, the opportunity to defend themselves against people who would kill their families, to me is the only logical choice here,' Mr Shorten said. He later told Labor caucus the party would not support putting Australian troops on the ground in Iraq. Mr Abbott told a coalition joint party room meeting there had been no requests for combat troops and there was a 'world of difference' between the war in 2003 and today. 'What we do will be done with appropriate due process,' he said. Mr Abbott (right), alongside Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin (left), said Australian forces had already participated in a humanitarian airdrop . 'We want to make sure that we know where the arms and munitions go when we deliver,' Air Chief Marshal Binskin said on Sunday at a joint press conference with the Prime Minister. 'They will be landing and handing them over to officials from the Peshmerga.' The SAS soldiers are believed to be at Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates and will accompany the RAAF C-130J Hercules and C-17A Globemaster aircraft when the equipment is transported, Fairfax Media reports. 'This is about what is right for our country and what is best for our world,' Mr Abbott said on Sunday. He described the situation overseas as 'severe' and spoke of a specific type of terrorist 'who hate us not because of what we do, but because of what we are'. Prime Minister Tony Abbott responded to the request from the Obama Administration . Mr Abbott said he agreed to join the US-led effort and Australian forces had already participated in a humanitarian airdrop to northern Iraq. An RAAF C-17 Globemaster is will be delivering arms and munitions to Iraq after Australian agreed to requests from the US . The Prime Minister also assured that no specific request to step up Australian military involvement in the area had been made and if we were asked the decision would be made under very specific criteria. Meanwhile, Greens senators were outraged by the decision the Abbott government made without the consultation of parliament, The Age reports. Independent Andrew Wilkie is said to have told reporters in Hobart that cabinet should have had an input on the matter. 'If Tony Abbott wants us to be gun runners for the Kurds at the behest of the United States then we are part of the war,' he said, according to the website. The Iraq government and other regional countries will co-ordinate Australia's contribution. The US has stepped up its strikes against Islamic militants in northern Iraq this month, and is considering extending air strikes to Syria. Since August 8 the US has conducted more than 80 air strikes, according to Central Command.","UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has announced his support for Australia's military involvement in Iraq .

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . Same-sex marriage is one of the highly debated controversial issue which has divided our nation. Australians - for or against - have failed to reach common-ground on their views while under the current law, same-sex marriage remains illegal. But a new SBS six-part documentary has captured the raw realities of how two completely different worlds collide. Living with the Enemy firstly documents a Sydney-based Anglican minister and an engaged gay Melbourne couple who are required to spend five days in one world, then five days in the other. Scroll down for video . Melbourne couple Gregory Storer (left), Michael Barnett (middle) and Anglican minister David Ould (right), from Sydney, who feature in Living with the Enemy . The three spent 10 days with each other to discuss their views on same-sex marriage . Anglican minister David Ould from Macquarie Fields, Sydney's south-west, first met Michael Barnett and Gregory Storer in January. Both parties signed up for the SBS six-part series, with hope that they will conquer what has previously proved to be difficult - even in today's day and age. Fr Ould believes same-sex marriage is an emotionally laden topic of debate, which is why neither parties haven't been able to see eye-to-eye. 'It's often a discussion we don't have due to the stigmatisation of gay people and the stigmatisation of those who hold traditional views,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I went into the show not because I wanted to persuade the couple but because I finally wanted to have a gracious conversation about the issue.' But while Fr Ould acknowledges that there is a stigma surrounding homosexuality, he says they're not alone. 'There's a horrible irony to it,' he said. 'I've been called a homophobe, gay-hater, fundamentalist and worse. You should see my email this week, it's a treat.' Fr Ould says receiving hate mail and being denounced for this views has become the norm. 'Most days I get told I'm stupid,' he said. 'Any Christian learns the reality quite quickly that we are branded in certain ways.' Fr Ould is a minister at Macquarie Fields in south-west Sydney . Fr Ould believes marriage is a lifelong union between a man and woman and should not be redefined . Michael and Gregory, who got engaged in August last year and married in New Zealand during the documentary, also hoped their opposing views with Fr Ould would 'meet somewhere in the middle'. 'But we didn't move very far because there was a stalemate,' Michael told the Daily Mail. We weren't able to talk to David about issues objectively as he had a vested interest due to his professional capability.' Michael, who previously had long term relationship with an Anglican priest, says he wasn't surprised or shocked when he met Fr Ould. 'His religious views are very crippling for him and in some way I feel sorry for him,' he said. The couple, who are both passionate atheists, chose to take religion out of their lives as they were sick of being told they were 'sinners' for being homosexual. Thus Michael cannot fathom why he's being refused a right that's entitled to any other Australian. 'I feel as though I'm being denied the opportunity to be equal to others based on things that is beyond my control like my sexual orientation or sexual identity,' he said. For Michael and Gregory, their definition of marriage is a simple one. 'It's a legal contract between two consenting adults,' Michael said. 'It's literally a piece of paper that shows the love and commitment to each other.' Gregory and Michael got married in New Zealand during the filming of the documentary earlier this year . But Fr Ould says marriage is more sacred than just an affirmation of love. 'It's an important social structure and has been for hundreds of years,' he said. 'It's a lifelong union between a man and woman, who normally produce children and a place where children are best raised.' The Melbourne couple listen to Fr Ould's sermon at his Sydney Anglican church . What Fr Ould stressed was that he wasn't against 'gay marriage'. 'Greg and Michael have the right to live an unhindered life and the right to a contractual relationship but we're opposed to the redefinition of marriage,' he said. When asked whether he thought that the biblical idea of marriage was outdated, he said: 'the idea isn't archaic because it's a timeless part of nature and God stands above time.' 'While the world around us is changing, marriage doesn't – the biology and physiology of it doesn't change,' he said. Michael says Fr Ould's views are disingenuous. 'Marriage is redefined constantly from women being owned by their husbands to men having multiple wives,' he said. 'While the religious approach may not change, marriage can be redefined because it already has been.' Michael believes with the growing support for marriage equality in Australia, it's only a matter of time that the law will be altered. While Fr Ould's stance remains the same, he says the overall experience has been enlightening. 'It made me more acutely aware of the pain gay, lesbian and bi-sexual people feel from our community,' he said. For Michael and his husband, they just want to be treated equally. 'We no longer want to be treated as second class citizens,' Michael said.

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . and Australian Associated Press . Social commentator and feminist Jane Caro insulted generations of women when she compared marriage to prostitution, a women's advocate says. Caro said her comments on ABC TV's Q&A on Monday night were not aimed at modern wives, but she was speaking about the institution of marriage in the past. 'I wasn't calling them prostitutes; I was merely saying that old fashioned marriage from that period is uncomfortably close to an economic transaction,' she told AAP. Scroll down for video . Jane Caro made the remarks in a special Festival of Dangerous Ideas panel on Q&A on Monday night . She has since adamantly stood by her comments while trying to clarify that she was not saying people's 'grandmothers' are prostitutes . 'I have been married for 39 years, I was at home with small children for five years. 'Why would I say such a thing?' Caro said on the program: 'I would argue that traditional marriage which included conjugal rights, particularly when women were not able to go to work or were fired when they first got married, and were basically selling their bodies and their reproductive rights to their husband - he bought them by giving her room and board in return - was a form of prostitution.' Australian Christian Lobby spokeswoman on women's issues, Wendy Francis, said the comments were offensive to women, including her mother, who she said was a feminist in her time. 'I wasn't calling them prostitutes; I was merely saying that old fashioned marriage from that period is uncomfortably close to an economic transaction,' she said . 'My very first thought when I first saw it was ""I really hope my mother isn't watching this"",' Ms Francis told AAP. 'It definitely was an insult to previous generations.' Caro said it wasn't until 1882 that women were able to retain their own money when they married. She said in some professions women were fired when they got married in Australia until the 1970s. 'These days because women earn their own money and make their own choices and have lots of economic opportunities ... marriage is a really much better institution now than it was,' Caro said. The comments were made amongst an all female panel which veered into a debate about sex work last night. Off the back of recent stories about how journalist Amanda Goff became a sex worker, the panel was asked: 'What do you think of prostitution as a conscious career choice in a first world country?' Ms Caro engaged in a back-and-forth over the matter with fellow panelist Swedish author Kajsa Ekman . Fellow panelist Swedish author Kajsa Ekman rejected Ms Caro's remarks as an 'an abstract comparison' as some sex workers have up to 15 buyers a day. Caro also saught to clarift the analogy she 'was clumsily trying to make' by publishing a column in the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday titled 'Why housewives are not prostitutes'. 'I did not want to isolate sex workers as a group, so I sought to broaden the question out to the way all women were caught up in an economic transaction in the past by talking about traditional marriages that included conjugal rights,' Caro wrote. She  went on to describe the period of time she had been referring to when women had no rights to property or  their children and men were lawfully allowed to 'discipline' their wives. 'That still did not make the women in such relationships prostitutes but it did make marriage much more about survival than choice,' she wrote. Caro also mentioned how until the 70s, women were often fired from their jobs in Australia when they either married or became pregnant, saying that it made 'the way society policed marriage uncomfortably close to an economic transaction.'","Jane Caro came under fire for her on Monday, when she said that housewives in traditional marriages were like prostitutes .

"By . Martin Ziegler, Press Association . A winter World Cup in Qatar in 2022 would make 'much more sense' according to one of FIFA's most senior figures in the Middle East. FIFA executive committee member Prince Ali Bin al Hussein of Jordan, speaking as a FIFA task force met in Zurich to look at the timing of the tournament, said it would be 'wonderful' to have a World Cup in the region but that due to the extreme temperatures in summer it should be moved. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore and FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke were among those at the Zurich meeting, chaired by Asian football confederation president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa from Bahrain. Hot issue: FIFA are considering holding a winter World Cup in Qatar . It is understood Valcke, Scudamore and other members of the working group favour a November/December tournament to minimise disruption to the rest of the football calendar. Prince Ali, speaking at the Soccerex conference in Manchester, said 'It would make much more sense to have it in the winter.' There is still the outcome of an investigation by FIFA ethics chief Michael Garcia into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to take into account and Prince Ali said he hoped it would address the decision to hold the vote for both tournaments at the same time. He added: 'One of the questions is why there was a double bid in the first place and in all fairness, for 2022, if they had had another four years to iron out those details things would not be as they are. Influential: FIFA executive committee member Prince Ali Bin al Hussein of Jordan . 'I hope things go smoothly but it would be wonderful to have a World Cup in our part of the world.' The task force was attended by representatives from confederations, FAs, leagues and clubs as well as the players' union FIFPro, the European Clubs Association and Qatar 2022 chief executive Hassan Al Thawadi. Sheikh Salman said: 'This is the first meeting and there will be future meetings on this matter. As the FIFA Executive Committee has emphasised, the consultation process should not be rushed but instead be given the necessary time to consider all of the elements relevant for a decision. 'We have made progress at today's meeting and will continue to work together to find the best solution for football.' Valcke clarified that, based on the hosting agreement, the World Cup must be held in 2022. The options of January/February 2022 - which would likely clash with the winter Olympics - and November/December 2022 were put forward as alternatives to June/July 2022.

"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . and Reuters . A regional German court has issued a temporary injunction against Uber, the U.S.-based online chauffeur service, saying its drivers lacked necessary commercial permits, potentially barring the company from operating in cities across Germany. San Francisco-based Uber, which allows users to summon taxi-like services on their smartphones, has faced regulatory battles and court injunctions from its early days, even as it has expanded rapidly into roughly 150 cities around the world. In its ruling, the Frankfurt Regional Court said the company could no longer offer its Uber and UberPop phone apps to connect drivers with passengers, stating that Uber's network of drivers lacked the necessary commercial licenses to pick up passengers. Banned: A regional German court has issued a temporary injunction against Uber . Taxi drivers gather next to the Olympia Stadium to protest ride-sharing apps on June 11 in Berlin . German law only allows drivers to pick up passengers without a commercial license if the driver charges no more than the operating cost of the trip. Because Uber stands to take a cut of any charges, the court held it liable and issued an injunction against the service. Legal experts said the ruling applies nationwide unless Uber appeals and subsequent decisions limit the scope of the ban. Founded in 2009 and valued at $18.2 billion after its latest funding round in June, Uber Technologies contends that it is an electronic marketplace that connects drives with customers, not a transportation service itself. Drivers must carry a valid driving license, have necessary local permits and undergo background checks before they pick up passengers, it says. The suit was brought by Taxi Deutschland, a Frankfurt-based consortium of taxi companies operating in major cities across Germany. Taxi Deutschland offers its own taxi-hire apps for smartphones. The ruling drew praise from other industry groups including Taxi.eu which said it put Uber drivers on a 'level playing with the 150,000 drivers it counts in its pan-European network'. Even in its home city of San Francisco, Uber has had to overcome legal and regulatory hurdles from city authorities concerned its services sidestep rules governing commercial transport and by taxi companies hoping to keep competition out. London black-cab drivers take part in a protest against Uber . Taxi drivers across Europe caused chaos in June by protesting against the service but it has continued to grow in popularity. Uber last week said that it was experiencing 'huge demand' for its services in German cities including Berlin, Frankfurt and Hamburg and that it planned to expand into Cologne and Stuttgart by the end of this year. In the last four months of this year, Uber had expected to double the number of subscribed users in Germany, after growing fivefold so far in 2014, the company said. An Uber spokesman said: 'Germany is one of the fastest growing markets for Uber in Europe. We will continue to operate in Germany and will appeal the recent lawsuit filed by Taxi Deutschland in Frankfurt. 'We believe innovation and competition is good for everyone, riders and drivers, everyone wins. You cannot put the brakes on progress. Uber will continue its operations and will offer Uberpop ridesharing services via its app throughout Germany.​' A demonstrator kicks a car, suspected to be a private taxi, during a 24-hour taxi strike and protest in Madrid, Spain on June 11, 2014.

Superfit Aslan Steel - and yes, that is the name he was born with - from Lewes in East Sussex, spent three months planning and training for his impressive feat, which involved pulling off a handstand on top of a submarine and planking on a helicopter. The 29-year-old decided to take on the challenge to raise money for St Peter and St James hospice in memory of his mother, Keetje Steel, who passed away in May. Flying high: Aslan Steel, 29, is pictured performing the plank pose on a helicopter to raise money for hospice in memory of his mother . Head for heights: Aslan Steel is pictured performing a handstand on top of HMS Alliance, a Second World War submarine . The street gymnast began his challenge on Saturday in East Grinstead by pulling off a 'human flag' hold  off the side of a massive Chevrolet Monster Truck. He then moved on to a 'V-sit' pose on the back of a classic Harley Davidson motorcycle, before holding an agonising 'side-sit' on the top of a Benetton B189 F1 car. Aslan says: 'I really wanted to push myself to the limit to raise money in memory of my mum. Hanging around: Aslan Steel performs a human flag hold off the side of a Chevrolet Monster Truck . 'St Peter and St James Hospice really cared for her, and I want to help them out as much as possible. 'The most difficult holds were on the back of the Harley or on the F1 car.

"By . Matt Barlow Reports From Basle . Nostalgia had been in overdrive long before Roy Hodgson stepped off the plane on Sunday, as the nation famed for its clock-making turned them back to an era when the England boss sparked a revolution in Swiss football. ‘We are still benefiting today from the structures he put in place at the time,’ said their new manager Vladimir Petkovic, as he joined the reflection on Hodgson’s influence, nearly 20 years on. Petkovic was playing in Switzerland at the time, nearing the end of his career and starting to take an interest in coaching. Revolution: Current England boss Roy Hodgson guided Switzerland to the World Cup back in 1994 . Influential: New Switzerland boss Vladimir Petkovic says the nation are still benefitting from Hodgson's spell . Hodgson proved to be a modernising force. It was his work with the Swiss - leading the national team to their first World Cup finals in 28 years - that made Inter Milan come calling. Last week, popular tabloid newspaper Blick ran a series entitled: ‘Roy was for me…’ which featured memories from the stars of his USA ’94 squad. ‘Roy welded us together,’ said Ciriaco Sforza, who won 79 caps for Switzerland and would follow Hodgson to Inter. ‘We would train and train again. By the time we were finished, we could do it blind. We had success that made us strong against any opponent. Practice makes perfect: Hodgson's Switzerland side would train and train in order to perfect their style of play . ‘Before the World Cup we were all hungry players and after the World Cup, most of us were sold abroad. There we pushed the doors open for the next generations.’ Having been appointed in January 1992, at the age of 44, Hodgson devoted time to drilling the team into his style. Clubs agreed to release players for four mini training camps each year. They would gather in different parts of the country for three days of intensive tactical work. Most Swiss clubs were playing with a sweeper at the time and he was keen to reshape them into a 4-4-2 formation. It must have worked. At one point in ‘93, they were ranked third in the world by FIFA. After the World Cup in ’94, they qualified for Euro ‘96, although Hodgson left for Inter in November ‘95. ‘He was a leader in terms of tactics,’ said striker Adrian Knup. ‘He founded the 4-4-2 system. We soon realised this system could lead to success, and that gave us confidence. The whole of Swiss football has become stronger thanks to him.’ Hodgson’s success attracted sponsorship, including finance giants Credit Suisse, who funded four new academies and supported the Switzerland youth teams. ‘Thanks to Roy, money could be generated,’ said Stephane Chapuisat, the star of Hodgson’s team. ‘We are still reaping the fruits of his work.’ At the turn of the century, the Swiss FA also sank time and money into their youth system and developed links to ethnic communities in their cities after a time when the country was receiving many immigrants fleeing from the former Yugoslavia. Tactician: Hodgson changed the style of Swiss football and reshaped the national team into a 4-4-2 formation . The population is just over eight million but here was an influx of talent from a part of the world where football ruled. Many of them had a healthy desire to make a better life, which collided with a fast-improving football infrastructure in Switzerland. It has helped produce team successes such as the U17 world title in 2009 and high-quality individuals like Xherdan Shaqiri, who left Kosovo for Switzerland at the age of one, and Granit Xhaka, who was born in Basle to parents from Kosovo. It is a multicultural generation which forms the basis of the team managed by Petkovic, a Bosnian-Croat who emigrated from Sarajevo for Switzerland in 1987 and replaced Ottmar Hitzfeld after the World Cup in Brazil. He will put his own influence on Swiss football, and there are suggestions he will flex Hitzfeld’s favoured 4-2-3-1 formation into a 4-3-3 shape for his first game in charge. The nostalgia does not extend to a return to 4-4-2 (not for Switzerland, anyhow) but they will be forever grateful to Hodgson, their catalyst for change. High quality: Xhedran Shaqiri (right) is one of a number of talented youngsters among the Switzerland squad .","England manager Roy Hodgson guided Switzerland to World Cup '94 .

It followed a gastric bypass operation carried out in 2008. At that point, he weighed around 41 stone and had a body mass index of 67, three times what it should have been. But the inquest heard ‘complications’ quickly arose after he was anaesthetised for the apronectomy procedure and he went into cardiac arrest for around 10 minutes. Mr Ross, who had four children and three step-children, was revived but suffered brain damage, his ex-wife Christine Blay told the hearing. He was taken to the cardiac intensive care unit at Wythenshawe Hospital then transferred to the specialist Dermot Murphy care home in Withington, where he had 24-hour care. He died in hospital on August 10 after developing bronchial pneumonia. The inquest heard Mr Ross had a very large heart due to his obesity and high blood pressure. Mrs Blay, 49, his wife for 11 years, said his weight rose after he stopped working following a fall. He also suffered asthma and diabetes. Coroner Nigel Meadows was told that the surgery was approved and he went for a pre-operative anaesthesia assessment a week before, where he was classed as high risk. Mrs Blay said that after he was admitted she was told that the operation hadn’t gone ahead and he was in a critical condition after a ‘cardiac event’. The inquest heard Mr Ross’s heart stopped during an attempt to intubate him, or insert a tube down his throat. The operation in March 2011 followed gastric band surgery in 2008, after which Mr Ross' weight fell from 41 to 26 stone, an inquest at Manchester Coroners' Court heard. Pictured is the private Spire Hospital in Manchester . Anaesthetist Dr Deborah Nolan said there was a high risk of complication because he was morbidly obese. It was a ‘difficult intubation’ after relaxant and anaesthetic drugs were given before his oxygen levels dropped, the inquest heard. He was immediately given oxygen but his heart rate dropped, Dr Nolan said. She said she had given him sufficient amounts of anaesthetics and had reacted in a ‘appropriate and timely’ way. The inquest continues.","Andrew Ross, 48, suffered severe brain damage prior to the operation .

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . Karen Nettleton, mother-in-law of Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, told the trade union royal commission he got her a job with a company linked to underworld figure George Alex . The grandmother of a young boy photographed with the head of a decapitated soldier in Syria broke down after giving evidence at the trade union royal commission. Karen Nettleton, mother-in-law of Khaled Sharrouf, worked as an accounts payable clerk for a company linked to underworld figure George Alex. On Monday she was questioned about payments coming from Elite Access Scaffolding. The royal commission is investigating whether the NSW Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) was paid kickbacks by Mr Alex's companies. She told the commission her son-in-law Sharrouf, who is originally from Sydney but fighting with ISIS militants in Syria, had arranged an interview for her at Mr Alex's company. In early August a gruesome photo of a young boy, believed to be Sharrouf's son, holding a severed head was posted on a Twitter account. Ms Nettleton's daughter Tara is married to Sharrouf, and the couple have five children who are all thought to be in the Middle East. When the graphic image emerged Peter Nettleton - the boy's grandfather - told News Corp  he was 'devastated' by the photograph, and added he felt sorry for Tara, the child's mother. However friends of Sharrouf such as Wissam Haddad jumped to his defence, saying this is what every 'sensible Muslim' wants for their family and children. The elderly former neighbour of the Sharrouf family recently revealed to Daily Mail Australia what it was like to live next door to them. In August this shocking image of a child, believed to be Sharrouf's son, holding the severed head of a man emerged on social media . Sharrouf fled to Syria with his five children and is believed to be fighting alongside IS militants . Last month Joyce told of the quiet life that Tara Nettleton lived, but how Sharrouf would come and go at all hours of the day and night. She said she was not always worried about living next door to the couple until police helicopters descended on their small road in 2005. Joyce also added Sharrouf used to come home at 3am after being out with his friends and bang on the door saying ‘Tara let me in’ At the commission Karen Nettleton was also asked about $2500 disguised as 'union payment', and confirmed Sharrouf was an associate of Mr Alex, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Ms Nettleton (right) was questioned about payments coming from Elite Access Scaffolding, a company linked to Mr Alex . After a short grilling in the witness box, Ms Nettleton left the commission. The commission also saw prison inmate Jim Kendrovski refuse to answer questions over fears for the safety of his family, after he was assaulted at Parklea jail last week after being summonsed. Details of the how Sharrouf, ex-Comanchero bikie Bill Fatrouni and CFMEU NSW were all seen at Mr Alex's home. The hearing continues. Ms Nettleton's is thought to have helped her daughter and son-in-law flee to the Middle East .","Karen Nettleton told the trade union commission Khaled Sharrouf got her a job with an associate .

"By . Phil Gradwell for MailOnline . Follow @@GraddersOnline . India have been tucking into England's bowling all the way through this one-day international series and they were pictured gorging on fast food during practice. Virat Kohli and his team-mates seemed confident enough ahead of the final ODI to fill their faces with McDonald's and Nando's on the Headingley outfield. The pictures seems like a throwback to the days before dieticians and nutritionists were commonplace in top-class sport and it is rare to see elite stars shovelling down burgers and fries. Tucking in: India's marquee batsman Virat Kohli scoffs down some fast food on the Headingley outfield during a nets session .

Burger kings: Shikhar Dhawan tucks into some fries (left), while (right) Edgbaston hero Suresh Raina is happy with a Quarter Pounder . However, India's ability to score quick runs on this tour has earned them the right to eat a bit of fast food before a dead rubber. Their nutritional habits seem a long way from England's approach ahead of the Ashes Down Under, when they were ridiculed for their 82-page menu, including such delicacies as quinoa. England have barely given the tourists any food for thought in the previous three matches and were hammered at Edgbaston on Tuesday, losing by nine wickets with 19-and-a-half overs to go. Moeen Ali thinks the hosts can learn a lot from India - but he did not mean in their refuelling habits. He said: 'Me sitting on the sidelines for the first two games, watching the way Indians bat, you can learn a lot from the way they approach it, with no fear and just back themselves. 'If there is a risk, they just take it. Sometimes it doesn't come off but as a team if we can all do that and execute the plan like I say then we will be fine.' In the seconds: Kohli gestures to the dressing room while patting his stomach - perhaps he was asking for more?","India eating fast food during nets session at Headingley .

"By . Jemma Gillard for MailOnline . A couple  definitely managed to leave their mark on each other when they got married at a tattoo convention and were inked with each others' initials instead of exchanging rings. Dani Cook, 25, had been looking forward to a traditional white wedding when she arrived to tie the knot with Adam Butler, 29, at Alexandra Palace in London. But instead of the intimate ceremony and beautiful castle setting she had hoped for, the council worker was met with a hall crammed with 10,000 ink-loving strangers. Wedding bells: Dani Cook, 25, and Adam Butler, 29, married at a tattoo convention in front of 10,000 strangers . Adam had been tasked with arranging the surprise ceremony as part of a TV reality show but decided to hold the entire thing at the tattoo convention in London. The wedding venue shouldn't have come as a complete shock for the bride, as the fun loving couple from Torquay, Devon, are mad about tattoos and even have matching ones. 'I have 22 tattoos in total including a portrait of John Lennon and Dani has around 11,' revealed bar manager Adam. 'I have a king of hearts suit on my finger and Dani has the queen on hers. 'Because of our love of tattoos, I thought the convention would be ideal for us. But it wasn't just the event that I was sold on: the venue and it's grounds are stunning and I was blown away by it. 'It was hard to carry the tattoo theme throughout the day, especially at the reception, but I think I managed to pull it off.' Romantic: Adam was in charge of arranging the wedding and opted for a convention instead of a castle . Happy: The pair cut their cake which, like the rest of the wedding, also had a colourful body art theme . Instead of exchanging rings at the altar, Adam arranged for a tattoo artist to ink the first letter of their names on each others' wedding ring finger. Even though the bride spent most of the day travelling from Devon to London in a minibus, that didn't stop Adam from giving Dani her special day. Dani admitted that although her original thoughts were 'I can't believe this is happening', she thoroughly enjoyed her unusual wedding. 'My dream was to get married in a stately home with the ceremony or reception taking place outside, but on the day all I could think about was Adam. 'The most important part for me was to have my whole family at the wedding and for my father to walk me down the aisle. 'He done well choosing my dress, but the worst part was not having any contact or any say in the plans.' Who are you? Along with family members and friends, the guest list included everyone at the convention . At least she said I do! Dani smiles as she and Adam exchange vows in front of 10,000 strangers . Romantic: The couple have new tattoos added to their fingers in place of a more traditional ring . The newlywed's story appeared in BBC Three show Don't Tell The Bride, which sees men organise their weddings behind their partners' backs. Producers give the groom £12,000 to plan a wedding in just three weeks - but allow him no contact with his fiancee. As a result, the weddings can be unusual, with Adam admitting that giving him the reins was particularly risky because, he says, he is 'lazy' and never does anything around the house. 'I wanted to show Dani that I could do it and that I don't always leave everything to the last minute,' he added. All done: The couple show off their new tattoos following the ceremony at a body art convention in London . Speaking about his unusual choice of venue, he said: 'We love to mess around and do silly things and I'd say our shared love of tattoos are just an added bonus to us as a couple. 'We both knew that we wanted to get married and we never wanted a long term engagement so it worked perfectly. 'It was incredible when the Arctic Monkeys song, Do I Wanna Know started and my wife made her entrance - I got goosebumps.'","Dani Cook, 25, married Adam Butler, 29, in front of 10,000 strangers .

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . When Carmen Waters took her dog for a walk with her boyfriend on Sunday, she thought it was just like any other weekend. She didn't even think twice when her boyfriend Kane Thomas pointed out a plane flying past with a banner saying 'CARMEN WILL YOU MARRY ME?' 'I looked up and saw and thought ""Oh look there's banner, maybe someone's proposing,"" not even thinking,' Ms Waters told the Daily Mail Australia. Kane Thomas and Carmen Waters got engaged in Mona Vale in Sydney's northern suburbs on Sunday . Mr Thomas, 25, proposed to Ms Waters, 21, with a plane and sky banner . 'I even saw the name Carmen and thought ""That's a coincidence"" but didn't think it was for me. 'Then I turned around and he was down on one knee.' Ms Waters, a 21-year-old childcare worker from Mona Vale in Sydney's northern beaches, said she was in complete shock – especially when she realised their friends and family were in on the surprise and were waiting nearby. 'I said yes – obviously – then he made a phone call, and my family and his family were waiting around the corner and they all came over,' she said. 'Everyone was really excited and emotional. Mr Thomas had been trying to propose for weeks but kept having to cancel his grand gesture because of rainy weather . The couple met at a party and have been together for four years . 'Then as we were standing there like 100 dolphins swam past - it couldn't have been more perfect.' Mr Thomas, a 25-year-old concrete pumper, had been trying to propose at the Mona Vale Headland Reserve for weeks but had to cancel three times because of rainy weather. Last month Sydney experienced its wettest August in 16 years. 'It was the first sunny day in ages so apparently he rang everyone and was like ""It's on, it's today!""' she said. Mr Thomas and Ms Waters were taking their dog Gypsy for a walk at the Mona Vale Headland Reserve when he popped the question . Their family and friends were waiting around the corner, and ran out to surprise Ms Waters after she said yes . 'I can't believe everyone can keep secrets from me this well, that makes me worried!' Ms Waters said she was so surprised because she thought she would be able to tell when Mr Thomas was planning to propose. 'I honestly thought I would have some sort of sign, I know him so well I thought he wouldn't be able to keep it from me,' she said. 'I didn't think we'd be doing a day-to-day thing, but we were just doing something we always do.' Later in the day the couple (pictured centre and second from right) celebrated their engagement with friends . Ms Waters described Mr Thomas as 'the perfect boyfriend' After the proposal the couple, who met at a party almost four years ago, took plenty of photos with their friends and family before going out to lunch in Manly. There was also a second surprise in store – Mr Thomas had organised for all their friends to celebrate the engagement at a nearby pub that afternoon. 'He is the perfect boyfriend and I've been living with him for three years and I can still say that,' she said. 'He's amazing, my parents absolutely adore him, he just treats me like I'm a princess.' The couple are planning to get married on October 31 next year - their five-year anniversary - somewhere on Sydney's northern beaches.","Kane Thomas, 25, from Mona Vale on Sydney's northern beaches, proposed to girlfriend Carmen Waters, 21 .

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . A father and son were forced to bite a dog and stab it with garden shears when it attacked their pet during a walk in a suburban street. Luke Shearer, 26, of Coventry, West Midlands, repeatedly stabbed an attacking Staffordshire bull terrier with the tool as he tried desperately to get it to release its grip on his pet husky Sky. When the Staffie refused to let go even after it had been stabbed, Luke wrestled the dog away by biting the animal on the head. Scroll down for video . Luke Shearer was forced to stab and bite a Staffordshire bull terrier after it attacked his husky Sky while he and his father, Derek, were walking their dog in Coventry, West Midlands . The incident happened after the animal broke free while being walked by two children. Luke, who was walking Sky with his father, Derek, said people in the area stood and filmed on their phones rather than helping. Luke, who suffers from post traumatic stress disorder, said: 'It happened so quick. We were walking to cut my grandma's hedge so we had the shears with us. 'The dog came and jumped at Sky's neck, and it was life or death for my dog, so I just reacted and hit it with what I had. 'My dad was hitting it with his walking stick but that didn't work, so I stabbed it four or five times in the spinal column, but it kept coming. I jumped on it and started biting its face until it let go. 'The kids were terrified, it's not their fault, it's their parents. It's like sending them out with a loaded gun to play with. 'Now I'm worried about the dog, I'm worried it hasn't been taken to a vet to get treatment.' Beloved family pet Sky is now on medication after the incident, which her owners described as 'pure hell' He also hit out at the bystanders who filmed on their phones rather than helping. He said: 'I thought I had broken my arm, they could have called an ambulance or the police but they just filmed. 'What world are we living in where they stand there and film rather than phoning for help? It's irresponsible.' Three-year-old Sky is now on medication, but will make a full recovery and Luke was released from hospital after his arm was checked. Luke's father Derek, 59, said: 'It was three minutes of pure hell. People were filming and laughing, not one person helped. 'Luke's cracking up because of what he had to do to that dog. The police need to find the owners.' A spokesman for West Midlands Police said they are looking into the incident and are trying to trace the owner as a criminal offence may have been committed by allowing the dog off the lead.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association Sport . Lewis Hamilton has already opened talks with Mercedes with regard to signing a new deal. Last week Mercedes confirmed they had signed Nico Rosberg to a new long-term contract, believed to run through to the end of 2016. The German manufacturing giant is now eager to extend its partnership with Hamilton, who still has another 18 months to run of his initial three-year agreement. VIDEO Scroll down to see Lewis Hamilton: From karting kid to world champion . In talks: Lewis Hamilton is in discussions over a new deal with Mercedes . Hamilton revealed last week ahead of the German Grand Prix he was 'quite relaxed' with regard to his situation with Mercedes. The 29-year-old stated he was 'very, very happy in the team', adding he felt it would be 'very difficult for me to see myself anywhere else' given his association with Mercedes since the age of 13. Hamilton, however, kept the door slightly ajar for a move elsewhere as he said: 'But you never know what the future may hold.' Hamilton, Rosberg and Mercedes are currently F1's dream ticket as the duo have won nine of the 10 races so far this season, whilst the team is firmly on course for the constructors' title. Although there have been moments of consternation for motorsport boss Toto Wolff to contend with, the Austrian is eager to retain Hamilton beyond the end of 2015. 'We are already sitting together and negotiating with Lewis about a multi-year contract,' said Wolff, speaking to Austria's Kronen Zeitung newspaper. 'Lewis is a fixed part of the team, and I would hope for a long time to come.' Second fiddle: But he currently playing catchup to team-mate Nico Rosberg in the standings . VIDEO Rosberg signs Mercedes extension . Comeback: Hamilton came from the back of the grid to finish third at Hockenheim on Sunday . Any decision from Hamilton may be some way off yet, and much could depend on the outcome of this year's title fight with Rosberg. Hamilton has fallen 14 points adrift after Rosberg's win on home soil at Hockenheim on Sunday, although the Briton deserves full credit for limiting the damage after a stirring drive from 20th to third. A qualifying crash following a right-front brake disc failure again put Hamilton on the back foot in his duel with Rosberg. Hamilton required acupuncture ahead of the race, and this week will also have physiotherapy prior to competing at a circuit he has made his own in recent years, the Hungaroring just outside Budapest. Hamilton has won four Hungarian Grands Prix from seven attempts, and the last two in particular, so completing a hat-trick to go into the sport's summer break on a high would provide him with a huge tonic. 'I'm not going there with any concern about maintaining my record,' said Hamilton. 'I'm simply going there to win, as was the case ahead of the weekend in Germany. I went into it with the right mentality and preparation. 'But things happened and got in the way. That's not to say I want luck or wish for luck. I never pray or wish for that. I just don't want anything like that. 'All I hope is the car sticks together so I can go out there and do the job.' Teamwork: Hamilton speaks with Mercedes boss Toto Wolff . Smash: Hamilton recovered in Germany after a heavy crash in practice before the race . To that end, Hamilton would love nothing more than three trouble-free days as he feels he deserves as much given his problems of late. Qualifying especially has proven a thorn in his side of late as he has had to contend with issues or his own failings at the last five race Saturdays. 'A couple of times it's been down to me not getting the lap,' said Hamilton. 'I think I would have got the lap in Germany, but then who knows. The car broke down, but that's okay, there are many more races to go.' With a laugh, Hamilton said: ""I'm certainly not planning on starting at the back in Hungary! 'But a clean weekend is what I'm aiming for, to come away from there with some strong points ahead of the break when I'll get some rest going into the last part of the season.' With a huge grin he then added: 'Maybe I'll go visit some Indians, or a Buddha and rub his belly or whatever. 'I'll try all the different religions to see if I can get some luck.'","Hamilton has already opened talks over a new Mercedes deal .

An industrial designer fed up with the pushing and shoving of subway travel has developed a frightening fashion accessory way to keep fellow passengers at bay. Introducing the 'Spike Away' vest - a plastic armor fitted with long flexible spikes. While the spikes wouldn't cause any real harm to anyone who comes in contact with them, the damage is all aesthetic, according to creator Siew Ming Cheng. Keep away, fellow commuters: The Spike Away vest was developed by young designer Siew Ming Cheng (center) during a workshop at the National University of Singapore . Science fiction: The vest was made using everyday plastic materials found in the gardening section of a hardware store . The spikey strips are typically employed to keep unwanted visitors away from delicate plants in the garden . The vest was created at a special workshop in Singapore that endeavored to solve the problems of personal space invasion at busy subway stations, such as this one . Cheng put together the vest during a design workshop at the National University of Singapore, according to her profile on Behance. The workshop was called 'Chindogu', which is the Japanese art of designing gadgets to solve mundane, everyday problems. The class was lead by futuristic German furniture designer Werner Aisslinger. After a brainstorming session, attendees are giving half a day to source materials and hack together a prototype that represents the idea. Cheng decided that wearing armor would be the most effective solution. All the materials were from a typical hardware store. The pastic spike trips were fastened together using cable ties . Coming in contact with the spikes of the vest would not cause much harm. The effect is almost entirely visual . Critics have been quick to quip the vest, if ever put into development, is a 'lawsuit waiting to happen' The vest is made of strips of spiky, flexible plastic material found in the gardening section of a handy store. The strips are looped together with cable ties. Fittingly, the strips are normally used to keep birds and cats away from plants. The designs did not necessarily have to be a practical so long as they solved the problem, which in this instance was overcrowded public transportation. Critics were quick to say they are a 'lawsuit waiting to happen'.","Design workshop at National University of Singapore tasked students with finding a way to maintain personal space on public transportation .

Stafiej found a 20 gram bag of marijuana inside the car. Bell, Blount and a female passenger all claimed ownership of the marijuana according to police. Making his mark: Le'Veon Bell set a franchise record for total yards by a rookie running back in his first season . In action: LeGarrette Blount playing against Buffalo . Bell, 22, was taken to a hospital to have blood drawn and is expected to be charged with driving under the influence of marijuana. Bell, Blount and the female passenger were arrested and released. All three are expected to receive notice of formal charges through the mail said Kohlhepp. The possession and DUI charges are both misdemeanors. The Steelers take on the Philadelphia Eagles in a NFL pre-season game on Thursday. Bell and Blount were expected to see significant playing time in the main tune-up for starters before Pittsburgh's opening game against the Cleveland Browns on September 7. 'We are aware of the reports and still gathering information,' Steelers spokesman Burt Lauten said. 'We will have no further comment at this time.' Bell, who made his debut against the Minnesota Vikings at Wembley last September, set a franchise record for total yards by a rookie running back, smashing the mark set by Franco Harris. The second-round pick out of Michigan State ran for 860 yards and eight touchdowns and caught 45 passes for 399 yards despite missing the first three games of the season with a foot injury.

Gatlin backed up his sprint double victory at the Diamond League finals in Brussels on Friday, which took his tally to 16 races for the season. There he set a personal and season's best time in the 100m and smashed his rivals in the 200m an hour later. His win on Sunday makes Gatlin the first male sprinter to go through an entire season unbeaten since Usain Bolt in 2009, taking full advantage of the Olympic and world champion's exceptionally lean season.","Justin Gatlin won all of his 18 races during the 2014 season .

"By . Marcus Townend for the Daily Mail . Plans for a new £10million All-Weather floodlit circuit at Newcastle, which would have opened next year, have been knocked off track by the BHA. Racing’s ruling body has refused to allow dispensation from a rule, designed to protect the sport’s diversity, which states each individual fixture must include at least two races over a mile or further which total a minimum aggregate distance of two and a half miles. Newcastle needed the permission because planning restrictions mean their new track would only have lights on its straight mile and not the round course. Out of Toon: Newcastle's plans for new All-Weather circuit have been delayed by the BHA . While the need for a new AW Flat track in the north is widely accepted, there is strong opposition to Newcastle digging up its Turf circuit. In an increasingly bitter debate, the BHA have bought some time. ARC, the largest racecourse company in Britain which owns Newcastle, described the delay to its plans as ‘unwelcome’ but insisted it will press on with the project. However, any re-submitted proposals next year are likely to see their aspirations to build an AW track competing with rival plans being formulated by Catterick. The BHA is now committed to further talks with both courses. Its chief executive Paul Bittar said: ‘There is a general consensus among stakeholders that there would be benefits to the sport from an all-weather track in the north. ‘We weighed up the advantages of introducing a floodlit northern all-weather track at Newcastle in the latter part of 2015 against the negative race planning impact and associated implications for the sport as a whole of granting an exemption to a key rule of racing. ‘As a result, the Board decided there was insufficient evidence at this time to justify granting an exemption to the rule for the 2015 Fixture List. ‘BHA will continue discussions with ARC around its plans for Newcastle, including matters relating to the existing turf track, plus other interested parties, including Catterick Racecourse. Competition: Catterick race course is expected to launch a rival bid for an All-Weather circuit . ‘This is clearly a significant issue for the long-term structure and development of British racing, and BHA is tasked with reaching the best outcome for the sport as a whole.’ ARC, limited by their planning restrictions, appear to have no scope to alter the Newcastle AW track lay-out. So, while they have more time to make their case, the facts are unlikely to alter much. But spokeswoman Susannah Gill insisted Newcastle, with the proposed development of its facilities for racegoers, remains the best option for a new AW track, saying it would be a ‘Wolverhampton of the north’. She added: ’As well as what we can offer the Horsemen, we would be a popular venue on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings. I am not sure Catterick would be.’","Newcastle plan new £10m All-Weather circuit to be opened in 2015 .

"By . Pa Reporter . Castleford shrugged off fears of a Wembley hangover as they beat a resurgent Bradford 32-18 despite the best efforts of Lee Gaskell to move up to second in the First Utility Super League. The Tigers were left heartbroken by neighbours Leeds Rhinos in the Tetley’s Challenge Cup final last weekend but remain on course for a first Grand Final appearance after a solid victory at the Mend-a-Hose Jungle. Andy Lynch got the scoring under way in the fifth minute with a try against his former club, who went into the contest on the back of three straight wins, and that was followed by efforts from James Clare, Luke Dorn and Michael Shenton. Flying high: James Clare scores Castleford's second try against Bradford to move Tigers to second . Gaskell scored Bradford’s sole try in the first half and he went over twice more at the start of the second period to make it a hat-trick. Daryl Clark eased Castleford’s nerves with a stunning solo try which Marc Sneyd converted before the stand-off slotted over a penalty to make it a perfect afternoon with the boot. Lynch gave the Tigers the perfect start when he crashed on to a pass from dummy-half Clark and benefited from some weak defence to touch down. Castleford were celebrating again on 14 minutes after good play by Sneyd and Dorn created the space for Clare to score in the corner in acrobatic fashion. Sneyd converted from the touchline to make it 12-0, a deficit Bradford thought they had eaten into midway through the first period, only for Dale Ferguson’s try to be ruled out for obstruction. Castleford were awarded a penalty at the other end for a high shot on Dorn and went close themselves when Clark was held up over the line. The Tigers did not have to wait too much longer for their third try, Dorn taking a good offload from Shenton and showing a good turn of pace to score. Already-relegated Bradford registered their first points of the match seven minutes from the break when Gaskell took a pass from Luke Gale, playing against his future employers, and stepped his way to the line. But the visitors suffered a blow on the stroke of half-time as Shenton cut back inside untouched for a four-pointer, which Sneyd turned into six with his fourth successful kick. Gaskell went over for an almost identical try to his first-half effort two minutes after the break and quickly completed his hat-trick after Gale put him through a hole 40 metres out and he rounded Dorn to score under the posts. The Tigers had to do plenty of defending as Bradford strived to pull level, which they would have done but for Jamal Fakir’s fumble just yards from the posts. The Frenchman’s mistake proved costly as Clark showed the Castleford fans what they will miss when he leaves at the end of the season with a brilliant 80-metre try after taking a quick penalty tap. The victory was sealed when Sneyd put over a straightforward penalty two minutes from time.

"By . Ian Ladybourn, Press Association . Australian scrum-half Tim Smith, who is on loan from Salford, was at the heart of the Wildcats’ 42-6 triumph, only their second win in five matches, which keeps them within four points of eighth-placed Widnes with two matches left of the regular season. Smith’s half-back partner Pita Godinet was also influential on his return from a six-week injury lay-off. Wakefield suffered a blow before kick-off when skipper Danny Kirmond failed a late fitness test on a knee injury sustained in training but they produced a near-perfect opening quarter to take a grip on the game and never looked like relinquishing their hold. Try: Ali Lauititi crosses for one of Wakefield's tries . Get in there: Wakefield's jubilant players celebrate with try scorer Dean Collis . Loose forward Danny Washbrook did the early damage, breaking clear to send veteran prop Andy Raleigh romping over for his first try for more than 12 months before getting on the end of Smith’s grubber kick to touch down himself. That made it 10-0 after 14 minutes and it got even better for the home side when right winger Chris Riley collected Paul McShane’s kick to the corner to score a third try, to which Paul Sykes added a second goal. Salford had earlier showed a glimpse of their attacking flair when New Zealand full-back Kevin Locke got winger Niall Evalds on a dangerous run but it was only after they fell 16-0 behind that they started to exert any pressure on the Wakefield line. Opener: Andy Raleigh crosses for Wakefield's first score . The Wildcats defence proved up to the task, however, with the Red Devils going closest to scoring when hooker Logan Tomkins was held up over the line. Wakefield created the first opening of the second half when impressive forward Taulima Tautai got Sykes into a hole before being pulled back for a forward pass and Salford made the most of the let-off. Former St Helens favourite Tony Puletua breached the Wakefield line on halfway and second rower Harrison Hansen charged over from 50 metres for his side’s only try, his first since February. Locke’s conversion cut the gap to 10 points but there was no way back for the visitors when centre Dean Collis went over for their fourth try on 55 minutes, which was just reward for their decision to run a penalty from in front of the posts. Sykes was wide with the conversion attempt but was on target three minutes later when second rower Ali Lauitiiti took McShane’s pass 10 metres from the line and proved unstoppable as he powered his way over for Wakefield’s fifth try. It was all one-way traffic in the final quarter as the Wildcats piled on the misery for their out-of-touch visitors. Collis produced a superb flick pass for winger Richard Owen to touch down and Godinet was rewarded for his industry when he got his hand to McShane’s grubber kick. A 40-20 kick from Sykes, another impressive performer at full-back, then set up the position for Owen to round off the scoring with his second try a minute from the end.","Smith, on loan at Wakefield from Salford, is instrumental in crushing victory for Wildcats .

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Seamus Coleman is confident Aiden McGeady can be a regular match-winner for the Republic of Ireland after watching him do just that in Georgia. The 28-year-old Everton winger chose Ireland's tricky Euro 2016 Group D opener in Tbilisi as the perfect moment to display his undoubted talent on a sustained basis and fire his country to a precious victory. McGeady's double, the second of which arrived inside the final minute of normal time at the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena, clinched a 2-1 win and fulfilled team-mate Coleman's pre-match prediction. Match winner: Aiden McGeady scored Ireland's winning goal in the 90th minute against Georgia . What a strike! McGeady's late strike ensured Ireland won their opening Euro 2016 qualifier . The full-back said: 'He [McGeady] was brilliant, fantastic. I said to him before the game, ""You can win us this match"" because he's got that ability to beat players and his confidence is up at the minute, and I'm delighted to see it. 'To be fair, I thought a lot of people would have snatched at it - James [McCarthy] actually played him in rather than shoot, which was great composure in his behalf. It was a good Everton goal. 'We were delighted - he won us the game. Moments of magic win games and Aiden definitely did that tonight. 'We all know that's what he is capable of week-in, week-out and as long as he believes it, he can be a top, top player.' McGeady's brace took his tally for Ireland to five goals either side of Tornike Okriashvili's 38th-minute equaliser, although the fact that it arrived in his 70th senior appearance is a stick that has often been used to beat him in the past. However, he is thriving on Merseyside after forcing his way into the team following his January arrival from Spartak Moscow, and Coleman and his team-mates at both domestic and international level will hope there is more to come. Confidence boost: Seamus Coleman believes McGeady has benefited from a move to Everton . The former Sligo Rovers defender said: 'It's difficult because he was playing in Russia and maybe not a lot of people follow the Russian league. He might have been doing brilliantly out there and you just don't notice it. 'But since he has come to us, the manager believes in him a lot. He has started the season very well and he showed tonight that he's on top form. 'It's brilliant for him. His confidence is up - the move to Everton could have done him the world of good. We saw the best of Aiden McGeady on Sunday night.' Left back Stephen Ward, who lined up behind McGeady for much of the game, was equally thrilled by his contribution, but far from surprised. Ward said: 'We see him every day and we know how good a player he is. He has done fantastically well for our country and tonight showed just how big a player he is because he was outstanding. He scored two and came bitterly close to getting a third as well. 'To score that late is important and gives us a good start, but throughout the game, I thought we fully deserved it. High praise: Ireland manager Martin O'Neill lavished praise on Everton star McGeady . 'When they got their goal, it was a bit of a setback, but I didn't think we panicked at all. We kept playing our football, we kept the ball really well and thankfully Aiden came up with a piece of absolute brilliance and won us the game. 'Something like that, we see every day in training and when you have got a player like that in your team, you have got every chance all the time.' The Republic will now welcome minnows Gibraltar to the Aviva Stadium next month knowing victory there would send them into their toughest game of the campaign in Germany with maximum points and brimming with confidence. 'We won't look too far ahead of the next game - the manager and the staff here won't let us,'added Ward. But if we can continue and get another positive result, we will go to Germany full of confidence. 'That's the minimum to go there with now, and hopefully we can do that.'","Everton winger Aiden McGeady scored in the 90th minute against Georgia .

"By . Lucy Osborne for the Daily Mail . A boy bullied for having Asperger’s has been told he will never walk again after falling 50ft from a bridge while trying to escape his tormentors. Joshua Davies, 18, was running away from a gang of boys across a river when he plummeted on to rocks below, breaking his spine in four places and leaving him paralysed from the waist down. His family claim he has been picked on relentlessly over the past five years by a group of younger teenagers, who saw him as an ‘easy target’. Joshua Davies, 18, pictured from his hospital bed in Wales, where doctors have said he will never walk again . Joshua, pictured in his hospital bed, broke his spine in four places and will be unable to even sit up for six weeks . Joshua’s stepfather Michael Morgan, . 35, last night accused police of repeatedly failing to act, after his . family pleaded for help on more than 15 occasions. On . the afternoon of August 17, the teenager and his friend were walking by . the river when they realised the bullies were following them. ‘They heard them shout, “There they are – let’s get them,”’ said Mr Morgan. ‘Joshua . and his pal climbed on to the steel supports of the bridge to get away . but the boys started throwing stones at them. One of the stones hit . Joshua on the shoulder and another hit him on his foot. He lost his grip . and fell.’ Joshua, who also broke both arms and legs in the accident, was still in hospital yesterday. He was attacked by members of the same gang earlier this summer when he refused to buy them alcohol, his family claim. ‘He . came out of the local corner shop and one of the boys jumped on his . back and started hitting him on the back of his head,’ said Mr Morgan, . an electrical engineer. The Broadway which crosses the river Taff in Pontypridd, South Wales. It was here Joshua fell onto the rocks . ‘That was the only time he defended himself and he was arrested and charged, which made him scared to defend himself again.’ Mr Morgan said his stepson, who was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome at 14, is ‘trusting and can be easily manipulated’. ‘He . does not always have a sense of danger. We have tried to instil it into . him, but you can’t wrap him up in cotton wool, although now I wish we . had done.’ The bullying . became so bad that Joshua was increasingly anxious whenever he left his . home in Pontypridd, South Wales. ‘He has been forced to avoid certain . areas, which has made him a prisoner in his own community,’ said Mr . Morgan. Joshua pictured before the accident. He was due to start a course in electrical engineering and construction this week - instead, he remains in hospital where he'll be unable to even sit up for the next six weeks . Asperger's syndrome is a form of . autism, which affects people's social skills, ability to communicate and . how they relate to the world around them. As autism is measured on a 'spectrum', there are wide variations in how it affects those who suffer from it. Often . those with Asperger's syndrome have difficulty maintaining eye contact . when speaking to others and are awkward when interacting with people. They can develop unusual preoccupations, or rituals, and show repetitive behaviour. The exact cause of the disorder is unknown, although it is thought it could be genetic given it tends to run in families. It is four times more likely to occur in males than in females. There . is no single cure, although a range of treatments, including special . education, speech, physical or occupational therapy and medication can . be used to help treat it. ‘He has felt . threatened and been constantly on edge ...  even if he saw a group of . innocent boys approaching he would start to worry.’ Mr Morgan claimed . that Joshua went to the police more than 15 times about the bullies’ attacks, but that they ‘didn’t take him seriously’. ‘His problems were brushed under the carpet because they thought he was messing around,’ he said. Joshua had recently left school and was due to start a course in electrical engineering and construction this week. However, he has been told he can no longer attend as it is not suitable for wheelchair users. He has undergone three operations and will not be able to sit up for six weeks, but his family say he remains upbeat. Joshua's parents said he was recently chased into a local supermarket by a group of bullies and a security officer had to help him to escape through the back door while the manager called the police . Joshua’s . mother Cheryl, 44, a full-time carer for her other son Michael who also . has autism, said last night: ‘Joshua is not  a fighter – he’s a very . gentle young man who now faces life in a wheelchair. ‘I think this could have been prevented if the police had listened to him.’ Detective . Inspector David Peart said: ‘I can confirm that South Wales Police . responded to allegations of assault on three separate occasions between . April 2011 and June 2014. ‘On . each occasion, a thorough investigation took place and appropriate . action was taken. There is no evidence to suggest that the incident . which took place on August 17 is connected.’ Three teenagers – two aged 15 and one aged 16 – were arrested and remain on police bail.","Boy bullied 'because he suffers from Asperger's' paralysed in fall from bridge .

Tom Attwater, 30, is battling a terminal brain tumour but is ignoring his own health problems and desperately trying to raise the cash needed to help save his daughter Kelli’s life. Time is running out for Mr Attwater, who has already raised £425,000 needed for her treatment, after doctors confirmed his tumour was growing. Scroll down for video .

My brain tumour is getting worse and I am finding it harder to do normal things. ‘Some people have advised me to slow down and concentrate on enjoying the rest of my days. ‘But all that matters is making sure that I raise enough money for Kelli so she can have the best chance of a long and happy and healthy life.

Tom is pleading with people to donate what they can even though he might not get to see it through . Tom has received more than 17,000 donations ranging from £1 to £10,000 after posting appeal for help online . He said: ‘I will never get to see my beautiful daughter grow up as I so want to. I don’t blame people or the world for this. A lot of life is simply luck and mine has run out. ‘I am going to miss so much - her first day at school, her first date, to hold her when her heart hurts.

We don’t have that time.' ‘Now my final gift to Kelli will be trying to raise the money so she can live a great and happy life. It will be my legacy to her. ‘I don’t know if we will make the £500,000 before I die but I can only hope our story will touch people’s heart to want to help make my dying wish come true.’ Mr Attwater has received more than 17,000 donations ranging from £1 to £10,000 for his campaign after posting an emotional appeal for help on the internet in 2013.

She underwent seven months of chemotherapy and several operations . Mr Attwater was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour in September 2012 and was told it was terminal in April 2013. Mrs Attwater, 26, a primary education student, said: 'It was a double blow for me. 'Tom didn’t look anything up on the internet, but I couldn’t help myself. 'He only wanted to know how much time he had left. His life expectancy is two to three years, and he’s already had one.' The chemotherapy Kelli had also makes her more likely to develop other types of cancer, including leukaemia . Mr Attwater had suffered from headaches but did not think it was anything serious until he collapsed and suffered a seizure in his sister’s kitchen. Doctors found a tumour in his brain. If it had been left much longer the pressure would have killed him. Mr Attwater said: 'When I found out it was terminal, part of me did think, ""I’m a 29-year-old man and I’ve achieved nothing"". 'But then I made lists of things I wanted to do - one for a month, one for six, one for a year and so on.

"By . Press Association Reporter . Northern Ireland stalwarts Aaron Hughes and Chris Brunt are cautiously optimistic of emerging from a 'wide open' Euro 2016 group. The pair are among their country's most experienced campaigners, sharing 136 caps and a combined 26 years of international football, but both are still searching for a first major tournament appearance. There are unlikely to be too many more chances, with Hughes 34 and Brunt approaching his 30th birthday, and the one in front of them is as enticing as they have experienced. Strong start: Northern Ireland midfielder Chris Brunt has called on his side to beat Hungary . Confident: Northern Ireland - led by Michael O'Neill - will be hoping to seal qualification for Euro 2016 . There are no heavy-hitters in Group F - they start against Hungary on Sunday and also face Romania, Finland and the Faroe Islands - and the play-off on offer for the third-placed side seems an achievable aim. Hughes and Brunt have been around long enough to temper any undue enthusiasm with a shot of realism, but spirits remained high as they touched down in Budapest. 'I think we can do it, but all the other teams will be saying the exact same thing,' said Hughes. 'In our World Cup group a lot of people would have said Russia and Portugal will be the top two and the rest are fighting for order but it's very hard to predict this one. 'Greece are consistent and know what it takes to get through but everyone else on any given night can beat each other. 'That throws the group wide open and we have to be confident we can do it.' West Brom captain Brunt echoed those sentiments, sensing a real chance to take Northern Ireland back to the big stage for the first time since the 1986 World Cup. High ambitions: Brunt wants to see Northern Ireland qualify for the next European Championship . 'You've got to be confident going in,' said the midfielder. 'It's going to be tough but with the extra teams going through this time it's got to be the best chance we've had for a long time. 'It's important we get off to a good start in the group. The other teams will be thinking of that as well, especially Greece, given that they were in the World Cup but they aren't, with respect, a Spain or a Germany. 'But you don't get to the World Cup knockout stages without being a good side, so everyone expects them to qualify from the group. There is second and a play-off place up for grabs though. 'This campaign is going to be big for everyone. I want to contribute and have a successful campaign but it's down to improving results on the pitch.' Two of Northern Ireland's biggest frustrations in recent years have been their poor form on the road and Brunt's disappointing goals record - just one goal in 46 caps. A result against Hungary would quickly turn around the first of those issues, but Brunt warned his own search for a second goal may be one of the sacrifices along the way. Clear objective: Brighton defender Aaron Hughes is optimistic his side can progress to the next round . 'Of course you want to score more goals, but if you take away David Healy then you could probably say it's a problem for most of us in the camp. 'It's a different responsibility at international level away from home. A lot of times away from home with Northern Ireland we're under a lot of pressure, but we often defend really well and that can impact on us in an attacking sense. 'If getting a result means more defending I'll take it. It really doesn't matter who scores though, even if (goalkeeper) Roy Carroll smacks one in.' For Hughes, this is the second qualifying campaign since he reversed his retirement. It is widely assumed it will also be his last but having called it a day once and changed his mind he is no longer willing to predict his future. 'That question is always going to be around when you're at the age I'm at, especially after making the U-turn a couple of years ago, but regardless of whether this was my second campaign or my last this is as good a chance as we've had in a long time. 'I'm taking each game as it comes now and not looking past Sunday. 'Look at the guy in the World Cup (43-year-old Colombia goalkeeper Faryd Mondragon), it's always possible.'","Chris Brunt believes Northern Ireland have been placed in an open group .

"By . Ben Nagle for MailOnline . Wales manager Chris Coleman has backed his first-choice left-back Ben Davies to oust Danny Rose from the Tottenham starting line-up and make the position his own at White Hart Lane. Davies, who became Mauricio Pochettino's first signing as manager of Spurs, has been playing second fiddle to Rose since his  arrival in north London, and is yet to start a game for his new side. Coleman, though, believes that it won't be long before the tables are turned and Davies makes the starting eleven. Boss: Chris Coleman says his Wales left-back will soon be first-choice at Tottenham, if given a chance . Sub: Davies (left) is yet to start a game for his new side, and has had to settle for substitute appearances . 'I think Ben will end up being their first choice. It is not always easy when you have a big move. Ben is a Swansea boy and we don't tend to be great travellers when we are young. 'But he is a great player and a great lad, he will settle in there.' The move came about as part of a swap deal between the two clubs. Michel Vorm and Ben Davies joined Spurs, while midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson headed for south Wales alongside a £3.5m payment to Swansea. Since his arrival on 23 July, Pochettino has opted to stick with the left-back he inherited when he joined the club, and Davies has not made enough of an impact to break through. International duty: Davies is currently away with the Wales squad, who play Andorra on Tuesday . Coach: Coleman's side begin their qualifying campaign in Group B on Tuesday . The 21-year-old Welshman has impressed Coleman on international duty though, and has nailed down a starting position and held off the competition of Neil Taylor for his starting place. Coleman is confident that his defender will follow the same path at club level as he has at international. 'Danny Rose has not done anything wrong, but all players have a bad day, and when he does and Ben gets his chance we know he is good enough.' Coleman was speaking at a press conference ahead of Wales opening Euro 2016 Group B qualifier against Andorra on Tuesday.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A pensioner bled to death in hospital after doctors failed to give her a tablet would could have saved her life. Sheila Baker, 70, was admitted to The University Hospital of North Staffordshire, with crippling stomach pains. The great-grandmother was diagnosed with colitis, or inflammation of the bowel, and was given a combination of drugs to treat the condition. But it has emerged that one tablet, a proton pump inhibitor, which should have been given to Mrs Baker to protect her stomach lining from being attacked by the cocktail of drugs was not given. Sheila Baker, 70, from Stoke-on-Trent, pictured with her granddaughter Zoe and daughter Barbara, bled to death in her hospital bed at The University Hospital of North Staffordshire, after the trust admitted doctors failed to give her a vital drug . As a result, the hospital has conceded the 'below standard care', caused Mrs Baker to fall unconscious and die from gastrointestinal bleeding in August 2012. Mrs Baker's daughter Barbara Humphreys, 49, was yesterday awarded a five-figure compensation payout from the hospital, after bosses at the trust admitted liability. It emerged a string of errors resulted in medics giving the pensioner the drugs, including steroid prednisolone, Ibuprofen and aspirin, which in the absence of the PPI tablet, caused the bleeding. Mrs Humphreys, who works as a care co-ordinator, said: 'My mum was only 70 and she died unnecessarily. It was never about money, I wanted to make sure this doesn't happen again. 'At the time I thought the hospital was doing everything they could to help mum, but after she died I had a gut feeling that something wasn't quite how it should be, and I was right. 'The death certificate said she died from internal bleeding and I later discovered she should have been given a PPI which would have stopped this. 'My mum lost her life unnecessarily. I just wanted to get justice for my mum and now I've got that. 'My mum was a proud woman. She never wanted a fuss. 'Before she became ill she was very independent, she would come shopping with us and visit all the time. 'But after she collapsed the first time she was in excruciating pain and that never went away until the day she died. 'We were so close and she died all of a sudden. My sister Lynn lives in America and she never had chance to say goodbye. She will never have any closure.' The great-grandmother was admitted in August 2012 with crippling stomach pains and diagnosed with colitis and prescribed a number of drugs. But doctors failed to give Mrs Baker a proton pump inhibitor tablet which would have protected her stomach lining from the drugs she was given . Mrs Baker's daughter Barbara Humphreys, pictured, has received a five-figure sum from the hospital after they admitted liability for her mother's death. The hospital has also issued an apology to the family . Mrs Barker, from Stoke-on-Trent, in Staffordshire, was taken to hospital in June 2012 complaining of stomach pains and was initially sent home with painkillers. Two weeks later she was re-admitted to hospital after collapsing at home and doctors diagnosed colitis. After being given the cocktail of drugs to treat her condition blood tests revealed a significant drop in her haemoglobin levels which should have indicated internal bleeding. Mrs Humphreys, who has two children, Zoe, 24, and son Callum, 10, added: 'I later found out that my mum's haemoglobin level dropped by a large margin but this was never picked up by the medical staff. 'The drop should have indicated there was a problem and is a key symptom of internal bleeding. 'If the doctors had been doing their job they would have realised she was in trouble and might have been able to do something about it. 'Instead, my mum, who just weeks earlier had been fit, healthy and independent, was left to bleed to death in a hospital bed.' The University Hospital of North Staffordshire have  issued an apology and admitted the pensioner should have been prescribed a PPI. Chief executive Mark Hackett said: 'I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the family of Mrs Barker. 'It is clear some aspects of the care received by Mrs Barker in 2012 fell below the standard of care she was reasonably entitled to expect. 'I wish to offer my profound apologies for the care Mrs Barker received.' Monica Bhakri, of West Midlands Solicitors, who represented Mrs Barker's family, said: 'No amount of compensation is ever going to bring Mrs Barker back, but the principle is that the hospital has admitted failings in the standard of care which means Barbara can now move forward with her life.'","Sheila Baker was admitted to The University Hospital of North Staffordshire with crippling stomach pains in August 2012 .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . US President Barack Obama has not been invited to Hollywood actor George Clooney's wedding to human rights lawyer Amal Almuddin. The actor's publicist dismissed a story in the National Enquirer that President Obama would travel to Italy to attend the star's wedding. A spokesman for Clooney told the New York Post: 'The president was not invited. He has more important things to do.' Hollywood star George Clooney, right, is expected to marry Amal Alamuddin, left, later this month in Italy . The screen star, centre left, will marry Ms Alamuddin, centre right, at his Lake Como holiday home . It is reported that Brad Pitt, left, will act as Best Man for Clooney during the ceremony later this month . It is understood that Brad Pitt, a newlywed himself, is likely to be best man during the wedding which is understood to be taking place over the coming days. Clooney and Ms Alamuddin are expected to get married at his £25 million Lake Como holiday home in Italy. It was revealed earlier this summer that Clooney had persuaded the mayor to bring in laws to guarantee his privacy. Local authorities will hit swimmers with a £450 fine if they are caught in the water within 100 metres of his mansion. Pedestrians are also to be banned from stopping on the road outside the property. The laws announced by Laglio Council will stay in operation 24 hours a day until September 30. Laglio mayor Roberto Pozzi said at the time: ‘We have to guarantee privacy and security for George Clooney and his guests.’ George Clooney's spokesman said the Hollywood star had not invited President Obama, right, to his wedding . Last Saturday, President Obama attended the wedding of his close friend and long-time chef Sam Cass and MSNBC host Alex Wagner. President Obama went to the wedding in Pocantico Hills, just north of New York City with his wife Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha. Mr Cass first started working for the President when he was still a senator living in Chicago. Mr Obama persuaded his friend to join him in the White House. As well as working as a chef, Mr Cass has advised Mrs Obama on nutrition as part of her anti-obesity initiative. Mr Obama returned to the White House on Sunday, after the wedding where he continues to deal with the worsening crisis in Syria and Iraq among other things. Domestically, President Obama is under significant pressure due to the ongoing situation in Ferguson, Missouri. He has faced particular criticism over his handling of the ISIS threat. Meanwhile in an open letter written to the President, the parents of a member of Seal Team Six who was killed in Afghanistan in 2011 attacked Mr Obama over the amount of time he spends playing golf. According to the Obama Golf Counter, the President has played 192 rounds since taking office. Billy and Karen Vaughn's son Aaron Carson Vaughn was in a Chinook helicopter when it was shot down by insurgents killing all 33 men on board. The Seal was engaged in a mission to capture a senior Taliban commander when the aircraft crashed. The Vaughn's wrote: 'As Commander-in-Chief, your actions - or lack thereof - Mr President, cost lives. 'As you bumble about in your golf cart, slapping on a happy face and fist-pounding your buddies, your cowardly lack of leadership has left a gaping hole — not only in America’s security — but the security of the entire globe. 'Your message has come across loud and clear, sir: You are not up to this job. You know it. We know it. The world knows it,' the Vaughns wrote in the letter published on World Tribune. The couple go on to directly ask Mr Obama to resign so that a man or woman 'of courage and substance' can take over and address the 'out-of-control thug fest' happening in Syria and Iraq, where ISIS is attempting to establish a caliphate. 'It’s time for you to step down and allow a true leader to restore our honor and protect our sons and daughters... 'America has always been exceptional. And she will be again. You, Mr President, are a bump in the road,' they wrote. Billy Vaughn told MailOnline that he has been displeased with the way President Obama has been acting at press conferences. 'I'd like to see him have some passion about anything going on in the world instead of just speaking in a monotone voice like he has a script that has been made up,' Mr Vaughn told MailOnline.","George Clooney is expected to marry Amal Almuddin in Italy later this month .

"By . Ronnie Esplin . Darren Fletcher remains optimistic about Scotland's European Championship qualification prospects despite the 2-1 defeat to Germany in Dortmund on Sunday night. The World Cup winners dominated the first-half and were more than worthy of their 1-0 interval lead thanks to a Thomas Muller header. Gordon Strachan's side, however, came out energised and purposeful after the break and deservedly levelled in the 66th minute through wide-man Ikechi Anya to send the thousands of Tartan Army foot soldiers inside the impressive Signal Iduna Park into raptures. Optimistic: Darren Fletcher was encouraged by Scotland's 2-0 loss to world champions Germany . That joy was short-lived, however, when Muller soon restored the home side's lead as he took advantage of slack defending in the Scots' penalty area to slam the ball high into the net from close range. Scotland skipper Fletcher was disappointed to be replaced by James McArthur before the equaliser, saying, 'The manager made the changes. He's got players who have performed for him in the past and he felt like he needed a change and it obviously worked because we came into the game a lot more.' Indeed, Fletcher saw enough both on and off the park after the break to give him hope ahead of the visit of Georgia to Ibrox next month and for the rest of the Group D campaign. 'We went there and showed we can compete and if we take that performance into other games then I am sure we will be fine', said the Manchester United midfielder. 'We can't be disheartened, we knew that would be the most difficult game in the group so let's try to get some points on the board going forward. 'We changed the formation a little bit at half-time. Germany tired and we made a few chances. Heads up: Both Germany's goals were scored by Bayern Munich forward Thomas Muller (L) 'We believed in ourselves a bit more. You are always worried about attacking and leaving gaps but I thought the boys did fantastically well and we played some good stuff in the second half. 'We knew it was going to be difficult but it was hard to take because there were spells when we played well and created some really good chances.' If few people believed Scotland had any chance of beating the World champions on their own patch, expectation will be different when Georgia, who lost their opener 2-1 at home to the Republic of Ireland, visit Glasgow. Sub way: Manchester United midfielder was disappointed at being replaced by James McArthur . Fletcher, however, refused to accept that match day two in the campaign falls into the must-win category. 'We want to win all our home games,' he said. 'That's the plan in qualifying, to pick up points away from home and win your home games. 'I don't know if it is must win yet (against Georgia) but it's important that we get three points on the board as quickly as possible.'","Scotland were defeated 2-1 by Germany in opening Euro 2016 qualifier .

"By . Craig Hope for the Daily Mail . He has already been billed as the new Raheem Sterling – and it’s easy to see why. Like England’s star player, Rolando Aarons was born in Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, but has chosen to represent the Three Lions. The Newcastle winger will make his debut for Aidy Boothroyd’s Under-20 side against Romania in Telford. New star: Rolando Aarons has already made an impression for Newcastle and could soon make his full debut . But comparisons with Sterling extend beyond the 18-year-old’s birth certificate. Both moved to the UK at a young age before being picked up by Football League clubs – Aarons with Bristol City and Sterling at Queens Park Rangers – only for their talent to be recognised by Newcastle and Liverpool respectively. Aarons, like Sterling, is blessed with blistering pace and no shortage of skill. He announced his arrival on the Premier League stage with a goal – a rare header – and an assist following his second-half introduction against Crystal Palace last weekend, only Wilfried Zaha’s injury-time strike denying him a match-winning cameo. Leading light: Remy Cabella clings onto Aarons who scores his first Newcastle goal against Crystal Palace . Already there is pressure on Alan Pardew to hand the teenager his first league start when domestic action resumes next weekend, but Aarons is a level-headed type guarded against getting carried away with his recent rise. ‘It’s been crazy,’ he said, ‘I’ve gone from under-21s football (at Newcastle) to the first team and to under-20s with England in no time. ‘But it’s not hard (to keep my feet on the ground), because it’s not my personality to get carried away with anything. Ambition: Aarons has been compared to England international Raheem Sterling after bright displays . ‘I like to take things in my stride and I’m quite humble. ‘I’m still in the reserve-team dressing room and that’s fine. My friends are in there and that’s cool.’ The Jamaican FA tried to persuade Aarons to opt for the country of his birth during the summer, and he admits it was a tough choice. ‘It wasn’t an easy decision, because I was born in Jamaica,’ he said. ‘But England is a big opportunity for me and I want to go out there and play and impress and show how good a player I am. ‘I’m buzzing. I can’t wait to go out and experience something new with England and I’ll be confident because I’m in a good place right now.’ Making noise: The Newcastle winger is expected to become a real part of Alan Pardew's plans . On the call up, he added: ‘I was on the physio table getting a bit of treatment when someone came in with the papers. It was a complete shock and I didn’t know how to react to it. I’m happy and honoured.’ Aarons’ graduation to the senior set-up on Tyneside has even come as a surprise to Pardew and his backroom team. While undoubtedly talented, the youngster, much like Sterling, found it difficult to adjust to a move north aged only 16. But two years under the guidance of former England legend Peter Beardsley has seen Aarons mature into the player of today. ‘When I first came here I found it mentally tough. It took me a while to adapt,’ he went on. ‘But after about a year and a half I stared to feel back to my old self, how I felt when I was younger. ‘The coaches and the manager have given me confidence and have worked with me day in, day out to help me be the player I want to be. ‘Peter Beardsley has helped me a lot. And Steve Stone has worked with me as well, and the gaffer too – they’ve all been brilliant.’ Aarons pointed to the name on the back of his shirt following his first senior goal last weekend. ‘I’m not big headed or anything,’ he said, ‘I just want people to recognise what I’m doing for this team and how much it means to be here.’ Remember the name: Rolando Aarons.","Aarons was born in Jamaica yet chose to represent the Three Lions .

"By . Chris Foy for the Daily Mail . Follow @@FoyChris . Ben Foden has a point to make this season. It’s about what he stands for and what matters to him: sport, not showbusiness. And it’s about a hunger to reclaim lost status. The Northampton full back will be eased into the new Aviva Premiership season on Friday night when he is among the Saints’ replacements for the visit of Gloucester. That is the upshot of a minor ankle injury which disrupted the final stages of his pre-season. Yet once he does enter the fray, he will set about his personal mission with renewed purpose. Goal: Northampton full back Ben Foden is determined to claim back the England No 15 jersey this season . Party: Foden (right), who is married to Una from The Saturdays (left), is often accused of focusing on showbiz . Foden senses the doubts about his motivation, from those who matter and others who don’t. There is a nagging perception in some quarters that, with his pop-star wife, Una, and attendant celebrity profile, this is a player for whom the primary focus in life has shifted and the fires of career ambition have been partially doused. He is at pains to set the record straight. The 29-year-old goes into the final season ahead of a home World Cup with that looming target on his radar. Work will come first and any sideshows in the long-lens gaze of the paparazzi will be kicked into touch for now. Asked if the doubts about his hunger stem from the image of his lifestyle, Foden told Sportsmail: ‘You can understand why people think that. You can understand why Stuart Lancaster and the England coaches might think like that, too. ‘But I have always said that my rugby comes first. Whatever comes with being married to Una and all that jazz comes second. ‘I want to be known as Ben Foden the rugby player rather than Ben Foden, married to Una from The Saturdays. It is very important to me that I have my own identity in that way, and I think that I deserve that as well. Untrue: Foden (right) says that rugby 'comes first' for him and 'all that (showbiz) jazz comes second' Glory: Foden (centre) with his wife Una (left) and their daughter (right) holding the 2014 Premiership trophy . ‘I’ve been in this game a long time. I have 34 caps for England, I’ve won a Premiership title, I’ve played in a Heineken Cup Final, I’ve won LV Cups and Challenge Cups. I’ve scored in a World Cup quarter-final, in a Premiership final and in a Heineken Cup final, so my credentials speak for themselves. People sometimes forget all that.’ Foden concedes that his fervent desire to force his way back into the England team might not have been fully recognised, even by the coaches. He was a fixture in the Test XV from 2010 until the summer of 2012, before injuries and the rise of Alex Goode and Mike Brown knocked him from his perch. He intends to be more vocal in emphasising his wish to fight back. ‘I think England have been a bit miffed about why I haven’t been a bit more upset about being left out,’ he said. ‘But to be brutally honest, I just didn’t feel fit and I felt that the other guys were playing better than me. ‘It’s only now that I’ve got this full pre-season under my belt that I feel like the Foden of old, so I will definitely have that conversation with Stuart to tell him, “I’m still hungry for it and I will prove it”. ‘It’s probably going to be the last World Cup I’ll have a chance to be involved in so this is going to be such a big year for me. I want to push for that spot. Pace: Foden (centre) is renowned for his attacking running style and his ability to beat defenders from deep . Looking forward: Foden is determined that he will make the England squad for the 2015 World Cup on home soil . ‘I had to force out Delon Armitage the first time to claim that No 15 shirt, when he’d been playing very well. Then I got injured, Alex Goode came in and he played very well. ‘Then when Mike Brown got his opportunity, he came in and played very well, so I think we’re all on a level playing field. ‘It will be a straight shoot-out now and will come down to who wants it more.’ Four of Foden’s last five starting Test appearances for England have been on the wing - where resources are thinner than at full back. But despite some experts suggesting he makes a wide berth his objective, he wants to play for his country in his club position. ‘When you listen to the pundits like Stuart Barnes or Will Greenwood, they’re saying, “Foden’s future lies on the wing”,’ he said. ‘I think it’s good that I can cover that position, but I see myself as an out-and-out full back. ‘I want to run out in the No 15 shirt for England again. Whoever gets that shirt ahead of me, they’re going to have to play their socks off to stop me nicking it back.’ Try time: Foden is determined to reclaim his Test No 15 spot back from Mike Brown and Alex Goode .

"By . Associated Press . Police Chief Mike Szabo (pictured) was suspended amid the investigation in Waldo, Florida . The north Florida town of Waldo has long had a reputation as a speed trap after requiring drivers to speed up and down six times on a small segment of highway. Waldo now faces allegations that the town victimizes motorists to turn a profit. Two police chiefs have been suspended, the police department has rebelled and the state is investigating possible wrongdoing. A small segment of highway that runs through Waldo requires drivers to speed up to 65 mph, before jumping back down to 55 mph; then 45; then goes back to 55; then back down to 45; to 55 again and eventually, 35 mph. AAA named the tiny town between Jacksonville and Gainesville one of only two 'traffic traps' nationwide and even placed an attention-getting billboard outside the limits of the town to warn drivers to slow down before entering. The situation simmered for years until this month, when Police Chief Mike Szabo was suspended Aug. 12, apparently in response to an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement into suspected improprieties in the way officers write tickets. The issue then burst into the open two weeks later at a Waldo City Council meeting, when a group of police officers said they had been ordered by Szabo to write at least 12 tickets per 12-hour shift or face repercussions. The officers also leveled allegations at the Aug. 26 meeting against Cpl. Kenneth Smith, who had been picked to fill in for Szabo. The officers complained that Smith had, among other things, mishandled evidence. The city council then suspended Smith. Not surprisingly, things are tense at the tiny stucco storefront office that serves as Waldo City Hall. On Friday morning, Mayor Louie Davis and City Manager Kim Worley met in a small cluttered office to discuss the controversy, slamming a door shut with a 'no comment' when a reporter walked in seeking information. A driver is pictured entering the town of Waldo, Florida, where motorists can encounter up to six different speed limits in a roughly two-mile drive . Waldo has long had a reputation as a speed trap, but the allegations made by the police officers were particularly stunning since ticket quotas are illegal under Florida law. In 2013, Waldo's seven police officers filed 11,603 traffic citations, according to records obtained by the Gainesville Sun newspaper. That compares with 25,461 citations in 2013 for much larger Gainesville, which has 300 officers and 128,000 residents, including thousands of college students. The fines paid by motorists are a big money-maker. According to the city's 2013 budget, about half of its $1 million in revenue came from 'court fines' from tickets issued. After council appearance, the officers filed a complaint with the Florida Inspector General's Office seeking protection under the Florida Whistleblower Act. The officers said they were forced to go public because Worley failed to conduct an investigation after they told her about the quotas, the mismanagement of evidence and other problems, according to the complaint. 'City manager Worley broke the trust of the concerned members and went straight to Chief Szabo,' the officers said in the complaint. 'Chief Szabo then took a retaliatory stance against the members for approximately six months.' In a written statement released after the council meeting, Worley said the city takes the officers' allegations seriously but will not comment further. She has requested that a commander from the Alachua County Sheriff's Office take over leadership of the department. Waldo resident Mike Barrs fills up his truck with gas in Waldo amid the speeding ticket scandal in his town . The State Attorney's Office in Alachua County said it is waiting for the FDLE to finish its investigation of ticket quotas and other wrongdoing before deciding whether to file charges against either Szabo or Smith. The FDLE did not return a message seeking comment. The Florida Department of Transportation is in charge of setting speed limits, but says it did factor in requests from Waldo officials when setting up speed limits there. Because the stretch of highway with six different speed limits runs by schools and a popular flea market that draws many pedestrians, the department said the speed changes are legal. But enforcing speed limits is Waldo's responsibility, said Tony Falotico, a traffic operations engineer at FDOT. Waldo residents said many people do drive through town too quickly, but hope the multiple speed limit changes could be reduced to make it easier to comply with the law. Some welcomed news of the state's investigation, saying people are tired of the harassment. 'I'm glad they're doing something about it,' said Mike Barrs, 35, a longtime Waldo resident who said he's gotten at least 20 tickets. 'If I had a light out on my trailer they'll pull me over for that, for anything.' AAA, which named Waldo and nearby town of Lawtey as the nation's two worst speed traps, said it opposes traffic enforcement practices designed to raise revenue rather than increase road safety. 'AAA condemns all practices,' spokeswoman Karen Morgan said, 'whereby law enforcement agency rates the efficiency of its officers based upon the number of arrests made or citations issued.'","Police Chief Mike Szabo and Cpl.

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . A young father died of a massive electric shock as he fixed a cooker in a primary school just months before his third child is due to be born. Jason Haslem, 24, was knocked out by a massive electric shock whilst working on the electrics system in the days before pupils were due to return for the first day of the new term. He and his wife Jessica, who married in March last year, are expecting a third child due in March 2015. The incident occurred on Thursday when he had been assigned to check over the cookers at Fir Bank Primary School in Royton, near Oldham, which teaches 202 pupils. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said it was likely to visit his employer Acme Refrigeration's . headquarters in Blackburn today after it launched a joint investigation, . alongside police, into his death. Jason and Jessica Haslem (pictured) married in March last year after first meeting each other seven years ago . Mr Haslem pictured with his sons Toby, aged 4, and 22-month-old George . Mr Haslem was a gas engineer and worked out of the firm’s Blackburn site in Philips Road. He had been employed by Acme for the majority of the past five years after starting work there as an apprentice. And Mrs Haslem, 25, said becoming an engineer was all her husband had ever wanted to do. The stay-at-home mother from Penwortham, near Preston, said: 'I don't know anyone who had a bad thing to say about Jason, there was not a single person he met who didn't like him. 'We met through mutual friends and knew each other for a long time before we got together. There was just nothing I could dislike about him. 'He was an amazing person and an absolutely amazing father - there was nothing he wouldn't have done to make life as perfect as he could for our children. 'I obviously struck lucky to have him as the father of my children - he was so supportive of me, and I was of him, even when we had some crazy hair-brained ideas.' She added: 'He had such a drive and always wanted to learn more and better himself as a person, especially for the kids sake and to set a positive example for them. 'But I don't think he could have possibly bettered himself. 'George is far too young to understand what is going on, but I have told Toby that his daddy has gone to be a star, and he understands that. 'No amount of time will heal this, there is just no replacement for Jason. We will talk about him and remember him every day. 'I just feel lucky that in such a short space of time we shared so much, we didn't do things by halves and that was just the type of person he was. 'We all loved him so much and are going to miss him so much.' Jason and Jessica Haslem pictured together. Following her husband's death, Mrs Haslem said she could not have asked for a 'better person to have dedicated my life to' In a . statement posted on Facebook soon after the tragedy, she wrote: 'I want . to thank everyone, from the bottom of my very empty feeling heart, for . all of your kindness and thoughts. She . added: 'Numbness is wearing off, it's all starting to feel too real. Take me back a week please, I won't let Jason out of my sight.' Mr Haslem's employers yesterday described Mr Haslem’s death as ‘a tragic accident’ and offered its condolences to his family. Mr Haslem, from Penwortham, near Preston, is survived by two young sons - George, 22 months, and Toby, four. Hazel . MacKay, head teacher at Fir Bank Primary School, in Grasmere Road . school, said the work was being undertaken to refurbish the school’s . kitchen. She said: 'Our thoughts are with this man’s family at this time and we offer our deepest condolences. 'The . school was closed at the time this incident occurred due to the . holidays. This matter is now being investigated by the Health and Safety . Executive and we will co-operate fully with them.' Mr Haslem died while working on the cooker at Fir Bank Primary School, in Royton near Oldham (pictured) Jason Haslem, from Penwortham, near Preston, died after receiving a massive electric shock at the school . 'It is with enormous sadness that we confirm the death of one of our employees, Jason Haslem. 'This is clearly a tragic incident for everyone at ACME Facilities Group Limited and for everyone who knew Jason but, above all, our thoughts and profound condolences are with Jason’s wife and family. 'Our priority now is to support them, and Jason’s colleagues, at what is an extremely difficult time. 'It is very important that the circumstances surrounding the incident are thoroughly investigated and we will of course continue to provide all necessary assistance to the authorities involved in that process. 'It would be wrong to say anything else whilst that investigation takes place.' A spokesman . for Greater Manchester police said: 'At 4.45pm on Thursday, August 28, . police were called to Fir Bank Primary School following reports a man . had been injured in an industrial accident. 'Officers . arrived and discovered a 24-year-old man had been hurt and was . unconscious. Paramedics tried to revive him but the man was sadly . pronounced dead at the scene.

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . A fake Good Samaritan stole clothes and a camera from an elderly couple's holiday luggage before helping them onto a train with the bag he had just ransacked.

"By . Candace Sutton for Daily Mail Australia . Award-winning film and television star Ryan Corr has been placed on a 12 month good behavior bond after pleading guilty to possessing heroin in a lane way. Corr, 25, pleaded guilty to possessing .26 grams of heroin after he was caught by police in a lane way in Bondi, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, on May 27th. A who's who of actors from Australia and overseas, supplied character references for the former Packed to the Rafters star, who arrived in Waverley Local Court in Sydney's east. The 25-year-old arrived dressed in a blue suit, blue and white spotted shirt and navy tie, while sporting a beard. The actor walked into court accompanied by his lawyer, high profile solicitor Chris Murphy. Scroll down for video . Moving on: A happy and relieved Ryan Corr exits from court after pleading guilty and receiving a 12-month good behaviour bond for possession of heroin. Police who arrested the film and TV actor in a Sydney laneway in May say the 25-year-old 'dropped a small tied freezer bag containing a white powder' which Corr admitted 'being heroin and that it was for his personal use'. The actor said on Monday he was 'looking forward to getting back to work' Former Packed to the Rafters actor and rising film star Ryan Corr, 25, arrived at Waverley local court to face drug charges three months after he was found in a back street in Sydney's Eastern suburbs with .26 gram of heroin in a tied off freezer bag. Corr was traumatised at the time from his grandfather's heart attack, his lawyer Christ Murphy says . Actor Ryan Corr missed an earlier appearance at Waverley Court a month before he turned up (pictured) with lawyer Chris Murphy to plead guilty to possessing heroin, due to filming commitments in the UK where the 25-year-old was shooting scenes for the convict drama, Banished, set in 18th century England when its was setting up Australia as a penal colony . Police found Corr in Castlefield Lane, Bondi, in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs with heroin in a freezer bag. The court heard Corr had purchased .26 grams of heroin at a Bondi hotel. But Corr's lawyer Chris Murphy argued that a conviction would significantly impact his career. 'He has a contract for a major movie,' he told the court. 'He is at the top of his brilliant career.' Mr Murphy has also tendered 11 character references, including one from award-winning actress Jacqueline McKenzie. They also included production member of Wolf Creek 2, Jocelyn Moorhouse of the Sydney Theatre company as well as unnamed Hollywood film figures, one of whom described Corr as a future 'Al Pacino or Steve Buscemi'. Corr has had roles in Underbelly: The Golden Mile, Love Child and Blue Water High. Scene of the crime: Ryan Corr had only just left a Bondi hotel where a man offered him a small amount of heroin, saying 'take this and you will feel okay' and walked 200 metres to Castlefield Lane, Bondi pictured, above) where police apprehended hima nd observed the young actor to drop a small tied off freezer bag with .26g of white powder, which proved to be heroin. Corr had only just returned from Melbourne to see his grandfather who had suffered a cardiac arrest and was not expected to live, his lawyer told Waverley Court . Magistrate Julie Huber said she accepted that Corr was not a heroin user and had only taken the .26g of the drug in a plastic bag and gone to Castlefield Lane (pictured, above) because he was in a state following the heart attack suffered by his grandfather, Don, who had been a big influence in his life following his parents' divorce when he was nine years old . Castlefield Lane, where Ryan Corr was followed and arrested by police who believed he was in possession of an illegal drug - which proved to be .26g of heroin -  runs parallel to Bondi Rd and is in close proximity to a school . Rubbish piles up on the side of the road on Castlefield Lane, near where actor Ryan Corr - who has appeared in more than 450 TV, play and film acting roles - was found after he walked there from a hotel where a man gave him heroin to help ease his distress over his grandfather's health . He is set to star alongside Russell Crowe in the film, The Water Diviner. But Mr Murphy said Corr had never taken heroin and any drug conviction could ruin his future brilliant career. 'There is no suggestion that this man has ever injected with a needle in his arm or used heroin,' he told the court. Mr Murphy, quoting an unnamed Hollywood-based director who had worked with actress Brooke Shields, said Corr was  'brilliant' and 'asked for consideration to kepping his record clean' saying that in the 'US and Hollywood,  the centre of film ... any blemish on his slate can spell disaster for his career'. Mr Murphy said Corr was distraught about his grandfather's near fatal heart attack at the time he was caught with heroin. Mr Murphy said the actor had been filming the convict drama Banished in Sydney when his grandfather Don Corr collapsed on a Melbourne street in cardiac arrest. 'He had a close relationship with his grandfather,' he said. Scroll down for video . Corr is best known for his character in Packed to the Rafters, but has also had roles in Underbelly: The Golden Mile, Love Child and Wolf Creek 2 (pictured) in which he played opposite John Jarratt in the Australia's biggest grossing film of the last year . Five days after his arrest, Ryan Corr won a Best Performance award at the Madrid International Fantastic Film Festival for his role in the thriller Wolf Creek 2 opposite John Jarratt (the two are pictured in a scene from the film) playing a backpacker who comes into the clutches of the merciless serial killer played by Jarratt . 'His parents divorced when he was nine.  His grandfather was his guiding light. 'He was on the set filming in Sydney. His grandfather was expected to die.' Mr Murphy said Corr took a quick flight to Melbourne on May 24 and grandfather Don was taken 'out of an induced coma to say goodbye'. Three days later, he went to Fletcher Street Bondi to check on the tenant of a bedsit he had bought and then visited a hotel where a man gave him the .26 gram of heroin. The man told Corr, ' take this, you will feel okay'. He then 'walked 200 metres' and was arrested. Ryan Corr's good character, kindness, outstanding acting ability and glittering future were laid out in 11 references or letters tendered on his behalf from: . Mr Murphy said Corr was ' grateful in an odd way for his arrest, telling his lawyer that 'it stopped me doing something ... that's not me'. In a bizarre reference as to why the magistrate should not 'blemish' Corr's career and 'needs to keep his record clean' because it would affect his employment as an actor in the US and Canada,  Mr Murphy cited an alleged incident involving the Prime Minister. He said Tony Abbott had ' burnt a bus stop to the ground and was charged with malicious damage of property' but had no recorded conviction. Magistrate Julie Huber told Corr that she accepted his grandfather's heart attack had made him 'vulnerable' and that 'a conviction would affect your employment in the future'. The actor's father, who works at the Rossbourne school for special needs children in Melbourne said as he left court he was ' always proud' of his son and 'I think his career will speak for itself'. A smiling Ryan Corr also said he was 'pleased the charge has been dismissed and I am looking forward to getting back to work'. A theatre company spokesman told the The Sydney Morning Herald the young actor requested release from the production 'and his departure from the show is not related in any way' to his arrest. Corr said he was leaving because he had been cast in a leading role in a film, understood to be Holding Man directed by Neil Armfield. Ryan Corr was photographed last year walking around Sydney's Kings Cross area, pictured here lighting a cigarettes while while seated beside a blue bag at the bus stop . Corr stayed on the move  and spent much of his time on the phone, pacing up and down the street . Later the actor picked up the blue bag he had with him and was on the move again along the Kings Cross street . Pictures and video footage of Corr also emerged from May last year of him smoking, pacing back and forth and talking on his phone near a bus stop in Sydney's Kings Cross. 'The man was allegedly in possession of a small amount of a prohibited drug,' New South Wales police told Daily Mail Australia.

But today Boris Johnson got the chance for retribution when he poured freezing water over the radio presenter in the latest ice bucket challenge. The stunt took place live on LBC radio at the end of the London Mayor's monthly phone-in, with the two men using a paddling pool to prevent water damaging the studio. Scroll down for video . LBC breakfast show host Nick Ferrari sat in a paddling pool in the studios, while Boris Johnson poured two buckets of water over his head . Mr Johnson appeared reticent at first, fearing he might be nominated himself to take part in the ice bucket challenge which has become an internet craze . As Mr Johnson asked 'do you want both buckets?', Mr Ferrari replied: 'I want as much as you want to give me!' Millions of pounds have been raised for charity through the internet craze, which sees videos of the challenge, and nominations, posted on social media. Mr Ferrari revealed he had been nominated by hair stylist Nicky Clarke and former cricketer Darren Gough. He reassured Mr Johnson: 'You're not involved in this in any way, and I'm not gonna nominate you.' But he called on the London Mayor to help out with dumping the freezing water over his head. 'I'm not going to nominate you, but will you throw the water over my head now, if we go outside...there's a paddling pool standing by...would you throw a bucket...? Mr Ferrari vowed to give money to Mr Johnson's Mayor's Reading Fund, as well as to cancer and motor neurone disease charities .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . Drinking more than three cups of coffee a day can double a person's risk of developing diabetes, Italian scientists have warned . Drinking more than three cups of coffee a day can double a person's risk of developing diabetes, researchers have today warned. Regularly drinking coffee can increase the risk of prediabetes - the early stage of type two diabetes - in those adults who metabolise caffeine slowly and suffer hypertension, scientists have found. The Italian team studied 1,180 patients aged between 18 and 45, who suffered stage one hypertension - high blood pressure - but not diabetes. They found of the coffee drinkers, 87 per cent drank one to three cups a day, while 13 per cent drank more. The study found 42 per cent of participants were fast metabolisers of caffeine and 58 per cent were slow. Over the course of six years, scientists diagnosed prediabetes in 24 per cent of patients. Moderate coffee drinkers were found to have a 34 per cent increased risk of developing prediabetes and heavy caffeine addicts faced a 50 per cent heightened risk. Yet the risk of prediabetes linked with coffee intake was increased only in slow caffeine metabolisers. Dr Lucio Mos, from San Daniele Cardiology Hospital in Udine, north east Italy said: 'Lifestyle factors are very important for the prognosis of young people with hypertension. 'In a previous analysis of HARVEST (Hypertension and Ambulatory Recording Venetia Study) we found that coffee was a risk factor for the development of sustained hypertension and that the risk was modulated by the genetic background of the individual. 'Slow metabolisers of caffeine were at increased risk of hypertension. 'Our study shows that drinking coffee increases the risk of prediabetes in young adults with hypertension who are slow caffeine metabolisers. 'The risk is even greater if these individuals are overweight or obese, and if they are heavy drinkers of coffee. 'Slow caffeine metabolisers are exposed for a longer time to the detrimental effects of caffeine on glucose metabolism. 'Thus, the effect of coffee on prediabetes depends on two factors, the amount of daily coffee intake and the individual's genetic background. A study of nearly 2,000 patients found heavy caffeine addicts who metabolise coffee slowly and have high blood pressure are at highest risk of developing prediabetes - the early stage of type two diabetes . 'Young-to-middle-age people with hypertension should be aware that coffee consumption may increase their risk of developing diabetes in later life. 'Genotyping for the CYP1A2 gene polymorphism could help them to better know their risk. 'The results of the HARVEST study suggest that in patients with hypertension, caffeinated coffee should be considered a dietary risk factor for prediabetes. 'This risk applies especially to slow caffeine metabolisers and to patients who are overweight or obese. 'Our findings contradict previous epidemiologic studies that have advocated coffee consumption as a means to lower the risk of type two diabetes mellitus.'","Italian scientists found heavy caffeine addicts had a 50% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes .

"By . Richard Spillett . Tony Blair's son Nicky, pictured in 2006, has set himself up as a football agent and could make thousands from the Brazil World Cup . The son of former Prime Minister Tony Blair looks set to make thousands off the back of the World Cup after signing up top players to his football agency business. Nicky Blair, 28, starting representing footballers after leaving Oxford University and reportedly made a massive sum from brokering the transfer of Mexican Hector Herrera last year. The players he represents - including fellow Mexican rising star Marco Fabian - could now make the agent even more cash if they perform well at the World Cup in Brazil. Fabian, 24, impressed when he was brought on during his nation's 1-0 win over Cameroon yesterday, increasing speculation he could be about to move to a top European club. It is thought Nicky Blair could earn around 10% of any fee given to the player as well as a cut of his future earnings, adding to his growing empire. Nicky, helped by his university friend Gabriel Moraes, set up agency Magnitude after teaching in an inner city school following university. It is thought they have signed up a number of young South American players with a view to cashing in if the youngsters make it big in Europe. Herrera, 24, was one of his first successes when he moved from Mexican outfit Pachuca to Portuguese team FC Porto for £6.7million last year. Fabian's estimated £10million value means he could make Nicky even more money, with Premiership teams reportedly interested. The Mirror reported today that Nicky's firm also has a number of Brazilian stars on its books, including Marlon Barbosa of club side Fluminese and Leandro Alves of Botafoga. Nicky has reportedly already cashed in on the sale of Hector Herrera (left) to Portuguese club FC Porto and could now be set to earn even more if rising Mexican star Marco Fabian (right) seals a move to Europe . It is thought mother Cherie is supportive of the venture and has allowed her son to use a desk at her business in central London. The money would put Nicky on his way to emulating his father's growing fortune, which is estimated at £80million. Meanwhile, Mr Blair's eldest son, Euan, is expected to follow his father into politics and has been tipped to run for election in Bootle, Merseyside. Younger sister Kathryn has gone into law, also like her parents, and worked for the same inn of court her parents Tony and Cherie joined in the 1970s. Mr Blair's 14-year-old youngest son Leo, who was the first child born to a serving Prime Minister in over 150 years in 2000, is meanwhile said to be 'musically gifted' Nicky, far right, pictured with father Tony Blair, brother Euan (far left), sister Kathryn (centre), brother Leo (bottom centre) and mother Cherie, leaving Downing Street for the final time in 2007 .","Ex-PM's son Nicky Blair signed up Mexican footballers to his agency .

Padraig Harrington, Miguel Angel Jimenez and Jose Maria Olazabal have been announced as Ryder Cup vice-captains to Europe skipper Paul McGinley. Captain McGinley named Stephen Gallacher, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood as the final three members of his playing team for Gleneagles on Tuesday, and the Irishman has now finalised his back-room staff. The big-name trio are synonymous with European success, with 17 Ryder Cup appearances between them, and now form a five-strong line-up behind McGinley, who had already appointed Sam Torrance and Des Smyth as his deputies.

Martin Kaymer . Graeme McDowell . Rory McIlroy . Ian Poulter . Henrik Stenson . Justin Rose . Lee Westwood . Olazabal is a Ryder Cup legend thanks to his feats during seven appearances as a player, where he danced on the 18th green at Muirfield Village after Europe's victory in 1987 and formed a formidable partnership with his great friend and compatriot, Seve Ballesteros. The 48-year-old Spaniard also led the team to victory two years ago as captain during the Miracle at Medinah and shed tears in the memory of Ballesteros. 'Jose Maria's passion for the Ryder Cup is recognised the world over,' said McGinley. 'It was obvious in his legendary partnership with Seve and was also so very apparent two years ago at Medinah, so I'm delighted he has accepted my invitation to be involved again, once more maintaining that important continuity.' Harrington is a three-time major champion and made six appearances in the match as a player, but he has suffered a slump in form and is now ranked as low as 287th in the world. The 43-year-old Irishman was nowhere near qualifying for the team this year. 'Padraig is my oldest friend on Tour and is a guy I have known most of my life,' said McGinley. 'We went to school together, came through the amateur ranks together and have been together in many contests for both Ireland and Europe over the years, so I know what he can bring to the team room.'

That aspect of things is something that really interests me and I'm therefore delighted that Paul has given me the opportunity.' Jimenez, the evergreen Spaniard, has played in the Ryder Cup four times and was touted earlier in the year as a genuine wildcard selection following his victory at the Spanish Open in May, but the 50-year-old's form faded over the summer. 'Miguel is someone that the spectators love as well as being very popular with all the players,' said McGinley. 'However, he is also a person that I respect very much.' McGinley added: 'I know it's been common in the past to have three or four vice-captains but I've gone for five because I feel an extra person is justified due to the additional workload which comes from being the home team, in addition to how well I saw such a system working when we ended up having five vice captains under Colin Montgomerie at Celtic Manor in 2010.

"By . Philip Quinn . If the final dress rehearsal before the opening night of the Euro 2016 drama wasn’t worth a standing ovation, Republic of Ireland casting director Martin O’Neill will be satisfied things went to script. Seeking pointers for Georgia on a subdued evening in the Aviva Stadium, O’Neill will have noted Kevin Doyle’s well-taken header, Wes Hoolahan’s invention, Robbie Brady’s deliveries and Darron Gibson’s enthusiastic return. At one point, Gibson was a tad too enthusiastic and a crude second half lunge earned the Everton midfielder a deserved caution, and the hook ashore from O’Neill moments later. Opener: Crystal Palace striker Kevin Doyle headed The Republic of Ireland ahead after 20 minutes . Republic of Ireland: Given (Elliot 45), Keogh, Meyler (Murphy 85), Ward, Pearce, Brady, Pilkington (McGeady 59), Quinn, Gibson (Whelan 70), Hoolahan (Keane 59), Doyle (Long 59). Subs Not Used: Forde, Coleman, Wilson, O'Shea, Stokes. Booked: Gibson. Goals: Doyle 20, Pearce 81. Oman: Al-Habsi, Al-Owaisi, Al-Mukhaini, Al-Musalami, Al-Mukhaini, Mudhafar Al Gheilani (Al-Busaidi 60), Al-Farsi( Al-Muqbali 81), Al-Muhaijri (Al-Jabri 60), Saleh (Al-Maashari 87), Hardan (Al-Qasmi 60), Al Seyabi (Al-Hadhri 76). Subs Not Used: Al-Ihsni, Al-Nahar, Al-Rushaidi, Al-Jalabubi, Al-Zaabi. Att: 14,376 . Ireland’s first win, the first in seven games was much-needed; so too was a welcome clean sheet but worryingly for O’Neill, little was created from general play against the plucky Asian visitors – both goals came from corners. For Doyle, the goal was the latest chapter in an encouraging week. First, he jumped two divisions on loan to Crystal Palace; then he got to start, then he scored. It was a trademark Doyle effort too, stealing first run on his marker to meet Brady’s corner, and direct a header into the far corner for his 14th international goal. A week shy of his 31st birthday, Doyle isn’t reaching for the pipe and slippers by a long shot, and the goal will have pleased Neil Warnock as much as O’Neill. It was needed too as the opening 20 minutes was unproductive and devoid of atmosphere in front of the smallest attendance since the Aviva opened in 2010. Those that stayed away didn’t miss a lot, in truth. Perhaps the new-look aspect to the team was responsible as O’Neill made six changes from the side which lost 5-1 to Portugal in June, gave the armband to Richard Keogh, and slotted David Meyler in at right-back. Legend: La Galaxy striker Robbie Keane came on as a substitute but couldn't add to his 62 goals for Ireland . With one eye clearly on Georgia, O'Neill held the bulk of his first XI in reserve. As expected, Shay Given returned in goal for his 126th cap after a two-year absence and there was an ironic cheer when he touched the ball for the first time after three minutes. Given had little to do for 45 minutes apart from bark out orders and instil urgency into an unfamiliar line-up in front of him – only Doyle and Stephen Ward survived from his last game, against Italy in the Euro 2012 finals. Given didn’t have one shot to save so his form has to be taken on trust but his vast experience has put him in position to oust David Forde in Tbilisi on Sunday. Other fringe players didn’t do their Euro cause any harm either. Brady, after a hesitant start, emerged as a key threat from set-piece situations. Tough work: Robbie Brady holds off two Oman players as Ireland controlled the match at the Aviva Stadium . With James McClean ruled out of the Georgia game with injury, Brady is in line for his first competitive start since the trip to the Faroe Islands two years ago. His delivery picked out Doyle for the opener and on the half hour another, pin-point corner was met by Pearce at the far post with a thumping header. As the ball dipped in at the far post, the covering Hassan Al Ghailani athletically headed clear from under the crossbar. By then, the Omanese were on the retreat and Meyler, reveling in his raiding right-back role, showed a dash of skill, and vision, to chip against the angle of post and bar. Meyler was involved going forward to the extent that he picked up the Man of the Match aware – you’d have got long odds on that before kick-off. After a cluster of second half substitutions, which included the arrival of Robbie Keane and Shane Long, a fine goal-line clearance in the 67th minute denied Aiden McGeady as Ireland finally cranked up the pressure. Late on: Reading's Alex Pearce  (right) fired in a late second for Ireland to secure the 2-0 home win . Nine minutes from time, a slightly scuffed Brady corner fell to Pearce in the box and the big stopper nimbly created space to stab a left-footed shot into the bottom corner for his second international goal – his first was also against Oman. McGeady then clipped the crossbar late as on as Ireland toyed with Oman who looked rungs below Ireland, rather than the one place the FIFA rankings tell us. On this one-sided evidence, the gulf is far greater between the teams than the Persian variety which laps their shores. Ireland are headed that way on Friday, if a little further north, to the Caucasus. They travel with a gentle breeze at their backs, nothing more, and while they’d gladly settle for a similar result in Tbilisi, they’ll need to be word perfect to get it. Finally: Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill guided his side to their first win in seven matches .","Robbie Brady crossed for Kevin Doyle to head in the opener on 20 minutes .

"By . Derek Lawrenson for the Daily Mail . For Europe's Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley, choosing his three wild card selections for the match at Gleneagles later this month proved an exercise in the three Rs. There was romance in opting for Stephen Gallacher to make his cup debut at a venue just 30 or so miles from his home in Linlithgow. There was Ian Poulter, the racing certainty. Then came cold reality, and the agonising decision of having to choose between Luke Donald and Lee Westwood. McGinley was standing next to him as his foursomes partner when Donald almost died of stage fright on his debut at Oakland Hills in 2004. 'He was just besotted with nerves for the first six holes,' he said. VIDEO Scroll down for From pro shop to the tour, Ian Poulter's incredible story . Big decision: Europe captain Paul McGinley announces his wildcards to face the United States . Left out: Luke Donald has been left out of the European Ryder Cup team by captain McGinley . Demanded inclusion: Stephen Gallacher's blistering recent form has earned him a wildcard . Only one celebrating now: Lee Westwood (right) and Donald drink to Ryder Cup success two years ago . Since 2000, European captains' picks have a hugely impressive Ryder Cup record: . Wins - 25 . Losses - 11 . Halves - 7 . Europe have won five Ryder Cups out of six in that period. The Dubliner has been there every step of the way, watching the Englishman grow into one of the finest Ryder Cup players of all time. But still he felt he couldn't pick him. 'It was the shortest of short heads between Lee and Luke,' confirmed McGinley. 'But in August at the Bridgestone Invitational and the USPGA Championship we saw a little flourish of form from Lee that Luke was not able to show. There were no green shoots of form from him and that proved the difference.' Sometimes you shake your head in amazement on these occasions but McGinley is such a clear thinker that even if you disagreed with any of his choices you had to respect the sound logic. Forget the red herring that he would be hidebound by statistics. 'These selections were primarily about a captain's instincts,' he said, which is as it should be. At the press conference at Wentworth, the excitement felt by Gallacher, even down a crackly phone line, was plain. 'I've been dreaming about playing in the Ryder Cup all my days,' said the 39-year-old Scot, and given the identity of his uncle Bernard — eight times a player, thrice captain — it might almost literally be true. VIDEO Paul McGinley announces wildcards . Missing pieces of the jigsaw: The three wildcard names are added to a board displaying Europe's team . Line-ups: The United States wildcards are set to be revealed late on Tuesday by Tom Watson . McGinley's boys: The full European team to take on the United States later this month . VIDEO Ian Poulter's incredible story . For: . Gallacher's last five strokeplay results at Gleneagles are: 2nd (2013), 6th (2012), 6th (2011), 14th (2010), 10th (2008). Against: . The Scot has never won a singles match in seven attempts at a major event. He has played in the World Golf Championship matchplay event, the Royal Trophy, the Seve Trophy, Volvo Match Play and the Eurasia Cup. It was vital for the health of European golf that a player who went out to the Italian Open last week and came so close to the top two finish he needed to make the team automatically — he finished third — received his due. Imagine if he had been overlooked? What sort of message would that have sent out, going forward, to all those who loyally support the European Tour? After qualifying for the team in similar circumstances in 2004, McGinley (below) recognised that more than anyone. 'Picking Stephen was an easy one,' he said. 'He showed me last week he deserved a place on this team. It wasn't just the 65 he shot on Sunday, the second best round of anyone on the day. On Friday he stood 14 shots off the lead at one point but came home in 30 and showed exactly how much he wanted it. 'Let's be clear. I haven't done Stephen a favour by picking him. His performances demanded he be picked.' The other easy one was Poulter, currently on a wondrous run of seven successive victories in Ryder Cup matches. 'He's always up for the Ryder Cup challenge, isn't he?' said McGinley, smiling, and the Englishman was only too willing to concur. 'I made 24 birdies in the tournament last week and the encouraging thing for me is that I am starting to hole some putts again,' said Poulter. 'I've got three weeks now and I can guarantee I will be ready.' Then came the difficult bit. The pick that left a knot in McGinley's stomach. The first call he made after making his mind up was to Donald, to get the worst bit out of the way. 'He was desperately disappointed and I know the next time I see him in person it is going to be a very difficult conversation,' said McGinley. The man to beat: Rory McIlroy is the leading figure on the European team for Gleneagles . Miracle at Medinah: Europe's team celebrate their remarkable success in Chicago in 2012 . Mr Ryder Cup: Ian Poulter has an incredible record in the event and was never likely to be left out . 'Let's not get it out of perspective. There are much harder things to take in life than the Ryder Cup. But in sporting terms it was the hardest phone call I have ever had to make.' The other thing that swung it Westwood's way was his influence in the locker room, a fact recognised by the player himself. 'I think I've got more experience than most captains and if Paul wants me to practise with the rookies or talk to them or help in any way, almost like a playing vice-captain if you like, I'm very happy to do that,' he said. This will be Westwood's ninth Ryder Cup — only Sir Nick Faldo (11), Christy O'Connor and Bernhard Langer (both 10) have played more — and the pride he feels is obvious. This is only the second time he has been picked, and he recognised he will be under more pressure. But the man who admitted he lost his spark in July is sounding a lot more like his old, formidable self. The Ryder Cup can do that for a man. 'The spark is definitely back, I'm swinging the club a lot better and I'm more focused,' said Westwood, who will add this week's Wales Open to his schedule before the Ryder Cup to make sure he is acclimatised. The three selections complete a strong European team, led by current major winners Rory McIlroy and Martin Kaymer. It won't be as easy at Gleneagles as many think — the Americans are better than advertised — but the home side will deservedly start as clear favourites. Rory McIlroy . Age: 25 .

Only goal difference separates the two sides, as well as FC Groningen and PEC Zwolle, as PSV lead the win after two games in the Eredivisie as they look to improve on last season's fourth placed finish. 69010 . 30070 . 29443 . 56680 . 56077 . 60233 . 60094 . 59908 . 57029 . 58329 . 55937 . 58631 . 62555 . 53685 . 59722 . 55427 . 60094 . 60094 . 34691 . 43770 . 32694 . 32973 . 41611 . 66201 . 76998 . 56402 . 31278 . 63925 . 60094 . 58004 . 52872 . 67280 . 39846 . 15080 . 60419 . 58631 . 55078 . 38383 . 10194 . 47880 . 60233 . 45697 . 60094 . 57040 . 60814 . 56040 . 29443 . 51800 . 49600 . 60233 . 70891 . 43120 . 52687 . 60094 . 60256 . 60094 . 54637 . 48995 . 55264 .","PSV outdid Ajax as well as many others around the world with their superb Ice Bucket challenge .

"By . Michael Gadd for MailOnline . Tim Howard already has Champions League ambitions for Everton and says the club should aim for no less than silverware as they prepare for a return to the Europa League under Roberto Martinez. The Toffees' fifth place finish with a record 72 points earned the side automatic passage into European club football's second tier and after Friday's draw, a place in group H with Lille, Wolfsburg and Krasnodar. Now the US keeper, lauded as a hero in his home country after the World Cup in Brazil, says his club side has no choice but to be ambitious. Ambitious: Tim Howard says Everton should be aiming for silverware and the Champions League, no less . Well-rounded: Howard holds the Nike Ordem ball, the brand's most innovative, technologically advanced and aerodynamically tuned ball to date . 'We're in Europe again, so that will be good to have those big nights at Goodison but I think ultimately, at the end of the season we have to be lifting a trophy, I think that's important,' Howard said during a photo shoot with Nike's Ordem ball. 'Which one that is, it's difficult to say in August, but certainly that's the aim and the focus and we have a big enough squad to cope with the demands of Europe, different cup competitions and most importantly the Premier League.' Everton has opened the Premier League season with two disappointing 2-2 draws against promoted Leicester and Arsenal, who ended last season one place ahead of them. In both matches Howard's side were 2-1 up going into the closing moments only 80th and 90th-minute equalisers turning three points into one. Still, Howard is certain he is the last line of defence for a stronger side than the one which impressed many last year. Romelu Lukaku, on loan from Chelsea at Goodison last year, is now a permanent fixture while the arrival of Samuel Eto'o also from the west London giants adds even more quality in the final third. Late blow: Oliver Giroud heads the 90th-minute equaliser past Howard for Everton's second 2-2 draw of 2014 . Howard continues: 'Outside of that, we want to get into the Champions League - we think that we can do that, we were just short of that last year but again as I said we're stronger this season so we feel like we can do it.' First they need to turn draws into wins though and their next hurdle could hardly be tougher as they host Chelsea at Goodison Park on Saturday. If fit, Eto'o could debut immediately against his old club while Lukaku is also in some doubt with injury.
