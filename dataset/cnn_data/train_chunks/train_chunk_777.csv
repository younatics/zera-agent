"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Like every fad, the Gangnam Style dance craze that became the most successful YouTube video has had it's day. But it seems that the cult dance from South Korean rapper Psy that inspired countless parodies is still being recreated by one loyal fan- a European brown bear. British photographer Mark Sisson captured the cub's movements in Northern Finland in June. Happy feet: The brown bear cub stand up on his hind legs and crosses his arms to adopt rapper Psy's signature pose . Uncanny: Despite living in a Finnish swamp, the young bear recreates the dance craze with alarming accuracy. His siblings look more interested in the plants around them and his mother looks unamused . Mr Sisson watched in amazement as the cub stood on his hind legs, pranced around and banged his wrists together. Walking across a swamp with his mother and two siblings, the cub burst into action, despite his family's withering looks. The single-minded cub continued to prance around on his own in an uncanny recreation of Psy's energetic moves. Mr Sisson, . from Shropshire, said: 'These images were taken during a long night . spent in a photographic hide in northern Finland in late June, where I . was leading a photographic trip. 'This . summer there were a couple of European brown bears with families of . small cubs visiting this swamp area throughout the night. Going solo: Mark Sisson captured the cub in a remarkable moment when he looks directly at the camera and prances around . Coy? The cub has a bashful moment as he pivots around and turns his back on his unappreciative family . 'The cubs are . always playful and cheeky but this particular youngster seemed to have a . great delight in standing up and practicing his moves. 'Normally . standing up like this is to help them see potential danger at a . distance (their eyesight is not particularly good generally) but this . youngster had other ideas, and my client sharing the hide commented that . it reminded him of the Gangnam style of dancing! 'Looking . through the sequence of images he had begun a bit shyly with his back . to us, then had another go side-on and once he was happy tried once . again for his mum and siblings to see - unfortunately all he got was a . disapproving look from mum and the rest of the family carried on eating! 'Movement . wise he was moving from side to side, one foot to another and it was . this along with the positioning of his front paws that really drew the . Gangnam analogy to mind.' Copycat: Parodies of the Korean dance, which was released in July 2012 popped up all over the world as it surpassed 1 billion hits . Capturing the moment: Wildlife photographer Mark Sisson was on a hide near the swamp when he saw the family and it's star performer walk towards him .","Photographer Mark Sisson captured the moment in North Finland .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The notion that homes could be fuelled by human waste, might not be an appealing thought, but it could transform people's lives in developing countries. British scientists have already proved they can charge a phone by using urine to feed microbial fuel cells. And they aim to scale up their innovation to provide much needed electricity and sanitation in the form of a clever bathroom system designed to be used in remote and poor areas of the world. Scroll down for video . Dr Ioannis Ieropoulos is pictured at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory holding a phone powered by a microbial fuel cell stack. He believes the new technology could one day power homes in developing countries . Microbial fuel cells are energy converters that turn organic matter directly into electricity by utilising the metabolism of live micro-organisms. The electricity is a by-product of the microbes’ natural life cycle. The more they eat things like urine, the more energy they generate and for longer periods of time . The electricity output of MFCs is relatively small and the researchers are currently only been able to store and accumulate low levels of energy into capacitors for short charge and discharge cycles. They claim that this is the first time that scientists have been able to directly charge the battery of a device such as a mobile phone and it should be seen as a significant breakthrough. The research is backed by the Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation, as the Microsoft billionaire is keen to help to create a fully-functional system that could be installed in bathrooms to collect urine, which would be used to light and heat a house as well as power gadgets. The system is being developed by The Robotics Lab - a collaboration between the University of the West of England (UWE) and the University of Bristol. ‘The beauty of this fuel source is that we are not relying on the erratic nature of the wind or the sun, said Ioannis Ieropoulos, project leader and researcher at UWE. ‘Using the ultimate waste product as a source of power to produce electricity is about as eco as it gets.’ A number of fuel cells are pictured. They use urine as a source of power to produce electricity. By harnessing this power, researchers have managed to charge a Samsung mobile phone . Dr Ieropoulos said that the microbial fuel power stack has so far generated enough power to a person to send text messages, browse the Web and make a short call on their phone. The technology works by using natural microbes housed within the fuel cell as a bio-catalyst. The microbes consume part of the urine, which generates electrons that when connected to a cathode, create an electric current. While the technology is proven on a small scale, the scientists’ next aim is to refine the cell so that it can be used to charge a battery, which could power showers and light rooms. Tim Worstall, a writer and fellow at the Adam Smith Institute, London, is unsure whether the money spent on developing the cells could be better spent building traditional infrastructure. He said: ‘The real question now to be researched is whether this method makes sense in those parts of the world where one of those three, or more likely all three of sewage, potable water and electricity, don't exist, Power Technology reported. ‘Would such technologies be cheaper than spending the money to actually go and build those systems?’ he added. It might be a race to the finish to see whether the fuel cell technology or infrastructure projects will be the first to transform peoples’ lives. A single microbial fuel cell is pictured.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . Iranian warships dispatched to the Atlantic Ocean will travel close to U.S. maritime borders for the first time in a bid to send 'a message' to the White House. A destroyer and helicopter-carrying supply ship began their voyage last month from the . southern Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas and are on a three-month mission. The voyage is intended to counter the U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf, as the Islamic Republic continues to assert its power across the Middle East and beyond. 'Iran's military fleet is approaching the United States' maritime borders, and this move has a message,'  Admiral Afshin Rezayee Haddad of Iran's Northern Navy Fleet said, according to The Jerusalem Post. 'This move has a message': Iranian warships dispatched to the Atlantic Ocean last month will travel close to U.S. maritime borders for the first time in response to U.S. fleets near Iran . Haddad said the vessels have already . entered the Atlantic Ocean via waters near South Africa, carrying about 30 navy academy cadets for training along with their regular crews. Iran had first warned America of its . plans to deploy its naval forces along U.S. marine borders 'in the next . few years' in September 2012. Iran's Navy Commander Rear Admiral .

'American officials publicly say they do not seek regime change in Iran. That's a lie. They wouldn't hesitate a moment if they could do it,' he said, in a speech to mark the 35th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution today. 'The solution to our economic problems is not looking out and having the sanctions lifted ... My advice to our officials, as ever, is to rely on infinite indigenous potentials. 'Our (hostile) stance toward the United States is due to its controlling and meddlesome attitude.' Last month, Iran and six world powers agreed on how to implement a nuclear deal struck in November.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Our existence didn’t come as a result of a glorious bang, but instead of a long, cold transformation, according to a new theory. The theory contradicts the most popular concept of our universe's beginning, which suggestsit started with the Big Bang, and has been expanding ever since. The Big Bang model suggests the universe began from what is known as a ‘singularity’, or a point of infinite density at which physical laws break down. The latest theory contradicts the most popular concept of the universe which suggests the world started with a Big Bang, and has been expanding ever since. Pictured here is the cosmic microwave background that is thought to have been left over from the Bang . But Christof Wetterich, a theoretical physicist at Heidelberg University in Germany, claims this Big Bang never happened. Instead, the universe started as an empty and cold void, slowly emerging from a deep freeze. He claims his theory will help resolve some of the more challenging aspects of the Big Bang theory, such as the singularity present during the beginning of the universe. The concept that the universe is expanding was developed in the 1920s when astronomers look at the light emitted or absorbed by atoms, which appeared at different frequencies. Professor Wetterich's latest suggestion builds on his earlier theory that the universe is not expanding, but instead getting fatter . The theory suggests the universe started as an empty and cold void, slowly emerging from a deep freeze. Professor Wetterich’s argues that while fundamental particles become heavier over time, gravity weakens. This logic suggests the universe still underwent inflation but did not necessarily continue expanding. Professor . Wetterich also argues that instead of starting with a big bang, time . before inflation could stretch into the infinite past. His picture is akin to saying that instead of the . universe expanding, the ruler with which we measure it is shrinking. In this picture, he says, ‘you can go as far back in the past as you want, and the past is even pretty boring.’ They found that when matter moved away, galaxies exhibited a shift to the red, lower frequency part of the spectrum. After observing that most galaxies exhibit a red shift that became greater for more distant galaxies, they theorised that the universe was expanding. But Professor Wetterich’s theory suggests that the fundamental particles of the universe are instead becoming heavier over time, while gravity weakens. This logic suggests the universe still underwent a period of inflation but did not necessarily continue expanding. According to a report in Science News, . Professor Wetterich’s picture is akin to saying that instead of the . universe expanding, the ruler with which we measure it is in fact . shrinking. Professor Wetterich also argues that instead of starting with an explosion, time before inflation could stretch into the infinite past - in other words, there was no real beginning to the universe. In this picture, he says, ‘you can go as far back in the past as you want, and the past is ... pretty boring.’ Professor Wetterich’s latest suggestion builds on his earlier theory that the universe is not expanding, but instead getting heavier. Radiation from the early universe would make it look hotter than it actually was if particle masses have been increasing. This means distant objects would appear to be receding even if they aren’t. He says this would explain why the universe appears to be expanding. Professor Wetterich claims that he is not trying to overthrow the big bang as both it and his slow freeze model are consistent with current scientific observations.","Professor Christof Wetterich from Heidelberg University argues that while fundamental particles become heavier over time, gravity weakens .

"By . James Tozer . Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell was yesterday suspended from the soap after he was charged with child sex offences. The 48-year-old actor, who has played mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV series for 30 years, insists he is innocent of the allegations – which include child rape – and has vowed to ‘fight the charges vigorously’. However, the show’s bosses said he would not be appearing in any further episodes while legal proceedings are under way. Le Vell, pictured with his wife Janette Beverley, who he split with last year . The actor was first arrested under his . real name, Michael Turner, in September 2011 and questioned after a . teenage girl claimed he had sexually assaulted her from the age of six. Three months later, however, . prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to take the allegations . to court and no charges were brought. At the time the father of two said he was ‘delighted’ to have been ‘completely exonerated’. He thanked police for their ‘thorough . investigation’, and expressed his gratitude to fans and the Coronation . Street cast for their loyal support during ‘a most difficult and . upsetting phase in my life’. He returned to the show after a short break and is currently involved in some of its main storylines. Stalwart: Michael Le Vell, real name Michael Turner, has been in the ITV soap since 1983 and is one of the country's biggest soap stars, and like his character, it has emerged how much he enjoys a drink . However, on Thursday evening it was . announced that after a review of the evidence, Le Vell had been charged . with 19 sex offences, including raping a child, indecently assaulting a . child and sexual activity with a child. There was no sign of the actor . yesterday at the £325,000, two-bed terraced house he has been renting in . Hale, Greater Manchester, since separating from his wife  Janette . Beverley and leaving the family home in 2011. But in a  statement he . said that following the serious allegations that had been made, he . wanted to make it ‘quite clear’ that he was ‘innocent of these charges . and intend to fight them vigorously’. He added:  ‘I will now put all my . efforts into clearing my name and proving my innocence.’ Charged: Michael Le Vell has been charged with child sex offences, whose real name is Michael Turner, will appear in court later this month . Thanking friends, family and fans for . their continued support, he said he would now concentrate on preparing . his defence. An ITV spokesman said: ‘Given the serious nature of these . charges, Michael Le Vell will not be appearing in Coronation Street . pending the outcome of legal proceedings. ‘It would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this time.’ Greater Manchester Police said the . rethink over charging Le Vell had followed a review of evidence by the . Crown Prosecution Service and related to ‘offences against a child . between 2001 and 2010’. Alison Levitt QC, principal legal . adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions, said: ‘I have very . carefully reviewed the evidence in this case and I have concluded that . there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to charge . Michael Robert Turner with a number of sexual offences.’ Le Vell will appear in court in Manchester later this month. Originally from Manchester, Le Vell began his acting career in the Oldham Theatre Workshop. He joined Coronation Street in 1983 . and quickly endeared himself to fans who have followed the trials and . tribulations of Kevin, from being Brian Tilsley’s apprentice mechanic . through to his stormy marriage to Sally, played by Sally Dynevor, and . fathering two teenage girls as well as a child from his affair with . Molly Dobbs. Early years: Le Vell in an episode of Coronation Street from 1987 . Born Michael Turner in Newton Heath, Manchester, Michael Le Vell is best known for the role of garage mechanic Kevin Webster, in the ITV soap opera Coronation Street. After taking an interest in amateur dramatics while at school, Le Vell began his acting career in the Oldham Theatre Workshop. He landed the role on Coronation Street after a making short guest appearance in the show as the paperboy Neil Grimshaw. He had attended an audition at Granada Studios for the series Scully, where he met casting director Judy Hayfield who presumed he was there to audition for Coronation Street. She asked him to return the following day to audition and he was offered the part. He first appeared as Webster in the soap on October 19 1983, moving in with Hilda Ogden as her lodger and getting a job as an apprentice mechanic with Brian Tilsley. Le Vell has featured in some of Coronation Street's most explosive storylines, most recently Webster's affair with Molly Dobbs. After twenty-six years in the role, Le Vell pledged to carry on playing Kevin Webster because he still viewed it as 'the best job on television'. He has also starred in the BBC shows Fame is the Spur and One by One. During the 1980s Le Vell became something of a gay icon and would receive a high volume of fan mail from gay men. This was reportedly due to the fact he wore tight jeans and a moustache and appeared on screen with his left ear pierced. He later claimed that the attention from gay men ended as soon after he shaved off his moustache. He married Coronation Street Co-star Janette Beverley in October 1986. They couple have two children together but split last year. He was a member of the celebrity 'All Stars' football team which play charity matches and was hospitalised during a match in 2007.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Florida man accused of murdering his new wife just days after they were married more than a decade ago is now representing himself in his long-anticipated first degree murder trial, and on Tuesday he cross-examined the prosecution's star witness: His former girlfriend who admits that she helped him murder his wife. Authorities say Michel Escoto bludgeoned his 21-year-old bride Wendy Trapaga to death in October of 2002 - just four days after they were married - so he could collect on a million-dollar life insurance policy and run off with his girlfriend, Yolanda Cerrillo, who has admitted to helping Escoto plan the murder of her then-romantic rival in exchange for complete immunity from prosecution. 'Happy with yourself?' Miami-Dade County prosecutor Gail Levine asked Cerrillo of her involvement in the murder and the deal she reached with prosecutors. Scroll down for video . Tears: Yolanda Cerillo sobs as she admits her involvement in the murder of Wendy Trapaga . 'I’m worthless,' Cerrillo sobbed. 'That’s how I feel right now.' 'But it’s not about you, is it?' Levine asked. According to the Miami Herald, Cerrillo then broke down in tears. 'It’s about a mother who lost her daughter and I had something to do with it,' Cerrillo answered back in tears. Escoto faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of Trapaga, who was found strangled, drugged and bludgeoned to death in warehouse parking lot in October of 2002. Authorities say Escoto killed Trapaga on the couple's impromptu honeymoon in Key West, just four days after their 'rushed' wedding. Prosecutors say that on the night of the murder, the couple went out partying and then checked into the Executive Airport Motel. Escoto later told police that he and Trapaga had gotten into a fight and she left on her own. Tragic: Wendy Trapaga was allegedly murdered by her husband of four days and his ex-girlfriend in a scheme to cash in on an insurance policy . While married to Trapaga, he was still seeing his longtime girlfriend, Cerrillo, whom he had been living with prior to his marriage to Trapaga. In 2002, Cerrillo says Escoto abruptly moved out of the apartment the two had shared. Cerrillo admits that she was devastated after Escoto left her. 'It was downhill. He left me. I couldn’t handle it very . well,' she told the court. 'All I could do was cry in my room.' Escoto testified that after she'd discovered that Escoto had moved in with Trapaga, she had him meet her in a restaurant parking lot to confront him about it. 'Killer': Authorities say Michel Escoto married Trapaga only to murder her for a life insurance payout . That, Cerrillo says, was when he told her about his plan to kill Trapaga for the insurance money and then run away with her. Cerrillo testified that the original plan was to kill Trapaga during a trip to New Orleans during Mardi Gras. Escoto decided to speed up the plan because 'he was running out of money,' according to Cerrillo, who added that 'Wendy needed to die sooner.' The honeymoon in Key West was where Escoto decided he would kill Trapaga - Cerrillo says she even gave him the $80 to pay for the hotel. After Trapaga was dead, Escoto was to send a page to Cerrillo's beeper - 'that would be the message that it would be done,' Cerrillo told the court. Attorney: Escoto is acting as his own attorney, and actually cross-examined the ex-girlfriend, Cerrillo, with whom he allegedly plotted the murder . Escoto then drove to Cerrillo's home, where - she told the court - she could see what appeared to be Trapaga's body reclined in the passenger seat of Escoto's car. Cerrillo then followed Escoto in her own car to the warehouse parking lot where Trapaga's bludgeoned body was found by police days later Cerrillo said she had to drive around for a little while after they got to the warehouse to give Escoto more time to finsih killing Trapaga, who apparently was drugged while in Escoto's car. Cerrillo says she found him he had abandoned the car he'd driven and was walking in the street covered in blood - and he was holding a tire iron. Cerrillo and Escoto stopped on the way home to throw the tire iron into the ocean, at which point a police officer pulled up to their vehicle but simply shooed them away from the water. Tire iron: Authorities say Escoto drugged Trapaga, before strangling her and bludgeoning her with a tire iron . In the months following the murder, Escoto moved back in with Cerrillo - but the relationship was rocky. During an argument, Cerrillo says Escoto choked her. She says she didn't want to call police because he'd reminded her of her involvement in Trapaga's murder. 'I had no way out,' Cerrillo said. 'He either kills me or I go to jail.' Escoto wasn't charged in his wife's death until 2005 after he'd given inconsistent versions of what had happened to his wife in a lawsuit he filed to get his hands on the insurance money. Cerrillo - now 40 - started cooperating with authorities in 2006. Civil penalties: A civil jury ordered Cerrillo pay Trapaga's mother a $44 million judgement for being responsible for the death of her daughter . In 2011, she admitted that she had not told investigators about the full extent of her involvement and came clean. 'The secret was too much,' she told jurors Tuesday. 'It was too stressful.' While she may not go to prison for her role in Trapaga's death, Cerrillo was found responsible for Trapaga's death in civil court, where a jury awarded Trapaga's mother a $44 million judgment against Cerrillo for her daughter's death.","Michel Escoto is accused of murdering his wife of four days, Wendy Trapaga .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Tom Sizemore has denied ever having met President Clinton or having given him Elizabeth Hurley’s phone number after a recording surfaced yesterday where he was making outrageous claims about his connection to the pair. The actor spoke out late Wednesday saying that he does not deny that it is his voice on the tape that was released on Radar Online hours ago, but blamed the claims on his use of drugs like crystal meth. ‘I was never at the White House and I never met Bill Clinton,’ Sizemore told HuffPostLive with his lawyer at his side. Coming clean: Tom Sizemore, seen next to his manager Charles Lago, said that he has never met former President Clinton nor did he give the Commander in Chief the phone number of his ex girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley . Liz Hurley went for large dark sunglasses despite the rainy weather in West London on Thursday afternoon . ‘I’m not denying I said these things. I don’t remember saying these things. ‘They're the rantings of a guy that it has been well-chronicled had a very severe drug problem.’ Sizemore, 52, said that he still has not listened to the tape in question- which purports that Sizemore is recorded telling how he went to the White House in 1998 for a screening of Saving Private Ryan while Bill Clinton was President. In the tape, he alleges that the President cornered him, forced him to give him Hurley’s number, and he overheard Clinton call the model and arrange for a private plane to fly her from Los Angeles to D.C. Sizemore published a memoir last year wherein he described how he had a three-year affair with his one-time co-star, Hurley, that began in 1992 and ended in 1995- during which time she was also dating Hugh Grant. Persistent rumours: Elizabeth Hurley and former US president Bill Clinton have an intimate moment at a charity ball in Russian in 2005 . He did not have sexual relations with this one either: Bill Clinton and Liz Hurley at the charity ball . Close friends: Liz Hurley appears to have her hand on the former president's back during the dinner in St Petersburg nine years ago . Although these pictures capture the pair sitting close together at the charity event, Mr Sizemore has said he made up the story about the affair between Bill Clinton and Liz Hurley . When news of the tape surfaced this morning, Hurley immediately denied the reports on Twitter. ‘Ludicrously . silly stories about me & Bill Clinton. Totally untrue. In the hands . of my lawyers. Yawn,’ she wrote to her nearly 450,000 followers. Sizemore . said that he has not spoken to his former flame in regards to the tape, . and apologized to both Hurley and the former President for bringing the . issue up. ‘I’d like to apologize to her for any hurt or BS I caused her or the Clintons or anyone else I could have mentioned,’ he said. ‘My perceptions were not the greatest.’ Having a ball: The only time the pair were ever pictured was at a November 2005 at a Russian charity masquerade ball at the Catherine Palace of Pushkin . Complete denial: The speculation of an alleged affair began because Sizemore said he connected Hurley (left) and then-President Bill Clinton (right) during a visit to the White House in 1998 which he now says never happened . Setting the record straight: In the past, Hurley has said that she finds powerful men like Clinton 'sexy' but she says the latest claims about them having an affair are false . In today’s interview, Sizemore claimed . that he was hanging around questionable people during the depths of his . drug addiction around 2006, and he assumes that one of those people . secretly taped him saying this outrageous story. ‘It’s an old tape... I wasn’t really willing to be videotaped,’ he said Wednesday. ‘Those were the type of folks I was hanging out with before I went to Celebrity Rehab,’ which occurred in 2010. He . went on to clarify that he has never met former President Clinton and . the only time he attended a screening of one of his films near the White . House was during former President George W Bush’s administration. Ramblings: Sizemore, seen here during an interview Wednesday night, said that he has been sober for five years but had a multi-year drug addiction that landed him in rehab . Different era: Elizabeth Hurley, seen today with a friend in West London, was the first party involved in the story to make a public comment wherein she vehemently denied the claims she had an affair with Clinton . Sizemore said that the latest recording- which may have been taken at the same time as an earlier video that Radar released that shows Sizemore smoking from a pipe that is believed to contain crystal meth- is ‘more proof that I wasn’t in my best of shape’. ‘I had fallen into disrepair. ‘I’ve been through a lot and I haven’t been through a lot- it’s all relative. ‘It’s the choices I chose to do back then and they're coming back to haunt me now.’ He said that while he is a Democrat, he ‘not a very political guy’ and did not want to weigh in on any analysis about how this claim would help or hurt Hillary Clinton as she is widely considered the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in 2016. ‘This shouldn’t harm Mrs Clinton- it's just ludicrous that the ravings of a drug addicted actor have any influence on who should be president,’ Sizemore said.","Tom Sizemore has denied ever giving President Clinton the number for his ex-girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley .

The increasingly bitter split between Johnny Weir and his husband intensified when Victor Voronov accused the Olympic ice-skater of cheating on him and holding their Japenese Chin dog, Tema hostage. Angry Voronov, 29, claims that Weir committed multiple acts of adultery - including an affair with an unidentified Chicago club owner and sexting a porn star. In legal documents obtained by TMZ, Voronov also alleges that Weir forced him out of the closet during their relationship and that he married him because his life with a Georgetown-educated lawyer would make compeling reality television.

Happier times: Victor Voronov and Johnny Weir on their wedding day in 2011 and (right) out and about in Manhattan . Claiming that his husband treated him like an errand boy, Voronov says that Weir was cruel to him and even forbid him from letting his dog, Tema live with them in case it took his attention away from the ice-skater. In addition to the allegations of adultery and cruelty, Voronov is also requesting a judge to force Weir to return property the lawyer claims the Olympian took from him. These include 20 furs - including a $125,000 coat made from sable - a crocodile Celine bag, 40 Balencia bags, one green and one orange Hermes Birkin and 12 Chanel bags. He is also claiming temporary support and legal fees. Furs: Voronov claims that Weir has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of clothes from him and has asked a judge for them back . Anger: The two have traded accusations about the other through the media - alleging adultery and physical abuse . A source close to Weir told TMZ that the property Voronov is requesting was the Winter Olympic commentators before their marriage, which the source added, 'couldn't be more obvious from the fact that they are purses and women's furs.' The source also added that Weir 'categorically denies' the adultery allegations. But  last week, in a sign of how acrimonious the split has becoming, Weir pened up about his divorce from his husband - claiming his husband was often abusive towards him and relied on his money. In an ugly twist, the 29-year-old former skater shared details of his two-year marriage with Victor Voronov, a non-practising attorney, in an interview with Access Hollywood on Thursday. While he was all smiles and professionalism during his stint as a commentator in Sochi, behind the scenes, he struggling with a 'personal hell' of an emotionally and physically abusive partner, he said. He filed for divorce on February 12, while he was in Sochi. And in a sign that this split may be about to get uglier still, Weir's ex released an image of the bite mark he claimed the presenter inflicted on his arm. 'Sochi was one of the hardest times in my life,' he said. 'When I was on the broadcasting, I escaped my own personal hell that I was living in. 'My husband was behaving very erratically. The majority of the time off camera I was in tears. I was on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a good place.' Return: This is Tema - Victor Voronov's dog - who is not being returned to him by Johnny Weir according to court papers seen by TMZ . He said that while the damage couldn't be seen on his body, he was controlled emotionally and Voronov forced him to cut out friends, professional contacts and even his mother. He added that their fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of control, including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the police. A picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man's forearm.  Despite the fall out, however, the couple appeared together in a New Jersey court earlier this month and a judge agreed to dismiss the case. Speaking to Access Hollywood, Weir said that physical attacks weren't just made by him. 'Some of my closest friends have seen him hit me before,' he said. Stars of Sochi: Weir and fellow skater Tara Lipinski were applauded for their colorful commentary in Sochi - but Weir has revealed that throughout the experience he was arguing with his husband . He added that he had added pressure because Voronov, whom he married after a short romance, had taken on the 'traditional' role and Weir was left to provide for the two of them. 'He was not super accepting of the fact that I work and I have to work this week in Russia, this week in Los Angeles, next week in Tokyo,' he said. 'I was supporting two people and whether it seems like a big deal or not, I come from a lower middle class family that has to work, no matter what. 'If you canâ€™t be an attorney this week, then you better go get a job next week, otherwise the bills wonâ€™t get paid. I had to travel to work to support myself and to support my family.' On Friday, TMZ also reported that Weir emailed Voronov last September, claiming that he had destroyed his pricey Birkin bag. 'If you decide to wreck things, please wreck cheaper things than Birkin,' he wrote. 'He goes on ...""The f*** you on the Birkin is kinda cool, though, you artist.' Despite the rocky relationship, Voronov said on his Twitter account that he had not been aware that Weir had filed for divorce until the announcement this week. Weir had written on Wednesday: 'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts and I wish him well.' 'Shocked by the abrupt ending of my marriage and am dealing with the trauma including multiple things I am just now becoming aware of...' he wrote on Wednesday. Champion on ice: Weir competed in the 2010 . Vancouver Winter Olympics, finishing sixth place in the men's single . competition, and was a hit in his first commentary stint at Sochi . On Thursday he added: 'Yes. I'd like to confirm, It's true: I am only now finding out that my husband @johnnygweir filed for divorce from me months ago.' Voronov's spokesperson, Wendy Feldman, added: 'It is our extreme hope and desire that this divorce could have been handled amicably. Not only is Victor heartbroken but he is now humiliated.' But Weir said he's not worried about the scandal - and that his ex has nothing up his sleeve that could do any damage. 'The worst that he could do is post naked photos that we have between each other and I look flawless,' he said. Weir officially came out as gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality. On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov, a Georgetown Law graduate. Ahead of the nuptials, Weir told IceNetwork that Voronov, who comes from a Russian family but grew up in Atlanta, was 'kind of everything that I've ever looked for and aspired to be in a relationship with'. He went on: 'We've known for a long time and we reconnected over the summer, and it's just been a whirlwind. He's wonderful. He's in the legal field, completely separate from all of my razzle dazzle. He loves watching me perform and seeing what I actually do.' But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery. 'A marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'","Victor Voronov has filed court papers alleging his estranged husband Johnny Weir repeatedly cheated on him .

"By . Dominic Prince . Petra Stunt, 25 (pictured with husband James), bought Sloane House for £70million in February 2012 and asked friend Paul Fleury to take charge of the renovations . The daughter of Formula 1 billionaire Bernie Ecclestone is suing a trusted friend who was in charge of restoring her £100million Chelsea mansion, saying he siphoned £1.6million into his private bank accounts. Petra Stunt, 25, bought one of London’s most magnificent townhouses, Sloane House, for £70million in February 2012 and appointed Paul Fleury, 45, to oversee lavish renovations. The socialite had a budget of £25million to transform the historic building in West London, including a new wing, featuring a pool, gymnasium and underground car park. But last year the family discovered that Fleury – a friend who had worked for them for the past seven years and was paid £7,000 a month to manage the renovation work – was allegedly forging invoices from companies that did not exist and paying them into bank accounts controlled by him. In the writ served by Princess Diana’s former lawyers, Mishcon de Reya, it is alleged Fleury is a ‘sophisticated fraudster’ who sent Petra the invoices via a company she owns called Sloane House Ltd. It was a clearly a step too far for the flamboyant Petra who, alongside sister Tamara, 29, is often portrayed as spending ‘Daddy’s billions’ with barely a thought for the bottom line. When Petra married art collector James Stunt, her mother Slavica justified the £12million cost of the three-day nuptials as ‘worth every penny’. When she bought Sloane House, formerly owned by Tory peer Lord Bamford, friends quipped ‘it will give Petra something to do’. Petra alleges that family friend Fleury billed her with fake invoices worth £1.6million and siphoned off the money into accounts controlled by him . Fleury says his payments had been verbally agreed with Petra and that they were ‘commissions’ – a claim denied by the Ecclestones. Fleury helped to renovate and restore eight family properties, he said, including one in Switzerland. He told The Mail on Sunday that he had considered himself a ‘family friend’ and had attended Petra’s wedding. He added: ‘It’s a complicated story. I am surprised the Ecclestone family want this coming to court.’ A spokesman for Petra said: ‘As this is before the courts at present, we cannot comment.’","Petra Stunt, daughter of Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone, is suing the builder who took charge of renovations on her Chelsea home .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Blasted: Josef Hecken received a torrent of criticism for his claims that beer cures mental disorders . A bottle of warm beer is better than psychotherapy, a German health official has advised. According to Josef Hecken, chair of the country's statutory health system, a drink can heal minor illnesses like sleep disorders. Speaking at a debate, he also ridiculed the inclusion of psychotherapists in Germany's healthcare provision. His comments have provoked outrage among leading medics claiming he has trivialised severe mental disorders. Dieter Best, chairman of the German Association of Psychotherapists, attacked Hecken's suggestion as 'unspeakable' in an open letter. He wrote: 'You trivialise and ignore the needs of our patients with your bottle of beer metaphor. 'And you subtly stigmatise people with severe psychiatric disorders.' The letter, published in German newspaper Tagesspiegel, also blasted Mr Hecken for saying it was a 'cardinal sin' the government incorporated psychotherapists into the national health service. Before 1999, people with mental disorders were transquilised instead of receiving therapy, Mr Best exclaims. In a desperate bid to backtrack, Mr Hecken issued a statement describing his suggestion as 'unfortunate' and 'misunderstood'. He said: 'I, as an individual, do not regard every indisposition, such as difficulty falling asleep, as a pathologic condition that requires treatment. Cure? Leading medics have written an open letter blasting the comments for 'trivialising severe mental disorders' 'Sometimes the old home cure of a bottle of warm beer helps me. 'I am aware that there are significant interdependencies between alcohol consumptiona nd pscyhological diseases, which are documented in studies. 'The last thing I want to do is to trivialise psychological diseases or to even describe alcohol consumption as an appropriate alternative for psychotherapeutic treatment.'","Josef Hecken, chair of Germany's statutory health system, claimed 'the old home cure of a warm bottle of beer' can solve problems with sleep .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The unique twists, turns and layers of Mount Everest’s rocky terrain have been caught on 3D camera by a motorised glider. A pair of German pilots mounted the specialist Modular Airborne Camera System (MACS) to the wing of a Stemme S10-VTX glider before making the trip over Everest’s summit - 8,848 metres above sea level. Footage from the camera will now be used to build a high-quality 3D model of the Nepalese mountain, with a resolution down to 15 centimetres. Scroll down for video . German pilots flew the motorised glider, pictured, over the summit of Mount Everest and filmed the event using a specialist 3D camera. Researchers plan to use this footage to build a 3D model of the Nepalese mountain with a resolution down to 15 centimetres . Mount Everest is the tallest of the so-called ‘eight-thousanders’ - at 8,848 metres - and is the standard to which all other mountains are compared. Everest’s geological story began 40 million years ago when the Indian subcontinent began a slow-motion collision with Asia. The edges of the two continents were forced together and formed the tall ridges that make up the Himalayas today. Glaciers have chiselled Mount Everest’s summit into a huge, triangular pyramid, defined by three faces and three ridges that extend to the northeast, southeast, and northwest. The southeastern ridge is the most widely used climbing route. It is the one Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay followed in May 1953 when they became the first climbers to reach the summit and return safely. Researchers plan to use this model to help improve forecasts of landslides and floods resulting from the outbursting of glacial lakes. The scheme was set up by the Mountain Wave Project (MWP) and researchers from the German Aerospace Centre, also known as Deutsches Zentrum für Luft-und Raumfahrt (DLR). MWP pilot Klaus Ohlmann and co-pilot Jona Keimer took an hour and a half to reach the summit, after taking off from the expedition base camp at Pokhara airport in Nepal on 28 January. They flew the glider along the Himalayas towards Mount Everest before using mountain waves to gradually gain altitude. 'The conditions were ideal, despite the wind speeds at the summit of Everest, which neared 100 kilometres per hour,' said Ohlmann. 'The almost turbulence-free slope updrafts helped us ascend quickly.' The MACS camera system, developed and built by DLR, was fitted to the glider in an unpressurised instrument container under the wing. Its three camera heads, arranged facing . toward each other at a lateral slant, give a 120-degree field-of-view . and can take high-resolution images of steep slopes. The Stemme S10-VTX glider, pictured, was mounted with a specialist 3D Modular Airborne Camera System (MACS) built by the German Aerospace Centre. The 3D model will be used to help improve forecasts of landslides and floods resulting from the outbursting of glacial lakes . Due to the cold temperatures of the Himalayan summits, which can drop to below -35 degrees Celsius, engineers had to put the camera through a series of tests before the flight could take off. This included tests in a vacuum chamber, at moderate altitudes above the Alps and while subjected to unusual lighting conditions. While the pilots were given a specialist oxygen sysyem designed to help them fly to such high altitudes. The pictures from the camera will now be . used to create detailed 3D colour computer images of the mountainous . regions that the glider passed over.

"Google has developed a model to predict a hit film with 94 per cent accuracy, right down to the box office takings on opening weekend. Using search data and applying it at various stages before a film's release, Google says it can predict the success of upcoming releases a month before their release, and even box office takings the weekend after opening. In a blog post titled 'Quantifying Movie Magic with Google Search', Andrea Chen, Principal Industry Analyst, Media and Entertainment for Google, says that searches for movie trailers made four weeks before a film premiers can be used to determine opening weekend revenue. Prediction: The new model for predicting movie success could help movie marketers to make a film more appealing to audiences if data shows it's doomed to opening weekend failure at the box office . According to Chen, using the trailer-search data along seasonal information and a film's 'franchise status' (i.e. whether it's a James Bond or Twilight movie), can predict the opening weekend box office takings with 94 per cent accuracy. To predict within one week out from a film's opening, Google uses search volume for a film's title rather than its trailer and combines it with data such as theater counts to make predictions that are 92 per cent accurate. Big decision: According to Google's research, moviegoers consult 13 sources before deciding which movie they're going to go and see . 'In the seven-day window prior to a film's release date, if a film receives 250,000 search queries more than a similar film, the film with more queries is likely to perform up to $4.3 million better during opening weekend,' Chen writes. 'When looking at search ad click volume, if a film has 20,000 more paid clicks than a similar film, it is expected to bring in up to $7.5 million more during opening weekend.' And the blog post seems to show that deciding to see a film on a whim is a thing of the past for most people. According to research conducted by Google, a moviegoer will consult 13 sources before making a decision to see a film, and film searches on Google were up 56 per cent from 2011 to 2012. Leaving a trail: Google searches for movie trailers are a surprisingly accurate predictor of box-office success . The search giant has also developed a formula that can predict how movies will perform at the box office the week after their opening weekend with 90 per cent accuracy by analyzing paid ad clicks rather than search statistics. 'Our hypothesis is that once a film has opened, search ad clicks are a strong indicator of intent to purchase a ticket whereas the intent associated with a search query is more varied (i.e., undecided moviegoers searching for reviews),' writes Chen. Hit: Several studios passed on The Great Gatsby, which insiders predicted would bomb. It went on to become a huge success, and is expected to take in more than $330 million worldwide, a figure Google's new system could possibly have predicted . So how well does the system work? According to Wired, Google's system could have predicted the Channing Tatum stripper flick Magic Mike was going to be a big success. Warner Bros was hoping for $15-20 million on the film's opening weekend, but it ended up grossing $39 million. Google's model would have predicted $40 million. 'Ultimately, it is this online engagement that gives us tangible insight into intent, arming movie marketers with actionable data in their never-ending quest to quantify â€˜movie magic,â€™' Chen writes. It's not yet clear what these new predictive powers mean for movie-goers, but movie marketers will definitely be paying close attention.","Google says it can predict box-office takings with 94 per cent accuracy four weeks before a movie's opening weekend .

"By . Emma Innes . People are more likely to die at Christmas than at any other time of the year, a study shows. U.S. researchers examined death certificates and discovered that people have the highest chance of death on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day. They found this to be true of people who died of natural causes including circulatory problems, respiratory disease and cancer. People are more likely to die at Christmas than at any other time of year - and the figures hold true for all age groups except children . The researchers, from the University of California, San Diego, say the figures hold true for people of all ages, except for children, CNN reports. A study conducted in Britain this year also revealed people taken to hospital as an emergency on Christmas Day are more likely to die than they would be on other days, including weekends. The researchers, led by David Phillips, a professor of sociology, do not know exactly why people are more likely to die over Christmas. However, there are many theories. Some believe it could be because people experience more stress and, sometimes, more sadness at Christmas. Andrew Meacham, an obituary writer, told CNN: ‘We are always getting a slew of obits this time of year. I noticed this happened pretty regularly so I did call around to funeral directors to see if they believed there was an uptick too. People are most likely to die on Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year's Day . ‘I've written many stories about a spouse or a partner dying and then you see the remaining partner die within hours or days or weeks or months. To me there seems to be a correlation between body and mind here.’ Dr Phillips studied deaths among people with Alzheimer’s. He found there were more cardiac-associated deaths during the Christmas holidays and believes this could be triggered by stress in people with dementia who tend to be distressed by changes to routine. In a bid to look for other explanations . for the increased festive death rate, Dr Phillips decided to investigate . whether cold weather was to blame. Researchers believe the most likely explanation for the increase in death rates at Christmas is reduced access to healthcare . To his surprise, he discovered the increase in cardiac-related deaths at Christmas is lower in cold U.S states bordering Canada than in those that border the Gulf of Mexico. The team then decided to look at whether festive eating and drinking was responsible. But they also had to discount this theory as deaths among hospital inpatients also went up even though their diet and alcohol consumption is regulated. The researchers were also surprised to find that the number of suicides is lowest in December and that homicide rates also drop. As a result, Dr Phillips believes the real reason for the peak in deaths is related to the availability of healthcare. He believes some people put off visiting a doctor during the festivities and that some hospitals have fewer staff at Christmas, increasing the death risk. He bases this theory on the fact that the increase in death rates is particularly significant in patients admitted to trauma centres as emergencies. He told CNN: ‘For those deaths, the spike was even sharper. Those are the cases where seconds make a difference and you may see a real difference between the response of a junior and senior member of staff.’ The news comes just days after experts at New York University revealed the number of people suffering from heart problems increases at Christmas. They say the number of both fatal and nonfatal heart attacks increases, as does the number of people suffering from irregular heartbeats, CBS News reports. This trend could be caused by stress, cold weather or overindulgence, they speculate.","Highest death rates are on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day .

"By . Patricia Kane . and Marc Horne . A further eight people were yesterday confirmed to be suffering from Legionnaire’s disease as the deadly outbreak continued to take its toll. It means 36 people have now been struck down by the bug – which has already caused the death of one man – with a further 44 in Edinburgh waiting for test results confirming whether they are also infected with the waterborne virus. Of the 80 confirmed and suspected cases, 15 are in intensive care and 27 are in general wards. A further 16 cases are being treated in the community and a number of people have already been discharged from hospital. Scroll down for video . Checks: An Edinburgh distillery yesterday, one of the possible sources of the Legionnaires disease outbreak . The new figures came as experts warned of a fresh wave of outbreaks. They blame cutbacks on health inspectors, coupled with recession-hit companies neglecting safety measures, for creating the ideal conditions for potentially lethal bacteria to thrive. One leading Legionnaire’s expert claimed firms were deliberately falsifying safety logs and said the practice could have devastating consequences. Public health consultant David Harper said outbreak prevention measures had slipped to dangerous levels and were not policed as rigorously as they should be. He said: ‘Local environmental health officers have been cut back, which means we may see more outbreaks of Legionnaire’s. When times are tight, maintenance is one of the first things to be cut. This goes right across the board – at hospitals, hotels and any facility which has water systems, air-conditioning or cooling towers. ‘Businesses are ticking boxes and saying they are doing all these checks, but in reality not all of them are. They are gambling with peoples’ lives.’ The source of the Edinburgh outbreak has yet to be identified but health authorities believe the bacteria found its way into one of 16 cooling towers in the south-west of the city. The towers, thought to be responsible for the worst outbreak of its kind for 30 years, have all now been chemically treated. The first case of the disease was discovered last Tuesday. The victims range in age from 33 to 76, with men more affected than women. The only link between them is an association with south-west Edinburgh. Last night, a Health and Safety Executive spokesman said: ‘We have maintained the broad number of inspectors and other staff over the past five years. It is wrong to claim numbers have  been significantly reduced.’ Yesterday, Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: ‘The risk to the public remains low.  I want to stress this bacteria is not passed on person to person or by drinking water.’ A whisky distillery last night found . itself at the centre of the Legionnaires’ disease outbreak after failing . safety checks on a cooling tower. The North British Distillery Company was yesterday served with an Improvement Notice by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The watchdog found the firm’s tower had not been properly treated with chemicals to kill bacteria, including legionella. Deadly: A conceptual image of Legionella Pneumophila bacteria, which causes Legionnaires' Disease . Scotland's health secretary said the number of cases could still rise, . despite a chemical clean-up of the industrial site thought to be . responsible. An HSE statement said the improvement notice does not mean the tower concerned is where the outbreak originated. The firm has already taken all three of its cooling towers at the site out of operation. Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon has said it is 'not always possible to conclusively determine the precise source of an outbreak'. The dead man has been named locally as . Robert Air, 56, from the Seafield area of Edinburgh, who had reportedly . been working as a labourer on a building site in Gorgie before becoming . unwell. Another . 14 patients are critically ill in intensive care following the . outbreak, with 28 cases confirmed and 46 suspected. Ten people have now been discharged from hospital. It can take up to two weeks for people to show symptoms after being infected with the disease. The potentially fatal infection could spread up to 44 square . miles from the source, affecting tens of thousands of people. Two patients are being treated outside of the NHS Lothian area - in the Highlands and in the North of England. Ms Sturgeon said: 'I want to stress that, although these patients are being treated elsewhere, they are considered part of the south-west Edinburgh outbreak. They have had association with the affected area. Outbreak: A man in his 50s has died and 15 people are in a critical condition after an outbreak of Legionnaires' at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary . 'I would hope that over the next few days those investigations will start to deliver more specific answers on where the source of the outbreak might be.' Legionnaires’ is a potentially fatal lung infection caused by the Legionella bacteria. It is caught by breathing in contaminated water droplets and cannot be spread from person to person. Scottish health authorities believe the bacteria may have found their way into one of several cooling towers in the south-west of Edinburgh. The tower then emitted a cloud of vapour with the bacteria in the tiny water droplets. The outbreak is believed to be the worst of its kind to hit Scotland for 30 years. Most of the victims diagnosed so far are men aged from their mid-thirties to mid-eighties, mainly living in the Dalry, Gorgie and Saughton areas in the south-west of the city. All those affected are men and women aged between 33 and 74. A spokesman from the North British Distillery in Edinburgh said: 'Our thoughts are clearly with the families of those affected by this situation. 'The . North British Distillery is actively working with the relevant . authorities on the matter and supporting their ongoing inquiries to . ascertain the source of the Legionella bacteria. A map showing the location of the Legionnaires' disease outbreak . 'Industrial . cooling towers are only one potential source of infection, and the . North British Distillery is one of a number of sites in the area with . industrial cooling towers. 'The . site has been inspected and nothing of concern was found. However, we . are awaiting the results of the analysis of the samples taken by . Edinburgh City Council Environmental Health Department. 'We wish to reassure the local community that we will comply fully with any guidance issued by the relevant agencies.' Ms Sturgeon said 16 cooling towers . identified as possible sources of the outbreak were chemically treated . last week and a fresh round of chemical treatment is under way in the . capital. She said: ‘No link has been identified . between these patients other than a general association with the . affected area in the south-west of Edinburgh. 'What . that does is underline the view that the source of this infection is an . outdoor community source and not an indoor-specific source, such as… a . spa in a hotel. Dr . Duncan McCormick, chairman of NHS Lothian’s incident management team . said: 'We’re doing everything we can in terms of early diagnosis, . appropriate treatment and intensive care, but I think we can’t rule out . any further deaths at this stage.' Legionnaires’ is three times more common in men than women and mostly affects the . over 50s. The elderly, smokers, and those with cancer, diabetes and . kidney disease are also at higher risk. Legionnaires' disease is a potentially fatal lung infection caused by the bacteria legionella. The bacteria is commonly found in any freshwater areas but can sometimes find its way into artificial water supply systems. It is contracted when small droplets of contaminated water in the air are breathed in, but is not spread from person to person. The elderly, smokers, diabetes sufferers, those with kidney disease and cancer patients are most at risk, and men are three times more likely to contract the disease than women. Symptoms . of the disease include headaches, muscle pain, high fever, chills, a . persistent cough, shortness of breath, chest pains and sometimes . vomiting and diarrhoea. About half of those who contract the disease experience changes to their mental state, such as confusion. Symptoms can start between two and 14 days after exposure. The disease is treated by intravenous antibiotics. Around 10% of people victims will die from arising complications. Large . buildings such as hotels, hospitals and museums are more vulnerable to . contamination because they have larger, more complex water supply . systems, which can let the contamination spread quickly. Initial . symptoms include muscle pain, a fever, a persistent cough, chest pains . and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea. Although it can be treated by . antibiotics, about one in ten patients will die. Once it has infected your lungs, . Legionnaires' causes a persistent cough and the coughing up of mucus . or possibly blood followed by chest pains, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea. Around half of those with the disease risk changes to their mental state, and may find themselves confused. It . is so called because it was identified at a hotel hosting a convention . of the American Legion veterans organisation in Philadelphia in 1976. 'I would like to express my sincere condolences to the family of the patient who died,' said Dr McCormick. 'I would urge anyone who develops symptoms of Legionnaires' disease to contact NHS 24 or their GP. 'People who fall into certain risk groups, these are males who are adults, who have an alcohol, drinking habit and have an underlying illness such as diabetes, or heart disease or lung disease - these people are at greater risk. 'These people should be very much aware that if they start feeling symptoms of flu-like illness, together with diarrhoea, cough and confusion, they should be consulting their GP or NHS 24 as soon as possible.' The first case was identified on Monday May 28, and since then the numbers have soared. Dr McCormick said there was no threat to the city's public water supply. 'The public water supply in Edinburgh is extremely closely monitored and in addition it's not possible to contract Legionnaires' disease through drinking water. 'It's contracted through the inhalation of water vapour in the form of an aerosol and that doesn't and that doesn't happen through drinking water supplies.'

"By . Pete Jenson . Barcelona legend Johan Cruyff has branded the club’s record signing Neymar ‘a problem’ the day after president Josep Maria Bartomeu pledged to improve Lionel Messi’s contract and make him the world’s top earner. 'The problem that Barca have now is Neymar,' said the former Holland star. 'He is a great player, that is not in question but you cannot sign a 21-year-old and pay him more than players who have won everything there is to win. No-one is God when they are just 21 years old.' The comments will further embarrass Barcelona who have long maintained that Neymar’s salary is below that of other established stars. Problem child: Neymar (centre) in training with Barca team-mates Dani Alves (left) and Lionel Messi . God delusion: Neymar is being paid more than other Barcelona stars, claims former boss Johan Cruyff . Not the big star: Neymar (right) will never be the main man at Barcelona while they still have Messi . In the thick of it: Cruyff says Barca's decision to pay Neymar (centre) so well could lead to things going 'wrong' Ever since Neymar joined the club in the summer there have been whispers that the €40m sum paid to his parents company N&N was a way of paying the Brazilian a higher wage while avoiding upsetting the dressing room. Cruyff’s comments, made in Kuala Lumpur at the Laureus awards, will sow the seeds of doubt again among the club’s supporters. Neymar’s contract guarantees him a wage of just under €11m a year well below the €17m that Messi earns and on a par with Barcelona’s second tier of top earners such as Andres Iniesta and Xavi. But he also received an €8.5m signing on fee and if the €40m paid to N&N is divided over the five years of his contract his take home pay takes him close to Messi and well beyond Barca's Spain internationals who, as Cruyff points out, have won everything in the game. Cruyff added: 'When you already have the best player in the world a player of just 21 years cannot be the big star – with 26 maybe but not at 21. It is a shame because Neymar is a great player  but if the situation continues like this things could go wrong.' Focal point: Messi is Barcelona's star man, highest earner and record goalscorer . Leveller: Neymar's earnings are on a par with those of Barca legends Andres Iniesta (left) and Xavi . Cruyff, one of Barcelona’s greatest ever players who also managed their 'Dream Team' side that won the European Cup at Wembley in 1992, rarely holds back when asked about his former club and even more so since falling out with Sandro Rosell, the club’s president for most of this season until he stepped down. Rosell even stripped Cruyff of an honorary president title bestowed on him by another former president Joan Laporta. He has also stopped going to the Nou Camp since Rosell replaced Laporta in 2010. Cruyff famously said of Neymar when the club signed him: 'You cannot have two captains on one boat' hinting a possible clashes ahead between Brazil’s No 10 and Barca’s No 10 Messi. Cruyff also spoke about the decision of Pep Guardiola to leave Barcelona. He said: 'Pep left Barca because the directors were interfering with his decisions.' Legend: Cruyff played and managed Barcelona, leading their 'Dream Team' to the 1992 European Cup .","You can't buy a 21-year-old and pay him more than winners - Johan Cruyff .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Australian film company has halted preproduction of its upcoming film 'Deep Water' because of eerie similarities the plot has to the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight 370. The action horror feature, from Arclight Films, tells the story of a China-bound flight that mysteriously crashes in a remote stretch of ocean. The survivors then have to fend off hungry sharks as 'the plane is starting to sink into a bottomless abyss.' 'Out of sensitivity to the Malaysia flight situation, we've decided to put it on pause for now,' Arclight Films managing director Gary Hamilton told The Hollywood Reporter Monday. Tragedy: The Malaysian Airlines flight has been missing for two weeks now (stock image of a Malaysian Airlines plane) but we now know its final destination was the Indian Ocean . The news comes as Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told a press conference new analysis suggested the flight ended in the southern Indian Ocean, and that all those on board are now dead. The creepily similar film plot had been promoted with the tagline: 'Survivors of a plane crash face terror beyond reckoning as the plane is starting to sink into a bottomless abyss and soon discover they're surrounded by the deadliest natural born killers on earth.' It's not the first time Alister Grierson, the film's director, has had a project scuppered by real-life disasters. Two weeks before the 2011 release of his best known film Sanctum, about an underwater cave diving expedition gone wrong, Australia was hit by disastrous floods. The Queensland-based filmmaker said he couldn't deny the strange timing between his project and the real-life drama of MH3L0. But despite saying it was 'mysterious,' he insists that his film is vastly different. Cinematic coincidences: Australian filmmaker Alister Grierson is directing Deep Water, pictured at Tropfest LA in 2012 . Flashback film: (L - R) Alister Grierson, James Cameron and Andrew Wight on the set of Sanctum in 2011 . Sanctum scares: A scene from Alister Grierson's underwater thriller . On Sunday, before it was confirmed . the plane crashed into the Indian Ocean, he told MailOnline: 'The . similarities and timing is interesting and I can see why anecdotally the . two things link up, it's a tricky thing. 'But . in simple terms, Deep Water is about an accident that happens on an . airplane which goes down in the ocean, and the survivors trying to stay . alive afterwards. 'It's . more complicated than that as there are villains and sharks, but it's a . fun action/adventure with thrills and spills and scares.' Grierson . and Australian company Arclight Films began pre-production on Deep . Water at Village Roadshow Studios in Queensland weeks before the . real-life incident. It is . unclear when preproduction will resume on the film, but it will be at . least two years before the movie makes it to cinemas. Grierson's . first big budget feature Sanctum - produced by Avatar filmmaker James . Cameron - was two weeks out from release when Queensland and Northern . New South Wales were hit by devastating floods in 2011. Grief: A relative of one of the Chinese passengers aboard the Malaysia Airlines, MH370 collapses in grief after being told of the latest news in Beijing, China, Monday . Tears: A relative of passengers on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 cries as he walks out of a hotel hall at after hearing the news that the plane plunged into Indian Ocean and that none on board survived . 'The floods came through and destroyed whole areas, with people losing their lives,' he said. 'We had this weird situation where we were about to release a film where there's flooding and people drown. It was strange territory.' Grierson said Deep Water was likely to be a co-production with China, who also worked with the same Australian crew on kitsch shark thriller Bait with Sharni Vinson and Julian McMahon. 'We've nicknamed it Bait 2 because there's a lot of the same crew and even themes, but it's a stand alone story,' he said of Deep Water. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 vanished from civilian radar screens less than an hour after take-off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing with 239 people on board on March 8. No confirmed sighting of the plane has been made since, but much debris has been found in remote waters off Australia which might be part of the missing plane. Relatives of passengers in Beijing had been called to a hotel near the airport to hear the prime minister's press conference Monday, and some 50 of them gathered there. Afterward, they filed out of a conference room in heart-wrenching grief.","The action horror film, from Arclight Films, tells the story of a China-bound flight that mysteriously crashes in a remote stretch of ocean .

"A gang of drug smugglers have been jailed after they were caught with heroin worth £306 million concealed in vegetables and bed linen. The international drugs ring planned to flood UK streets with the drug, imported from Pakistan, in one of the largest ever drug smuggling plots uncovered in the UK. The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) traced the criminal network to the West Midlands and spent months gathering intelligence on suspected members - which included a husband and wife team -  in 2009. Heroin seized from a Midlands based gang who have been successfully prosecuted after being found with £300million of drugs - some of which are seen here concealed in food packages . Cash seized from the gang. The international drugs ring planned to flood UK streets with the drug, imported from Pakistan, in one of the largest ever drug smuggling plots ever uncovered in the UK . Kingpin Mohammed Farooq, 47, was caught  after a massive 263kg . load of heroin was traced to a warehouse he owned. His wife Catherine Farooq was sentenced to nine months for money laundering offences . The three-year operation, called Project No Deal, intercepted the  £26 million 1,036 kg of heroin - which held a street value of £306 million. It is one of the largest ever drug smuggling plots ever uncovered in the UK. The intelligence-led operation started in June 2009 when a shipment of heroin hidden inside bags of chilli powder was intercepted at Leeds Bradford Airport after it arrived from Pakistan. Officials managed to use the address information - even though it was false - to identify suspects in the West Midlands and Pakistan. Further enquiries led to a series of seizures of increasingly large amounts as the gang became more audacious in their smuggling attempts. Officers and border officials swooped in seven different locations at Felixstowe, Tilbury Docks and addresses across Birmingham between April 2011 and August 2012. Customs officers found heroin stashed inside shipments of vegetables, bed-linen and even in deliveries of sanitary products.

Heroin was concealed in card packaging. Customs officers also found heroin stashed inside shipments of vegetables, bed-linen and even in deliveries of sanitary products . Further raids then found drugs cash stashed inside cars after meetings between key players were caught on secret cameras. Eventually, kingpin Mohammed Farooq, 47, was caught alongside two Pakistani associates after SOCA traced a massive 263kg load of heroin to a warehouse he owned. Farooq, from Solihull, West Midlands., was jailed for 29 years in June after he admitted organising the 263 kilo shipment of heroin. He was captured on undercover surveillance footage handing boxes of cash to couriers in supermarket car parks. Wife Catherine Farooq, 51, the final member of the ring, was jailed at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday for money laundering. The court heard Farooq had used the drugs money to fund his daughters' private school education - and his wife had splashed out on a new Mercedes.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The makers of a new doll which refuses to eat have been accused of encouraging anorexia. When attempts are made to feed her, she shakes her head and keeps her mouth firmly shut – a scenario familiar to new mothers who struggle to get babies to eat. The feeding spoon contains a magnet that triggers an internal switch, closing the £34.99 doll’s mouth. But the ‘mother’ can get her to eat by turning the spoon over and pressing it against her lips. Eating disorder charities are calling for a doll - called 'Nenuco Won't Eat' - which turns its head away when offered food to be banned. They are worried it could normalise eating disorders . The Nenuco Won’t Eat doll’s Spanish makers say she is designed to help children understand the frustrations of normal life and how important it is to eat properly. However, campaigners claim there is a more dangerous subliminal message that will encourage girls to refuse food. Chris Leaman, policy manager at YoungMinds, said: ‘This doll sends the wrong message to children and encourages them to think that refusing food is normal behaviour. ‘We would not want children to be influenced by this, and are concerned that it promotes unhealthy attitudes towards food and body image.’ The 'Nenuco Won't Eat' doll has a magnet in her spoon which means her head turns away when a child tries to feed her. Campaigners say the sale of the doll is 'deeply worrying' A spokesperson for the eating disorder charity B-eat said: 'Research shows young children are becoming aware of body image at a much earlier age. A doll that refuses food is hardly a good example to them' The charity Beat, which campaigns on anorexia and bulimia, said: ‘Research shows young children are becoming aware of body image at a much earlier age. A doll that refuses food is hardly a good example to them.’ Siobhan Freegard, of the parenting site Netmums, said: ‘Anything which encourages young children to think not eating is normal is deeply worrying.’ And Anita Worcester, of eating disorder charity SWEDA, said: ‘Promoting what is basically an anorexic doll seems unhealthy.’ Nikki Jeffery, UK marketing director for Nenuco’s maker, Famosa, claimed the doll represents the real difficulties mothers face when feeding a baby. The toy company, Famosa, says the toy just represents play in real life as babies often reject their food . She said: ‘We know that children often don’t eat what they are given, but the doll is designed to show them how important it is that they eat properly. ‘It is about enabling young girls to have the closest experience possible to being a “real mum”. We are not encouraging children not to eat. ‘The idea is that the child understands the doll is being mischievous and that the child encourages the doll to eat the food, just as a parent does with their child.’ She said the doll would teach children the value of eating healthily as its food included  fruit and vegetables. The British Toy & Hobby Association has named the Nenuco doll among 37 new toys that it expects to sell well this year.","'Nenuco Won't Eat' has a magnet in her spoon which makes her head turn away when a child tries to feed her - it will go on sale in the UK in February .

"By . Ruth Styles . The British might have a reputation for prim propriety but it seems that wasn't always the case, as a recently rediscovered cache of 18th century tiles reveals. Kept under lock and key since their discovery in a Fleet Street pub in 1962, the reliefs offer an explicit peek into Georgian bedrooms and prove that far from being strait-laced, the 18th century was a considerably more risque place than previously thought. Now the tiles are to go on display for the first time during a late night event at the Museum of London, although, as you might expect, it's strictly for those aged over 18. Piquant: One of the set of eight erotic 18th century tiles discovered after a fire in a Fleet Street pub . Late London: City of Seduction gives visitors a peek into the bedrooms of London's historical inhabitants, with Romans rituals, ancient erotic sculpture and Georgian prostitutes among the stars of the show. But even the raciest of Romans would find it hard to outdo the 18th century tiles, most of which offer viewers graphic depictions of couples enthusiastically indulging in the pleasures of the flesh. 'Erotic material – such as these relief . tiles – was widely available in the 18th century, if one knew where to . go and had the means with which to acquire it,' explains curator, Jackie Keily. 'For obvious reasons these tiles are not . normally out on public display so we are pleased to show the complete . set for the first time ever - just down the road from where they were discovered.' Fragments: Some of the tiles are broken and in poor condition because of the fire . Raunchy: Although some show a moment of post-coital bliss, many more are extremely explicit . She is history's most famous lesbian, best known for a series of lyrical poems that speak of her mostly unrequited love for other women. Now papyrus fragments discovered in the head of a mummy by Oxford University papyrologist Dr Dirk Obbink have revealed that the poet was a devoted sister as well an ardent lover. One causing particular excitement among historians is a poem that speaks of her love for brother Charaxos who is gently teased for being in love with an Egyptian slave girl. Touchingly, it also includes an exhortation to pray to [goddess] Hera 'so that Charaxos may return here, with his ship intact; for the rest let us leave it all to the gods, for often calm quickly follows a great storm.' Whether Charaxos did indeed make it home to his sister, frustratingly, remains unknown. Unlike Keily, the descendants of the Georgian tile makers didn't appear to be quite so appreciative, with the reliefs hidden by layers of obscuring plaster during the Victorian period. The tiles only came to light again after a fire at the Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub in 1962 but, thanks to their explicit content, were swiftly bundled into a vault by the team that found them. Now they have been uncovered once more and are currently being studied by historians, who believe that the tiles, found in an upstairs room, were used to decorate a fireplace. Quite why the fireplace required such racy decoration is more of a mystery, although researchers believe they could have been intended for temporary use, put up when the room was being used as a brothel or as the haunt of a men's drinking club. 'London has always been a hotbed for the seductive, saucy and down-right sordid,' added Keily. 'From the bath-houses of Roman Londinium and the stews of medieval Bankside to the Restoration Rakes and Soho’s swinging sixties, this city has long traded in the currency of sex.'

"By . Charles Sale . Plans are at an advanced stage for a League of Nations football competition within Europe to spice up the much-maligned friendly dates in the international calendar. The UEFA initiative, which is expected to win support from the 54 national associations, will be further developed at the annual Congress in Kazakhstan next month, with a start date scheduled for 2018 after the World Cup in Russia. The latest developments come as the FA recognise a need for quality friendlies to fill Wembley in the wake of such an uninspiring Euro 2016 fixture list that practically guarantees qualification. New ideas: UEFA president Michel Platini is supporting a new European League of Nations tournament . Challenge: England would face European countries in a league format before progressing to a knockout competition under the plans . Big draw: Facing some of Europe's top countries could help the FA avoid empty seats at Wembley, like there were against Moldova last year . The proposed League of Nations format, to be played over a two-year period with semi-finals and final in a year without a major championship, would see the 54 countries split into various leagues offering promotion, relegation and wild card places at Euro 2020. England would expect to be in the top division of 12 countries, split into four groups of three to provide a last-four for the knockout stages. On top of that set of matches, the FA would still have occasional friendly dates on which to play showcase opponents, such as the Republic of Ireland or Brazil. Option: The FA will still be able to host top tier friendlies, like the one played against the Republic of Ireland in May 2013 .

"By . Simon Walters . The controversy over Tony Blair’s friendship with Wendi Deng intensified last night as new evidence emerged of the closeness between them. The Mail on Sunday can disclose that a cache of emails to and from Ms Deng and the former Prime Minister was discovered when her ex-husband Rupert Murdoch filed for divorce. And the newspaper can also reveal how: . Just good friends: Tony Blair and  Wendi Deng are understood to have exchanged several emails, fuelling the suspicions of her media tycoon husband Rupert Murdioch . The newspaper revealed in December that . Ms Deng’s crush on Mr Blair was laid bare in a note in which she . confessed how attractive she found him, and that the pair had stayed . overnight at one of Mr Murdoch’s homes without his knowledge. We were also first to reveal how a furious Mr Murdoch ended all ties with his former friend and ally, Mr Blair, because he felt ‘betrayed.’ Further details of lovestruck Ms Deng’s note, in which she praised Mr Blair’s ‘good body’, his ‘really, really good legs’ and even his ‘butt’ were revealed by US magazine Vanity Fair last week. It said staff at Mr Murdoch’s home in Carmel, California, were uneasy when Mr Blair arrived and tried to find her. Ms Deng revealed in in a note in how attractive she found Mr Blair,  praising his 'good body', 'good legs' and even his 'butt' The . magazine claimed they told him Ms Deng had gone to the master bedroom, . but ‘by the time they could tell her, Mr Blair was looking for her, they . found Mr Blair walking into the master bedroom and closing the door . behind him’. On another occasion ‘they were feeding each other during dinner, which made the staff uncomfortable’. Mr Blair's friends deny he had an affair with Ms Deng and the Mail on Sunday has no evidence to the contrary . Mr Blair’s allies have been rocked by . the ‘Wendi and Tony’ headlines. One female former Labour Minister and . ally confronted him: ‘Tony, look me in the eyes and tell me you did not . have an affair with Wendi.’ Mr Blair insisted he had not. Others have claimed he did not reciprocate Ms Deng’s feelings but was simply trying to help her cope with her marriage problems. Mr Blair’s friends deny he had an affair with Ms Deng and the Mail on Sunday has no evidence to the contrary. But . 82-year-old Mr Murdoch, chairman of the News Corp media giant, claims . he was deceived – and the furore shows no sign of going away. The . Mail on Sunday has been told that the warm feelings of Ms Deng for Mr . Blair were clear in a cache of emails sent from her newscorp.com email . address to Mr Blair and others. Mr Blair replied to many of them. An . ally of Mr Blair said: ‘Ms Deng was assisting with Mr Blair’s . Foundation and he is godfather to one of her children. It would be odd . if they didn’t exchange emails. They were not intimate.’ The . 300 pages of emails – some of which were sent between Ms Deng and Mr . Blair – came to light, along with her private note praising his ‘good . body,’ as Mr Murdoch was preparing for the divorce proceedings that led . to the end of their marriage in November last year. It . was a ‘careless’ email by Ms Deng, thought to have been sent to the . wrong person by mistake, that is believed to have given away her . meetings with Mr Blair in the first place. Apart: Wendi Deng and Rupert Murdoch. Mr Blair's friends deny he had an affair with Ms Deng . One of the reasons for the continuing . controversy is that fresh details of meetings all over the world . between Mr Blair and Ms Deng, without Mr Murdoch’s knowledge, keep . coming to light. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that they met late in the . evening at 5 Hertford Street on August 2, 2012. The club is in a former red-light . district where Tory peer Jeffrey Archer first became entangled in the . scandal that led to him being jailed when he met prostitute Monica . Coghlan in 1986, but is now one of the most expensive parts of London. It is run by Robin Birley, aristo- cratic son of socialite Lady Annabel Goldsmith, and Mark Birley, who founded Annabel’s. Prince . William and the Duchess of Cambridge are frequent visitors at  5 . Hertford Street, whose members include George Clooney, Tom Cruise and . Kate Moss. A source at the London office of Mr Murdoch’s News UK, which owns The Sun and The Times, said: ‘We know they met at Loulou’s.’ Together: Mr Blair and Ms Deng are understood to have met on a yacht in the Mediterranean owned by music mogul David Geffen . Mr Blair and Ms Deng are also said to have met at Rupert Murdoch's London apartment, left, and at his California ranch, right . Asked . yesterday if Mr Blair had met Ms Deng at Loulou’s, a source close to Mr . Blair initially dismissed it with contempt, saying ‘not only did they . not meet there, he has never even heard of it’. Asked . later if he had met Ms Deng at 5 Hertford Street, the source confirmed . Mr Blair was there. ‘He did meet her for a drink along with other . people. He was there for half an hour and then left to go for dinner.’ This newspaper has been told Mr Blair . and Ms Deng met at Mr Murdoch’s apartment in London’s Westminster twice . in four days in June 2012. Weekend stay at Murdoch’s ranch in Carmel, California, April 27, 2012. Fly from Carmel to Los Angeles together next day. Met at Carlyle Hotel, New York. Date unknown. Met at Murdoch’s London apartment. June 21 and 24, 2012*. Met on yacht in Mediterranean owned by music mogul David Geffen. Date unknown. Met at 5 Hertford St Club, London, August 2, 2012. Weekend stay in Carmel, October 7, 2012. Met at Murdoch’s home in Los Angeles. Date unknown. *Blair’s friends say he saw Ms Deng at Murdoch’s apartment only once. A . source said Mr Blair met Ms Deng there on June 21 and June 24. ‘He was . seen coming and going at unexpected times,’ said the source. Mr Murdoch was not in Britain at the time and was unaware his wife was meeting Mr Blair at their London home. When he was Prime Minister, Mr Blair was a frequent guest at cocktail parties hosted by the newspaper tycoon at the apartment. Mr Blair’s friends admitted he . visited Ms Deng at the Murdochs’ home for lunch. But they said unnamed . ‘other people’ were present and were adamant he had visited her there . only once. As . well as revealing her longing for Mr Blair, the note by Ms Deng found . at Mr Murdoch’s Carmel home is believed to have revealed a further . intriguing insight into her feelings – and worries. It . is said to show Ms Deng believed that Catherine Rimmer, Mr Blair’s . ‘strategy director’ at Tony Blair Associates, and who worked for him in . No  10, warned him he would get ‘in trouble’ with her. The note reportedly states: . ‘Katherine (sic) Rimmer does not like me because she does not want Tony . gets (sic) in trouble with me.’ Friends . of Mr Murdoch had told him they feared Ms Deng was meeting Mr Blair . behind his back. He was not convinced until Ms Deng spent a weekend with . Mr Blair at Mr Murdoch’s California ranch, according to UK-based . friends of Mr Murdoch. They . say she made two errors. First, Mr Murdoch’s staff reported their . concerns after seeing Mr Blair seek out Ms Deng in her bedroom in April . 2012. Their worries reached Mr Murdoch, who asked them what they had . seen. The . next day Ms Deng and Mr Blair flew together from Carmel to Los Angeles . for a dinner hosted by Mr Murdoch to raise money for Mr Blair’s . foundation. Rumours: Friends of Mr Murdoch had told him they feared Ms Deng was meeting Mr Blair behind his back . Prime Minister Tony Blair and wife Cherie stand outside 10 Downing Street 2006 . When Mr Murdoch found out about it later, he is said to have regarded it as ‘the straw that broke the camel’s back’. Crucially, when Ms Deng and Mr Blair spent another weekend in Carmel in October, 2012, she had told her husband she was meeting a girlfriend. But the girlfriend left early and let it slip when she bumped into friends of Mr Murdoch. Mr Blair arrived next day. To make matters worse, Mr Murdoch was at a family gathering, attending to his dying 103-year-old mother. The following week he spoke to Mr Blair, who reportedly omitted to say he had met with Ms Deng at Carmel.","Blair met Ms Deng at Mr Murdoch's London home when he was abroad .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . UPDATED: . 14:14 EST, 8 February 2012 . It is one of the rarest conditions in the world, affecting just one in a billion people. However, in an incredible quirk of fate, three sisters have all been blighted by a condition known as werewolf syndrome - where they are covered from head to foot in thick hair. Savita, 23, Monisha, 18, and 16-year-old Savitri Sangli, who live in a small village near Pune, central India, inherited the hypertrichosis universalis disorder from their father. All three struggle to keep the condition under control with cream and hope they one day might eventually be able to pay for specialist laser treatment to rid them of their excessive hair. Brave (from left to right): The lives of Savita, Monish and Savitri Sangli have been blighted by one of the rarest conditions in the world - werewolf syndrome . Genetic: The girls stand in front of a picture of their father with their mother (front middle) and two of their other sisters who are unaffected by the disorder . Despite the devastating effects of the syndrome, the siblings still dream of a day when they might get married. Hypertrichosis universalis is a genetic mutation, in which cells that normally switch off hair growth in unusual areas, like the eyelids and forehead, are left switched on. It means the girls have had abnormal hair growth on their bodies and even their faces, affecting their eyebrows, nose and giving them appearance of having a beard. They must use a special cream every day - otherwise the hair will quickly return. The youngest sister Savitri is still virtually covered in hair. One in a billion: The sisters, pictured with their mother, inherited the condition from their father . Documentary filmmaker Sneh Gupta is planning make a film of the girls in a bid to help their dream of becoming almost hair free - with the eventual aim of finding marriage . The girl's mother Anita Sambhaji Raut has six daughters in total with only three having werewolf syndrome. The condition was passed down by the girls' father, who Anita was forced to marry aged at the age of 12. Because theirs was an arranged marriage and she did not lay eyes on him until the wedding day, she had no idea he was suffering from the condition himself. Anita and her daughters are now desperate to fund laser surgery that will help to finally remove the curse of excess hair and allow the girls to lead normal lives. Hopes: The girls dream of marriage and a day when they might be hair-free . In their small village near Pune, central . India, the Sangli have little prospects for marriage and the eldest . Savita sometimes gets sent home from work when her hair begins to show. Laser surgery would cost 350,000 Indian rupees - or Â£4,500 per girl - but the family are not wealthy enough to be able to afford it. Now documentary filmmaker Sneh Gupta is planning make a film of the girls in a bid to help their dream of becoming almost hair free - with the eventual aim of finding marriage. Mum Anita, 40, said her husband - who died in 2007 and whose portrait hangs in the family home - also suffered from werewolf syndrome. Anita was being looked after by her uncle and auntie as her parents had passed away and they told her if she didn't marry this man they would kill her off. She said: 'It was only on the day of my marriage that I discovered what he was, (he) was hairy on his face, ears and body, that's when I found out. 'I was very young, I didn't know what kind of boy he was, he scared the hell out of me when he arrived at the altar. He's the groom, I am the bride, I had no idea what all that meant. 'I was only 12 when they forced me into marriage, and if you don't agree to marriage as a girl they will kill you off. 'I asked my mother-in-law why my daughters were born like this and she told me because their father is like this, at the time (as a baby) my daughter had little hairs all over her face. 'When I used to take her (Savita) out as a child, they used to shout here comes the beast, the witch, that's what they said. 'They keep her at work now for 10 to 15 days, and then after that they ask her to leave as soon as the hair starts showing through, that's what they do. 'I tell people this is the type of girl she is, hair grows on her face, she has to apply medicine, we must be honest with everybody.' In the village society a woman does not have much prospects if she is not married and mum Anita explained she was still trying to get her daughters a man. She said: 'If a good proposal comes in, I'll get her married. If nothing comes in she'll have to work and survive. As long as I am living I have to keep trying.' Eldest daughter Savita, who now using a cream to try and combat her hair growth, said: 'When I used to go to school the boys and the girls would shout, 'hairy face', 'horrible looking', 'don't sit next to her', that's how they behaved. 'Marriage is not an option for us, it's not likely to happen, who is going to marry us when hair keeps growing on our faces.'","The Sangli sisters are covered from head to foot in thick hair .

The latest breakout star to emerge from this year’s tournament – or certainly an internet sensation who blew up for a couple of hours on Sunday – was Alex Chang, the Stanford Cardinal's wildly-enthusiastic cowbell player. A showman par excellence, Alex beat his bell as if he life depended upon it and no doubt in some small way contributed to his team’s impressive 60-57 win over Kansas in the third round of the 2014 NCAA Tournament.

The over-enthusiastic cowbell player who stole the limelight during Sunday's March Madness game between the Cardinal and Kansas has been revealed to be Alex Chang, a Stanford student . His demented cowbell hammering certainly caught the eye of the TV cameras on more than one occasion, and the trance-like state and intensity in his eyes that he achieved left many on social media sites to wonder if perhaps he might have been under the influence of something. Sports writer Rick Bozich of the Louisville News at one point tweeted that security at the Scottrade Center had told him they had had an issue with band members sneaking in booze, but he later tweeted that security had done a u-turn on those claims and confirmed that no alcohol had been confiscated. Cowbell guy's impressive moves quickly inspired a host of online chattered and at least two Twitter handles - @StanfordCowbell and @cowbellstanford.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . The woman due to become the first African American businesswoman to be boss of a Fortune 500 company has said more women will soon be taking over top jobs in the U.S. Xerox chief executive Ursula Burns said the business world would be foolish to ignore the large pool of talented women in America's colleges. 'A tidal wave is coming', the 50-year-old told the audience at a Prism awards fundraiser for New York University. Optimistic: Ursula Burns, the first African American woman to lead a Fortune 500 company, expects more women to take on leading business roles . Ms Burns, who is credited with helping her predecessor save Xerox, said executives would be 'silly . business people' if they did not draw on the pool of talented women in college soon. She . added that the most successful corporations would hire women and minorities, according to  Huffington Post Business. Although Ms Burns, who was seventh on Fortune's list of the 50 most powerful women in business last year, believes women will play an even greater role in the business world, she despaired at the lack of women in high-level executive positions. Basically there's been no progress,' Ms Burns, who rose to the top role at Xerox after starting as an intern, said. Her speech at the luncheon comes amid renewed debate about women's progress in business. In March Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said women were being held back by things that were out of their control. The author of Lean In added that hard work, help and ambition could redress the lack of businesswomen in top positions. Those remarks came as Yahoo! chief executive Marissa Mayer banned working from home, even though she has a nursery next to her office to help her balance being a mother and a boss. Historic: Anne Mulcachy with President Obama and Google's chief executive Eric Schmidt. Her handover to Ursula Burns will be the first woman-to-woman Fortune 500 succession . Ms Burns reflected Ms Sandberg's advice, and encouraged career women to 'be . the best at what you do and work hard', adding that young people often believe it will be easy to reach the top of their profession. 'They think you can get to this end just participating nine to five,' she said. A strong work ethic was instilled in . Ms Burns from an early age. She was raised in a housing project in . Manhattan by a single mother who worked as a cleaner and ironed clothes . to help pay for her daughter's education, . Her efforts were rewarded when Ms Burns graduated from Columbia with a masters in mechanical engineering. Despite their hard work and ambition, women still face . barriers to progressing in their careers when it comes to pay and promotions, making only 80 per cent of what their male counterparts earn. For example, Ms Burns is one of only 21 women who hold the title of an S&P 500 CEO. More than a third of public companies had no woman senior . officers last year, according to a survey from Catalyst. At a conference in March, however, Ms Burns told aspiring businesswomen not to have guilt trips about missing out on what their children are doing, adding it's a 'fool’s journey' to try to achieve the perfect work-life balance. She also warned against taking life too seriously, adding 'Ninety per cent of this stuff is just not that serious,' according to the Wall Street Journal. The rarity of women in top positions was highlighted when Ms Burns was offered the chief executive role at Xerox from Anne Mulcachy last month. Career advice: Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg says women are being held back . It was the first woman-to-woman handover for a Fortune 500 company and, when Ms Burns officially takes over on July 1, she will be the first African American woman in the list. Ms Burns and her predecessor cemented their success by saving Xerox. In the past five years they have halved the company's debt to $7 billion and boosted net earnings. According to CNN Money, Ms Mulcachy told her to 'figure out how to get $2 billion out' while ensuring Xerox survived to be a company our children could work at. Her lasting advice for women wanting a leading role in business however is to work for a company or industry they are passionate about.","Ursula Burns says companies would be 'silly' to not hire talented women .

"By . Daniel Martin . Almost three in four people have no confidence that David Cameron will be able to deliver on his promise to claw back powers from the EU. A poll has found that just 20 per cent think the Prime Minister can get a better deal with Brussels, while 72 per cent do not. Some 51 per cent think other members will block reforms, while 26 per cent doubt the Prime Minister's skills as a negotiator. A survey found three quarters of voters have no confidence that David Cameron will be able to deliver on his promise to claw back powers from the EU . And almost one in four suspects he wants to stay in the union even if Britain does not achieve a better deal. The findings, which come from a major piece of research commissioned by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft, cast doubt on the electoral effectiveness of Mr Cameron's pledge of an in-out referendum by 2017. Of the 20,000 people questioned, around two-thirds said other countries benefited more from the EU than the UK. Some 49 per cent thought the drawbacks of being a member outweighed the advantages - compared to 31 per cent who said the opposite, and 20 per cent who were not sure either way. The survey also suggested people had a more positive view of Russia than of the EU. The European Parliament came fourth from bottom in a league table of 27 ‘liked' countries and institutions. Only Saudi Arabia, Iran and North Korea were placed below it. Lord Ashcroft said: ‘Many like David Cameron's plan to negotiate better terms for Britain. The trouble is, three-quarters of them doubt it will work.' The European Parliament came fourth from bottom in a league table of 27 'liked' countries and institutions . Last night an important House of Lords committee called for a greater role for national parliaments in EU decision-making. The Lords EU committee demanded a new ‘green card' procedure to enable groups of national assemblies to work together to propose new EU legislation or amend existing European law. The report also says that parliaments, working together, should have the right to require proposed EU legislation to be withdrawn or substantially amended. It emerged yesterday that the European Commission is to take Britain to court over its attempts to limit benefits payments to migrants. The legal action centres on the ‘right to reside' test that European Union migrants must pass before they can claim benefits in this country. A lawsuit will be lodged ‘shortly' in the European Court of Justice, a Sunday paper was told yesterday. Another poll out last night shows that only one in ten Tories trust Nigel Farage in Europe - suggesting UKIP's threat to the Conservatives may have run its course. The poll, by YouGov and for the LBC radio station, shows there is growing support for Britain staying in the EU. Some 45 per cent want to stay in - well ahead of the 34 per cent who said we should leave. It comes ahead of this week's head-to-head debate between Mr Farage and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg on the subject of Europe.","Just 20% think PM can get a better deal with Brussels, according to poll .

"By . Associated Press . and Ryan Gorman . and Jonathan Block . The 16-year-old boy that bypassed security and managed to climb to the top of 1 World Trade Center is now saying he's sorry for the stunt that made national headlines. 'I seriously apologize to anyone who may have been insulted or felt disrespected by my actions,' Justin Casquejo said on his Twitter page Friday afternoon. 'It was not my intention to do so.' New York Police Department Chief Bill Bratton today also told reporters he was 'disappointed' by the breach. 'We’ll work very closely with the Port Authority to determine exactly what happened,' the New York Post quoted him as saying. 'I’m disappointed that it happened, certainly. We have a lot of focus on that area, but again, the focus will significantly increase as it gets closer to opening.' Daredevil: Justin Casquejo, 16, sneaked into the WTC site and spent almost two hours on the roof of the nearly completed Freedom Tower, he is pictured at right on top of a construction crane in nearby Hoboken . Fascinated: Casquejo has long been obsessed with the WTC's Freedom Tower, according to the Post . Casquejo, of nearby Weehawken, New . Jersey, was arrested at 6 a.m. Sunday and charged with misdemeanor . criminal trespass, said Joe Pentangelo, a spokesman for the Port . Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site. The . teen accessed the construction site of the nearly completed tower by . slipping through a 1-foot opening in a fence at around 4.00 a.m., . Pentangelo said. He then allegedly entered the tower by climbing . scaffolding. 'He’s a skinny kid who got through a skinny hole,' a police source told the New York Post. Casquejo is said to have taken an elevator up to the 88th floor despite not having any identification, according to the paper. He was let off at the 88th floor and hoofed it up to the 104th floor where he sneaked past a sleeping guard to access the roof. That guard has since been fired, the spokesman said, but the elevator operator was ab;e to keep his job because he is in a union. Casquejo scaled equipment on the roof to reach the 1,776-foot tall Freedom Tower's antenna. The daredevil spent two hours perched atop the city before trying to sneak his way out as the sun came up. 'He came here and he ran hog wild,' a site worker told the Post. Thrillseeker: Casquejo, pictured on a construction crane in Hoboken, appears to love sneaking into tall buildings under construction . Accused: Casquejo faces a criminal trespass charge for his WTC stunt, but appears to have gotten away with climbing a construction crane in Hoboken (right) Boisterous: Casquejo was much more talkative on Twitter than when reached by the Post . Port Authority police arrested him on the premises. His camera and cellphone were seized after authorities obtained a search warrant. Officials are still trying to piece together exactly how he was able to elude security measures implemented by agencies including the New York Police Department, Port Authority Police and private security firms. 'I walked around the construction site and figured out how to access the Freedom Tower rooftop,' Casquejo said in court, according to documents cited by the paper. The investigation was continuing into whether the teen may have entered other parts of the building. He later tweeted the word 'inspired,' in reference to his now-infamous climb to the top of one of the tallest buildings in the world. He wasn't nearly as talkative when reached by the post. 'Ha ha, oh yeah, that. Right. I would really love to talk to you guys because I have a lot that I want to say about it,' said the teen. 'I was told that I just can’t [talk] without permission.' 'We take security and these types of infractions very seriously and will prosecute violators,' Joe Dunne, chief security officer for the Port Authority, said in a statement. 'We continue to reassess our security posture at the site and are constantly working to make this site as secure as possible.'","Justin Casquejo, 16, says on his Twitter page that he 'seriously apologies to anyone who may have been insulted or felt disrespected .

"By . Wills Robinson . Dramatic footage of an alleged teenage terrorist testing a Molotov cocktail behind a leisure centre was shown at the Old Bailey today. Neo-Nazi Michael Piggin, 18, asked friends to film him hurling the homemade bomb at a wall where he had spray-painted the phrase 'no more mosques', the court heard. Jurors were shown the mobile phone clip of the incident, where Piggin faces the camera while grasping the flaming bomb made from a wine bottle. Scroll down for video . Preparation: Michael Piggin, 18, prepares to throw the alleged Molotov cocktail against the wall while his friends filmed him on a mobile phone . Flames: The Old Bailey saw him bring his arm back and launch the homemade explosive, which was put together using a wine bottle . Another video shows the defendant spraying the anti-Islamic message on the leisure centre wall in Loughborough. Piggin is on trial accused of plotting a 'new Columbine' massacre at a school and college, as well as formulating attacks on mosques, local shops, a cinema and council offices. He kept detailed notes of his plans in a Che Guevara notebook adorned with racist epithets and Nazi symbols, the court heard. Police found a Swastika flag on his bedroom wall and a cache of weapons including homemade pipe bombs, a crossbow, air rifles, and knifes next to his bed among books on notorious mass murderers. One of Piggin's old classmates said he alienated fellow pupils by spouting racial abuse and declaring his support for the British National Party and the IRA. The Asian teenager, now 17, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said they were friends when they first met in September 2011, but fell out in May 2012. Gesture: After throwing the suspected bomb and setting part of the wall alight, he turns to the camera . Organisation: The accused teenager is said to have plotted a Columbine-style massacre at a school and college . 'I heard him call me a P*ki a few times, and then I got told through other friends that were in some of his lessons that he was quite a big racist', he said. 'He said offensive things to teachers and he was uncontrollable. When it was the beginning of exams, he was saying I wasn't British because my family wasn't born here.' The witness described an incident when Piggin flew into a rage while they were playing football and he was accidentally tripped up. 'He got quite wound up and he just started going really mad, raging at the person', he said. 'He started calling him names and threatening him. Graffiti: More footage shows the defendant allegedly spraying 'No more mosques' on the wall . Suspected: He wrote the anti-Islamic slogans on the wall next to a footpath behind a leisure centre in Loughborough . Apparel: Wearing a cap and carrying a shoulder bag, the court saw the defendant stepping back from the wall . 'After that, he would say to people ""You better watch your back, I've got guns"".' He added: 'People got really sick of him, because he is really racist.' The boy said Piggin smashed a display cabinet in school when another pupil questioned the deployment of British troops. 'At the beginning he seemed like a nice, decent guy', he said. 'But then throughout the year he acted up a bit, saying he supported certain types of terrorist groups like the IRA and the EDL. And he was quite racist as well.' The court heard how Piggin detailed the plans in a notebook with Che Guevara on the front . 'He was in quite a few of my lessons, and I saw him change in character. 'I didn't think he was a right person to hang around with so I stopped speaking to him.' Jurors have been shown Piggin's alleged 'hit list' from his notebook, including teachers, pupils, and other people he held a grudge against. Prosecutor Max Hill QC told the court this witness 'appears at number two on that list'. Piggin's notes also include his plans for 'Project New Columbine' and his ideas for his Urban Revolutionary Army. Piggin and two other 18-year-old boys, who cannot be named, have already admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bombs. But Piggin, an Asperger's sufferer, denies he was planning a terrorist attack. Piggin denies possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism and possession of a document or a record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism on or before 19 February 2013.

"By . Harriet Arkell . Trusted nanny: Former nanny Sarah Hallcup, 27 . A nanny employed by the youngest son of the Duke of Wellington was today convicted of helping her boyfriend burgle their country home. Lord Christopher Wellesley and his wife Lady Emma Wellesley entrusted Sarah Hallcup, 27, with the keys to their rambling home during the four years she looked after their children. But when the family returned from a four-week holiday in Scotland to find their home had been ransacked and treasures worth £30,000 stolen, police discovered Hallcup's boyfriend Neal Akhtar was the culprit. Goods taken from the Wellesleys' Top Hill House in Heckfield, Hampshire, included busts of the first Duke of Wellington, who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, a Cartier clock, a fob watch, paintings and rocking horses. The raid was said to have left the couple, who have three children, 'very distressed'. Prosecutor Edward Phillips told Winchester Crown Court that the small annexe where Hallcup lived had also been ransacked. A bathroom window had been left open . at each property as a decoy, but officers grew suspicious because there . was no sign of disturbance, suggesting the burglar had not had to force . his way in. Detectives . later discovered the fingerprints of Hallcup's boyfriend Neal Akhtar, . 27, in the house, and when they arrested him, officers found pictures of . goods stolen on his mobile phone and camera. Contact had also been made to an antiques dealer about selling some of the goods. Hallcup was arrested after she admitted being in a relationship with Akhtar. The police found her phone had been . used to search for the value of a Cartier clock, and texts between her . and Akhtar involved talk of 'robbing the mansion'. Prosecutor Mr Phillips added: 'Sarah Hallcup had the utmost trust of Lord and Lady Wellesley. 'They trusted her and they also trusted her with their property. Ransacked: The court heard how treasures worth £30,000 had been taken from the Wellesleys' home . 'In order for her to deny any involvement in the burglary, the prosecution would suggest it was staged to make it appear that the burglary had occurred on July 30 on the return of Lord Wellesley. 'It is clear that Neal Akhtar could not commit that burglary without the agreement of Sarah Hallcup. 'She alone had access to the house.' Akhtar, from Reading, Berks, admitted burglary, and another man, Scott Allaway, 27, also from Reading, admitted handling stolen goods. Allaway told police he went to the house to help Akhtar transport the stolen items. Hallcup denied conspiracy to burgle between July 26 and July 30 last year but was today convicted by a jury. 'Distressed': Lord Christopher Wellesley . She was released on bail while Akhtar and Allaway were remanded in custody.  All three defendants will be sentenced later this year. Speaking after conviction, Edward Phillips, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Hallcup had 'grossly breached' the trust of her employer. He said: 'Sarah Hallcup grossly breached the trust that her employer had placed in her by conspiring with her boyfriend to burgle the home where she had been the nanny for four years. 'This burglary left Lord Wellesley and his family very distressed. 'Sarah Hallcup was someone they had trusted for many years to look after their three young children and their house. 'Yet she was complicit in stealing items from them, some of which she knew had a great sentimental value for their owners.' He added: 'The prosecution case was that while Lord Wellesley was on four-week-holiday with his family she conspired with her recent boyfriend, Neal Akhtar, to burgle Top Hill House. 'As she was trusted, Lord Wellesley had given her the keys to his house that allowed her access to the house via the utility room. 'She had clear instructions to keep the keys in order to get access to the utilities in the kitchen and she was only authorised to leave the keys out for the Lord if he so requested. 'The jury at Winchester Crown Court heard how her boyfriend's fingerprints were found on Lord Wellesley's property. 'The telephone evidence made it clear that Hallcup had conspired with her boyfriend to burgle her employer. 'Lord Wellesley made the shocking discovery that a number of valuable items had been stolen when he came back from holiday. 'We would like to thank Lord Wellesley and the other witnesses in this case who gave statements and helped to secure these convictions. 'We hope now that Lord Wellesley and his family will be able to move on with their lives.'","Sarah Hallcup, 27, had been nanny to aristocrat's children for four years .

"By . Tara Brady . Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter believes he is being spied on and prefers to send a good old fashioned letter to world leaders instead of emails. The 89-year-old said it was likely that his emails are monitored by the National Security Agency. The Democrat said: 'As a matter of fact, you know, I have felt that my own communications are probably monitored. Scroll down for video . Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter believes he is being spied on and prefers to send a good old . fashioned letter to world leaders instead of emails . 'And when I want to communicate with a foreign leader privately, I type or write a letter myself, put it in the post office, and mail it,' he told NBC's Meet the Press. He added: 'Because I believe if I send an email it will be monitored.' Asked about disclosures of sweeping U.S. surveillance activities, Carter, who served as president from 1977 to 1981, said the practice 'has been extremely liberalised and, I think, abused by our own intelligence agencies.' Since former employee Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the National Security Agency's surveillence programme last year, President Obama has proposed changes into how the agency collects its data. Snowden claims he tried 10 times to make formal complaints about government spy programmes but no-one listened to him.

Snowden previously worked for the CIA before joining the NSA in Hawaii as a contractor from Booz Allen Hamilton. It was from there that he leaked information about the extent of NSA spying programs to the press before fleeing to Hong Kong and then seeking asylum in Russia. Snowden said that no one wanted to be associated with any complaints at the NSA. During the interview Carter also said that President Obama had noy asked for his advice on how to deal with Russia's annexing of Crimea. When asked if he had been contacted by the president, Carter said: 'Unfortunately the answer is no.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Michael Piggin is said to have plotted a Columbine-style massacre at his school . A teenage neo-Nazi accused of plotting a Columbine-style massacre at his school downloaded the Mujahideen Poisons Handbook to his mobile phone, the Old Bailey heard. Michael Piggin, 18, stored weapons and terrorist manuals in his room as he drew up a ‘hit list’ of pupils and teachers he wanted to attack, jurors heard. He took knives into school and showed them to fellow pupils, the court heard. Piggin allegedly planned to target two schools in his area, a mosque, cinema, university and council offices and dubbed his plans for an armed assault on his former school as ‘the new Columbine’. Jurors were told today that Piggin downloaded extremist literature onto his mobile phone before he could carry out his attack - including the Mujahideen Poisons Handbook. The book, written in English and 23 pages long, discusses the chemical formulas of various poisons and how they can be used in everyday objects such as face cream and fizzy drinks. It also tests out different poisons and their effectiveness by detailing their effects on rabbits, with one passage stating: ‘Potassium cyanide results in rabbit’s death in several minutes in all of the three different tests’. Prosecutor Gareth Patterson said the contents of the book include a whole chapter on cyanide poisoning and another on how to extract alkali poison from potatoes. Another details how to make poison tipped arrows, the court was told. The Old Bailey heard he 'planned to target two schools, a mosque, cinema, university and council offices' One section states that less than a teaspoon of sodium nitrate is ‘enough to kill a person in two to four hours, can be used in a juice and tastes like lemon’. Wearing a black Arctic Monkeys t-shirt, jeans, gold chain, and glasses, Piggin remained emotionless in the dock. A supporter of the English Defence League, Piggin allegedly kept a notebook of potential targets and plans for his attack in a notebook covered in swastika flags. The teenager also had a swastika flag above his bed and wrote essays on his hatred of Muslims. He and two other 18-year-old boys, who cannot be named, have already admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bombs. Piggin, of Loughborough, denies possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism and possession of a document or a record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism on or before 19 February 2013. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Michael Piggin, 18, accused of planning 'the new Columbine'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Jason Groves . David Cameron is 'watching what he eats', Downing Street confirmed today in the latest evidence of the slimming craze sweeping the Cabinet. With George Osborne on the 5:2 diet, Michael Gove attending an Austrian ‘fat farm’ and Eric Pickles 'no chips, no cheese' strictures, it seems half the government is tightening its belt. But the suggestion that the Prime Minister is keeping an eye on his weight appeared to be undermined today, when he was pictured buying cakes at a sale in Number 10. Prime Minister David Cameron was seen eyeing up the cakes baked by to raise money for Sport Relief during a reception at Downing Street . Downing Street insisted the PM was watching what he eats, but he appeared tempted by the cakes and biscuits on offer . Four years in power has taken its toll on the waistlines of many members of the Cabinet. A combination of stress, eating on the go and endless receptions with tempting - but high calorie - canapes means it is all too easy to pile on the pounds. Mr Cameron, who has fought an on-off battle with his weight, tucked . into low-fat options on his flight back from a trip to Tel Aviv last . week, after Number 10 asked for him to be served a selection containing . no dairy products. Aides insisted he was not following a specific dairy-free diet, but today his official spokesman confirmed the Prime Minister was trying to curb his carbs. Mr Cameron is said to be . experimenting with alternatives to standard milk, such as almond milk, . which is low in calories and fat. At a regular briefing for journalists, the spokesman was asked if the PM puts almond milk on his porridge. He replied: ‘I am tempted to say that I don’t really tuck into these kinds of stories,’ before admitting ‘there is one morsel I could offer’. He added: ‘Does the PM keep an eye on what he eats, I’m sure that’s the case but I don’t think it’s anything too strict.’ When pressed he complained that journalists were ‘making a meal of it’. Pressed again, he conceded: ‘I’ve run out of really bad puns.’ David Cameron, who has filled out since taking office in 2010, is said to be trying out dairy alternatives . Last week on a visit to Scottish Widows in Edinburgh, Mr Cameron opted for a small ham salad and fruit juice . However, Mr Cameron was later seen casting his eye over a selection of cakes on sale for charity in Downing Street. Fundraisers, including TV presenter Davina McCall, were invited to Number 10 to mark Sport Relief. Schoolchildren baked cakes to sell to raise money for the charity, with the PM appeared unable to resist. Questions about the Prime Minister's dieting emerged after photograph's showed Mr Osborne’s fashionable 5:2 diet appears to be paying off, with the Chancellor looking noticeably leaner on the breakfast TV sofa yesterday. The Chancellor is said to have shed significant amounts of weight by cutting his calorie intake to just 500 on two days of the week. It follows his decision to start wearing a hi-tech Jawbone wristband to keep track of his fitness regime and sleep patterns. Squeezed middle? Osborne appeared slimmed down at the BBC yesterday, compared to jogging in 2013 (right) He looked far from svelte when he was pictured eating a Byron burger to get through the spending review . Mr Cameron’s efforts to keep in trim have been hampered by a knee injury, which has curtailed his jogging. Although he has been able to take up the activity again recently, it is still only at a relatively low level. Aides . said he had been ‘pounding the streets’ in Jerusalem last week, but . sources later revealed his activity had been confined to a short . 10-minute jog. The Prime Minister has spoken several times about his battle with middle-age spread. In . an interview with Now magazine in 2012 he was asked about his New . Year’s resolutions and replied: ‘Probably to lose a bit of weight, I . think. That’s the key one for me.’ But last summer he was photographed looking portly and sunburned on a beach while on holiday in Cornwall. At . the Conservative Party conference in October he joked that the . unflattering photos of him wearing only a Mickey Mouse towel did at . least demonstrate he had the ‘stomach for the fight’. In an interview in January this year the Prime Minister described himself as a ‘middle-aged, slightly overweight man’. He said he tried to go jogging once or twice a week in parks near Downing Street, and was rarely recognised. ‘The . thing about the parks in London is its mostly full of tourists who just . see some middle-aged slightly overweight man trotting past them and . they just think it’s another one,’ he said. Flight . records from last week confirm that a special diet was requested for Mr . Cameron on his trip to Israel and Palestine. He was listed as the . flight’s ‘VVIP’, with a note to say he should be served ‘non-dairy’ meals. His main meal on the five-hour flight from Tel Aviv to London was salmon served with salad. He was also served with a snack of tacos with chicken and vegetables. Asked about the meal selection, a Downing Street spokesman said he had ‘no comment’ to make. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, meanwhile, has taken up kickboxing in a bid to get fit and slim down for the general election, and it emerged that the Education Secretary Michael Gove spent a week at an Austrian ‘fat farm’ popular with celebrities. The £2,500 stay is said to have helped him shed two stone.","Downing Street confirms David Cameron is watching what he eats .

"By . James  Nye . Cincinnati Reds pitcher Aroldis Chapman suffered a sickening injury on Wednesday night when he was hit by a line drive in Surprise, Arizona during a Spring training game. The closer broke bones above his left eye and nose when the ball which he pitched at 99mph came hurtling back towards his face - the latest frightening injury to a pitcher struck in the head by a batted ball. Chapman was undergoing further testing at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center, where he was set to spend the night for observation, according to a statement from the Reds. Scroll Down for Video . Pitch: Reds closer Ardolis Chapman fires off a 99mph pitch towards  Salvador Perez of the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday night in Arizona . Manager Bryan Price said Chapman was conscious and talking as he was taken off the field during Cincinnati's spring training game against the Kansas City Royals. The exhibition was called after an 8-minute delay with Kansas City leading 6-3. 'Not good,' Price said. 'He left the field on a stretcher, took a line drive just above his left eye is what it looks like â€” a contusion, a laceration, and certainly needs to be taken to the hospital and checked. 'We've got Tomas Vera, an assistant trainer, is going to be with him. And then we'll get our updates from there.' Watch Video Here: . Return: Perez rifles back the ball towards Chapman (left) who is still following through on his pitch at the stadium in Surprise, Arizona and (right) the ball can be seen as a white speck just above Chapman's left arm about to hit his face . Contact: The ball ricochets off Chapman's face at speed - causing him to raise his left hand to his face in agony . The hard-throwing left-hander was struck by Salvador Perez's liner with two outs in the sixth inning â€” the pitch was clocked at 99 mph. Chapman crumbled to the ground, face down, his legs flailing. The ball caromed into the third base dugout. Medical personnel, including Royals Dr. Vincent Key, rushed onto the field. Blood could be seen on the mound. Perez put his hands on his helmet before reaching first base. He immediately went to the mound where players from both teams huddled as the 26-year-old Cuban reliever was being attended to in an eerily silent stadium. An ambulance's siren could be heard in the background while Chapman was loaded onto the stretcher. 'It was an absolute bullet that Sal hit,' Royals manager Ned Yost said. 'It's just a real sickening feeling for everybody.' Collapse: Chapman falls to the ground as concerned team mates and umpires dash over to help him as he writhes in agony on the floor . Players from both teams knelt, some bowing their heads and crossing themselves in prayer. Chapman was taken to Banner Del E. Webb Medical Center in Sun City. He was then transferred to Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center. Perez appeared to be in tears as he left the field, and first baseman Eric Hosmer hugged him. Perez quickly left the clubhouse without speaking to reporters. Hosmer hit a line drive off the head of Tampa Bay's Alex Cobb last June. Cobb sustained a concussion. Playing right field, Reds teammate Jay Bruce heard the ball hit Chapman. 'It was one of the more frightening and non-fun moments I've been a part of on the baseball field,' he said. After Chapman was driven off to the waiting ambulance, Price and Yost met with the umpires. 'It was really a mutual agreement,' crew chief Chris Guccione said. 'Players were rattled. The staff was rattled. The umpires were rattled. We figured it was best, along with both teams in agreement, that the game should end.' Prayers: Cincinnati Reds players and Kansas City Royals players kneel as Chapman receives urgent medical care on the field on Wednesday night . Urgent attention: Cincinnati Reds closer Aroldis Chapman suffered facial fractures after being struck in the face by a line drive during a spring training game on Wednesday . Recovery: Chapman was carried off on a stretcher after a terrifying moment when he was hit by a liner off the bat of Kansas City Royals catcher Salvador Perez in the sixth inning of Wednesday night's game in Surprise, Arizona . Emergency: The Reds said Chapman was taken to a local hospital, where tests indicated fractures above his left eye and nose before he was transferred to another facility to undergo further testing . Father: Chapman's father, (in the striped sweater) who was in the stands, rushed onto the field and players from both teams took a knee as Chapman was immobilized, placed on a stretcher and carried off by a medical cart . Applause: The Cuban-born Chapman was kept overnight for observation, and the game was suspended following the incident . Treatment: Cincinnati Reds closer Aroldis Chapman is taken off the field after being hit by a line drive Wednesday night March 19, 2014, after another frightening incident involving a pitcher being struck by a batted ball . Yost said neither he nor his players wanted to keep playing. Price felt the same way. 'You can't find it in your heart to go out there and play,' he said. Oakland pitcher Brandon McCarthy, who had emergency surgery after he was struck in the head by a line drive in September 2012, urged caution in a post on Twitter. 'all reporting at this point means zilch, until he gets a scan,' he said in a tweet. Chapman, who throws a 100 mph fastball, had walked four Royals in the inning before being injured. The two-time All-Star had 38 saves for the Reds last season. When reporters walked into the Royals clubhouse, third baseman Mike Moustakas asked a team official to request that they leave. Cincinnati Reds relief pitcher Aroldis Chapman throws in the third inning of a spring training baseball game against the Cleveland Indians in Goodyear, Arizona in this 2012 file photo . 'No one wants to talk,' Moustakas said. In January, Major League Baseball approved a protective cap for pitchers following several terrifying scenes similar to this one in the last few years, including Toronto's J.A. Happ, who sustained a skull fracture. The heavier and bigger hats were available for testing during spring training on a voluntary basis, but the cap apparently would not have helped Chapman in this case. 'I know this isn't uncommon as we would like it to be, but it was frightening,' Price said. 'Certainly frightening.'","Cincinnati Reds closer Aroldis Chapman suffered fractures to bones in his nose and left eye while taking a line drive to the face on Wednesday night .

"By . Emma Innes . Short bouts of moderate exercise - such as walking or steady cycling - can improve energy levels among people suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS), research suggests. Patients said they had an improved quality of life and suffered less fatigue after taking part in exercise sessions lasting just a few minutes at a time. In a 12-week programme, 60 patients undertook short periods of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise in 18 supervised and 18 home-based exercise sessions. People with MS said they had an improved quality of life and suffered less fatigue after taking part in exercise sessions lasting just a few minutes at a time . The sessions involved five three-minute bouts of exercise, with two minutes of rest in between each bout. As the study progressed, patients were encouraged to exercise for longer - such as five four-minute bouts - or to take shorter rest periods. Many patients also did muscle strengthening and balance exercises and were taught cognitive behavioural techniques, such as setting goals and understanding the benefits of exercise. The results were compared with 60 MS patients receiving usual NHS care who were not told to take specific exercise. Researchers found that people on the moderate-intensity programme reported improved fatigue levels and had better quality of life for up to nine months. People said they had improved emotional wellbeing, social function and better overall quality of life compared with the other group. An MRI scan showing multiple sclerosis in the brain. Researchers found that people on the moderate-intensity programme reported improved fatigue levels and had better quality of life for up to nine months . The study, carried out by Professor John Saxton from the University of East Anglia, also found the programme to be cost effective compared with usual NHS care. Funded by the MS Society, the research was published in the Multiple Sclerosis Journal. Professor Saxton said: ‘It seems illogical to turn to exercise as a way of managing fatigue, but the results showed that a pragmatic programme based on short bouts of moderate-intensity exercise can really help people improve symptoms and quality of life. ‘Exercise can also offer social interaction - walking with friends, bike riding with the family - there's a lot to gain.’ Ed Holloway, head of care and services research at the MS Society, said: ‘We're delighted that this study has shown how a well-designed exercise programme can be a cost-effective way to help manage some of the symptoms of MS. ‘Fatigue in MS is an incredibly common but troubling symptom that can hugely affect an individual's quality of life. For many people with MS this programme could be a cost effective treatment option.’ More than 100,000 people in the UK have MS, which is usually diagnosed when people are in their 20s and 30s. MS affects almost three times more women than men.","Short bouts of moderate exercise improve quality of life and reduce fatigue .

"By . Alex Greig . Parents have complained after Detroit eighth graders were asked to write an essay about whether they would prefer to be a slave or a factory worker during the Industrial Revolution. Kaya James, an eighth grade student at Novi Middle School, said she was offended at the question posed during her history class. She was also concerned that most of her classmates said they'd rather be slaves than factory workers. Offended: Kaya James, 13, was upset when asked in class to write an essay about whether she'd prefer to be a slave or a factory worker . 'I was disappointed because what slaves went through is really humongous and for them to say they would rather be a slave is really disappointing' Kaya told ABC7. Kaya came home upset, offended and nearly in tears, her mother Tina James told CBS Detroit. James said she doesn't think students are being taught enough about the true history of slavery if they're willing to make such a choice. 'I just don't think they are being taught slavery in its entirety,' Tina James told ABC7. Seeking change: Tina James has met with the school district superintendent and the school principal to discuss the way Novi Middle School teaches history to its students . 'If you fully understood the psychological aspects of being a slave you would never choose it.' Tina James called her daughter's school after speaking with other parents who shared her concerns about the controversial essay question. The Novi Community Schools superintendent Steve Matthews said the question was based on on a Michigan Content Expection, in which eighth grade studets are asked to explain the differences between the lives of free black people, free white people and enslaved people but has now been removed from the curriculum. 'What it suggests to me as a district, we need to do a better job of helping our students understand the devastating impacts of slavery back in the 1800s,' said Matthews. Change: Novi Middle School has removed the question from its curriculum and is seeking to restructure the way slavery is taught . Keen student: Kaya James says history is her favorite subject . He added that the school is looking at changing the way the history of slavery in the U.S. is being taught at the school. Kaya James, who hopes to be an attorney when she's older, said she's glad that she raised the issue and hopes her input will help change the way history is taught at her school. 'I don't want anything to be centered around my teacher because I really like him and I think he's a great teacher,' she told ABC7.  'The school is a great school... it's just that question is really offensive and it's disappointing what the responses were.' Superintendent Matthews says he plans to include Tina James in discussions about how to change the school's history curriculum. 'We have children that have impressionable minds and I want to make sure that the impressions that we leave on them are accurate and truthful and honest,' James said.","Kaya James' history teacher asked her eighth grade class to write an essay about whether they'd rather be a slave or a factory worker .

"By . Mia De Graaf . This is the terrifying moment a climber hung from a wall of ice inches away from a powerful waterfall. Defying the elements, Will Gadd hiked himself up 460 feet of icicles at Helmcken Falls in British Columbia, Canada. The stunning climb is believed to be the toughest mixed route in the world. Perilous: Will Gadd, 47, was hauling himself up a wall of icicles for eight hours in Helmcken Falls, British Columbia, Canada, after three weeks of planning . Hanging next to a waterfall, Mr Gadd, a prolific climber from Alberta, Canada, had to use all his strength to keep on track - but broke his index finger in the process . After three weeks of planning, it took prolific climber Will Gadd more than eight hours to complete. Temperatures dropped to as low as -35C during the climb, which would be regarded as severe in Antarctica. But the region is notorious for fluctuating conditions, and Mr Gadd, 47, spent the entire expedition in fear of the icicles melting.[related] . During the extreme climb, he broke his index finger, and one of the three other members in his team dislocated her rib. Had it been any other climb in the world, he would have stopped for safety reasons. Will, from Alberta, Canada, said: 'Even for experienced ice and mixed climbers, Helmcken Falls is really off the charts - it's a new frontier. Precarious: As the area is notorious for fluctuating conditions, Mr Gadd spent the expedition in fear of the icicles melting . The waterfall is so powerful it has formed a dent in the ground, and snow continued to fall throughout the trip . During the trip, one of Mr Gadd's three teammates dislocated her rib. But they ploughed through as this climb is 'a new frontier' The climb is widely regarded as the hardest mixed-terrain trek. Mr Gadd said it was the climb of his life and the team managed to do it safely . 'Every new frontier in sports is exciting and often dangerous. Helmcken is certainly both. 'One of the unique problems at Helmcken Falls is that it sits right on the border between the ocean air mass and the interior air mass, so the temperatures can either be frigid, or warm up well above freezing in a matter of hours. 'For me, it was the climb of my life, and I'm really happy my team and I did it safely. Helmcken Falls sits on the border between land and ocean, meaning the temperatures can rise or drop within a matter of hours . Temperatures dropped to -35C, which would be regarded as severe in Antarctica. Mr Gadd admitted he wouldn't do the climb again . At the top: When he reached the top, Mr Gadd had a well-earned rest in the Helmcken Falls lodge . 'One of the really cool things about Helmcken is that you can see it clearly from a visitor's viewpoint. 'It's one of the most amazing places in the world, and yet you can sleep in a real bed at the Helmcken Falls Lodge at night. 'I just don't want to climb there anymore - it's never good to trust your luck too much.' Using a couple of wires, a pick and an axe, these daredevils threw caution to the wind by heaving themselves up perilous cliffs of ice. Albert Leichtfried and Benedikt Purner beamed at cameras as their feet dangled hundreds of feet above a life-threatening drop. The usually fast-flowing waterfalls in the Dolomites in Italy and the far north of Norway were frozen solid when temperatures in those areas plummeted below -20C. Jaw-dropping: Using very basic pickaxes, these two men fearlessly hauled their way up an ice cliff in Norway . With life-threatening rocks below, Albert Leichtfried (left) led the way and Bededikt Purner followed up climb in Norway for their Men On Wire project here and in Italy . The climbers had to dodge deadly hanging ice curtains made of dagger-like icicles as they ascended. They hiked up icefalls ranging from 300ft to 659ft tall. The highest frozen waterfall the pair climbed was Storfossen in Norway which is taller than London’s iconic Gherkin skyscraper. Most of the waterfalls climbed by the pair were categorised ‘grade five’, meaning they were near-vertical, requiring sustained climbing and offering little rest.

Mr Leichtfried, 37, of Innsbruck, Austria said: 'Climbing on frozen water must appear quite mad to someone who is not an experienced climber. But I have been ice climbing for 20 years so it seems normal to me. 'Ice climbing carries with it more risks than climbing indoors or even up rocks. Climbing in cold weather is more dangerous as there are different alpine risks, like avalanches. 'With ice you can tell when it is dangerous by the colour. If it is bright white then it is safe to climb, but a blue colour indicates the ice is less stable.' 'Climbing on frozen water must appear quite mad to someone who is not an experienced climber. But I have been ice climbing for 20 years so it seems normal to me,' Mr Leitchfeld said. Klaus Kranebitter, who was taking photos of their expedition, said they were concentrating intently but had a lot of fun wildly hanging of cliffs . Mountain guide Klaus Kranebitter, 40, took photographs of the pair during their daring ascent. He said: 'Albert and Benedikt have a lot of respect for the ice. They knew the risks. 'They were concentrating deeply and a little bit nervous, which helped keep them aware of the dangers.'

"By . Chris Parsons . and Allan Hall . With his Clark Gable moustache and dishevelled wartime appearance, he may look like any other prisoner of war. Leslie Bull's story, however, is much more remarkable, as the British Flight Lieutenant was the real prisoner upon which Steve McQueen's character is based in The Great Escape. While the iconic scene from the 1963 film shows McQueen's PoW Virgil Hilts attempting to cross the Swiss border on a motorbike, the reality saw British officer Bull imprisoned by the Gestapo and murdered on Hitler's orders. Great Escapee: In a picture taken by German Criminal Police, Leslie Bull, the British Flight Lieutenant on which Steve McQueen's character was based, is photographed 24 hours before his death . In the U.S. war film The Great Escape, . McQueen's character attempts to jump a barbed wire fence at the Swiss . border before his capture and return to a Nazi PoW camp in World War . Two. The details for the film's inspiration emerged yesterday as a memorial for Flight Lieutenant Bull and the three fellow escapers who were killed alongside him was unveiled in the Czech town of Most. Unpublished images have since been found by an historian of Briton Bull, along with his other three failed escapees Squadron Leader John 'Willy' Williams, RAF Flight Officer Jerzy Mondschein and RAAF Flight Lieutenant Reginald 'Rusty' Kierath. Movie interpretation: The Steve McQueen filmed showed his character attempt to escape the camp on a motorbike, though this was added for artistic license . Inspiration: Just like in the 1963 film (pictured) Lt Bull and fellow escapees pulled on a rope outside the camp to alert other PoWs about the nearby patrolling guard . In the pictures taken shortly after their capture, the four men all stare defiantly at the camera. Just 24 hours later they had all been executed. Their plight does have a certain resemblance with the events of the Great Escape, however. Research has shown that, just like in the American film, Bull sneaks out of the tunnel near the Stalag Luft III, trailing a rope so he can signal to men behind him when the patrolling guard is at a safe distance. Guy Walters, an historian writing a book about the Great Escape, found the pictures in a war crimes file at the National Archives at Kew. Executed: RAAF Flight Lieutenant Reginald 'Rusty' Kierath, Squadron Leader John 'Willy' Williams,  and RAF Flight Officer Jerzy Mondschein were also captured and killed along with Bull by the Gestapo . Memorial: The details for the film's inspiration emerged yesterday as a memorial for Flight Lieutenant Bull and the three fellow escapers who were killed alongside him was unveiled in the Czech town of Most . He said: 'The photos show them as terrified men. 'Within 24 hours of these photos being taken they were lying with bullet holes in their heads.' Sombre: Soldiers flank a memorial gravestone .

Relatives of these . four men will then follow in their footsteps, retracing their famous . escape from Stalag Luft III to the Czechoslovakian border, where they . were intercepted and then secretly murdered on Hitler's orders. The . memorial — which brings the four men’s families together for the first . time — is the initiative of a Czech commercial pilot, Michal Holý, who . says the men should have been recognized 'many years ago.' 'This was deliberate, calculated murder, not death on a battlefield in war,' he said. After the war, tribunals in Hamburg and Nuremburg sentenced 20 former Gestapo officers to death for the murders and jailed many more. However, no one was ever located or brought to justice for the execution of the four pilots near Most.","British Flight Lieutenant Leslie Bull was captured by Gestapo after trying to flee PoW camp in 1944 .

"By . Fiona Macrae . They have pulled the wool over our eyes for years. Goats are far from silly billies. Scientists say that despite their reputation for being slow-witted, goats are actually rather intelligent. In one particular task, they were quicker on the uptake than chimps. Smart: Research from Queen Mary University, London, found goats learn fast and have excellent memories . The Queen Mary University of London researchers hope the finding will lead to improved conditions on farms and in sanctuaries. The scientists began by training a dozen goats use a two-step process to retrieve a pasta and grass treat encased in a plastic box with an extendable lever. First, they had to use their lips to grab a string that pulled out the lever. They then used their muzzle to nudge the lever upwards and release the food. Nine of the 12 animals quickly learnt the task. Only one of the three remaining animals actually failed. Two others were disqualified for trying to use their horns rather than faces to lift the lever. Researcher Alan McElligott said: ‘The key thing is that this was a two-step process. It wasn’t a case of just pressing a button and food coming out. ‘It requires a level of reasoning and understanding.’ On average, it took the goats 12 attempts to learn how to access the food - meaning they were quicker on the uptake than chimps using similar equipment. Tasks: The scientists began by training a dozen goats use a two-step process to retrieve a pasta and grass treat encased in a plastic box with an extendable lever . Dr McElligott said that while this doesn’t mean they are more intelligent than chimps overall, it was still an impressive result. Ten months later, the animals could still remember what to do - a sign of ‘excellent’ long-term memory. Dr McElligott said: ‘They remembered straight away, without any reminders or training. It was remarkable.’ The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology also revealed that the animals learnt just as quickly when left to their own devices as when they watched another goat solve the puzzle. This is important, as it is often thought that learning through mimicry is a sign of intelligence. Dr McElligott, who has previously shown that goats have ‘regional accents’ said: ‘It seems that goats are perfectly good at problem solving by themselves. ‘Our results challenge the common . misconception that goats aren’t intelligent animals - they have the . ability to learn complex tasks and remember them for a long time.’ It is thought that the abilities help the animals find food in harsh and changeable environments. Dr McEllligott only looked at goats but he suspects sheep are also more intelligent than they are given credit for. Proof . of this comes from Cambridge University research which found that Welsh . mountain sheep can map their surroundings and may even be able to plan . ahead.

"By . Katy Winter . For most women, a man overly attached to his mother is one to be avoided - but, if a new study is to be believed, it seems they may be worth sticking with. Mummy’s boys do better at work and earn more than men who have a less close relationship with their mothers in childhood, research shows. The findings come as part of an epic study by Harvard University, known as the Grant study, into what makes men happy. Men with uncaring mothers earning an average of $87,000 (about £53,230) less a year than those who are 'mummy's boys' Started in 1938 the study, which is still on-going, followed 268 male undergraduate students from youth to old age, with . evaluations taking place every two years. It is one of the longest and most detailed studies of human development in history. While the study showed that our personalities continue to change and develop well into adulthood, altering our levels of life satisfaction, one factor from our childhood did seem to persevere in affecting our adult lives. Men who were close to their mother in childhood also performed better and more efficiently later on in their careers . Men who had a close, warm relationship with their mothers were found to consistently earn more money than those who had a distant maternal bond. The salary difference was not trivial either, with men with uncaring mothers earning an average of $87,000 (about £53,230) less a year than those who are ‘mummy’s boys.’ This amount is taken from when the men were earning their peak salary, generally between the ages of 55 and 60. Additionally, men who were close to their mother in childhood also performed better and more effectively later on in their careers. A strong bond also prevented men from developing dementia in old age. Interestingly there was no such correlation with childhood relationship with the men’s fathers and their working life, salary or productivity as an adult. Instead a loving father-son bond in their youth was linked to a higher level of life satisfaction at 75 and lower levels of anxiety. Long-time director of the study George Vaillant has published a book, Triumphs of Experience, The Men of the Harvard Grant Study, explaining its vast wealth of findings. Alongside the major finding that excessive alcohol consumption was the strongest predictor of unhappiness (predicting earlier death, divorce, depression and neurosis) they also found that liberals have more sex than their conservative counterparts and that high IQ isn’t linked to higher earnings. Vaillant, who headed the research for 42 years has succinctly summed up the basic message as: ‘The seventy-five years and twenty million dollars expended on the Grant Study points … to a straightforward five-word conclusion: ‘Happiness is love. Full stop.’’","Men with a close bond to mother in childhood earn £53,230 more a year .

"By . Katy Winter . The traditional two-week annual holiday could become a thing of the past within ten years as families increasingly opt for several 'mini-breaks' instead, according to new research. A study of Britons' changing holiday habits also predicted that by 2023 the majority of the British people will travel with multiple generations of their family including parents, grandparents and children. And rather than head abroad to the sunshine, twice as many will have 'staycations' in the UK, taking an average of two or three trips each year for four days. The traditional family vacation of two weeks abroad, is often now unpractical for busy modern families . Accommodation preferences are also set to transform, with many Brits choosing to stay in unusual locations such as lighthouses and windmills. The report, which examined the holiday habits of over 10,000 people, also showed that staycations have jumped by more than 61 per cent this summer, compared to 2012. A separate study from Mintel has shown that overseas holidays have continued to fall since 2010, dropping an estimated five per cent in the last year. Recent figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) also show that travel to long-haul destinations fell by five per cent in 2012. The cost of overseas trips, and environmental issues concerned with flying, are the leading cause of the fall in Brits travelling abroad. The report also revealed that . savvy Brits are searching for better value breaks, and there is a . growing demand for interesting destinations closer to home. Charles Millward, chief executive of . luxury cottage rental firm Rural Retreats which produced the report, . said: 'More and more of us . are enjoying holidays with our extended family. The good weather this summer has seen people taking advantage of England's natural beauty spots such as The Durdle Door at Jurassic Coast, near West Lulworth in Dorset . 'Our . hectic lifestyles also mean the typical two-week trip is no longer . practical for most families, and as a result it is being phased out in . favour of the four day mini-break. 'Many families, because of university or work commitments, also find that increasingly they live apart. 'Mini-breaks . provide an opportunity for relatives to get together at short notice, . and it seems that this trend will become even more of a popular option . for holiday-goers over the next decade.' Charles added:'With the economy still fluctuating and money tight, UK travellers are increasingly swapping long-haul flights and trips aboard to favourite destinations in the UK. Rural Retreats has seen a r40 per cent increase n bookings in their converted lighthouse properties . 'The trend for staycations has been increasing year on year, and the great weather this summer has been a watershed. 'The weather has caused Brits to flock back to UK's beaches, attractions and heritage; some of the finest in all of Europe. 'This year in particular has shown that the UK can be a fantastic holiday choice, and may provide a boost to the UK tourism industry which will see many more Brits choosing to explore UK shores over the next decade rather than holiday abroad.' Charles explains: 'There has been a large increase in people holidaying in unconventional accommodation, from railway carriages, to windmills and even lighthouses. 'We've witnessed a 40 per cent increase in people staying in our lighthouse properties in the last year, with Cornwall in particular proving popular. 'The next ten years for the UK travel and tourism industry is looking increasingly healthy, with the holiday habits of Brits suggesting that in a decade's time many more of us will be content to holiday at home.'","Traditional two-week annual holiday no longer practical for many families .

"By . James Gordon . Buttercup is a duck who is now able to waddle freely like any other - thanks to a 3D-printed left foot. Buttercup was hatched at an Arlington, Tennessee, high school with his left foot turned backwards . It meant he was unable to walk or swim properly. It also caused him a lot of pain. The school contacted the Feathered Angels sanctuary, where founder Mike Garey saw the deformity and decided to do something about it. Scroll down for video... Quack happy: Buttercup the duck shows off his new (red) 3-D printed webbed foot . I beleive I can walk: Buttercup was born with a twisted left goof, but thanks to 3D printing technology, a prosthetic has been developed for him to enable him to walk and swim properly . Painful: Butterfly was born with one backward-facing foot, but a 3D printer has made her a mould for a new foot . Mr Garey Contacted NovaCopy who specialise in 3D printing. Because the foot needs to be flexible, the usual plastics used in 3D printing would not be viable. So instead, the company scanned the left foot of Buttercup's sister Minnie and printed a 3D mould which was then used to cast a silicone foot . for the lucky duck. The . new bright orange prosthetic foot and nylon sock that Buttercup wears . isn't quite as flexible the real thing but it does mean that Buttercup . can now walk and swim in way he never has been able to before. Printing the replacement foot took just over 13 hours. Chicked off:  Buttercup the duck was hatched with his left foot turned backwards and seemed destined to hobble as he waddled . The future is now: The 3D design and molding process for Buttercup the duck's new foot . Webby to wear: Thanks to cutting-edge 3D printing technology, the little duck now has a brand new webbed prosthesis . 'It's . different for him because his leg is taller than it used to be when he . just had the peg,' Garey told USA Today. 'His muscles will have to . adjust, but I'm amazed at how well he's doing right off the bat.' Mr . Garey is already discussing what the next steps will be in Buttercup’s . prosthetic work. A new scanner will allow engineers to scan the current . prosthetic, then edit its design in a computer program. He still is amazed at how well the original prosthetic has worked for Buttercup. Does this meet your approval sir? Buttercup the duck is shown his new 3D printed foot for the first time . 'There . was always the big unknown of whether or not it would work and if he . would accept it. If he didn’t like the prosthetic and wouldn’t walk on . it, it  wouldn’t have mattered how many times I changed it.' Joel . Graves, the 3-D engineer who printed the prototype for Buttercup’s . foot, said he also was amazed that the first trial of the prosthetic . worked. Mr Graves often . works on manufacturing projects, and even some medical projects. He said . 3-D printing sometimes gets a bad reputation because of the media’s . focus on the printing of weapons. 'That isn’t the point,' he says. 'The point is to help people - or even animals - improve their quality of life.' 'It’s . extraordinary to work on something that will actually benefit someone, . even if that someone is a duck,' Graves said. 'It could be a person . benefiting like this in the future.' Wobble instead of a waddle: As Buttercup grew bigger her trouble with her deformed foot became more apparent . 3D for free: With the help of NovaCopy, a 3D modelling company that donated its services, a new mould was made for a silicone foot for Buttercup . Advances in the development of 3D printers have been revolutionizing the way objects can be created. Recently, US scientists printed tiny batteries as small as a grain of sand, from interlocked stacks of miniscule electrodes. Brides in Japan are even paying to have themselves printed in 3D on their special day so they can be immortalised on their wedding day. Quackers about it: Buttercup will now be able to walk and swim properly at the Waterfowl sanctuary in Tennessee .

When it comes to tying the knot, Ron Sheppard is in illustrious company. He . is on his eighth marriage...two more than Henry VIII managed, the same . number as Elizabeth Taylor and just one fewer than Zsa Zsa Gabor. But Britain’s most married man insists his eighth wife will be his last. After all, the union with Weng Platino has already lasted nine years. Mr . Sheppard, 65, says that in 35-year-old Weng, from the Philippines, he . has finally found his true love and soulmate after searching for more . than 47 years. He was 19 when he wed his first wife, Margaret, in 1966. The marriage lasted two years and he went on to marry Jeanette, Lesley, Kathy, Sue, Usha and Wan. The . retired holiday camp entertainer, who once mentored Shane Richie, said: . ‘I have had eight mothers-in-law so I must be brave.’ Mr . Sheppard, who has eight children, 13 grandchildren and four . great-grandchildren, has now written a book on his life, which he has . called Lord Of The Wedding Rings. He says he always believed marriage was for life but never felt ‘true love’ in his first seven marriage. ‘I . genuinely believe there is the right person for everyone out there,’ said Mr Sheppard, of Martock, Somerset. ‘Unfortunately for me, it took . me longer than most to find the right one. ‘When . I first married I was very young and naive. With some of the marriages, . I just didn’t have the heart to say no and it seemed to be the decent . thing to marry. ‘Weng has changed me inside out.

He met her online shortly after separating from seventh wife Wan, who was from Thailand, in 2003. He flew to the Philippines to meet Weng and they instantly fell for each other, marrying on the Isle of Wight in November 2004. Mr Sheppard is in talks with production companies about turning his book, which is published on February 1, into a film.

"By . Amie Keeley . Nazi SS leader Heinrich Himmler's love letters to his wife are to be revealed for the first time . Nazi SS leader Heinrich Himmler's love letters to his wife are to be revealed for the first time. Hundreds of the notorious SS commander’s private letters, notes and photographs dating from 1927 to 1945 will be published on Sunday by Germany’s Die Welt newspaper. The architect of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of six million Jews, met his future wife Marga, who ran a Berlin nursing home, in 1927. The trove of letters give an insight into the early days of their relationship and also document the breakdown of the marriage from 1938 onwards when Himmler had an affair with his private secretary. The documents belonged to an Israeli family and are now being stored in Tel Aviv. They are also expected to detail Himmler’s extreme anti-Semitism and give new insight into the rise and fall of the Nazi regime. They were taken by U.S. soldiers from a safe in the Himmler family home after he committed suicide while in Allied custody swallowing a cyanide pill. But it is not clear how they ended up in Israel. Die Welt said the letters had been independently verified. Michael Hollmann, president of the German Federal Archive, told The Telegraph: ‘We are sure about these documents. There is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the documents in Tel Aviv.’ According to Die Welt, the letters do not change the overall picture of the Nazi reign of terror, but they certainly add countless previously unknown details and help [give] a better idea of what type of person the SS leader was, his everyday life and his surroundings’. The letters are expected to detail the extreme anti-Semitism Himmler (pictured here with his daughter) harboured and give new insight into the rise and fall of the Nazi regime .","Collection includes letters and photographs from between 1927 and 1945 .

"By . Simon Walters . Explosive leaked emails have laid bare for the first time the depth of the bitter feud between Ed Miliband and Ed Balls. The emails, sent last week and obtained by The Mail on Sunday, reveal that the Labour leader’s team think Mr Balls is a ‘nightmare’. They prove the two are deeply divided over how to respond to the economic revival. And they indicate Mr Miliband is sick and tired of the shadow chancellor’s refusal to obey his orders and ‘stay on message’. United front? Ed Miliband with Ed Balls are said to have had a number of behind-the-scenes rows . Publicly, the two men have always . denied reports of long-running personal and political simmering . tensions, and of heated behind-the-scenes rows between them and their . rival camps. Privately, the . emails paint a very different picture and leave no doubt that relations . between them are as bad as critics have long suspected. The . emails were sent on Wednesday in response to Bank of England Governor . Mark Carney’s announcement that the economic recovery had finally taken . hold. ‘The glass is half full,’ he declared. In . its most optimistic set of forecasts for years in the latest quarterly . inflation report, the Bank raised its outlook for growth and jobs and . reduced its outlook for inflation. But the rosy forecast posed another test for relations between Miliband and Balls. The . Labour leader is known to disagree with Mr Balls’s refusal to accept he . was wrong to predict Coalition policies would trigger a double-dip . recession. And the shadow . chancellor’s continued use of his mocking ‘flat-lining’ gesture with his . hand to David Cameron – when the economy is on an upward path – is . regarded by Mr Miliband as another blunder. After . the Bank of England announcement, Mr Balls wasted no time in seizing . control of Labour’s official response, before Mr Miliband had the chance . to do so. He told his senior adviser Alex Bellardinelli to email Mr Miliband’s aides, informing them of his response to the new forecast. Mixed messages: Extracts from emails sent by the Balls team, top, and the Miliband camp, below . Around . a dozen influential Labour figures received the roundrobin email. They . included the former Treasury mandarin Torsten Bell, Mr Miliband’s chief . economic adviser and a former aide to ex-Chancellor Alistair Darling, Mr . Balls’s most powerful Labour critic. In . the terse email, which echoes reports that Mr Balls resents deferring . to Mr Miliband, Mr Bellardinelli wrote: ‘Could we get this out pls? cleared at this end [by Balls] and essentially the same script as we had . on GDP day the other week.’ Mr . Balls’s 200-word statement began: ‘After three damaging years of . flatlining . . .’ a phrase Mr Miliband now avoids. Mr Balls went on to . complain about the ‘cost-of-living crisis’, . called for a ‘recovery that’s built to last’ and an ‘economy that works . for working people’. Less than 15 minutes later, Mr Bell forwarded the . email to fellow Miliband loyalist, . Greg Beales, the Labour leader’s head of strategy. In withering terms, . Mr Bell wrote at the top of the email: ‘As an example of why we’re . having problems on EB (EdBalls) messaging – this is his current three-part argument: Cost of living; Recovery built to last; Economy works for working people.’ Mr . Bell signed off with his own damning, one-word assessment of Mr Balls: . ‘Nightmare’. He did not send the reply to Mr Balls’s office. Ten minutes later, Mr Beales replied to Mr Bell in equally scathing When did built to last become a part of our thing?’ Today’s . disclosure of the backroom sniping between Balls and Miliband will do . little to increase their low ratings in opinion polls. Surveys show that voters are sceptical about the prospect of the pair running the economy. And . the leaked emails are bound to be used by Prime Minister David Cameron . and Chancellor George Osborne to reinforce Tory claims that their Labour . rivals cannot be trusted with the nation’s purse strings. A . spokesman for Ed Miliband said last night: ‘Ed Balls was entirely . right. After three damaging years of flatlining, there is no recovery . for millions of families. ‘Prices . are rising faster than wages, and figures this week showed that people . are on average £1,600 a year worse off since David Cameron came to . office.’","Emails sent last week reveal the Miliband's team think Balls is a 'nightmare'

"By . Mia De Graaf . A 17-year-old clung to the edge of a 110ft cliff for 30 minutes after trying to rescue his dog. The teenager clambered down the perilous drop at midday yesterday after his 18-month-old British Bulldog, Rio, fell down and landed on a narrow ledge. But in his haste, the boy slipped and ended up hanging from a piece of rock as his older brother looked on, helpless. Perilous drop: The boy, 17, tried to climb down to the ledge to get his British Bulldog but slipped . After minutes of calling for help, a coastguard officer arrived and was winched 40ft down to where the teenager was hanging. He was placed into a safety harness and hoisted back to the top of the 150ft cliff along with the dog, which was put into a special bag. His rescuers said that the teenager couldn't have held onto to the jagged rock  in Charmouth, Devon, for much longer and would have been severally injured or killed had he fallen. The dramatic incident happened while the boy and his family were holidaying in a caravan half-a-mile from the cliff. Graham Turner, of the Lyme Regis coastguard team, said: 'The younger brother went down after the dog but he slid down and had to dig his fingers into a rock to stop himself. 'He slid down to a ledge and was left clinging on. His feet were over the edge of the ledge and it was a near vertical drop after that. After minutes of calling, just holding a rock on the cliff in Devon, coastguards arrived to winch him up the 110 feet . The dog, Rio, survived unscathed, but pet owners in Devon have been warned to keep them on a leash . 'He was in serious trouble and imminent danger. He would have been killed or severely hurt had he fallen further. 'He had been there for 30 minutes and another five or ten minutes and he would have had to let go so we found him in the nick of time. He was terrified.' The victim, who hasn't been named, was wearing just shorts and a T-shirt and had to be treated at the top of the cliffs by paramedics for shock and cold. Rio the dog survived the drama completely unscathed. Julia Gosling, a spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, warned dog owners to keep their pets on leads when near cliffs. She said: 'This case highlights why we do dog rescues because people can put their lives at risk when they try and do it. 'The coastline can be an exciting place for dogs but even the most obedient dogs can do something unexpected at times.

"By . Emma Innes . A three-year-old girl with a unique combination of illnesses desperately needs a bone marrow transplant to save her life, doctors have said. Tia Pugh, who loves Peppa Pig and the Muppets, has an extremely rare form of immune deficiency called STAT1 deficiency. Medics have also discovered she has a tuberculosis-like illness called mycobacterium malmoense. They believe she may be the only person in the world to suffer both illnesses at the same time. Tia Pugh is thought to be the only person in the world with a rare immune deficiency, called STAT1 deficiency, and a tuberculosis-like illness, called mycobacterium malmoense . After months of hospital treatment and numerous tests, doctors now say her only chance of cure is a bone marrow transplant. Tia's father, Nick, is from Worcester and her mother, Yupa, is Thai with Cambodian heritage. This relatively rare ethnic mix means finding a genetic match for Tia could prove extremely difficult. Mr Pugh said: ‘Tia is our darling little daughter and it is heartbreaking to watch her suffer like this. ‘Now that the doctors have identified what's wrong we can at last get moving on finding a cure. ‘But we have to be quick, and that cure is out of our hands until we can find a match. ‘All I can say to the people out . there is please help us however you can, by signing up to the register . or setting up a recruitment event in your area. ‘Think . how you would feel if it was your daughter, or your son, and you needed . a stranger to help them survive.

It is characterised by susceptibility to both bacterial and viral infections. These often prove fatal. Because a patient’s immune system is unable to deal with infections, they have to be given regular antibiotics. The . only potential cure is a bone marrow transplant and, for Tia, it is . vital a donor is found before she succumbs to an infection. Tia also has mycobacterium malmoense which is an opportunistic infection which is usually treated with antituberculosis drugs. However, these are of limited effectiveness.

Tia also has mycobacterium malmoense which is an opportunistic infection which is usually treated with antituberculosis drugs. However, these are of limited effectiveness. When Tia was born she was initially believed to be healthy but she ended up back in hospital three days later when she fell ill. When she was nine months old it became apparent that she was very unwell as she developed blisters and rashes all over her body. She also started to suffer from repeated bouts of salmonella which meant she was often unable to eat properly so she became underweight. It was about a year before doctors were finally able to establish the cause of her problems. Tia and her parents lives in Worcester and have spent months in and out of hospital. The little girl underwent a blood transfusion before she was two and doctors have tried various combinations of medicine to make her better. For months, Tia had to go to the hospital at 7am and 11pm every day to receive vital drugs and nurses visit her home daily at 11am and 3pm to help care for her. Tia's mother has also undergone training to administer antibiotics to the little girl at home. Tia is also fed through an intravenous tube each night. Anthony Nolan, which manages the bone marrow register, is urging people to sign up as donors, especially those of South East Asian and mixed-Asian heritage. Henny Braund, chief executive of Anthony Nolan, said: ‘Tia's situation is so difficult that it's hard to hear about. ‘But it is precisely this kind of circumstance that Anthony Nolan was set up to help with. Over the last 40 years we have seen thousands of caring, selfless people put their names on the register and thousands of lives have been saved as a result. Tia has to take a lot of antibiotics to prevent her developing infections and has to be fed through a tube . ‘Now it is vital that we get the message out, especially to the South East Asian community, so that we can find a match for Tia as soon as possible. Please help however you can.’ Every year in the UK, around 1,800 people in the UK need a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. This is usually their last chance of survival. White northern Europeans have a 90 per cent chance of finding a suitable bone marrow donor but this falls to 40 per cent for people from black, Asian, and ethnic minority backgrounds. Some 90 per cent of donations take place during an outpatient appointment that is similar to donating blood. To join the bone marrow register visit www.anthonynolan.org .

"By . Bob Cass . David Moyes will present Manchester United with an unprecedented £100million transfer hit-list this summer. The United manager’s bold statement of the players he wants to restore his team to greatness will test owners the Glazer family’s eagerness to share his ambitions for the club. Top targets for Moyes are Juventus midfield pair Arturo Vidal and Paul Pogba, together valued at around £60m and an indication of the United manager’s current anxiety about the part of his team that has consistently failed to produce this season. Shopping spree: Manchester United boss David Moyes will present his bosses with a £100m wish-list this summer . Chasing: Juventus midfielders Arturo Vidal (above) and Paul Pogba (below) are Moyes' top targets . Moyes has also earmarked Joel Veltman, of Ajax, and Southampton teenager Luke Shaw as he tries to freshen up an ageing defence. And he will follow up his long-standing interest in Atletico Madrid’s  25-year-old Brazil international striker Diego Costa. The list is certain to test United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward’s ability to wheel and deal. Big spenders: Pogba and Vidal could cost United £60m to bring to Old Trafford . Deals: Executive vice chairman Ed Woodward (left) is the man behind the deals at United . If Moyes has found it difficult in the shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson, Woodward has no less daunting a job to succeed former chief executive David Gill, who, like Fergie, is still very much a presence at Old Trafford. Woodward’s biggest problem will not be financing the transfers. If United do not finish in the Premier League’s top four this season, Woodward will have to persuade players to give up their Champions League ambitions for at least a year and that will not be easy. An accountant, Woodward arrived at United after representing the American owners during their successful 2005 takeover. He made his mark as a successful head of commercial operations but Gill’s decision to stand down propelled Woodward into an entirely different role, negotiating with rival club executives and players’ agents. The recent acquisition of £37m Juan Mata from Chelsea was a step in the right direction. Goalscorer: Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa is another player on Moyes' list . Hot property: Luke Shaw (right) - who is a target for a number of clubs - could be a ready made replacement for Patrice Evra . If proof was needed that Moyes intends to be his own man and stand or fall by his ability to make United the best in Europe, it is in his pursuit of Pogba. Still only just 20, the French midfielder was in the Old Trafford youth  set-up after switching from Le Havre in controversial circumstances. But his departure to Juventus in 2012 was even more controversial, especially after Sir Alex had predicted a tremendous future for him. Since then Pogba has blossomed into one of Europe’s top young prospects. United would now have to fork out £30m for someone they let go 18 months ago for nothing. His Juventus team-mate Vidal, a 26-year-old Chile international, is valued even higher. He joined from Bayer Leverkusen for £10m in 2011 and was voted player of the year after his major role in Juve’s second successive title triumph last season. Transition: Ajax's Joel Veltman (left, on the right) could step into the shoes of the departing Nemanja VIdic . Nemanja Vidic’s decision to leave United has heightened Moyes’s need for at least one central defender and Veltman fits the bill. United were among several clubs, including Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal at the  Ajax-Groningen match on Thursday when the Holland international played in his team’s  2-1 win. United also face competition for Shaw and Costa. But the ball will be firmly in Woodward’s court when the transfer treasure hunt begins in earnest.","David Moyes will hand in a £100m shopping list to his Old Trafford bosses .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Four former employees of scandal-hit welfare-to-work firm A4E admitted swindling taxpayers yesterday. The guilty pleas follow a police investigation into the troubled company which is paid more than £200m by the Government each year. Julie Grimes, 50, Aditi Singh, 30, Bindiya Dholiwar, 27, and Dean Lloyd, 36, admitted dozens of offences of fraud and forgery. (File picture) A police investigation into A4E has resulted in four members of staff admitting deception . All four were arrested after the Daily Mail revealed concerns about taxpayer-funded employment schemes run by A4E two years ago. The company was employed by the Department for Work and Pensions to deliver an employment and training scheme called 'Inspire to Aspire'. It pocketed huge sums from the public purse for getting people off benefits by delivering training and helping people to find work. But Whitehall officials called in police over concerns that staff were billing taxpayers for 'successful' work that was not carried out or for non-existent clients. A whistleblower claimed forged signatures and blank timesheets were 'routine' techniques used for bumping up the numbers of successful job placements. The four former A4E recruiters admitted a total of 32 offences during a hearing at Reading Crown Court yesterday. The A4E controversy began in February 2012 when it was revealed that its founder Emma Harrison had paid herself £8.6 million . Grimes, of Staines, admitted nine charges of forgery. Singh, of Slough, who is seven months pregnant, admitted two counts of forgery and one of fraud. Dholiwar, of Slough, admitted seven counts of forgery. Lloyd, of Milton Keynes, admitted 13 offences of forgery. A fifth former employee was stranded overseas by poor weather and her barrister indicated that she too intended to plead guilty at a special hearing next week. All the offences took place between over four years until February 2013. No date has been set for the former employees to be sentenced. They each face up to 10 years in prison. The A4E controversy began in February 2012 when it was revealed that its founder Emma Harrison had paid herself £8.6 million. Damaging allegations followed that workers at the firm were inappropriately claiming 'success' fees, sometimes for individuals who worked for no more than 24 hours. Officers from Thames Valley Police's economic crime unit searched its headquarters in Slough, Berkshire, as politicians called for a full inquiry. The furore forced Mrs Harrison, worth an estimated £70million, to step down as chairman and resign from her role as David Cameron's 'back to work tsar'. Mrs Harrison remains the majority shareholder after building up the company, formerly called Action For Employment, into an operation spanning 11 countries. Her boasts that she can find jobs for the long-term unemployed have won her a string of lucrative Whitehall contracts over the past 20 years. A4e is one of several contractors which earn payments for helping the out-of-work find a job. Half of its work is subcontracted to charities, generating millions in management fees. A further eight former A4E employees, aged between 25 and 43, are expected to go on trial in October accused of fraud.","Guilty pleas follow a investigation into the troubled company .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Colleagues talking your ear off in the desks surrounding yours aren't just annoyingâ€”they're also destroying your concentration and bringing down overall workplace productivity. A new study found that 'focus' tasks are harder to accomplish when there are no barriers between employees, such as in open-plan offices, The Independent reported. Only one in four U.S. workers believe they are in 'optimal' workplace environments, resulting in a decrease in workplace effectiveness since 2008, according to a report by the global design firm Gensler. Open: Offices that boast less space to individually focus might have a negative impact on U.S workers' concentration . An employee's inability to focus has something to do with poorly-planned workplaces that cause less time away from colleagues so that workers can better concentrate on non-collaborative tasks. The open-office design became popular in Germany when designers wanted to break the tradition of factory-style desk arrangements facing the same direction toward management, who were comfortable situated in their own offices. The report, based on responses from more than 2,000 American workers, demonstrates these designs have only made workers more distracted. Distracting: Noise and smell make it harder for workers in the U.S. to focus at work . 'I donâ€™t think it would be going too far out on a limb to say we are at the beginning of a new era in workplace design,' Gensler executive director Diane Hoskins told The Independent. Open-plan workplaces, which meant to boost collaboration and creative thinking, have actually decreased employee's ability to collaborate, the report shows. 'Not only is the focus mode not functioning optimally in most office environments, we found statistical evidence that the effectiveness of collaboration, learning and socializing suffers if the ability to focus is diminished,' Hoskins said. A study by the Danish Ministry of Employment found workers in open-plan offices take 62 per cent more sick days than those with their own space. Unproductive: Open-plan offices originally meant to increase collaboration have actually decreased it . Thirty-one per cent of respondents said they are more satisfied when they can focus. They also see their companies as more 'innovative' when they can focus. The physical barriers companies have taken down have also been replaced by virtual ones, such as headphones and email, rather than face-to-face, conversations. Social media like Twitter and Facebook have also decreased workplace focus. Despite Hoskin's beliefs, many companies have still made their offices more open. Trying to highlight collaborative work, Facebook used a 'non-hierarchical approach' in organizing their new office at the Sun Microsystems California campus. Maximizing space and increasing shared resources, 2,800 engineers share a warehouse with a roof garden.","Workers lose concentration when they work in offices without space to focus without their colleagues, a report by design firm Gensler says .

"By . Mark Shapland . An Indian woman left severely disfigured in a brutal acid attack has found love with a social activist helping bring justice to victims of such attacks. Laxmi, 24 - who goes by just her first name - had given up on finding a partner thanks to the stares and comments she received in public left her too ashamed to leave the home. But after meeting Alok Dixit, 26, while protesting against the rising tide of acid attacks against women, Laxmi has turned her life around. True love: Laxmi was left disfigured after suffering a brutal acid attack in 2005 and thought she'd never find love ... until she met the dashing social activist Alok Dixit . Natural beauty: Laxmi before the attack - she has since undergone seven major surgeries to try and reduce the burns to her skin . The 24-year-old, from Delhi - who underwent seven major surgeries to try and reduce the burns to her skin said: 'After the attack, I never thought I would ever find a soulmate. I had lost hope. 'But in Alok, I couldn't have found anyone better. He understood the kind of pain I was in. He understood what I had been going through.' Alok, who along with Laxmi now runs the Stop Acid Attacks campaign, added: 'I never felt that looks are important. Looks do not matter because I find Laxmi very beautiful. She is a beautiful person and her beauty lies in her heart.' Coping: Laxmi says the attack left her emotionally and physically scarred and she has struggled with her confidence following the dramatic change in her looks . Laxmi was attacked in 2005 when she was 15-years-old by a man more than twice her age, who she refused to marry. The incident - which took place in broad daylight in one of Delhi's busiest markets - left her physically and emotionally scarred. It led her to file public interest litigations in India's highest court, seeking changes in the law and asked the government to take steps to restrict the sale of acid. But privately she struggled to cope with the dramatic change in looks and confidence following the horrifying attack. Laxmi added: 'I cannot forget how brutally I was attacked. I want to make sure that such things don't happen to anyone else. 'My father worked as a chef. I was friends with another girl in the neighbourhood and her brother soon started proposing to me. I was only 15. On April 18 (2005), he messaged me: 'I love you."" I ignored it.' But Laxmi had little idea of the tragic turn of events set to unfold because of her perceived snub. 'I was waiting for a bus when he approached me with his brother's girlfriend. They pushed me to the ground and threw acid over my face,' Laxmi recalled. 'I was crying for help, but no one came to my rescue. I tried waving at the passing cars. They did not stop, no one helped. I almost got run over three times. I could not even open my eyes properly. 'I felt as if someone had set my whole body on fire. The skin was just coming off, it was like dripping, from my hands and from my face.' Beauty lies within: Handsome lover Alox Dixit says Laxmi's beauty lies in her heart, adding that he has never felt looks are important . In the nine-years since the attack, Laxmi has undergone seven face reconstruction surgeries, but insists she no longer cares about her looks thanks to Alok. She said: 'Someone asked me the question of what if the attacker still offered to marry me? I said, he has changed my face, but he has failed to change my mind. 'Afterwards I never wanted to find love. I mean there was no hope in any case because of the scars.' But after meeting Dixit, that all changed and she says she learned to love again. 'I contacted Alok for a job. I was told later that he had been looking for me for over four years. Then when we met, he understood what I was going through,' she said. Tenderness: The couple live together in India but have shunned social convention and decided against getting married . The families of the couple have also accepted the relationship and are standing by them. 'We have decided to live together until we die. But we are challenging the society by not getting married,' Laxmi said. Dixit continued: 'We are not going to follow the norms that the society approves of. We will prove that our love does not need a name. Our love is about understanding and support.' The couple says they haven't thought about the future yet, but believe helping acid attack victims is their only goal.","Laxmi was 15 when a jealous lover attacked her in a Delhi marketplace .

"By . Stephen Adams . Under fire: Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt . A secret plan to sell  confidential medical records to private companies for as little as £1 has been drawn up by officials. From next month, GPs will start sending detailed NHS patient records to a central database for the first time under the new General Practice Extraction Service (GPES). Yet doctors do not have to tell patients about the project, described by campaigners as an ‘unprecedented threat’ to medical confidentiality. The records – held for every person registered with a GP – will contain details of medical conditions, as well as ‘identifiable’ information including a patient’s NHS number, postcode and date of birth. Private firms such as Bupa can then apply to the Health Service to buy  and use data from the records for research. The project is being driven by NHS England, the new super quango, after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt made it clear he wanted a data revolution in the Health Service. Mr Hunt argues that sharing GP records with universities and private companies will  provide a valuable tool for medical research, monitoring flu outbreaks and screening for common diseases. But privacy campaigners last night warned there were ‘huge risks’ with putting so much patient information into so many hands. Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said: ‘The more people who have access to sensitive data, the greater the risk that it will not be protected properly. We’ve seen that on umpteen occasions in the past. ‘And when there’s a financial element involved, it introduces all sorts of incentives that are not necessarily about protecting privacy.’ Critical: Liberty Director Shami Chakrabarti says it will infringe privacy . Phil Booth, of campaign group medConfidential, said: ‘They are presenting this as some anodyne thing that’s only going to be used for health research. But this is a massive re-engineering of how everybody’s medical records are going to be used. It is an unprecedented threat to our medical confidentiality.’ Mr Hunt believes that allowing universities and private groups access health information easier will attract pharmaceutical companies and life sciences firms to the UK. From next month, 100 GP  surgeries in England will upload details from patient records to a central database held by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). Sensitive medical information will be included – for example whether a patient suffers from a condition such as cancer, heart disease or depression – as well as lifestyle information such as alcohol consumption. Names and addresses will not be uploaded, but ‘patient identifiable data’ including date of birth, postcode, gender and ethnicity will. Using publicly available records such as electoral rolls – which contain postcode and dates of birth information – malicious individuals could then identify who the patient records belong to. There are 55 organisations  accredited to apply for identifiable or sensitive data. Most are NHS bodies but also on the list are Bupa, the hospital comparison firm Dr Foster and the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Confidentiality: Doctors are supposed to uphold patients' privacy . The HSCIC currently charges tens of thousands of pounds for carrying out a typical ‘data extract’ request. But last month Geraint Lewis, chief data officer at NHS England, announced proposals to reduce these costs to just £1 a time. Ms Chakrabarti added: ‘NHS England are not promoting an honest debate about this, either with individual patients or the public at large.’ Initially, only information put on medical records from April 1, 2013, will be included on the uploads to HSCIC. However, Mr Booth claims  NHS England want to include full medical records going back 20 years.He said: ‘This is a wholesale rewriting of the deal between patient and doctor. When people go to the GP, they go for medical treatment – they don’t expect commodification of their patient record.’ An NHS England spokesman denied the organisation was failing to tell patients about the scheme or promote it. And a Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Jeremy Hunt has made clear that any patient who does not want personal data to be shared securely with HSCIC will have their objection respected.’","Campaigners describe plan as 'unprecedented threat' to confidentiality .

"By . Jenny Hope . More than two million Britons are so fat they could be eligible for weight loss surgery, claim researchers. Operations for weight loss such as the fitting of a gastric band or gastric bypass surgery are available on the NHS to treat those with potentially life-threatening obesity. Some 8,000 receive treatment called bariatric surgery each year in England. More than two million Britons are so fat they are eligible for weight loss surgery, new research suggests . But researchers from Imperial College London estimate more than five per cent of adults would qualify, more than 2.1 million people. A study claimed those fitting the criteria for bariatric surgery were more likely to be women, retired with lower educational qualifications and of lower socio-economic status. It found that despite evidence of the cost-effectiveness of weight loss surgery, surgery rates were estimated to be a third of the benchmark rate in the NHS. This means the number of people eligible for surgery ‘far exceeds’ the estimated number of people having procedures. Researchers, who examined the health of nearly 9,500 people, acknowledged the huge financial implications for the NHS if treatments were carried out in such greater numbers. But they said more investment may be necessary to meet a growing need for the procedures, says the study published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine Open. About 8,000 people a year have weight loss surgery, which is also called bariatric surgery, in England . According to NHS guidelines, weight loss surgery may be offered to those whose morbid obesity could kill them, or to people who are morbidly obese and who have a serious condition such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure that could be improved if they lost weight. Until recently weight loss surgery has risen year on year in England, with rates highest in women and those aged 40-54 years old. But data shows there was a fall of 10 per cent in the number of weight loss procedures carried out between April 2012 and March 2013, suggesting patients are finding it harder to get referred or treated. The new study says doctors might not be correctly identifying or referring those eligible, and there may be too little capacity. It concluded: ‘5.4 per cent of the . general adult population is eligible for bariatric surgery in England, . far exceeding the current bariatric surgery uptake. Each weight loss operation costs the NHS about £8,000 but this is cheaper in the long term than treating obesity related conditions such as diabetes . ‘Due to the limited capacity of health services to meet demand under existing criteria, greater investment into service provision may be required to meet a growing need. ‘This would have significant resource implications,’ lead researcher Dr Sonia Saxena said. ‘Despite clear guidelines outlining who can undergo such surgery with the NHS, and evidence that these procedures are cost-effective in the long run, less than one per cent of those eligible have weight loss surgery each year. ‘This raises questions about why more procedures are not currently being carried out.’ She said those most in need of surgery are often least likely to use health care services. ‘Another barrier might be patient awareness of bariatric surgery and commitment to complete lifestyle intervention programmes prior to surgery,’ she added. Warnings from the Royal College of Surgeons say intensive weight loss programmes - which have to be completed before a patient can be accepted for surgery - are not being run in some areas. It says there is a ‘postcode lottery’ that in the long run will end up costing the NHS more because obese patients are at risk of serious health problems. Experts say diabetes alone costs the NHS £3,000 per patient per year for life, whereas the £8,000 cost of bariatric surgery is recouped within three years. Professor John Wilding, University of Liverpool and a specialist in treating people with severe obesity said: ‘It is essential that the current variations in the availability of services for these people with the most severe and complex obesity are minimised, so that the best and most effective treatments are available for all.’ Professor Paul Aveyard, Department of Primary Care, University of Oxford and a GP said: ‘GPs could do much more to tackle obesity. GPs worry that talking about weight will upset our patients but our fears are largely groundless.’ Professor Jason Halford, University of Liverpool, chair of the UK Association for the Study of Obesity, said there should be more action to target retailers, point of sale promotion and the heavy discounting of unhealthy options to help children avoid making poor food choices.","Roughly 8,000 people have weight loss surgery each year in England .

"By . Peter Hayter . The scale of the divisiveness on the Ashes tour which ultimately cost Kevin Pietersen his international career extended beyond a push for the removal of team director Andy Flower. While Pietersen’s barely disguised contempt for Flower’s management and methods boiled over during a players-only meeting after the fourth Test in Melbourne that left most of the squad flabbergasted, sources claim he had also had captain Alastair Cook and vice-captain Matt Prior in his sights for much of the tour. Pietersen has never hidden his dislike and distrust of Flower’s approach, so there was shock but little surprise when he tore into the coach at that meeting, forcing Cook and Prior to intervene more than once. In happier times: Kevin Pietersen wanted Andy Flower replaced as England's team director and also had Alastair Cook, left, and Matt Prior in his sights . Relationship broken: Pietersen never hide his dislike for Flower's methods during his time as England team director . But it is now emerging that as well as wanting Flower replaced as coach, Pietersen had grave misgivings about Cook’s captaincy and tactical approach and he further thought Prior was not worth his place — and he made those views known to various colleagues on the tour. Furthermore, it is known he had little time for batting coach Graham Gooch. There is debate over his motivation for pursuing an agenda of wholesale change from within the dressing room. His supporters suggest it was based on genuine and objective concern for the future prospects of the team. Others say he never got over losing the captaincy in the fiasco which resulted in his sacking and that of coach Peter Moores in the winter of 2008-09, and that he saw the Ashes loss as an opportunity to grab it back. Fall out: Pietersen lost the captaincy in the fiasco which resulted in his sacking and that of coach Peter Moores in the winter of 2008-09 . Whatever lies behind his thinking, the disappointment felt by Cook and Prior is all the more acute because Pietersen is aware that, were it not for them, his international career might have ended in 2012 after the Textgate storm that enveloped English cricket in crisis. Then, when Pietersen was dropped for the final Test against South Africa after it emerged he had sent derogatory text messages to ‘close friends’ inside the opposition dressing room about Flower and Andrew Strauss, then skipper, certain powerful voices were dead set on ending Pietersen’s seven-year Test career. Had Strauss carried on, it may have spelled the end for him. History: Pietersen sent derogatory text messages to 'close friends' in the South Africa side about Flower and former England captain Andrew Strauss . But, after Pietersen said it was ‘tough being me in the England dressing room’ in an extraordinary press conference following his brilliant hundred at Headingley, Prior extended the hand of friendship. The wicketkeeper was the only player to call his troubled team-mate in an effort to move forward. Later, even though Pietersen was not at first selected for the tour to India, new captain Cook sought to canvass the opinions of his senior players and then made decisive moves to bring him back into the fold. Flower was uncertain, but felt he had to support his new skipper. Pietersen repaid them with a wonderful century in the second Test in Mumbai and the uneasy peace held through last summer’s 3-0 Ashes victory, until it all ended in tears this winter. As the fallout from the 5-0 defeat spreads, Flower has relinquished day-to-day control of the England team — he will continue to exert an influence in his new role with the England Cricket Board — and Prior ended the series on the sidelines. In addition, observers with no axe to grind have proposed Cook should quit the captaincy to concentrate on his batting. Tough tour: Cook, left, and Flower presided over a humiliating whitewash in the Ashes against Australia . On Saturday, Andrew Flintoff not only called Flower’s style domineering, but also accused Cook of letting things ‘stand still’ as regards team planning and insisted that simply blaming  Pietersen was ‘just not right’. ‘It’s when you’re not doing well that you need team spirit, and I haven’t seen too many people coming out and accepting responsibility for this one,’ said Flintoff, the captain when England were whitewashed by Australia in 2006-07. ‘The group don’t seem to be a group any more. They’ve got one player who can take the blame and the rest of them want to go about their business and let him take the fall. ‘It’s not that we couldn’t bowl them out, not that we couldn’t score runs, not that we got outplayed — it’s Kevin Pietersen’s fault. I’d have more respect for some of the senior players if they held their hands up, rather than letting it all get heaped on one bloke.’ Backing: Andrew Flintoff, right, has defended Pietersen and says he can't take all the blame for England's woe in Australia . Yet senior figures consider Pietersen’s actions undermined team spirit from the start. They point out that his silence over an all-out attack on Cook by his close friend and ally Shane Warne before the series, when the Aussie called for the captain to be replaced by Pietersen, and KP’s disinclination to offer public support thereafter left more questions than answers. And his refusal to counter the assault on Cook by his No 1 cheerleader, Piers Morgan, who tweeted ‘Sack Cook’ at every available opportunity, did little to help team unity. When Pietersen hijacked the team meeting in Melbourne — called with Flower’s support and aimed at urging players to take more responsibility for their performances — he tried to press for a regime change. That was seen as final confirmation that he had no qualms about undermining team unity already rocked by the trauma of Jonathan Trott’s early departure and the continuing struggles on the field. When, before making the decision to sack Pietersen last week, new managing director Paul Downton took soundings from all concerned, he was left in no doubt of the general belief that Pietersen’s actions and behaviour concerning Flower, Cook and Prior were not merely divisive, but bordered on a deliberate attempt to undermine the leadership of the group. Early blow: England batsman Jonathan Trott came back home early because of a stress-related illness . Indeed, any lingering support from within has been blown away following Morgan’s efforts to drag Prior into the row over that meeting in Melbourne, and what some see as wilful twisting of Prior’s words in order to misrepresent his position over Flower and demonstrate his support for Pietersen. Morgan accused Prior of being a hypocrite to his five million Twitter followers, claiming the wicketkeeper had ‘stabbed [Pietersen] in the back’ by failing to support the batsman when Downton was taking soundings over his future, even though he had backed him in the meeting. Pietersen had initially complained he did not want to attend because it would cut into ‘family time’, then used the opportunity to launch a broadside on Flower. Morgan stated Prior had joined in, attacked Flower’s dictatorial style and said: ‘F*** Flower. This is our team.’ Support: Piers Morgan is Pietersen's No 1 cheerleader and has been championing his cause on Twitter . Prior, enraged by Morgan’s attempt to enlist his support for Pietersen’s anti-Flower stance, responded by pointing out that his words were intended to underline that the team had to face their own failure without blaming the management or Flower. Pietersen misjudged the mood of the meeting when Prior and Cook attempted to steer the discussion back to the issue of personal responsibility. What did not help Pietersen’s cause was his ‘that’s the way I play’ batting in the first three Ashes Tests. The deal has always been that if you take his runs, you take the rest. But the manner of his dismissals in five of the first six innings in Australia led Geoff Boycott to savage him and former England batsman David Gower to remark ‘his absolute insistence to try to dominate at all costs, to show his ego at all costs, cost England dear’. Criticism: Former England cricketer Geoffrey Boycott was not impressed with Pietersen's batting Down Under . Those who have followed Pietersen’s extraordinary journey from a young South African off-spinner who found his prospects for advancement limited in his home country, to one of the most destructive batsmen in the world, have witnessed just how disruptive he can be ... without trying. What happens when he is trying can be devastating, as Moores, Strauss and many others have discovered to their cost. One man who saw it coming was Mick Newell, Nottinghamshire’s director of cricket, who fell out with him when they were at Trent Bridge. Familiar story: Pietersen fell out with Nottinghamshire's director of cricket Mick Newell while he was at the club . At the time Pietersen was reintegrated after of Textgate, Newell said: ‘He’s England best player but I think it’s a short-term fix ... somewhere down the line it will go wrong again. If England beat Australia [in the summer of 2013], they’ll be OK and they’ll get through the Ashes in the winter. But in a year, I’m afraid, you can see it all kicking off again.’ The only thing wrong about that forecast was the timescale. The Mail on Sunday led the way with news that Kevin Pietersen’s England career was over after the humiliating 5-0 Ashes defeat in Australia. Cricket writer Peter Hayter revealed three weeks ago that the top brass had run out of patience with England’s record run scorer. And Patrick Collins summed up the mood in the team over Pietersen, who was unhappy with Alastair Cook and Matt Prior .","Kevin Pietersen did not just want to get rid of team director Andy Flower .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A German angler has managed to break the world record by landing the biggest cod ever caught. The mighty cod weighed in at 103lbs - smashing the existing record, that has been held for 44 years, by nearly 5lbs. Michael Eisele, from Kiel, Germany, was on a fishing trip to Norway when he snared the whopper. Catch of the day: An angler is celebrating after breaking the record for catching the world's biggest ever cod . The 44-year-old and his party had just been about to head back to port after an unsuccessful day's fishing when he got a bite. Mr Eisele spent 30 minutes trying to reel in the catch and said his knees started trembling when he saw it as it breached the water. The cod was so big two of his friends had to hold him back in fear he would have been dragged overboard by it. They . helped him heave it on board and Mr Eisele was barely able to hold it by . himself for the obligatory photograph on board the fishing boat. The one that didn't get away: Mr Eisele spent 30 minutes trying to reel in the catch and said his knees started trembling when he saw it as it breached the water . Strike a pose: The cod was so big two of his friends had to hold him back in fear he would have been dragged overboard by it . The 5ft long cod tipped the scales at 47 kilograms. The existing record stood at 98lbs 12ozs for a cod caught off New Hampshire in 1969. Mr Eisele's cod is not only a world record but also the very first to hit the 100lbs mark. Mr Eisele said he caught the fish in 90ft of water 10 miles off the Norwegian island of Soroya. He said: 'The fishing had been quiet all day. The just one hour before the turn of the tideI got a bite. Donated: Mr Eisele donated the record fish to the Norwegian Fisheries Museum in Bergen which will have it stuffed and mounted . 'I saw two red dots on the sonar-screen and it looked like a big one. 'So I concentrated from that moment on. It felt like ground contact. I took it very slowly and carefully. 'It took me more than half an hour to get the fish up. When we saw the fish my knees was starting shaking. It was so big. 'I needed the help from both boys staying in my boat to get it landed. 'It was an indescribable feeling. It was fish of a lifetime. 'I am a little proud to have the record.' Mr Eisele, the managing director of a fishing tackle manufacturers, donated the record fish to the Norwegian Fisheries Museum in Bergen which will have it stuffed and mounted. But he has submitted an application for his world record catch to the International Game Fishing Association. The record for the biggest cod caught in British water stands at 58lbs and was caught in the North Sea off Whitby in 1992.","Michael Eisele was on a fishing trip to Norway when he landed the whopper .

"By . Associated Press . A former New York City assistant district attorney and philanthropist has died after falling in a Florida horse jumping competition. Anne Heyman, 52, died in Wellington, Florida, on Friday after a fall at the Palm Beach International Equestrian Center at about 10:30 a.m. She was flown to Delray Medical Center, where she died three hours later. Heyman was born in South Africa and attended the George Washington School of Law. She went on to work for the Manhattan district attorney's office and later led the creation of the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village, a community for children orphaned during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Beloved: Anne Heyman was a mother to three biological children and a mother-figure to hundreds of Rwandan children whose lives she changed . Mourning: Current and former residents of the Agahozo-Shalom Village are devastated by Heyman's death . 'Each of us grieves not only for the passing of a tremendous woman and a true visionary, but also for the loss suffered by her family,' the organization said in an announcement posted on its website. 'She has made a remarkable impact on this world and we will continue to work to uphold her legacy.' Rwandan officials also mourned her loss. 'Deeply saddened by sudden passing of Anne Heyman,' wrote Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo in a message on Twitter. 'I know she lives on in many vibrant Rwandan girls she worked hard for.' Heyman and her husband, Seth Merrin, were inspired to help Rwandan orphans after hearing about their struggles at a talk about the genocide in 2005. Heyman was reminded of the residential living communities built in Israel for orphans of the Holocaust and wanted to bring a similar model to Rwanda, according to the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village's website. According to the Wall Street Journal, Agahozo Shalom is a combination of Hebrew and Kinyarwanda languages meaning 'a place to dry one's tears and live in peace.' Legacy: Heyman leaves behind the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village where orphaned children can live and go to high school . 'Big Momma': Staff at the village say devastated children are asking why God would take their mothers away from them twice . High places: Anne Heyman with Israeli President Shimon Peres (second left), Ran Goshen (second right), and her husband Seth Merrin (right) The first 125 students moved in to the village in 2008. The organization is now home to 500 children. Heyman is survived by her husband, Seth Merrin, their three children and hundreds of Rwandan orphans, who called her 'Big Momma.' Heyman and Merrin raised $12 million to build the village outside Kigali in eastern Rwanda. 'It’s the worst thing that could happen to us - again,' Emmanuel Nkundunkundiye, 21, a recent graduate told the Forward from the campus outside the Rwanda capital of Kigali. 'It’s like being made an orphan all over again.' Heyman visited the village every two or three months and would live there with the children for weeks at a time. Just two weeks ago, Heyman presided over the school’s graduation ceremony, which also marked the 20th anniversary of the 1994 killing spree in which hundreds of thousands were killed. Generous: Heyman and her husband raised $12 million to establish the village for orphaned teenagers . Recent visit: Heyman attended a graduation ceremony at the Rwandan youth village just two weeks ago . The children who have been there three or four years knew her very well and felt like she wasn’t only a grandmother to them, but also a guardian angel in some ways,' board member Lisa Issroff told the Palm Beach Post. 'She was an extraordinarily compassionate person to everyone, but in particular for people that were vulnerable.' In a bio on the organization's website, Heyman is described as 'an avid equestrian and competition show jumper' who lived in Manhattan with her husband and three children. Compassion: Heyman had a special affinity with vulnerable people and children . She fell Friday during a master's jumper competition, FTI Consulting Winter Equestrian Festival spokeswoman Jennifer Wood told the Palm Beach Post. Deputies said Saturday Heyman became dislodged from the horse after a jump and began leaning to the left side. The horse began to pick up speed and Heyman fell off. Witnesses told investigators Heyman struck the back of her head. She died from cardiac arrest while undergoing emergency surgery. Funeral details are expected to be shared in the coming days.","Philanthropist and former New York assistant district attorney Anne Heyman died Friday .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A harrowing 911 call made by a 10-year-old girl as her mother was being stabbed to death was played to an Ohio court on Tuesday. In the call, made on the morning of February 24, last year, the daughter of Tami Wong can be heard saying: 'My daddy’s murdering my mom.' The girl's father, Glenn Wong, is currently on trial for murder after he was found over his wife's body, which had more than 100 stab wounds. On trial: Glenn Wong, right, arrives in court on March 24 to face charges that he murdered his wife . The couple's children were witnesses to the tragic events of that February morning, and have both described what they saw and heard to the court. Summit County Assistant Prosecutor Angela Walls-Alexander, who held a framed photo of Tami Wong as she addressed the court, said the victim had 103 stab wounds caused by two kitchen knives. She added that Mrs Wong died from 'critical loss of blood,' Ohio.com reported. Her 51-year-old husband, who had been described in court as jealous and controlling, had tried to plead insanity, but Common Pleas Judge Paul Gallagher rejected his request. Wong, 51, has been charged with two . counts of aggravated murder, one count of murder and one count of . kidnapping, felonious assault and misdemeanor domestic violence. Attack: Glenn Wong is accused of stabbing his wife, Tami, more than 100 times in their bedroom . Crime scene: Wong was found over the body of his wife at their Twinsburg home . Prosecutors claim Wong suspected his wife was having an affair after seeing a bag of candy on her desk on Valentine's Day. 'Everyone in that office has the exact same bag, with the exact same candy in it,' the prosecutor said, adding that it was a gift to all the staff from a colleague. The couple had been married since 2001 but prosecutors claimed Mrs Wong had been unhappy and talked to a friend about getting a divorce. On the morning that she died, the couple's two children, aged 10 and seven, were playing in a room next to the master bedroom when they heard their parents arguing. A 911 call made at 7.06am by the daughter was played to the jury, in which the girl can be heard panicking. 'My daddy’s murdering my mom. I don’t know what’s happening,' she told the dispatcher, before adding: 'He has a knife, he has a knife, he has a knife.' At 7.11am, armed police arrived at the couple's Twinsburg home and found Wong on top of his wife. As the couple's children, who testified via video link from a separate court room, described what they saw and heard on the morning of the killing, their father broke down and wept. In court: Wong, left, talks to his attorney Brian Pierce as an Ohio courtroom . His daughter told the court she saw her father walk into the kitchen and return to the bedroom, where she heard 'my mom screaming ... ""Call 911"".' She added: 'I went to go to my parents' bedroom to get the cordless phone on a night stand. He was on top of my mom and it was … weird.' The couple's young son also witnessed the attack, and told the court he had been standing in the doorway to the bedroom at the time. 'My mom started to scream. He was on top of her. That was it,' he said. Wong's attorney, Brian Pierce, has said his client was responsible for his wife's death, but reminded the court they must determine what he was actually guilty of. His charges allow for two theories: that the killing was planned and calculated, or that he purposely caused her death during a kidnapping. 'I don't think the state will be able to prove to you that this was a premeditated event,' Mr Pierce said, according to the Twinsburg Bulletin. 'This was impulsive, spur of the moment … and frankly, not very rational.'","Glenn Wong is accused of killing his wife, Tami, at the family home .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . A woman whose father went to prison when she told police he raped her as a nine-year-old has said she made up the story to avoid being beaten by her mother. Chaneya Kelly, 24, of Newburgh in upstate New York, is pleading for her father's release nearly 16 years after she accused him of molesting her in 1997. Ms Kelly, who says her mother - then addicted to drugs and alcohol - forced her to make the claim, has said: 'I'm 24-years-old and I made this mistake when I was nine-years-old - but it's never too late to try and right your wrong.' Scroll down for video . 'Mistake': Chaneya Kelly, now 24, said she falsely accused her father of raping her as a nine-year-old because her mother threatened to beat her if she didn't . Her father Daryl Kelly, a Navy veteran who ran an electronics repair shop in Newburgh, was sentenced to 20 to 40 years in prison and barred from any contact with his children after being convicted by a jury of multiple counts of rape and serious sexual assault. Kelly, who has always maintained his innocence, had never been convicted of a felony before. 'All I think is, one day the truth will set me free. All I have to do is hold on,' Kelly told NBC News from the Green Haven Correctional Facility. In October 1997, while Kelly was living with his wife Charade and their five children in Newburgh, he says he was attempting to rid himself of a drug habit in order to take better care of his family. But he said his wife's own drug habit had spiralled to the point where she turned to prostitution in order to feed her addiction. Wrongful conviction? Chaneya's father Daryl Kelly as spent almost 16 years in jail for molesting her - a crime his daughter now says never occurred . Appeals: Chaneya persuaded the courts to allow her to have contact with her father again when she was 15-years-old . Chaneya, the Kellys' eldest child, says that one morning before school her mother asked her whether her father had ever 'touched' her. 'I was like, ""What do you mean, did he touch me?"" And she was like, ""Did he touch you in your no-no spot?"" And I would repeatedly say no,' the now 24-year-old said. According to Ms Kelly her mother threatened to beat her if she did not 'tell me the answer that I want to hear'. She said she told her mother her father had molested her to avoid being beaten, even though it wasn't true. Kelly was taken in for questioning on October 29 1997. There was no definitive forensic evidence to prove Chaneya had been raped, but the little girl and her mother's story - together with some suspect answers Kelly provided during questioning - were enough for officers to charge the father of five. He refused a plea deal that would have made him eligible for parole in six years, and within a year was sentenced to up to 40 years following a trial by jury. His daughter was sent to live with her grandmother, a Pentecostal minister, and six months later Chaneya told her grandmother her father had never raped her. Pat Thomas took her granddaughter to Kelly's attorney who videotaped the child's recantation. Her mother, Charade, also submitted a sworn affadavit to the court which said she threatened to beat her daughter until she said her father raped her. A judge refused to vacate Kelly's conviction, deciding the recantation appeared forced. Kelly, who remains in jail to this day, began studying law and has filed multiple appeals. His daughter visited him in prison when she persuaded the courts to allow her to have contact with him at the age of 15. 'The first thing my dad did was that he hugged me and he told me that he loved me and... that he doesn’t blame me for anything,' she said. Chaneya's mother has said she is now drug-free and confirms her daughter's story, blaming a drug binge for her threats. Frank Phillips, the Orange County District Attorney and chief prosecutor when Daryl Kelly stood trial, has emphasised that Kelly was found guilty by a jury. He said in an interview it was 'not unique' for the victim of a sexual crime to want to protect the abuser by withdrawing their accusation. Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick is leading a re-investigation into the Kelly case. His office and the detective behind the original police investigation in Newburgh both declined to comment.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A new study claims that young adults who care for an animal have stronger social relationships . Plenty of children pester their parents for a puppy or kitten. And now it might be harder for parents to refuse their pleas as a new study claims that young adults who care for an animal have stronger social relationships. U.S. scientists also found that looking after a pet might also boost teenagers’ connections to their communities as well. Animals are used in therapeutic settings where they can have positive effects on children, but little is known about the benefits everyday interactions with animals can bring to young people. ‘Our findings suggest that it may not be whether an animal is present in an individual’s life that is most significant but rather the quality of that relationship,’ said Dr Megan Mueller, a developmental psychologist and research assistant professor at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, Massachusetts, who co-authored the study. ‘The young adults in the study who had strong attachment to pets reported feeling more connected to their communities and relationships,’ she said. Dr Mueller surveyed more than 500 participants aged between 18 and 26 about their attitudes and interaction with animals, for the study which was published in online journal Applied Developmental Science. The young adults in the study who had strong attachment to pets reported feeling more connected to their communities and relationships. A stock image of young volunteers planting a tree is pictured . Their responses were compared to their answers to questions designed to measure positive youth development characteristics such as competence, caring, confidence, connection, and character, as well as feelings of depression. The study found that young adults who cared for animals reported engaging in more ‘contribution’ activities, such as providing service to their community, helping friends or family and demonstrating leadership, than those who did not look after a pet. The more actively they participated in the pet’s care, the higher they scored on their sociable deeds. U.S. scientists also found that caring for a pet (illustrated) might also boost teenagers¿ connections to their communities . The study also found that high levels of attachment to an animal in late adolescence and young adulthood were positively associated with feeling connected with other people, having empathy and feeling confident. ‘We can’t draw causal links with this study but it is a promising starting point to better understanding the role of animals in our lives, especially when we are young,’ said Dr Mueller. To further the research, scientists need to look at how specific features of human experiences are connected with animal experiences, as well as how these relationships develop over time, and look at a larger, more diverse sample of people.","U.S. psychologists claim that young adults who care for an animal have stronger social relationships .

"By . Emma Thomas . A horror writer who collected photographs of people after they had died is having his gruesome catalogue showcased by an American college. Acclaimed author Michael McDowell gathered photographs as well as other sombre 'memorabilia' including adverts for burial gowns and pins containing locks of dead people's hair. He even used a coffin housing a skeleton as his coffee table. Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, bought the 'Death Collection' McDowell amassed in three decades before his own death in 1999 and is now preparing to open the vault. Grisly end: As well of photographs of people who met their maker thorough natural causes, Mr McDowell also gathered images of people who were hanged. This photograph shows the hanging of the co-conspirators in the Abraham Lincoln assassination in Washington, DC . Burial gowns: Mr McDowell collected adverts for burial gowns posed by . live models. His archive is going on display at Northwestern University, . Illinois . Artifact: Librarian Benn Joseph holds up a mortician's chalk make up kit. This is one of the curios that form part of the 'Death Collection' The pictures include people that died from natural causes or who met a more grisly end by a knife or a gun. Researchers studying the history of . death, its mourning rituals and businesses that profit from it soon will . be able to browse artifacts amassed by an enthusiast author Stephen . King once heralded as 'a writer for the ages.' Mr McDowell's long career included . penning more than two dozen novels, screenplays for King's novel . 'Thinner' and director Tim Burton's movies 'Beetlejuice' and 'The . Nightmare Before Christmas.' He also wrote episodes for macabre television shows 'Tales from the Darkside' and 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents.' Photographs: Scott Krafft holds up a daguerreotype of a dead child from the mid 18th century. Mr Krafft said they may have been the only photograph of the child that existed . 'We . are very removed from death today, and a lot of this stuff we see in . this collection gives us a snapshot in how people have dealt with death . generations ago in ways very different from today,' said Benn Joseph, a . manuscript librarian at the school. 'We look at it nowadays and think . this is inappropriate or gory... but when it was done, it was very much . acceptable.' Mr Joseph and others spent months getting the 76-box collection - one containing a child's coffin - ready to be studied. The archive, which officials said . ultimately will go on public display, includes at least one artifact . dating to the 16th century: a Spanish painting of a dead boy, his eyes . closed, wearing a cloak with a ruffled collar. The school bought the collection from McDowell's partner, director Laurence Senelick, for an undisclosed price. McDowell's younger brother, James, said he didn't realize but wasn't surprised by the extent of the collection. 'He always had kind of a gothic horror side to him,' Mr McDowell said in an interview. There are photographs and postcards from around the world. One, taken in 1899 in Cuba, shows a pile of skulls and bones. In another, a soldier in the Philippines poses with a man's severed head. There also are reminders of the infamous. Photographs show the people convicted of conspiracy for Abraham Lincoln's assassination being hanged, with dozens of soldiers looking on and the US Capitol looming in the background. Some pictures are gruesome, including . one of a man whose legs are on one side of the train tracks and the . rest of him in the middle. But much of the collection is devoted to the . deaths of regular . Americans and how they were memorialized in the 19th and early 20th centuries. There . are, for example, dozens of photographs that families had made into . postcards of their dead children. Dressed in their finest clothes, many . appear to be sleeping. Some have their eyes open, serious looks on their . faces. Hair: Mr McDowell also collected pins and brooches containing locks of dead people's hair. The badges are worn by women after the death of a loved one . Macabre: Books and adverts are also among the collection. Pictured here is The Championship Book on Embalming . Collection: Scott Krafft (left) curator of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections and manuscript librarian Benn Joseph (right) display a painting of a dead Spanish boy from the 16the century . Interest: Horror writer Michael McDowell (pictured) amassed the huge collection of curios, photographs and artifacts over three decades . There's one of a small boy, standing up, . with his hands resting on a small stack of books. Joseph said it could . be a bit of photographic sleight of hand and that the boy may actually . be lying down but made to look like he is standing. 'With the advent of photography, regular folks could have access to that sort of thing (and) families either took the kid's body to the studio or they arranged for a visit from the photographer,' said Scott Krafft, the library curator who purchased the collection for Northwestern. 'And they may have been the only photograph of the child that existed.' The collection also offers a glimpse into what families did after their loved ones died, at a time when they were preparing their homes to display the remains and getting ready to bring them to the cemetery. After choosing a burial gown - worn in ads by living models - many families then looked for a headstone. Traveling headstone salesmen in the early 20th century often carried around design samples in a box about the size of one that holds chocolates. Those paying their respects in the 19th and early 20th centuries frequently selected a tribute song for the dead to play inside the family homes, Mr Joseph said. There were some 100 popular pieces of topical sheet music, with such titles as 'She Died On Her Wedding Day.' Beetlejuice: Mr McDowell worked on the 1988 film with Tim Burton . Boxes: Scott Krafft (right) curator of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections sits with librarian Benn Joseph (left). They bought the 76-box collection from Mr McDowell's partner for an undisclosed sum . Music: Sheet music written for funerals includes titles like 'She Died on her Wedding Day'. This is included in an archive of death-related oddities once owned by horror novelist and screenwriter Michael McDowell . Weirder still, at least by today's standards, is McDowell's collection of what were called 'spirit' photographs that include both the living and a ghostly image purportedly of a dead person hovering nearby. In one photograph, Georgiana Houghton, a prominent 19th century medium, shakes hands with an apparition of her dead sister. She explains the photograph 'is the first manifestation of inner spiritual life.' 'I'm sure Michael, when he came across this, was totally excited,' Mr Krafft said. While the collection isn't yet on display, members of the public can see one piece when they enter the library reading room where it is housed.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The Earth’s atmospheric carbon dioxide has remained remarkably stable over the past 24 million years. And scientists believe they have now solved part of the mystery as to why this has been the case, despite changing geological conditions. They believe that ancient tree roots in the mountains may play an important role in controlling long-term global temperatures acting as a type of natural ‘thermostat’. Researchers at Oxford and Sheffield Universities carried out studies in tropical rain forests in Peru and found that mountainous forest may play a particularly important role. This is the valley in the Southern Peruvian Andes where fine root growth and organic layer thickness were measured over several years . When CO2 levels became too low for plants to grow properly, forests in mountains appear to have kept the climate in check by slowing down the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. ‘This study shows how trees can act as brakes on extreme climate change, and the roots of trees in tropical mountains such as the Andes play a disproportionate role,' Yadvinder Malhi, professor of Ecosystem Science at Oxford University told MailOnline. 'However, these responses take thousands to millions of years and cannot do much to slow the rate of global warming we are experiencing this century.’ In a warmer world,  tree roots are more likely to grow into the mineral layer of the soil, breaking down rock which will eventually combine with carbon dioxide . In a warmer world,  tree roots are more likely to grow into the mineral layer of the soil, breaking down rock which will eventually combine with carbon dioxide. This process, called weathering, draws carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and cools the planet. The researchers say this theory suggests that mountainous ecosystems have acted like the Earth's thermostat, addressing the risk of 'catastrophic' overheating or cooling over millions of years. Researchers from Oxford and Sheffield Universities discovered that temperatures affect the thickness of the leaf litter and organic soil layers, as well as the rate at which the tree roots grow. In a warmer world, this means that tree roots are more likely to grow into the mineral layer of the soil, breaking down rock which will eventually combine with carbon dioxide. This process, called weathering, draws carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and cools the planet. The theory suggests that mountainous ecosystems have acted like the Earth's thermostat, addressing the risk of 'catastrophic' overheating or cooling over millions of years. In their research paper, published online in Geophysical Research Letters, the researchers carried out studies in tropical rain forests in Peru. They measured growth of the tree roots across different sites of varying altitude - from the warm Amazonian Lowlands to the cooler mountain ranges of the Andes- every three months over several years. At each of the sites, they also measured the thickness of the organic layer above the soil. This information was then combined with data of monthly temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil moisture to calculate the likely breakdown process of the basalt and granite rocks found in the mountain ranges of Peru. Using this model, scientists were able to scale up their results to calculate the likely contribution of mountain forests worldwide to global weathering rates. Researchers measured growth of the tree roots across different sites of varying altitude - from the warm Amazonian Lowlands to the cooler mountain ranges of the Andes (pictured)- every three months over several years . The researchers then calculated the likely amount of carbon to be pulled out of the atmosphere through weathering when the Earth became very hot. They looked at the volcanic eruptions in India 65 million years ago, known as the Deccan traps. The model also allowed them to calculate the weathering process and carbon feedback after the Earth's cooling 45 million years ago, when great mountain ranges like the Andes and the Himalayas were first formed. The paper suggests that mountainous regions may play a particularly important role in drawing carbon out of the atmosphere because they have abundant volcanic rock which is highly reactive to weathering when it disintegrates. At each of the sites in the Southern Andres of Peru, researchers also measured the thickness of the organic layer above the soil . 'This is a simple process driven by tree root growth and the decomposition of organic material,’ said lead researcher Chris Doughty, from Oxford University. ‘Yet it may contribute to Earth's long-term climate stability. It seems to act like a thermostat, drawing more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere when it is warm and less when it is cooler.’ 'A series of climatic events over the last 65 million years ago have resulted in global temperatures rising and falling. ‘However, the weathering process that regulates carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may be buffered by forests that grow in mountainous parts of the world. ‘In the past, this natural process may have prevented the planet from reaching temperatures that are catastrophic for life.'","Study found climate affects thickness of soil layers and rate of root growth .

"By . Louise Boyle . A California woman has bravely spoken out after making the horrific discovery that she had been labelled a 'home-wrecker' on a revenge porn site by her boyfriend's ex. Lorena Velasco admits that she started a relationship with a man she met at work when he was still married but believed he was separated and no longer living with his wife. The relationship did not last long after Miss Velasco, who has a three-year-old son, discovered her boyfriend was chasing other women. However the soured relationship left more than broken hearts behind - after the man's scorned wife posted Miss Velasco's personal details along with pictures of her on shesahomewrecker.com last November, labeling the mother a 'w****' and claiming that she used drugs. It doesn't appear that the . defamatory profile of Miss Velasco will be taken down anytime soon - and the same goes . for hundreds of women across the U.S. who have had their nude and sexually graphic pictures posted on the site along with insults like 'fat cow', 'b****', d********' and 'pitiful, home-wrecking tramp'. The site's owner, a suburban mom who goes by the name of Ariella Alexander, defiantly says that she is doing nothing wrong and that the 'scarlet women' deserve to be publicly humiliated because they broke 'girl code' by going after someone else's husband. Scroll down for video . Lorena Velasco, from California was placed on the website shesahomewrecker.com by the scorned wife of a man she had a relationship with . Miss Velasco's pictures were stolen from her Facebook page and given by a woman to shesahomewrecker.com . Miss Velasco, from Amador County, told CBS: 'It’s hurtful. It’s very hurtful... I guess she was so scorned that she felt the need to Facebook-stalk me, steal my pictures and say these things about me.' She added: 'It hurts very badly, but I’d never blame anyone he was talking to and go after them, because that’s on him.' The ex-wife of Miss Velasco's former boyfriend writes at length as to how she believes she was wronged. The post reads: 'She is 25 years old, with a 3 year old and is now dating my 40 year old husband. They are both doing drugs, and have since both lost their jobs, and I call that karma! ' The woman who posted the profile of Miss Velasco has not been identified. Miss Velasco appears to have taken to the website to respond to the attack on her character.  In November, she wrote: 'This is crazy b*******! I’m Lorena Velasco and this is the most . disgusting thing I have ever seen you used my picture without my consent . and you slandered my name because I dated your ex after he left you! You are truly and sad excuse for a human!' Miss Velasco with her three-year-old son said that she was very hurt by the online profile that was put online labeling her a 'home-wrecker' However it doesn't appear that the defamatory profile will be taken down anytime soon - and the same goes for the hundreds of other women across the U.S. being pinned by the site as 'home-wreckers'. The site is run by Ariella Alexander, who operates under the fake name from her home in Maryland. Alexander, 36, who believes she is acting within the law, posts the often intimate pictures of the alleged 'homewreckers' along with the women's names, where they live and details about their children and occupations. The mother, who also runs a blog where . she documents her cheating ex-husband's affairs, said that she believes . some of the alleged mistresses enjoy the attention that her site brings. Alexander claims that betrayed married women from across the country have sent her more than 1,000 pictures. She told CBS that she had no intention of taking down any 'home-wrecker's profile' because sleeping with someone else's husband broke 'girl code'. A mom, with the alias Ariella Alexander, runs a revenge porn website where she names and shames alleged mistresses from her home in suburban Baltimore . It is unclear how much money Alexander makes from her business but the website has a number of ad placements. The sad tales of loyalty betrayed and marriages destroyed fill Alexander's website in an endless scrolling list. One heartbroken wife from Florida writes: 'Thanksgiving day 2013, I discovered... all the filthy deleted texts. The horrible I love you’s the descriptions of having sex in the stockroom at work. The talk of how they had sex, where they had sex and what they did to each other... The affair had been going on so long I felt sick to my stomach.' In another a Texas woman sent topless pictures to the website of her daughter's fourth-grade teacher whom her husband was allegedly having an affair. Alexander's site takes a new spin on revenge porn. Previous cases have seen men post graphic pictures of their former girlfriends and wives in order to humiliate them. The mom runs the revenge porn site from her Maryland home which allows women to name and shame their husband's alleged mistresses - often including graphic pictures . Alexander's site names and shames the women accused of sleeping . with other women's husbands - with the role of the men in these alleged affairs featuring far . less prominently on the blame scale. The alleged mistresses are tagged with . long streams of insults and expletives - 'fat cow', 'b****', d********' and 'pitiful, homewrecking tramp'. Alexander has just launched hesahomewrecker.com where blame for alleged affairs sits squarely with the men. Revenge porn sites have come under legal scrutiny as more and more disgruntled exes decide to publicly share intimate photos of former lovers in an effort to shame them. California and New Jersey passed specific laws criminalizing revenge porn - while others including Maryland, where shesahomewrecker.com operates - are considering a change in legislation. Kevin Bollaert, who ran a California-based revenge porn site, was arrested last month after extorting victims out of thousands of dollars. He was charged with 31 felonies pertaining to the publishing of 10,000 explicit photos that were sent in from the subjects' ex-partners. When women contacted Bollaert begging to have their picture and personal details removed, he required that they transfer $350 to an account linked to another one of his sites- changemyreputation.com. Alexander has no remorse for her site and shrugs off responsibility over the fact that she has no proof that these women actually are the cheating mistresses they are made out to be. She told America Tonight: 'I can’t be certain for anything I read . on the Internet if it’s true or not. 'I mean, you can’t be certain. Somebody’s telling a story.' Alexander also edits the photos she receives - often naked selfies of other women that scorned wives have taken off cheating husbands' cell phones. She won't post naked pictures of women in their early twenties but of those in their thirties, forties or fifties? 'You know better at that age' is her response. The suburban mom appears to view her website as a public service for married women. Alexander also told GMA: 'I think if one woman says, ''Oh my god, I do not want to end up on this website''...because your life is going to be destroyed.' Under current legislation - the Communications Decency Act of 1996 - Alexander is not doing nothing wrong. Section 230 of the Act says that website operators are not legally liable for the words of third parties. And Alexander's website comes with a very clear disclaimer: 'The content of all posts and comments on Shesahomewrecker.com represent the opinions of the original poster and are not endorsed, approved or representations of the opinions of Shesahomewrecker.com or its owners.'

"By . Anthony Bond . Cuba has said missiles and fighter jets found buried under sacks of sugar on a ship bound for North Korea were being sent to the secretive state to be repaired. The Caribbean nation admitted last night that it owned the military equipment and said it was due to be returned to the island once repairs had been completed. The admission came after it emerged the captain of the ship had a heart attack and tried to kill himself as authorities in Panama attempted to board the vessel last week. The 35 man crew - made up of North Koreans - tried to resist arrest by rioting with the authorities. Scroll down for video . Controversy: Cuba has said missiles found buried under sacks of sugar on a ship bound for North Korea were  being sent to the secretive state to be repaired . Speaking out: The Caribbean nation admitted last night that it owned the military equipment and said it was due to be returned to the island once repairs had been completed . The ship, which has been identified as the 14,000-ton Chong Chon Gang, was carrying missiles . and other arms 'hidden in containers underneath the cargo of sugar.' It was seized last week as it tried to cross the Panama Canal. North Korea is barred by U.N. sanctions from importing sophisticated weapons or missiles. In a statement, Cuba's Foreign Ministry said: 'The . agreements subscribed by Cuba in this field are supported by the need . to maintain our defensive capacity in order to preserve national . sovereignty'. It . said the vessel was bound for North Korea mostly loaded with sugar - . 10,000 tons of it - but added that the cargo also included 240 metric . tons of 'obsolete defensive weapons': two Volga and Pechora . anti-aircraft missile systems, nine missiles 'in parts and spares,' two . MiG-21 Bis and 15 engines for those airplanes. Concerns: The ship, which has been identified as the 14,000-ton Chong Chon Gang, was carrying missiles and other arms 'hidden in containers underneath the cargo of sugar' Held: The ship was seized last week as it tried to cross the Panama Canal . Panama President Ricardo Martinelli tweeted this picture of what he said were undeclared weapons and later identified as outdated, Soviet-era arms . It concluded by saying that Havana remains 'unwavering' in its commitment to international law, peace and nuclear disarmament. Panamanian authorities said it might take a week to search the ship, since so far they have only examined one of its five container sections. They have requested help from United Nations inspectors, along with Colombia and Britain. Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli tweeted a photo showing a green tube that appears to be a horizontal antenna for the SNR-75 'Fan Song' radar, which is used to guide missiles fired by the SA-2 air-defense system found in former Warsaw Pact and Soviet-allied nations, said Neil Ashdown, an analyst for IHS Jane's Intelligence. 'It is possible that this could be being sent to North Korea to update its high-altitude air-defense capabilities,' Mr Ashdown said. North Korea has not commented on the seizure, during which 35 North Koreans were arrested after resisting police efforts to intercept the ship in Panamanian waters last week, according to Martinelli. He said the captain had a heart attack and also tried to commit suicide. A MiG-21 similar to the ones found within the North Korean vessel that had set off from Cuba. Both countries' air forces currently use the fighter . Going home: Panamanian presidential security detail walks on the deck aboard the Chong Chon Gang, which was on its way home from Havanna carrying outdated weaponry . The 35-man crew on board the Chong Chon Gang (pictured at the Panama port) rioted and the captain tried to kill himself when Panamanian authorities intercepted it . Long haul: Panama's President Ricardo Martinelli gives a thumbs up to workers inside the Chong Chon Gang. Searching the entire cargo hold will take several more days . Powerful drug: The ship has been under scrutiny from international authorities since 2009 and Panamanian police originally boarded in the belief it carried drugs . Panama's president Ricardo Martinelli announced the ship had been detained through Twitter . The U.N. Security Council has imposed four rounds of increasingly tougher sanctions against North Korea since its first nuclear test on October 9, 2006. Under current sanctions, all U.N. member states are prohibited from directly or indirectly supplying, selling or transferring all arms, missiles or missile systems and the equipment and technology to make them to North Korea, with the exception of small arms and light weapons. The most recent resolution, approved in March after Pyongyang's latest nuclear test, authorizes all countries to inspect cargo in or transiting through their territory that originated in North Korea, or is destined to North Korea if a state has credible information the cargo could violate Security Council resolutions. 'Panama obviously has an important responsibility to ensure that the Panama Canal is utilized for safe and legal commerce,' said Acting U.S. Ambassador Rosemary DiCarlo, who is the current Security Council president. 'Shipments of arms or related material to or from Korea would violate Security Council resolutions, three of them as a matter of fact'. The crew have been arrested and the ship has been detained at the Manzanillo International terminal . Still searching: A worker inspects the Chong Chon Gang at the Manzanillo Container Terminal in Colon City. The country requested help in searching the ship from Colombia, UK, and United Nations authorities . World tour: Authorities in Panama say the ship was travelling from the Pacific coast of Russia to North Korea via the Panama Canal after a stop in Havanna . Panamanian authorities believed the ship was returning from Havana on its way to North Korea, . Panamanian Public Security Minister Jose Raul Mulino told The Associated Press. Based on unspecified intelligence, authorities suspected it could be carrying contraband and tried to communicate with the crew, who didn't respond. Martinelli said Panama originally suspected drugs could be aboard. 'Panama being a neutral country, a country in peace, that doesn't like war, we feel very worried about this military material,' Martinelli said. In early July, a top North Korean general, Kim Kyok Sik, visited Cuba and met with his island counterparts. The Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma said he was also received by President Raul Castro, and the two had an 'exchange about the historical ties that unite the two nations and the common will to continue strengthening them.' Undercover? The bags were labeled Cuban Raw Sugar . Something's wrong here: As Panamanian air and sea police oficers boarded the Chong Chong Gang, the ship's crew of 35 resisted them and then tried to resist arrest . The meetings were held behind closed doors, and there has been no detailed account of their discussions. 'After this incident there should be renewed focus on North Korean-Cuban links,' said Hugh Griffiths, an arms trafficking expert at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Griffiths said his institute told the U.N. this year that it had uncovered evidence of a flight from Cuba to North Korea that travelled via central Africa. 'Given the history of North Korea, Cuban military cooperation and now this latest seizure, we find this flight more interesting,' he said. Clued in: Photos of the crew of the Chong Chon Gang hang in the ship. As suspicious Panama authorities went aboard to conduct a search, the ship's captain had a heart attack and attempted suicide . Photos of late North Korean autocrats Kim il-Sung and Kim Jong-il hang in many of the ship's crew quarters. All 35 crew members were arrested . Panama's President Ricardo Martinelli walks up a ramp to the North Korean-flagged ship. He would later post photos of the missiles to Twitter . The Chong Chon Gang has a history of . being detained on suspicion of trafficking drugs and ammunition, . Griffiths said.

"By . Helen Lawson . The British Library is to 'harvest' billions of web pages, blogs and e-books in a bid to preserve the nation's 'digital memory'. For centuries, the library has kept a copy of every book, pamphlet, magazine and newspaper published in Britain. From Saturday, it will also be bound by new regulations to harvest the entire UK web . domain to document current events and record the country's burgeoning . collection of online cultural and intellectual works. Any reader of MailOnline will know that from the shear volume of stories produced by this website alone, the task at hand is a gargantuan one. What they've missed: The Yahoo homepage from 2003, left, and 2006, right. British Library staff are beginning a huge project to document British web pages . Archiving our online life: This Yahoo homepage from 2010 will not be part of the project which begins on Saturday, nor will the BBC homepage from 2003 . The library could eventually collect . copies of every public Tweet or Facebook page in the British web domain . as it complies with an Act of Parliament passed 10 years ago. Lucie . Burgess, leading the project at the British Library, said the . unprecedented operation would provide a complete snapshot of life in the . 21st century which increasingly plays out online. 'Stuff out there on the Web is ephemeral,' she said. Web pages including long-since updated homepages can already be found online thanks to the Internet Archive. The site, run by a not-for-profit organisation based in San Francisco, aims to offer 'permanent access for researchers, historians, scholars, people with disabilities, and the general public to historical collections that exist in digital format.' Established in 1996, it receives data 'donations' from analytics firms and has become popularly known as the Way Back Machine. As well as web pages it contains millions of examples of online text, audio, moving images and software. And it provides specialised services for blind people and others with disabilities to ensure they can access the history of the web. 'The average life of a web page is only 75 days, because websites change, the contents get taken down. 'If we don't capture this material, a critical piece of the jigsaw puzzle of our understanding of the 21st century will be lost. 'If you want a picture of what life is like today in the UK you have to look at the web,' she said. 'We . have already lost a lot of material, particularly around events such as . the 7/7 London bombings or the 2008 financial crisis. 'That material has fallen into the digital black hole of the 21st century because we haven't been able to capture it. 'The social media reaction has gone.' The . operation to 'capture the digital universe' will begin with an . automatic 'web harvest' of an initial 4.8million websites - or one . billion web pages - from the UK domain, she said. This will start tomorrow and is expected to take three months. It will then take another two months to process the data. Lucie Burgess, head of content strategy, announced that the British Library is to 'harvest' the UK web domain to preserve it alongside newspapers and magazines in its archive . People at work on their computers at the British Library, which is bound to archive the web under new regulations from Saturday . 'We . will have to distinguish between content published in the UK and . elsewhere but in principle we will be able to archive the publicly . available tweets of any individual, company or organisation,' Ms Burgess . said. 'We'll be collecting . in a single year what it took 300 years for us to collect in our . newspaper archive,' which holds 750 million pages of newsprint. The library plans to make the content publicly available by the end of this year. Until now the British Library could only preserve a relatively small handful of websites. The . 2003 Legal Deposit Library Act paved the way for the information to be . stored but copyright laws forced the library to seek permission each . time it wanted to collect web content. Under . the new regulations - which extend to the Bodleian Library in Oxford, . Cambridge University Library, the National Library of Scotland, the . National Library of Wales and Trinity College Library in Dublin - it has . the right to receive a copy of every UK electronic publication. A year of collecting web material will produce the equivalent of what it took 300 years to amass in the library's newspaper archive, Ms Burgess said . Roly Keating, chief executive of the . British Library, said: 'Ten years ago, there was a very real danger of a . black hole opening up and swallowing our digital heritage, with . millions of web pages, e-publications and other non-print items falling . through the cracks of a system that was devised primarily to capture ink . and paper. 'The Legal . Deposit Libraries Act established in 2003 the principle that legal . deposit needed to evolve to reflect the massive shift to digital forms . of publishing. 'The regulations now coming into force . make digital legal deposit a reality, and ensure that the Legal Deposit . Libraries themselves are able to evolve - collecting, preserving and . providing long-term access to the profusion of cultural and intellectual . content appearing online or in other digital formats."" The . British Library, which has invested Â£3million in the project during the . past two years, plans to collect the material by conducting an annual . trawl of the UK web domain - every website ending with '.uk'. It . will harvest information from another 200 sites - such as online . newspapers or journals - on a more regular basis, as often as once a . day. Access to the material, including archived websites, will be offered in reading rooms at each of the legal deposit libraries. Culture . Minister Ed Vaizey said: 'Legal deposit arrangements remain vitally . important. Preserving and maintaining a record of everything that has . been published provides a priceless resource for the researchers of . today and the future. The web pages will join the British Library's existing 150million items in its archive . 'So it's right that these long-standing arrangements have now been brought up to date for the 21st century, covering the UK's digital publications for the first time.' Britain is one of the first countries to commit in law to capturing its entire digital domain. The challenge is not just saving the material, but preserving it. The British Library, which has a collection of 150million items as much as 3,000 years old, says it wants researchers in future centuries to have access to the content. But anticipating changing technology can be tricky - some years ago it was suggested the library's vast collection should be saved to CD-ROM. To ensure the collection doesn't decay, there will be multiple self-replicating copies on servers around the country and staff will transfer files into updated formats as technology evolves.","New regulations mean library will document current events - as told online .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Whitey Bulger is one of the most hardened criminals in America but it has been revealed that a note from his longtime girlfriend brought him to tears. The Boston mobster had a message passed along to Catherine Grieg via his lawyer, who shuffled the note from Bulger's Massachusetts jail to the Rhode Island jail where Grieg is currently serving time. Attorney J.W. Carney offered his legal pad to Bulger, and Bulger wrote a note that Carney hand-delivered to Greig at the detention center where she was serving time for helping Bulger evade authorities. Spotted: Greig and Bulger were captured in 2011 in their then-apartment in Santa Monica, California . The Boston Globe reports that she wept as she read and wrote a reply, which also made Bulger cry. He told Carney that one of his greatest regrets was never marrying Greig. Carney says the exchange was not illegal but did not reveal what the note said, nor did he read it himself. Captive man: Whitey Bulger, 83, was sentenced to life in prison with up to 30 additional years behind bars . 'To me there is no regulation or law that should prevent people from expressing love,' Carney said at a meeting of the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. This is not the first time that Bulger expressed his love for Grieg, as he recounted their good tims together in earlier jailhouse letters. 'My 16 years on the run were the happiest years of my life and hers. Memories sustain me,' he wrote in the letter. 'If I met Catherine at a younger age I would have had a better life. She was the best thing that ever happened to me.' Greig began dating Bulger sometime in the 1970s and lived together in Boston before they went on the run in 1995. After being caught by authorities by Bulger's side in their adopted apartment in Santa Monica, California in 2011, she was recently tried and found guilty of harboring a fugitive. She is now serving an eight-year prison sentence. Bulger does not appear to be settling for his life sentence, as he writes that he is 'getting things together for appeal'. 'Jail and prisons are a dead end,' he said in the letter obtained by Radar.com. It is unclear who the intended recipient was meant to be. 'I expect the worst is yet to come — I’ll deal with it and welcome the ""peace,""' the 83-year-old convict wrote. 'Will be busy but will write you again later on — You could do me a favor. Stay out of trouble and avoid entanglement in this. Meet a nice girl and enjoy life + appreciate freedom.' Better days: Whitey Bulger wrote in a recent letter from prison that the 16 years he spent on the run with his girlfriend Catherine Greig were the best of his life (pictured together here in an undated photo) His and her sentences: Bulger faces a life sentence plus up to 30 years and Greig faces eight years behind bars . In another jailhouse letter, Bulger wrote how he finds Greig has been inappropriately sentenced, as her eight years is a larger sentence than many of the fellow mobsters who testified against him in trial. Writing that ‘her sentence is a crime,’ Mr Bulger said, signing the letter 'Inmate No. 1428AZ,' the same prisoner number he was issued during his early 1960s stay at Alcatraz. ‘More time + fine than people who confessed to murder and made deal to testify against me for the gov and in return set free after short sentence. They told the gov what it wanted to hear and were rewarded.' Of the former Winter Hill gang henchmen Mr Bulger is referring to, one is likely Stephen ‘The Rifleman’ Flemmi – a confessed murderer who pulled his victims’ teeth out to prevent identification, had a sexual relationship with his stepdaughter and lured her to a home where Mr Bulger allegedly strangled her to death, according to his testimony during Bulger’s long-awaited trial.","Whitey Bulger wrote notes on his lawyer's legal pad and then had it ferried to his girlfriend Catherine Greig while she is also behind bars .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Iran and six world powers have agreed on how to implement a nuclear deal struck in November, with its terms starting from Jan. 20, officials announced Sunday. The announcement, made first by Iranian officials and later confirmed elsewhere, starts a six-month clock for a final deal to be struck over the Islamic Republic's contested nuclear program. It also signals an easing of the financial sanctions crippling Iran's economy, though some U.S. lawmakers have called for tough measures against the country. Iran's official IRNA news agency quoted Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi confirming the news. The agency said Iran will allow the United Nations' atomic agency access to its nuclear facilities and its centrifuge production lines to confirm it is complying with terms of the deal. Deal struck: A worker rides a bicycle in 2010 in front of the reactor building of the controversial Bushehr nuclear power plant . European Union negotiator Catherine Ashton praised the deal in a statement, saying 'the foundations for a coherent, robust and smooth implementation ... have been laid.' German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier called the deal 'a decisive step forward which we can build on.' U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry welcomed the deal in a statement as well, saying further negotiations 'represent the best chance we have to resolve this critical national security issue peacefully, and durably.' Under the November agreement, Iran agreed to limit its uranium enrichment to 5 percent - the grade commonly used to power reactors. The deal also commits Iran to stop producing 20 percent enriched uranium - which is only a technical step away from weapons-grade material - and to neutralize its 20 percent stockpile. In exchange, economic sanctions Iran faces would be eased for a period of six months. During that time, the world powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - would continue negotiations with Iran on a permanent deal. The West fears Iran's nuclear program could allow it to build a nuclear bomb. Iran says its program is for peaceful purposes, such as medical research and power generation. Iran's semi-official ISNA news agency reported Sunday that under the terms of the deal, Iran will guarantee that it won't try to attain nuclear arms 'under any circumstance.' In a statement, U.S. President Barack Obama said the deal 'will advance our goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.' All systems go: The White House confirmed January 12, 2014 that a nuclear agreement with Iran will take effect from January 20, but US President Barack Obama said he was under 'no illusions' how hard it would be reach a comprehensive resolution . 'I have no illusions about how hard it will be to achieve this objective, but for the sake of our national security and the peace and security of the world, now is the time to give diplomacy a chance to succeed,' Obama said. However, U.S. lawmakers are proposing to blacklist several Iranian industrial sectors and ban banks and companies around the world from the U.S. market if they help Iran export any more oil. The provisions would only take effect if Tehran violates the interim nuclear deal or lets it expire without a follow-up accord. However, that has caused anxiety in Iran, where hard-liners have already called the deal a 'poison chalice' and are threatening legislation to increase uranium enrichment. In his statement, Obama said 'unprecedented sanctions and tough diplomacy helped to bring Iran to the negotiating table,' but caution against implementing any more. 'Imposing additional sanctions now will only risk derailing our efforts to resolve this issue peacefully, and I will veto any legislation enacting new sanctions during the negotiation,' he said.","The deal is a finalization of the tentative agreement struck late last year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A nine-year-old girl has penned a book about her younger brother in the hopes of raising a million dollars to help find a cure for his rare disease. Makenzie Lawrey, from Cape Coral, Florida wrote 'The Mighty Mito Superhero' about six-year-old Gavin who suffers from Mitochondrial Disease, which does not have a cure. The disease, which leaves cells in the body unable to produce energy, means Gavin suffers seizures that leave him tired and unable to beat infections. See below for video . Close: Six-year-old Gavin Lawrey, who suffers from Mitochondrial Disease, kisses his big sister Makenzie, who has written a book to educate and raise funds to find a cure for her brother's illness . 'He turned 18-months-old and a light switch went off and he just changed,' his mother Brandi Lawrey told NBC2. 'We'd never heard of it. We didn't know what to do.' She told WinkNews that her daughter Makenzie has always written down her thoughts but recently decided she wanted to turn them into a book to help educate others, while raising funds for a cure. So she contacted Gavin's doctor and carried out her own research before writing the book in a way it would be easy to understand. It includes photographs of her and her family throughout the years alongside descriptions of how she has helped to take care of her little brother. Determined: Makenzie, pictured reading to her brother, said she wants to raise a million dollars with the book . Educational: The book follows her brother's heroic journey through medical procedures . Journey: The book is written from Makenzie's point of view as she watches her little brother in pain . 'Gavin is my superhero,' she writes in the book. 'Gavin battles pain while teaching those around him lessons.' Makenzie explained: 'I wanted to write this book so there was . a better way for people to understand what Mito is. It makes me feel really good because I know that even if he doesn't feel good I can still help in a way.' Despite Makenzie's best intentions, her mother was initially skeptical about her daughter's aim to raise a million dollars. 'She said, ""Hopefully I can raise a million dollars"" and I said, ""A million dollars?""' Brandi said. Illness: The disease, which affects cells responsible for making energy, leaves Gavin weak. Here he is pictured with his service dog Hershey after being hospitalized following seizures at school . Caring: Nine-year-old Makenzie is pictured comforting her little brother while in hospital . Hopeful: Their mother Brandi said she has been shocked by the positive response to the book already . Makenzie added: 'And she said, ""How about $10,000? And I said, ""No, a million"".' But in less than a week, Makenzie has sold more than 500 books and collected about $20,000 - thanks to the big sister's devotion and the firm following of their Facebook fans. Mrs Lawrey encourages people to donate an amount equal to their age when they are buying the book to represent the life they hope Gavin can live, Wink reported. Follow Gavin's progress and find out more about the book on his Facebook page. Makenzie's book can be found on Amazon here. See below for video . NBC-2.com WBBH News for Fort Myers, Cape Coral . Mitochondrial disease is caused by the failure of mitochondria, which are present in every cell in the body, apart from red blood cells. They are responsible for creating energy in the body and so their failure means less energy for the cells, eventually causing cell death. If this continues to happen throughout the body, it can cause systems to fail, such as the heart, lungs or muscles. It can cause weakness, pain, poor growth, seizures, cardiac disease, the inability to fight infections or problems with swallowing, sight or hearing, among other issues. The body's weakness means that even a simple flu or cold virus can have devastating effects on the patient, and even cause death. Any illness must be treated immediately with medical interventions, like IV fluids and IV antibiotics. Around one in 4,000 children in the U.S. will develop mitochondrial disease by the age of 10. Treatments are limited and doctors often prescribe vitamins.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Michigan driver who opened fire on several cars along a highway believed government agencies were tracking him, a court heard. Raulie Casteel is contesting terrorism and assault charges after firing 23 times at vehicles on Interstate 96 over several days in October 2012. The unemployed geologist told jurors that while stuck in traffic he became filled with fear and anxiety, most likely caused by an undiagnosed paranoid thinking disorder. Scroll down for video . Paranoid: Raulie Casteel, pictured in court on Monday, says he was suffering from delusions . The 44-year-old told the assistant attorney general that he didn't think about the ramifications of the shooting before picking up the handgun that he kept in the front of his car. Despite hitting several cars only one person was injured in the attacks. Casteel said that after losing his job he started to believe his ex-employer was 'blackballing him'. He believed the company was using ties with the Army to prevent him finding another job, and he believed the government was monitoring his phone calls and sending helicopters over his home. Casteel said he also believed at the time that 'advanced technologies' used by the government may have played a part in his wife's miscarriage, and caused his young daughter and two cats to get sick. He told the court he also sensed broadcasters were trying to send him messages while he watched telecasts of Detroit Tigers games. Damage: A bullet hole can be seen on the door handle of one of the victim's cars . Close call: A hole is left by a bullet that blasted through this car door . 'Sounds kind of paranoid,' his attorney, Charles Groh, said to Casteel in court. 'It . was, yes,' he replied, adding: 'It sounds crazy now.' Mr Groh told the court his client, an experienced hunter, had been 'chasing demons' when he opened fire on the road. He claimed Casteel wasn't trying to hurt anyone, CBS Detroit reported. The shootings took place along a 100-mile stretch of road. Casteel was arrested after police matched bullet fragments from cars to his gun. Only one person was injured in the shooting, but the attack set the region on edge, with schoolchildren being kept in during recess. Victim Scott Arnold initially thought the explosion he heard was a tire blowout as he drove on I96 in Fowlerville. When . he felt pain in his side he pulled over and saw blood and a bullet hole . in his vehicle. He had been struck in the buttocks. Fearful: Jennifer Kupiec told the court she saw Casteel laugh after firing at her car . On trial: Raulie Casteel has contested terrorism and assault charges, telling a court at the time of the shootings he was suffering from extreme anxiety that made him believe government agencies were spying on him . The court heard from other drivers left traumatized by the shooting. Many didn't see the shooter, and only realized they had been shot at when they lost control of their vehicles or saw the bullet marks, ABC7 reported. Jennifer Kupiec told the court a bullet missed her by a millisecond, and that she saw Casteel  laughing when he shot at her car. 'I started to cry hysterically. I could see right away where the bullet was. I know that could have been me,' Ms Kupiec said, as she brushed away tears. Casteel is contesting terrorism and assault charges, but not firearms charges. He said after the shooting he 'knew people were scared' and that 'he might get a knock on his door someday'. The geologist, who worked on environmental clear up operations, told the court there was a history of mental illness in his family. Since . his arrest, he has been given mental health counseling and was . prescribed medication that had helped with the feelings of fear and . anxiety. However, prosecutors want the judge to tell jurors that mental illness cannot be used as a defense for the charges. Treatment: Casteel, right, at a hearing in November 2012 at which he was ordered to undergo competency and criminal responsibility examinations . Last . year, Casteel pleaded no contest but mentally ill to assault and . firearms charges in connection to related shootings . that took place there. He faces up to 12 years in prison when he is . sentenced Thursday. A no contest plea isn't an admission of guilt but is . treated as such for sentencing purposes. The mental illness plea allows him . to get treatment in prison.","Raulie Casteel tells court he was suffering anxiety when he shot at cars over several days in 2012 .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Gay inmates in California can now marry their partners, a memo has revealed. The landmark decision, announced on 30 August, follows a Supreme Court rejection of Proposition 8 - which would ban gay marriage. Prison officials announced they 'must accept and process applications for a same-sex marriage between an inmate and a non-incarcerated person in the community, in the same manner as they do between opposite sex couples'. Approved: Gay marriage will be permitted between inmates and unincarcerated partners in California . Voters approved Proposition 8 in 2008. In 2010, a federal judge found the law unconstitutional - but the bill's supporters, ProtectMarriage, appealed the ruling. On 14 August this year the case was finally rejected and closed. And as of Friday, prisoners convicted of any crime will be able to apply to the state for a marriage licence. Complying with laws for free citizens, any chaplain can refuse to marry a couple on religious grounds. Unlike British prisoners, Californian convicts will not be able to wed each other. Since 18 March 2012 killers, rapists, drug dealers and terrorists in the UK have been allowed to get hitched inside prison was given after one man's mum wrote to inmate magazine Inside Time to get the go-ahead. Convicts in Corcoran State Prison in California will be granted a marriage licence if the chaplain accepts . Unlike in Britain, the prisoners at San Quentin, California, will not be able to marry each other . 'My son is currently held as a Category A prisoner and has expressed a wish to ""marry"" (in a civil ceremony) another male Category A prisoner who is in the same jail,' the concerned woman wrote. 'I would like to know whether he would ever get permission for this and, if so, how quickly would he be able to arrange it from the prison? Are same sex civil ceremonies allowed in prison, particularly from Category A prisoners?' Category A covers the most notorious and . violent inmates in the UK, including everyone from killers to . terrorists. They are detained in the country's toughest jails - such as . Belmarsh in London - under the strictest security conditions as they are . highly dangerous to the public. In July, two Parisian prisoners became the first couple to take advantage of the law when it passed in France. Serial killer Alfredo Stranieri and . Germain Gaiffe – who beheaded a man – married inside the high-security . prison at Poissy, just outside the capital. Gaiffe, 45, wore a white wedding dress . but was ordered to change into men’s clothing. Guests included terrorist Carlos . the Jackal after the couple asked him to be their witness. The rest of the United States does not look poised to follow suit, with gay marriage illegal for 70 per cent of its citizens. In Indiana, gay people applying for marriage outside prison can be given up to three years in jail.","State prison officials released a memo stating they 'must accept' applications following Supreme Court ruling .

"By . Martin Robinson . Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell has expressed his joy at Bill Roache's acquittal today as ITV revealed the pair will be back on Coronation Street together within months. The 49-year-old, who has played mechanic Kevin Webster for decades, was himself cleared of child sex offences after a trial at Manchester Crown Court last September. Mr Le Vell said today 'I'm delighted for him' as it emerged that Roache had been acquitted of rape and indecent assault of five women. Happy: Bill Roache waves to crowds today after he was cleared of child sex offences today and has received huge support from fellow Coronation Street stars today, including Michael Le Vell, who face trial last year . Bill Roache last appeared in May 2013 with no explanation given for his . absence until two months later when viewers were told he had left to care for his grandson in Canada. ITV said after today's verdicts it was 'looking forward . to talking to Bill soon about his return to work', with sources saying it could only be a matter of months until he is back. After his arrest scriptwriters explained . away Le Vell's absence by saying his character was in Germany visiting . his father, but he will return to the screen full time this spring. Friends and colleagues of Mr Roache have expressed their . relief and support after the actor was cleared of abuse charges - and . looked forward to his return to TV. Beverley Callard, known for her . frequent appearances as the Street's Liz McDonald, said: 'Ken, there's a . pint waiting for you in The Rovers. Love ya.' Celebration time: A jubilant Michael Le Vell pictured with a pint of lager after he was found not guilty last year . Actor Antony Cotton, the programme's Sean Tully said: 'The truth will always out.' A former Coronation Street actor said he was not even in the show in the year that one of William Roache's complainants recalled seeing him at Granada studios. The woman said she remembered seeing Kenneth Cope, who played the character Jed Stone, pop his head in a dressing room where Roache was said to be talking to her and another schoolgirl in May 1965 after they took part in a children's talent show. Mr Cope gave evidence for the defence in the trial at Preston Crown Court and said it could not have happened. Speaking to Channel 5 News, he said: ‘There's a lot wrong with that because I wasn't in the show in May 65. I wasn't in the show that whole year, I would've had to have a hell of a long neck. ‘I've got an idea I was in Yugoslavia doing Genghis Khan on a horseback. I would've needed a long neck to open his door and look around it. You'd never do it anyway, it was just etiquette. You never went into anybody's dressing room.’ He continued: ‘I was very, very surprised because, basically, from what I knew about Bill, I didn't think he was capable of doing it, I didn't think it was true. He wouldn't have to. ‘Bill attracted all sorts of ladies, many ladies, he had the pick of grown-up women without having to resort to kiddies.’ Charlie . Condou, who plays Marcus Dent in Coronation Street, wrote online: 'So . glad and relieved the right verdict was reached. Look forward to seeing . Bill back at work.' Vicky Entwistle - the programme's Janice Battersby - said she and her husband Andrew Chapman were pleased with the verdict. 'Andy . and I (are) elated to hear the wonderful news that William Roache has . been cleared of all charges. We have a  very happy house,' she wrote on . Twitter. Kate Ford, who has played his on-screen stepdaughter Tracy Barlow for many years, said simply: 'Yay!' Chris . Bisson, known to viewers for his role as Vikram Desai, said he was . 'glad to hear that Bill Roache was cleared unanimously by the jury'. And Bruno Langley (the show's Todd Grimshaw) said on Twitter: 'Go on Bill.' Actor Ken Morley, who played Reg Holdsworth in the soap alongside him, said: 'Another waste of public money. 'Considering the Michael Le Vell farce, they should be careful about the waste of taxpayers money. 'My . heart goes out to Bill. We all knew it was nonsense from the outset. It . is part of the Jimmy Savile witch hunt - this all followed the demise . of the repulsive DJ from Yorkshire.' Sherrie Hewson, who played Maureen . Webster and is a friend of Bill Roache said: 'It's made me really well . up. It's just that we've all backed him for so long and I just thank God . for this day. 'We all . know Bill. We've worked with him, we know of his innocence and we knew . right from the beginning - this should never ever have gone this far. and it's made me so cross'. Supporter: Kym Marsh, who plays Michelle Connor on the Street, declared the verdict was 'justice' for her colleague . Backing: Bafta winner Daran Little, who wrote the soap for ten years, was one of many who tweeted support for Bill Roache . Tribute: Chris Bisson, who played Dev's cousin Vikram Desai, also welcomed the verdict . His Coronation Street family had backed him in court when called by the defence. Last appearance: Bill last appeared as Ken Barlow last year, pictured with Stephanie Cole, with scriptwriters saying he had gone to Canada to care for his grandson . The . court heard he was 'always a perfect gentleman' around his on-screen . wife Anne Kirkbride during filming and the actress, who plays Deirdre . Barlow, described Roache as 'lovely', adding that there was 'never a . hint or suggestion' that he had behaved inappropriately on set. Chris . Gascoyne, 45, who has played Roache's on-screen son Peter Barlow since . 2000, told the court: 'It's been a joy to be with Bill.' Asked to describe Roache's character, he said: 'Kind, warm, open, good sense of humour. Professional.' Helen Worth, who plays Gail Platt, told the court she joined the Coronation Street cast in 1974, at the age of 23. 'He was caring. Never anything more. Just caring. What more can a man be? He was lovely,' she said. She said she was 'extremely nervous' when she joined the show, but was soon made to feel welcome by everyone. She added: 'Bill perhaps was caring more and welcoming to me then and has been to every new member of the cast since.' Peter . Baldwin, who played Derek Wilton for 21 years in the soap, added: ‘It . is one person’s word against another after 50 years - it is dreadful . that it comes to court. Colleagues: Anne Kirkbride, left, who plays . Roache's wife in Coronation Street, and Helen Worth, right who plays . Gail Platt, arriving at the court to testify in his defence . ‘I am glad for Bill and not at all surprised by the verdict. It is only because of the Savile case that these other cases are being brought. 'Ken, there's a pint waiting for you in The Rovers. Love ya' Beverley Callard (Liz McDonald) ‘What was happening in those days was anybody on television had kids and girls throwing themselves at them. The groups and bands at the BBC had people queuing up at the dressing room doors.’ John Stevenson, a Street scriptwriter and friend of Roache for 40 years, said: ‘I am pleased for Bill and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty is something I believe in. ‘I have known him for 40 years and have never heard or seen him doing anything crass or aggressive to anyone. He is the most mild-mannered and non-aggressive man you could wish to meet.’","Michael Le Vell was cleared of child sex offences after trial last year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . New York City mayor Bill de Blasio has used his debut on 'The Daily Show' to take a swipe at Upper East Side residents who complained about his incredibly slow response to last month's snowstorm. The Democrat tonight admitted to host Jon Stewart the city did a bad job at plowing the rich neighborhood, before jokingly threatening to unleash a plague of locusts on its wealthy residents. 'We have an experimental effort to get locusts up in there,' he jested, after Stewart pointed out that it was already the third storm since de . Blasio took office on January 1. Scroll down for video . Dad jokes: Mayor Bill de Blasio joked to 'The Daily Show' host Jon Stewart he planned to unleash a plague of locusts on snooty Upper East Siders . When Stewart noted it 'never snowed once' during the . billionaire Bloomberg's 12 years in office, de Blasio countered: 'I think he paid the right guy. I mean, he has the money.' The new mayor was heavily criticized early last month for not clearing the streets fast enough after the city was hit by a predicted storm. Respected weatherman Al Roker led the charge, slamming de Blasio's claim that the storm arrived three hours earlier than expected. Roker's fury was followed by scores of people dangerously tumbling to the ground on snow and ice-covered streets more than 24-hours after the snowstorm hit. Breaking bread...and pizza crusts: Stewart schooled de Blasio in the art of eating pizza, New York-style, before the pair downed a drink . What was he thinking? De Blasio horrified New Yorkers after this picture of him eating pizza with a fork at Goodfellas Pizza in Staten Island on January 10 went viral . It wasn't long before Stewart schooled de Blasio in the New York art of eating pizza, after a photo of the liberal mayor using a fork and knife went viral. 'You're a man of the people, eat like one!' Stewart joked. When he presented de Blasio with a slice, the mayor responded to the good-natured test with a prop of . his own, whipping out a knife and fork from his jacket to laughter from . the studio audience. 'As mayor of Napoli - I mean, New York City - . we are always ready for our pizza,' de Blasio said. The mayor had explained his pie consumption . style as a nod to his 'ancestral homeland' of Italy. De Blasio . then used his hands to bite into a slice as Stewart slurped on a giant . soda that the mayor's predecessor, Bloomberg, had tried to ban. Unlike the normally staid Bloomberg, de Blasio frequently jokes around at his press conferences. His jokes, which often fall under the heading of 'Dad humor', have a mixed success rate with the press corps, sometimes eliciting chuckles, other times groans. His spokeswoman, Rebecca Kirszner Katz, told Politicker that de Blasio wrote his own jokes for the comedy show, filmed at the program's Manhattan studio. Supportive: De Blasio's wife, Chirlane McCray, and the couple's son, Dante, stood by the sidelines of the studio and could be seen laughing during the taping of 'The Daily Show' with host Jon Stewart . De Blasio appeared eager to show off his wit to Stewart, who suggested that the mayor's strongly liberal views had him putting up 'posters of Lenin, Stalin' at his City Hall office. The Che Guevara posters are very popular, they really are,' de Blasio retorted. De Blasio's wife, Chirlane McCray, and the couple's son, Dante, stood by the sidelines of the studio and could be seen laughing. Stewart, who once was a college roommate of failed mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, has frequently joked about his love for de Blasio and his Afro-sporting teenage son. De Blasio was far more serious earlier in the day when he said he will soon unveil new steps in his campaign to combat income inequality. De Blasio told WNYC radio that he plans to improve the city's living wage policy and will reveal other proposals during his first State of the City address next Monday.

"By . Emily Kent Smith . In Southern Bangladesh, fishermen are busy at work and receiving a helping hand from an unlikely group of companions. Swimming in circles alongside the fishing boat, two short-haired otters shriek excitedly as they navigate their way through the river which feeds into the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest. The setting is Narail, some 130 miles from the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, where  fishermen drop their net close to the riverbank and one by one, tails up, the animals dive into the water. Fishermen in Bangladash rely on otters to help them with their daily work. The otters diver under water and chase fish into the nets . The technique has been used for centuries in the area but the tradition is now dying out in parts of Asia. One fisherman Shashudhar Biswas said 'Our job depends on the otters' In recent years, once abundant fish are increasingly scarce and when fishermen drag up their nets they are often empty. The scarcity of fish within the river has been put down to pollution, over-fishing and pesticides . This is a rare technique that has been handed down for centuries in the country but a partnership which has already long died out in other parts of Asia. 'Our job depends on the otters,' said Shashudhar Biswas, a fisherman in his 50s, whose family has trained the animals to help them fish for generations. The otters do not catch the fish themselves, instead they chase them towards the fishing net placed next to the boat. 'The otters manage to spot fish among the plants, then the fish swim away and we stay close with our nets. 'If we did it without them, we wouldn't be able to catch as many fish,' said Mr Biswas' son Vipul, standing as he steers the boat along the leafy canal. Fishing is usually done during the night when the fishermen can expect to catch between four and 12 kilogrammes (8.8 and 26 pounds) of fish, shrimp and crabs. Over 25 years the number of families involved in otter fishing in the area has dropped from 500 to just 150. In 50 years the practice has declined by around 90 per cent . 'The otters manage to spot fish among the plants, then the fish swim away and we stay close with our nets,' said Mr Biswas' son Vipul . 'If we did it without them, we wouldn't be able to catch as many fish,' said Mr Biswas' son Vipul, standing as he steers the boat along the leafy canal . The family earns around $250 (£151) a month selling their catch at the local market. But in recent years, once abundant fish are increasingly scarce and when fishermen drag up their nets they are often empty. 'The kinds of fish we used to find with our father, we don't see here anymore,' said Vipul. Natural fish populations have reduced drastically in recent years, said Mohammed Mostafa Feeroz, a zoology professor at Dhaka's Jahangirnagar University, because 'the fish simply cannot breed.' 'Over-sedimentation, water pollution from oil and the use of pesticides in (rice) paddy fields, as well as overcatching are all having an impact,' Mr Feeroz said. Fishing is usually done during the night when the fishermen can expect to catch between four and 12 kilogrammes (8.8 and 26 pounds) of fish, shrimp and crabs . Otters swim alongside the fishermen, busy at work finding fish in the river in Narail, some 120 miles from the capital Dhaka . Farmers spend half of their monthly wage of £150 feeding their companions . Mr Feeroz has been studying otter fishing in Bangladesh for 25 years. Over this period, the number of families involved has dropped from 500 to just 150. 'Go back 50 years and the practice has declined by about 90 per cent,' he said. If the trend continues, he believes otter fishing will be 'completely wiped out' within the next two decades. Though still in his 20s, fisherman Vipul is equally pessimistic. 'If there are no fish, then there's no point in having the otter fishing system,' he said. 'Just look at my family's situation. My brothers and sisters, they all want to study. They don't want to get into the river and catch fish. Due to over-fishing and pollution, the river is now experiencing a shortage of fish. The number of families in the fishing industry in the local area has decreased from 500 to 150 in 25 years . Wildlife experts fear it is not only the livelihoods of the fishing families that are under threat. Short-haired otters are an endangered species in Bangladesh and otter fishing plays a key role in their conservation, according to Mr Feeroz . 'If they study then they will obviously move out of the village to find better jobs or they will buy fish from the wholesale and sell them,' he added. He worries that his only source of income will soon no longer be profitable. Each month almost half of his earnings are spent on feeding his five otters -- two fully trained adults and three young apprentices -- who consume 3-4 kilogrammes (6-9 pounds) of fish a day. And wildlife experts fear it is not only the livelihoods of the fishing families that are under threat. Short-haired otters are an endangered species in Bangladesh and otter fishing plays a key role in their conservation, according to Mr Feeroz. 'The captive population here is very healthy because of the fishing,' he said. Sometimes fishermen release otters into the wild which strengthens that population, research shows. 'But as the practice gradually decreases, the wild population will face increased pressure,' he added.","Fishermen in Narail, 130 miles from capital Dhaka, use the otters to lure fish into their nets .

"The web site of Angry Birds app maker Rovio has been hacked two days after reports that the personal data of its customers might have been accessed by U.S. and British spy agencies. Rovio spokeswoman says the hacking lasted a few minutes early Wednesday and that end-user data 'was in no risk at any point.' The hacking came after documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden suggested that the NSA and Britain's GCHQ had been able to extract information through a host of smartphone apps across the globe, including the Angry Birds game franchise. Claims made in documents provided by Edward Snowden claim popular apps such as Angry Birds (pictured) are being used to siphon up user's data . Rovio has denied the claims, saying it does not ""share data, collaborate or collude"" with any spy agencies and that it would re-evaluate third-party advertising networks. 'Our fans’ trust is the most important thing for us and we take privacy extremely seriously,' said Mikael Hed, CEO of Rovio Entertainment. 'We do not collaborate, collude, or share data with spy agencies anywhere in the world. 'As the alleged surveillance might be happening through third party advertising networks, the most important conversation to be had is how to ensure user privacy is protected while preventing the negative impact on the whole advertising industry and the countless mobile apps that rely on ad networks.

'Uninhibited collection of consumers’ personal data by governments hacking into apps is unacceptabl,' said the App Developers Alliance President Jon Potter.

It says 'One N.S.A. analyst’s enthusiasm was evident in the breathless title — “Golden Nugget!” — given to one slide for a top-secret 2010 talk describing iPhones and Android phones as rich resources.'

The 393 corpses, most of which have not been identified, were piled four wide in tunnel excavated in a local cemetery in the storm-hit city. Contained in little more than bin bags, the bodies show the scale of death visited upon the city by the unprecedented power of Typhoon Haiyan. Scroll Down for Video . Grim spectacle: Hundreds of bodies lay rotting in a hastily-constructed trench . Stark: Almost 400 bodies lie in a hastily-constructed mass grave . Gruelling: Volunteers drag the corpses into place in storm-hit Tacloban . Anonymous: The vast majority of the bodies have not been identified . Fewer than 60 of those buried have been identified. Officials in the city tallied deaths on a whiteboard, which stands at more than 4,000 in the country so far, topping a previous estimate that as few as 2,500 may have died. Tacloban mayor Alfred Romualdez said many bodies would also have been swept out to sea and their bodies lost after a tsunami-like wall of seawater slammed into coastal areas. One neighbourhood with a population of between 10,000 and 12,000 was now deserted, he added. Elsewhere in the city corpses lay decaying in the streets. Quick burial is necessary to avoid the spread of disease, as cold storage areas and morgues in have been damaged. Meanwhile, international aid is beginning to reach the most devastated areas of the country. Earlier in the day US Navy Seahawks swooped in to drop of food to desperate survivors. The images below show one drop near the devastated town of Salcedo on the east coast of Samar island, part of increased efforts to reach far-flung regions. Samar and neighbouring island Leyte took the brunt of the typhoon and suffered many of the more than 3,600 casualties announced so far.

Anguish: A young Philippino child is in pain at Bogo General Hospital, The Philippines . Earlier an RAF plane carrying heavy duty vehicles and emergency medical supplies arrived in the Philippines as part of the UK's emergency response to the disaster. The huge C-17 transport plane touched down in Cebu province to deliver two JCB diggers, two Land Rovers and a forklift truck shortly after 8am GMT after leaving RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire yesterday morning. The logistical equipment will help with the distribution of aid, clear debris left by the storm and with reconstruction work to help the millions of people who have been displaced. The news of the huge response to the Disasters Emergency Committee's (DEC) appeal comes after the BBC announced its annual Children in Need fundraiser has raised a record £31 million for disadvantaged children and young adults in the UK. Speaking on behalf of the 14 UK charities which make up the DEC, its chief executive Saleh Saeed said: 'The generosity of the public is yet again surpassing all expectations.' David Cameron also announced the Government is to give an extra £30 million in aid, bringing the total amount to £50 million. Survivors gather at Tacloban to await transport to neighboring Cebu island province . Typhoon Haiyan which ripped through Philippines last weekend has been described as one of the most powerful typhoons ever to hit land, leaving thousands dead and hundreds of thousands homeless . Countries all over the world have pledged relief aid to help support those affected by the typhoon . Speaking at a press conference in Sri Lanka ahead of the Commonwealth summit, the Prime Minister said the scale of the disaster is 'becoming clearer every day'. A C-130 Hercules aircraft, described as the 'work horse' of the RAF fleet, will also be sent over to help carry aid workers to areas that have so far been difficult to reach. And British Airways said it was offering aid agencies including Oxfam, Save the Children and Unicef an aircraft to fly emergency aid and supplies to the disaster zone. The Boeing 747 freighter, which has a capacity for up to 120 tonnes of cargo, is scheduled to leave from Stansted Airport in Essex on Monday. Typhoon Haiyan - said to be the strongest ever to make landfall - has made roads impassable and left airports out of action, severely hampering relief efforts. Asif Ahmad, British ambassador to the Philippines, was at the airport to meet this morning's delivery.

He said: 'The significance of this load is that it is heavy machinery: bulldozers, Land Rovers, machines that can actually push through the debris that is blocking aid now. 'This is vital equipment because the Philippine military and others have not been able to bring this material here.' Five UK Government flights have now delivered aid packages and at least seven more are planned to leave. These have so far delivered 14,988 shelter kits, 17,369 tarpaulins, 11,230 hygiene kits, 5,925 jerry cans and nine 4x4s. Mr Cameron said: 'Today, I can announce we are providing another £30 million to support the UN and the Red Cross emergency appeals and we are also supplying an RAF C-130 Hercules aircraft to help ensure aid workers can move between the worst affected areas and get aid to those who need it. 'A week after Typhoon Haiyan hit, the scale of the disaster is becoming clearer every day - over 3,600 dead, nearly 12 million affected. A British man, his Filipino partner and their three-year-old daughter are missing in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan. Colin Bembridge, 61, from Grimsby, Maybelle Go, 35, and daughter Victoria were last seen on Tuesday. They had been visiting family in Tacloban. A number of British nationals remain unaccounted for, Foreign Secretary William Hague said yesterday. 'I'm proud of the fact that the UK has taken the lead in international relief with rapid response of warships, aircraft and equipment.' The funding will be used to deliver vital supplies to more than 500,000 victims of the disaster and support UN and Red Cross teams working on the ground as they co-ordinate the international relief effort. A 12-strong team of British doctors, surgeons and paramedics are already in the devastated Asian country helping to treat survivors of the typhoon. Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious is also being sent to replace HMS Daring, which has already been deployed to the Philippines. The latest death toll given by Mr Cameron is an increase of more than 1,000 on estimates made by the country's civil defence agency earlier this week. But some officials estimate that the final toll, when the missing are declared dead and remote regions are reached, will be more than 10,000. Jane Cocking, of Oxfam, said: 'Oxfam's teams are already on the ground and delivering aid to some of the worst affected areas. But we urgently need to bring more supplies in and this British Airways flight will enable us to do just that, helping us to provide emergency supplies and shelter to thousands of people who are in desperate need.' Robbie McIntyre, humanitarian officer at Save the Children, said: 'This flight provides us with an invaluable opportunity to get vital water, sanitation and hygiene supplies to those in the most desperate need. We are sending equipment that will be able to provide over 310,000 litres of safe drinking water as well as equipment to support sanitary toilet facilities. 'During disasters such as this it's always a challenge to get equipment of this type into the areas of most need, so we are hugely grateful to British Airways for giving us space on this flight.' Generous holidaymakers on British cruise ships have raised thousands of pounds for Filipino crew members who fear for their families, writes Walter Harris. Collections were organised by the captains of Saga's three ships during Remembrance Sunday services last  weekend, and the money has been distributed among the 1,000 Filipino crew. During one service on Saga's ship Sapphire, Captain Alistair McLundie and chaplain Ken Newell included the Lord's Prayer in Tagalog – a language spoken in the Philippines – and members of the Filipino choir held hands. One passenger said : 'Most of the crew came from the Philippines. Several were concerned at the lack of  news about their families and one feared her brother was among the dead. 'I found the Sapphire service remarkably moving.' Captains on Cunard and P&O ships also held collections and the companies have made a joint donation of £62,000 to the Red Cross, while their American parent company, Carnival Corporation, has given $1 million (£620,000) to the relief effort. All three companies have sent representatives to the Philippines to find the families of crew members.","Volunteers in Tacloban in the Philippines arranged the bodies in bags .

"By . Dr Ellie Cannon . Last week it emerged that  14 women a year die in France as a result of taking certain contraceptive Pills. For the million-odd British women on them, it was worrying news. Responding to this data, the medicines watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory  Agency (MHRA) has urged  all GPs to consider very carefully a woman's risk of blood clots before prescribing the contraceptive. The Pill comes in many different forms and it is the  third-generation Pills such as Yasmin and Marvelon that are deemed higher-risk and more likely to cause a blood clot. Third-generation Pills such as Yasmin and Marvelon are deemed higher-risk and more likely to cause a blood clot . The medicines contain  man-made versions of the female hormones oestrogen  and progesterone, and taking these in pill form suppresses a woman's natural menstrual cycle. But the oestrogen also increase the chance of developing a clot; the specific type of oestrogen in the third-generation Pills has been shown to convey double this risk. Q. I've been on the Pill for years and vaguely remember the GP who prescribed it mentioning  side effects - now I read  there are deadly risks. Should  I stop taking it? A. This data concerns the Pills Marvelon, Yasmin and Femodene. The risks are increased on these but still  remain very small in absolute terms for individuals. Do not stop taking the Pill - the MHRA . has advised this is not necessary. Speak to your doctor again about the . risks, and if there are any concerns you should be switched to a . different type or a different contraceptive altogether. The women died from blood clots, which means either complications from a DVT or a stroke. These are known but uncommon consequences of being on the Pill. What this French data highlights is that we have to convey these risks to patients and ensure women who are high-risk are not on these Pills. Q. Who shouldn't be  on the Pill? A. There are certain absolute  no-nos for the Pill, for example any woman . known to have a clotting disorder, or hormonally driven illnesses such . as migraine with aura or breast cancer. For . other risks such as weight, smoking or high blood pressure, it is more . of a grey area and the GP and the patient weigh up those risks versus . the benefits. For example, in a woman with a  BMI over 30, the risks of a . clot are higher but the advantages are thought to outweigh those . risks.  In these types of scenarios, the discussion with the patient is . paramount, especially as there are alternative contraceptives. There are certain absolute  no-nos for the Pill, for example any woman known to have a clotting disorder . A. At the outset you have a check-up usually three months after the Pill is initiated. After that you should be monitored at between six and 12 monthly appointments. The GP should be checking your blood pressure, asking you about side effects and making sure you are taking the medicine correctly. They should also be checking  to make sure you have not developed new risk factors. For instance, if a sibling developed a spontaneous blood clot, this increases your own likelihood of developing one on the Pill. I do know some women decline their checks as they think they're fine, but in my practice we wouldn't issue the Pill to them. Q. What other kinds of  side effects should I be watching out for? A. Contraceptive Pills are generally very well tolerated but they can cause weight gain, nausea, breast tenderness,  mood swings and erratic bleeding. This usually settles down in the first few months, but if it doesn't there are many different types available and women tend to find one that will suit them. Q. Can I just stop - or do  I need to gradually  reduce my dose? A. If you are advised to stop, this would normally be done at the end of the month or cycle so as not to cause any disruption with your bleeding pattern. If you are suddenly deemed to be very  high-risk, you can stop taking the Pill immediately: this would have no significant adverse effect. Q. What are the  alternatives? A. As well as the commonly prescribed contraceptive Pills, there are also low-dose Pills that contain less oestrogen as well as mini-Pills (or Progesterone-only Pill) which contain no oestrogen. There are a whole range of  non-Pill options known as LARCs - the long-acting reversible contraceptives that have the advantage of not relying on remembering to take a Pill, and  no oestrogen, so no clot risk. These include the implant, the contraceptive injection and coils.","14 women a year die in France due to taking certain contraceptive Pills .

"By . Damien Gayle . Lord Justice Jacob at his swearing in as Lord Justice of Appeal: He has been hired by Samsung as an expert witness in a patent dispute . The appeals-court judge who forced Apple to make a high profile apology to Samsung has been hired by the South Korean firm as an expert witness in its latest patent dispute. Sir Robin Jacob will testify on behalf of Samsung during the US International Trade Commission investigation into the company's patent dispute with Ericsson. The retired judge, who is now a professor of law at University College, London, made headlines last year when he accused Apple of a 'lack of integrity'. It came the Silicon Valley said it would take them two weeks to properly comply with a court order that it publish a notice that it had lost an earlier legal fight with Samsung. Sir Robin's involvement with Samsung has raised eyebrows in the legal world. Such expert witnesses are often paid thousands of dollars for appearances. Florian Mueller, a patent blogger and intellectual property consultant, who first spotted Sir Robinâ€™s name in the case in filings to the ITC, said the involvement with Samsung's latest patent dispute 'just doesn't feel right'. 'For someone so concerned with 'integrity' it is utterly unusual to issue a high-profile and extreme ruling in favour of a particular party ... only to be hired as an expert by that same party in another dispute,' he said. He added: 'It gives the impression that a judge who deals Samsung's number one rival a huge PR blow, in a way that I found very extreme and unjustified, will be generously rewarded. 'For that reason alone, I think both Samsung and Sir Robin Jacob should not have done this. 'What would people say if Judge Lucy Koh, a few months after denying Apple a permanent injunction against Samsung, returned to private practice and was hired as an ""expert"" by Samsung in a German litigation with Ericsson?' In November last year, Sir Robin was one of three Court of Appeal judges who ordered Apple to alter a statement on its website acknowledging it had lost a legal dispute with Samsung over the Galaxy Tab. Apple had complained that the Samsung Galaxy Tab was too similar to its iPad. An Apple iPad (left) is displayed next to Samsung's Galaxy tab: A High Court judge ruled the Galaxy Tab was not 'cool' enough to be confused with Apple's iPad - a decision upheld on appeal . But a judge at the High Court in London ruled last July that the Samsung Galaxy Tab was not 'cool' enough to be confused with Apple's iPad - a decision upheld on appeal. In the subsequent litigation, Samsung said Apple had on October 26 published a notice on its website acknowledging defeat - in 'purported compliance' with a Court of Appeal order. But the firm complained that Apple had added an account of court proceedings in Germany and the United States which was 'inaccurate and misleading'. Judges agreed. 'What Apple added was false and misleading,' Sir Robin said in a subsequently published written decision. 'There is a false innuendo that the UK court's decision is at odds with decisions in other countries whereas that is simply not true.' Order: The final statement that Apple linked to on the homepage of their website in the UK . Bad Apple: The original notice posted on Apple's website, which a court said did not comply with its orders . He added that Apple bosses had shown a 'lack of integrity' by saying staff would need two weeks to make 'minor changes' to the company website - and gave them 48 hours to comply. The court also ordered Apple to run a newspaper advert with the amended text telling the public of the ruling that Samsund had not infringed its patents. In a written statement to the Financial Times, a Samsung spokesman defended Sir Robin's appointment as an expert witness for the company's latest intellectual property dispute. 'Sir Robin Jacob is not a legal representative of Samsung Electronics,' the spokesman said. 'A highly reputed intellectual property expert and academic, Sir Robin has been contracted as an expert by a law firm that represents Samsung Electronics in its case against Ericsson.'","Sir Robin Jacob will testify on Samsung's behalf in dispute with Ericsson .

Quita's case is just one of many discovered by Reuters and NBC News in their investigation of 'private re-homing'. The term used to refer to the process of pet owners looking for new homes for their animals, but has now grown to include the re-homing of humans due to the similarity in advertisements placed online. But humans are not animals, and placing them with perfect strangers raises the risk of placing them with abusers. And that seems to have been the case with the Easons. It turns out that child welfare authorities had taken away Nicole Eason's two biological children and a sheriff's deputy wrote that she and her husband had 'severe psychiatric problems' and 'violent tendencies'. Nicole Eason denies that her children were taken away from her, and says that they are still living with her - something authorities say is not true. And they had adopted children this way before on at least six occasions. In 2006, Nicole Eason and another man, Randy Winslow, adopted a 10-year-old boy online. Convicted abuser: Nicole Eason, right, adopted a 10-year-old boy with Randy Winslow, left, who was eventually arrested for sending and receiving child porn .

The 10-year-old was sent to live with a foster family and just recently turned 18. His foster parents refused to let him be interviewed. On Quita's first night with the Easons, they told her to sleep in their bed, and Quita remembers that her adoptive mother was not wearing any clothing. When asked by Reuters what her personal parenting style is, Nicole Eason responded: 'Dude, just be a little mean, OK? …  I’ll threaten to throw a knife at your a**, I will. I’ll chase you with a hose' Mother of the year: Nicole Eason says she's a 'little mean' when parenting, threatening to 'throw a knife at your a**' When Melissa Puchalla couldn't get in contact with the Easons within days of dropping Quita off, she alerted the authorities and they tracked the girl down two weeks later and sent her back to Wisconsin alone on a bus. Now 21, Quita lives by herself and is going to school. By herself: Now 21, Quita lives be herself in an apartment outside Milwaukee, Wisconsin and is going to school . American nightmares: She says she thought America would be a safer place, but that 'it turned into a nightmare' When she first came to America, she thought she was 'coming to a nicer place, a safer place. It didn't turn out that way. It turned into a nightmare'. And Quita was just one of many cases Reuters found in their investigation of private re-homing. They found entire message boards on Yahoo and Facebook dedicated to advertising adopted children and estimate that 70 per cent of the children offered were foreign-born adoptees. They come from countries all over the world, and range in age from as young as 10 months old to teenagers. Reuters analyzed 5,029 posts on one Yahoo group page over five years. One adoptive mother's post from March 2012 for her 12-year-old daughter reads: 'I would have given her away to a serial killer, I was so desperate.' One adopted child from China says after she was re-homed, her new parents made her dig her own grave. A girl from Russia says she was re-home three times in six months. When she was 13, she says she had sex with a boy at one of the homes and he urinated on her afterwards. After notifying Yahoo about the pages, the company has taken them down. But a similar page on Facebook continues to run on a private basis. A spokesman for the social network said that the page shows 'that the internet is a reflection of society'. There is one safeguard in place to protect these children: the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children. If a child is transferred into the custody of a new family in a different state, it requires both families to alart the authorities in both states so that prospective parents can be vetted. But there is no way for the ICPC to hold these parents accountable if they don't notify them. It wasn't until January 2011 that a ICPC official wrote a nationwide alert saying private re-homing online posed a 'grave danger' to children and puts them 'at substantial risk.'","An investigation by Reuters and NBC News uncovered the process of 'private re-homing'

"By . Helen Roberts . A street vendor in India got the shock of his life when he found a two-week-old baby inside a bag he stole hoping it contained cash. Kishor Kale, 20, was selling nail polish to women on a train journey, from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus to Belapur, in Mumbai, India, when he noticed an abandoned bag sitting on the side of a carriage. Hoping it had money and other valuables inside, Mr Kale picked up the bag and exited the train. The two-week-old baby boy was abandoned in a bag on a train, before the bag was stolen by Kishnor Kale and then abandoned again . But when Mr Kale later unzipped the green bag on the station platform he found a baby’s hand reach out to him. Shocked, Mr Kale tried to flee and further abandon the little baby but a vigilant station ticket collector caught him. Soon, a crowd assembled and everyone was staring at the adorable 15-day-old baby sleeping inside the bag. The police arrived and detained Mr Kale thinking he was abandoning his own baby. They are now investigating the story. The healthy baby was found in a backpack (left) before being taken to this rescue home (right) Police officer Hanuman Kharat, of Wadala Railway Police Station, said: 'We’re investigating the case and we’re using Mr Kale to help us recreate the scene and find the baby’s real family.' Police are also using CCTV footage to find out who exactly abandoned the bag on the train. Mr Kharat said: 'We are also speaking to maternity hospitals in the area to find out who has given birth to boys this week.' Doctors at the Bhabha Hospital, in Mumbai, quickly declared the baby healthy and he was temporarily sent to Asha Sadan – a children’s home in Mumbai. Mrs Vijaya Moorthy, an official at the home, confirmed they were taking care of the boy. The police officer said Mr Kale has inadvertently saved the life of the baby boy. 'He could’ve died inside the bag if Mr Kale had not mistaken the bag’s weight for money,' Mr Kharat said. 'Things happen in mysterious ways.'","Backpack was abandoned on a train near Mumbai .

But at £37.95 for a pack of 60 little pink tablets – which is only enough to last a month as women have to take two a day – the price tag alone is likely to cause a shriek. Makers Pharma Nord claim a French pine bark extract called Pycnogenol improves poor circulation, which, they say, is linked to a weakened sex drive. Scientists in Italy conducted studies on 40 volunteers in their late 40s  and early 50s, and on another group of women aged 37 to 45. Both groups reported improvements in their sex lives after eight weeks, and scientists concluded the pill ‘significantly improves sexual function’. The genuine article: Viagra . Dr Graham Jackson, chairman of the Sexual Advice Association and a cardiologist at Guy’s and  St Thomas’ Hospitals in London, said the circulation theory behind Lady Prelox may prove correct. He added: ‘We know that in men sexual dysfunction is mainly a vascular problem. 'We don’t have any concrete evidence of this in women yet, but I suspect there may turn out to be a link.’ However, obstetrician and gynaecologist Andy Heeps said he remained unconvinced. ‘Female sexual dysfunction is a complex area. There’s no single cause and so there’s no single magic bullet,’ Mr Heeps added. Dr Jackson also cautioned that such pills worked on the basis that desire was already there. ‘These aren’t aphrodisiacs,’ he warned. ‘If you’re not turned on by your partner, no amount of tablets will help.’ Lady Prelox is the female version of Prelox for men. Launched in 2010, annual European sales for Prelox now top £10 million.","New tablets on sale at health-food chain Holland & Barrett this month .

"By . Tim Shipman . Vince Cable arriving at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Glasgow for the start of the LIb Dem Party Conference . The Liberal Democrats were plunged into civil war last night as Vince Cable openly defied calls from Nick Clegg to back the Government’s economic policy. The Business Secretary signalled that he would not back a motion supporting the Coalition’s deficit reduction plans, which will be put forward by the Lib Dem leader today at the party’s conference. Mr Cable issued a statement last night saying there were ‘aspects’ of the motion he could not support. This was seen as a clear signal that he wants the Government to increase borrowing. The move came as deep splits emerged at the top of the Lib Dems over economic policy and over their continuing partnership with the Conservatives. In a speech today, Mr Cable will demand a lurch to the Left with calls to raise the minimum wage, crack down on zero hours contracts and prevent business bosses who have been banned abroad from taking directorships in the UK. He will also signal that he opposes Chancellor George Osborne’s Help to Buy scheme. It is designed to help people move up the housing ladder, but Mr Cable believes it will lead to a new housing bubble. In a sign of the simmering divisions at the top of the party, Mr Clegg and Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander yesterday slapped down Mr Cable, dismissing his concerns as unwarranted. The Lib Dem leader said Britain is ‘nowhere near’ a new bubble while Mr Alexander said: ‘We are a million miles away from a housing bubble in this country.’ Mr Clegg will urge his party to stick to the spending plans agreed with the Tories. But rather than back him up, Mr Cable is due to spend two hours preparing for his own speech to the conference in Glasgow instead of turning up to the vote. He backs a rebel amendment which calls for borrowing restrictions on councils to be lifted, allowing town hall chiefs to run up deficits to pay for new housing. Scroll down to watch Cable's speech at the Lib Dem party conference . Vince Cable and wife arriving in Glasgow for the start of the Lib Dem conference. Mr Cable has openly defied calls from Nick Clegg to back the Government¿s economic policy . Signalling his support for the rebels, his spokesman said that while ‘Vince supports the motion’ she would not confirm that he would turn up and vote. And in an open challenge to Mr Clegg’s authority, she added: ‘He thinks there are aspects of it that could be improved, drawing on the amendments.’ Mr Clegg said yesterday that he believed it would be deeply damaging to the Lib Dems to sanction increased borrowing, as Labour has been demanding. And the Deputy Prime Minister warned that the Business Secretary’s desire to distance the party from coalition policy would be an economic and political disaster. He argued that his party should be claiming credit with the Tories for the economic recovery rather than distancing themselves from it. Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg finishes speaking at a conference rally on the first day of the Lib Dem conference . The leader’s spokesman said: ‘We need to ensure we get the credit for the hard decisions we have taken.’ Mr Clegg also risked a rift with the Left of his party by hinting that he would prefer a coalition with the Tories after the next election, rather than with Labour, who Mr Cable would prefer to work with. Denouncing Labour’s calls for more borrowing, which Mr Cable now appears to back, Mr Clegg said: ‘A majority Labour government would wreck the recovery.’ Tensions between Mr Cable and Dnny Alexander are said to have boiled over at a Cabinet meeting last week . The Deputy Prime Minister said that by contrast he would go into the election with the message ‘let us finish the job, but finish the job fairly’. He said the country needed the Lib Dems in this coalition because the Conservatives ‘don’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do’. Mr Clegg signalled that his next manifesto will present new tax rises for the wealthy as ‘die in the trench’ policies. He suggested the party’s Mansion Tax plans, which would raise £2billion a year from those with homes worth more than £2million, would be a red line in negotiations. And he said the party would also demand that the threshold at which people pay income tax be raised from £10,000 to £12,500, the level of the national minimum wage. ÷Tensions between Mr Cable and Mr Alexander are said to have boiled over at a Cabinet meeting last week when the Business Secretary outlined plans to help small businesses boost growth, the Mail has learned. When Tories Oliver Letwin and Grant Shapps criticised Mr Cable for piling red tape on firms, Mr Alexander backed them up. Yesterday it was reported that Mr Cable and Mr Alexander – the party’s two leading economic ministers – ‘can barely speak to each other’.","Business Secretary signalled that he would not back a motion supporting the Coalition’s deficit reduction plans .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . For decades, residents in the Americas have been hunting for a mythical dog-like creature that sucks the blood from pets and livestock. There have been various sightings of the so-called chupacabra since the mid-1990s, yet a resident in Texas claims he not only has spotted the elusive beast - he has proof it exists. A wild creature with a dog-like face and marked skin was been seen a total of three times around the Buffalo Bayou area, including in the back garden of resident Scott Black. Scroll down for video . A wild creature with a dog-like face and marked skin, pictured, has been seen a total of three times around the Buffalo Bayou area in Texas by local resident Scott Black. Black believes it may be proof of the elusive, legendary creature the chupacabra . During an interview with local news channel KPRC, Black said: 'It had big long pointy ears, a long tail, had no fur and on its skin, and you could see splotches of grey.' Black claimed he had most recently seen the creature in his back garden of his condo and took photos of what he believes to be a chupacabra through his window. After seeing the photos, a trapper from Ohio has now placed cages in the area to try and catch it. The chupacabra comes from the Spanish chupar ‘to suck’ and cabra, which means ‘goat’. It is a type of mythical creature, called a crytpid, that is said to roam parts of the Americas attacking and drinking the blood of goats. During an interview with local news channel KPRC, Black said the creature, pictured, had 'big long pointy ears, a long tail, had no fur and on its skin, and you could see splotches of grey' - physical characteristics associated with the 'goatsucker' chupacabra .

Many local residents around the bayou, including wildlife experts, believe the animal is actually a coyote.

Griffin said that a number of Houston residents breed different canines before releasing them into the wild, and believes that this latest creature may simply be a result of this inbreeding. He added that regardless what the creature is, it doesn't look 'friendly' and has warned the neighbourhood to keep pets and small children indoors until the animal is caught. It is the third sighting of the creature in the Buffalo Bayou area in the past fortnight. The first ever sightings of the legendary . animals were in Puerto Rico in 1995. Reports at the time claimed to have seen a creature the size of a . small bear with spines along its back, a long tail and distinctive . marks on its bare skin.

"By . Chris Hastings . It's a decision that must have set Dracula spinning in his coffin. The studios that were once home  to the famous Hammer Horror  films are to be turned into a luxury housing development. The owner of Bray Studios in Berkshire says the iconic location is no longer viable for movie-making – and that he wants to put up to seven executive homes on the site. But the plan has infuriated big names in the movie business, including Terry Gilliam, director of The Fisher King, and Richard O’Brien, composer and star of The Rocky Horror Picture Show – who are backing a campaign to save the studios. The owner of Bray Studios has said the site is no longer viable for making films and he wants to turn it into luxury homes . Bray remains best known for its  15-year connection with Hammer Horror films, which featured stars including Christopher Lee (pictured with Barbara Shelley) Protesters have set up a Save Bray Studios Facebook page and started an online petition. They claim that the studios are struggling only because showbusiness agent Neville Hendricks, who owns the site near Windsor, has let it  run down. Terry Gilliam, who made use of some of Bray’s facilities for his 2009 film The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus, said: ‘There is still a place for the smaller studios like Bray. There is a feeling that things have been allowed to decay.’ Hammer bought the leasehold on the 16th Century house and transformed it and the surrounding area into a studio . Richard O’Brien, the composer and star of Rocky Horror, said: ‘I would hate to see developers turn Bray into some riverside homes.’ Bray remains best known for its 15-year connection with Hammer Horror films, which featured stars including Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. Hammer – also well known for its Eighties TV series Hammer House Of Horror – bought the leasehold on the 16th Century house and transformed it and the surrounding area into a studio. It was named Bray after the nearby village. The property provided a backdrop and location for countless Hammer ‘classics’ – including The Curse Of Frankenstein in 1957 and Dracula: Prince Of Darkness in 1966. Simon Oakes, the current chief executive of Hammer Films, now based at Ealing Studios, said: ‘I would love Bray to survive as it was an important part of the Hammer story. But I was there a couple of years ago and the facilities were pretty  dilapidated, even then.’ The development plan was approved last summer and the campaigners believe demolition work is imminent. Mr Hendricks was last night  unavailable for comment.","Owner of Bray Studios says location is no longer viable for movie-making .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A deadly strain of bird flu previously unknown in people has begun to mutate into a form more likely to cause a human pandemic, scientists say. Just days after authorities in China announced they had identified cases of H7N9, flu experts in laboratories across the world are picking through the DNA sequence data of samples isolated from patients to assess its severity. One of the world’s top flu experts, Ab Osterhaus, from the Erasmus Medical Centre in The Netherlands, says the sequences show some genetic mutations that should put authorities on alert and entail increased surveillance in animals and humans. 'The virus has to a certain extent already adapted to mammalian species and to humans, so from that point of view it’s worrisome,' he said. A deadly strain of bird flu previously unknown in people has begun to mutate into a form more likely to cause a human pandemic, say scientists . 'Really we should keep a very close eye on this.' China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission confirmed that three people had been infected with the new H7N9 flu, with two deaths of men in Shanghai aged 87 and 27 who fell sick in late February. Chinese authorities have in the past two days confirmed another six cases, including another fatal one. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the cases of H7N9 are 'of concern' because they are the first in humans. 'That makes it a unique event, which the World Health Organization is taking seriously,' the Geneva-based United Nations health agency said today. Other strains of bird flu, such as H5N1, have been circulating for many years and can be transmitted from bird to bird, and bird to human, but not from human to human. So far, this lack of human-to-human transmission also appears to be a feature of the H7N9 strain. Other strains of bird flu, such as H5N1 (pictured), have been circulating for many years and can be transmitted from bird to bird, and bird to human, but not from human to human . Flu viruses are classified based on two types of protein found on their surface, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which are abbreviated to H and N. Although it is very early days, scientists says initial analysis also suggests H7N9 does not appear to make birds particularly ill - in other words it is what is known as a low pathogenic avian influenza, of LPAI. Unfortunately, this doesn’t necessarily mean it will be mild in humans, says Wendy Barclay, a flu virology expert at Britain’s Imperial College London. Its mildness in birds could also mean H7N9 is a 'silent spreader' - harder to detect than highly pathogenic flu strains such as H5N1 that can wipe out entire flocks of wild birds or domestic poultry and are therefore far more visible. In 2003, China initially tried to cover up an epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China and killed about a tenth of the 8,000 people it infected worldwide.","Warning comes days after authorities in China announced they had identified cases of H7N9 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Crown Prosecution Service has denied claims there is a 'celebrity witch hunt', after Coronation Street actor William Roache was cleared of abuse charges. Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor for CPS North West - who announced the charges against both Mr Roache and his fellow street star Michael Le Vell  - told a child sexual exploitation conference that each case was assessed on its own merits. Mr Le Vell's aunt and several former Coronation Street colleagues claimed he had been taken to court just because of his celebrity status. Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor for CPS North West,  announced the charges against both William Roache and fellow street star Michael Le Vell . He denied claims of a celebrity witch hunt . The actor had earlier been cleared by a jury at Manchester Crown Court last September of a string of allegations made by his accuser, who claimed she had been raped and abused when she was a young girl. Mr Afzal said that they had a 'duty' to consider the evidence in all such serious cases. He added: 'When serious allegations are made and the evidence in a case passes the prosecution test it is right that a jury considers the evidence. 'That is the way our legal system works, the prosecution decides that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction whereas the jury must decide the case is proved beyond all reasonable doubt. 'When a jury delivers a verdict, no matter what it is, that is justice being done. Michael Le Vell's aunt and several former Coronation Street colleagues claimed he had been taken to court just because of his celebrity status . 'We have a duty to those who make complaints of serious offences to listen to the allegations, and assess the evidence against the same evidential standards we use for all criminal cases, no matter who makes the complaint, or who the complaint is against. 'This case was treated like any other - what mattered were the allegations and the evidence and nothing else, and we fully respect the decisions of the jury and thank them for their careful deliberation.' Mr Afzal, who is also the national lead on child sexual exploitation for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'I absolutely detest this word 'witch hunt'. 'It is not a witch hunt. We look at the evidence. We follow the evidence. We present the evidence.' He said it was then a matter for the courts and juries to decide on what was put before them. 'I am not shy about pursuing these type of cases and will continue to do so,' he said. 'The vast majority of child sex abusers are not your public figures... and they cannot be allowed to get away with it because of some discourse about ""This is some kind of campaign' that is following what happened with (Jimmy) Savile or Cyril Smith or whoever it may be.' He said he had been spoken of as a 'celeb hunter'. 'I don't even know what a ""celeb hunter"" is,' he said. 'Nobody should be above the law in this country.' He said it 'does not matter' if, when looking at evidence, 'it takes us to someone who might have drawn attention to themselves publicly in some way, shape or form'. Mr Afzal said: 'Our resolve has to be 'Is the evidence there? Can we make this evidence stronger?' 'If we can make it stronger, is it sufficient to have a realistic prospect of conviction? 'Invariably if it is child sexual abuse it will be in the public interest to prosecute it.' It is then the CPS's aim to present a 'robust prosecution' and ensure a suspect's account is tested before a jury, he said. The then director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, later told a Home Affairs Select Committee that it was the 'right decision' to pursue a prosecution of Mr Le Vell. Mr Afzal, who is also the national lead on child sexual exploitation for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'I absolutely detest this word 'witch hunt' Mr Roache, who plays the character of Ken Barlow in the soap opera Coronation Street, leaves with sons Linus (left), James (second left) and daughter Verity (right) after being cleared of all charges at Preston Crown Court . Mr Starmer said: 'A proper assessment was taken in the case and the decision to proceed was the right decision. 'There is a safeguard within our system and that is at the end of the prosecution's case in court, it is not only open to the judge it is the duty of the judge to stop the case if there's no case to answer. 'That did not happen in this case, and therefore there was a case to answer. 'That case was answered and the jury took some time to consider their verdict. 'So it was a properly brought case, it's not a case on which there was no evidence, had it been it would have been stopped half way after testing of the evidence.' He went on: 'It is true, the test for the prosecutor is a realistic prospect of conviction and the test for the jury is whether the case is proved beyond all reasonable doubt having heard all the witnesses. 'But the fact that a decision was taken to start a case and it doesn't end up in conviction does not mean it was improperly brought.'","Nazir Afzal announced charges against Roache and .

"By . Jennifer Madison . UPDATED: . 03:39 EST, 14 December 2011 . For those faced with a struggle, Captain James Arruda Henry's story is nothing short of inspirational. The 98-year-old retired lobsterman has become a first-time author, having written and published his autobiography after learning to read at the incredible age of 91. And his manuscript, entitled 'In a Fisherman's Language', even has Hollywood calling. Scroll down for video . Incredible: James Arruda Henry, 98, reads an excerpt from his manuscript, 'In a Fisherman's Language' As ABC affiliate WTNH reports, Mr . Henry, of Mystic, Connecticut, spent most of his life without even his . closest family members suspecting he was illiterate. Forced to quit school in the third grade to take odd jobs, he kept the secret close to his chest - only confiding in his late wife. Mr Henry's granddaughter, Marlisa . McLaughlin, told the station how he used tricks, like waiting for others to order at restaurants first, or asking waiters how much he owed at restaurants, to avoid the issue. A family dispute in his 90s, she said, sparked his initiative to reclaim his education. A long-awaited re-telling: The book is a collection of stories about Mr Henry's life . Accomplished: Mr Henry opens a page of his book, which features many stories about his years as a lobsterman, including the loss of a fellow fisherman, Hank . 'He signed a document he could not read about where he was going to go live,' Ms McLaughlin said, declining to offer further detail. And then, after hearing about George Dawson, a . son of slaves who learned to read at age 98 and went on to write a book . of his own, entitled 'Life Is So Good' at age 101 - Mr Henry took up . reading. 'I said if he can do it, I'm gonna try,' Mr Henry said. Starting with his name, he eventually . moved on to the ABC's and children's books. He put them down for four . years after the tragic loss of his wife. But eventually he went back to . reading and with the help of his tutor, Mark Hogan, began to log his . life. A close secret: Mr Henry was forced by his father to quit school in the third grade and take odd jobs . In writing: Mr Henry's first hand-written letter, to his nephew Bobby, hangs on a wall in his home . Early days: A photo of Mr and Mrs Henry as young loves hangs in his home. She was the only person he had ever confided to that he was illiterate . As WTNH reports, he wrote about his family's voyage . from Portugal to the U.S., how he went on to captain a lobster boat and . serve on the National Guard, his many journeys at sea and how he was . unable to save another fisherman who had fallen overboard. He became a carpenter and a plumber, and even a professional boxer - and eventually built his own home in Stonington Borough. Inspiration: Mr Henry was inspired by George Dawson, a son of slaves, who learned to read at 98 and published this book at 101 . His life stories have become so . popular, in fact, nearly 800 copies were sold in the first two weeks of . the book's release last month. One thousand more have since been . printed as requests for the book flood in from as far as Germany. And now even Hollywood producers have . approached Mr Henry about optioning the rights to his life story for a . big screen adaptation. According to WTNH, the family also now . has a book agent and a deal in the works to publish a second edition . that would include a hardcover version. Ms McLaughlin said a textbook . publisher has approached the family about featuring her grandfather's . story in one of its books - and . Kindle and Amazon want to offer an e-version. Meanwhile, the family says they are reconnecting and closer than ever as a result of Mr Henry's late-life endeavour.

"By . Arthur Martin . A city trader who conned more than £316million from wealthy investors to fund a luxurious lifestyle has been jailed for 13 years. Nicholas Levene, 48, ran a 'Ponzi' fraud scheme which he spent on private jets, super yachts, a £150,000-a-year box at Ascot and on hosting £10,000-a-day pheasant shoots. The smooth-talking son of an electrician, nicknamed Beano because of his love of the comic, tricked some of Britain's most successful businessmen into parting with cash. But in the end it all came crashing down. In a letter to the court, Levene's own father described his son's lifestyle as 'beyond comprehension and . understanding explained only by that monster, greed'. Former Stockbroker Nicholas Levene arrives for sentencing at Southwark Crown Court . The city-boy's fraud was brought to and end when investors started legal proceedings resulting in his bankruptcy and arrest . Among his victims were Stagecoach Group's co-founders, brother and sister Sir Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, who lost £10million. Richard Caring, owner of the Ivy and Le Caprice restaurants in London, was also tricked into handing over the same sum, although it is unclear how much, if any, he recouped. Levene told clients he would make them huge profits, claiming he had access to shares which were unavailable to ordinary investors. He would from time to time give them . smaller sums of cash to maintain the illusion that he was delivering . them profits. In total, he took £316million. Con artist: Levene, who was nicknamed Beano because of his love of the comic, pictured with his wife Tracy (left) and on the trading floor in 1990 . The Serious Fraud Office discovered he lost £32million of that between April 2005 and September 2009. With interest and potential profits taken into consideration, the clients are believed to have lost out by £101.6million. Levene, . a former deputy chairman of Leyton Orient Football Club, spent more . than £18million on his playboy lifestyle, habitually chartering private . jets and yachts, staying in the penthouse suites of five-star hotels and . buying properties for family members.

During . the economic boom years he was able to pay clients, but when the stock . market crashed he resorted to duping new investors. Commonly known as a 'Ponzi' scheme, his type of scam repays investors out of their own money or that of subsequent investors. The fraud was brought to an end when investors started legal proceedings which resulted in his arrest and bankruptcy. Levene had already pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to 12 counts of fraud, one count of obtaining a money transfer by deception, and one count of false accounting. Jailing him at Southwark Crown Court yesterday, Judge Martin Beddoe told Levene he had carried out a 'determined and utterly dishonest course of offending for your own aggrandisement'. 'You were truly addicted to greed and a lifestyle that you did not really have the skills or imagination to achieve,' he said. 'The sums are staggering...it has involved so many acts and moments of betrayal of people who... clearly believed they were your friends.' The £316 million that Nicholas Levene conned from people was made up of cash from some of the UK's most influential and successful people. Among his victims were Stagecoach Group's co-founders, brother and sister Sir Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, who lost £10million. And Richard . Caring (right), owner of the Ivy and Le Caprice restaurants in London, was also . tricked into handing over the same sum and he may not have got any of it back. Caring is nicknamed ‘the coat hanger king’ and lives in a vast . Hampstead house dubbed ‘the Versailles of London’. His club Annabel’s in Mayfair is the only nightclub which can boast it once had the Queen as a guest. His wealth was valued at around £450 million, and he is close to being in the 100 wealthiest people in Britain. He made his money from flooding high street fashion chains . with clothes made in the Far East, supplying, among others, his great friend, Topshop boss Sir Philip Green. Despite having no experience in . restaurants, he then built up a collection of some of the most famous . dining rooms in Britain. In 2005, he paid £31.5 million for Signature Restaurants, which owned . The Ivy, J Sheekey and Le Caprice. The group also operates the . relaunched Scott's, as well as Daphne's, Bam-Bou and the Rivington . Grill. He went on to buy Annabel's nightclub, along with Harry's Bar and . Mark's Club when he bought the Birley Group for £102million last June. In January, he completed a £105 million deal to take a Soho House chain.","Nicholas Levene ran 'Ponzi' scheme which he spent on private jets, super yachts and a £150k-a-year box at Ascot .

"By . James Chapman . and Daniel Martin . The Prime Minister will re-introduce a Bill committing whoever is in government to holding a vote by 2017 later this year . David Cameron must start from scratch in his attempts to pass legislation guaranteeing a referendum on Britain’s EU membership after it was killed off by Labour and the Liberal Democrats yesterday. The Prime Minister will re-introduce a Bill committing whoever is in government to holding a vote by 2017 later this year. He suggested he would use the Parliament Act to force the plans into law against the wishes of the House of Lords, where peers voted last night by 180 to 130 to end the debate. The Conservatives attacked Labour and . the Lib Dems as ‘enemies of democracy’ for their stance, insisting the . majority of voters want a say on the Europe issue. But . some ministers privately doubt the wisdom of the Prime Minister’s . backing for the Bill. Its failure risks confusing voters after his . public pledge to hold a referendum by 2017 if he remains in Downing . Street. And amid . growing signs of trouble for Mr Cameron’s plans to renegotiate looser . ties with Brussels before an in/out vote, Francois Hollande yesterday . publicly rebuffed hopes of fundamental EU reform yesterday by telling . him it was not a ‘priority’. The . French president used a summit between the two countries to tell the . Prime Minister that the EU ‘cannot be expected’ to follow the example of . just one country. Mr . Cameron hit back, making it clear that he wants to see changes to the . EU’s fundamental treaties before the 2017 vote. But he said he would . hold the referendum whether or not he gets substantial changes. The . Prime Minister had ordered all Conservative MPs to back the Private . Members’ Bill, introduced in the Commons by Tory backbencher James . Wharton, which would guarantee a referendum. In . a highly unusual move, a three-line whip – the strongest possible . instruction – was imposed on Tory MPs, meaning any members of the . Government who voted against would have had to resign. The . legislation cleared the Commons with a big majority but last night, . after Labour and Lib Dem whips met to agree tactics, it was effectively . killed off as peers voted to end debate. UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Tory backbencher James . Wharton who introduced the private members' bill on a European referendum criticised Labour and the Lib Dems for derailing the legislation . As well as opposition peers, crossbenchers voting against the Bill included Lord Hannay and Lord  Kerr – both former British ambassadors to the EU. Mr Cameron said last night: ‘Today the Labour Party in the House of Lords voted to block our Bill that would have ensured a referendum on Britain’s EU membership by the end of 2017. ‘This is disappointing news for all of us, but we are not going to give up in our efforts to turn our referendum commitment into law. Far from it. After all, we succeeded in passing it through the House of Commons – a huge achievement. ‘We are going to try to re-introduce the same Bill in the next session of Parliament and, if necessary, rely on the provisions in the Parliament Act to stop Labour and Liberal Democrat peers killing the Bill once again. ‘Irrespective of these attempts, the Conservative Party remains absolutely committed to giving the British people their say in  a referendum.’ At their meeting at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire Mr Hollande told Mr Cameron that change to EU treaties was 'not a priority for the time being' Mr Wharton, the MP for Stockton South . who brought forward the Bill at the behest of the Tory leadership, . said: ‘Labour and the Lib Dems have conspired in the House of Lords to . kill this important piece of legislation, doing the bidding of their . political masters in the Commons.’ Conservative HQ went further, branding Labour and the Lib Dems ‘enemies of democracy’. UKIP . leader Nigel Farage said: ‘The Labour Party have once again . demonstrated just how much they do not want ordinary people to have . their say on the EU.’ Douglas Alexander, Labour’s Shadow Foreign Secretary, said: ‘The House of Lords today has once again raised serious questions about the Prime Minister’s approach towards such a serious constitutional matter.’ As Mr Cameron and Mr Hollande met at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire to discuss plans for greater defence co-operation between Europe’s two largest military powers, Mr Hollande said change to EU treaties was ‘not a priority for the time being’. ‘France would like the UK to remain within the EU,’ he said, adding that he wanted a ‘more efficient’ and ‘better integrated’ eurozone, but that any amendments to the text of treaties were not urgent.","PM to re-introduce a Bill guaranteeing a vote by 2017 later this year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Canadian industrial rock band has sent a $666,000 bill to the Pentagon over allegations that interrogators at Guantanamo Bay used their music as a form of torture. Skinny Puppy founder Cevin Key said the band learned of the alleged tactic from a fan and former guard at the detention center who is writing a book about his experiences there. 'Someone being forced to listen to something at deafening volumes for six to 12 hour at a time until they basically defecate or urinate themselves ... it's kind of like our music is being used as a torture device or weapon,' Key said in an interview with CBC. Bill: Skinny Puppy, the Vancouver industrial rock band that sent an invoice to the U.S. military for allegedly using its music in Guantanamo Bay . Skinny Puppy: The band says its music has been played at Gitmo in the interrogation of detainees, and is now demanding $666,000 in compensation . 'I am not only against the fact they're using our music to inflict damage on somebody else, but they are doing it without anybody's permission.' He said use of the band's tracks - which utilise combinations of up-tempo drum beats, ambient music and synthesizers - was a tactic of one particular interrogator, according to the guard. Key declined to name the guard due to potential litigation in the matter. He said the band's 'music is unsettling for some to say the least, so I could only imagine if put into the wrong environment - it could be your biggest nightmare'. Musical torture: Iwouldn¿t want to be subjected to any overly loud music for six to 12 hours at a time without a break, Key said . Key acknowledged Skinny Puppy having a strong fan base among members of the military, but said he 'wouldn't have imagined it being turned around in this manner'. He said the revelation prompted the band to send a bill to the US Department of Defense for musical services rendered. 'We decided to come with a figure that would be somewhat relevant to the evilness of the deed, so basically we're invoicing them $666,000,' Key said. He said the government had not yet responded to the bill. Let the band play on: Cevin Key, the band¿s keyboardist, says the band at first planned to design an album cover based on an invoice for the U.S. government, rather than sending a physical invoice. But after learning that the government had allegedly used their music without permission, Key says the band was told it could bring a suit against the Department of Defense .","Canadian electro-industrial music genre pioneers, Skinny Puppy, recently found out their music was used to torture detainees at Guantanamo Bay .

"By . Associated Press . A former Tampa police officer was denied bail today and will remain in jail until his trial in the shooting death of a husband and father in a Florida cinema. The bail hearing for Curtis Reeves, 71, who shot Chad Oulson, 43, after an argument over texting on January 13, took a dramatic turn when prosecutors played a grainy video of the shooting and a recording of the defendant's police interview. Judge Pat Siracusa watched the video of the shooting and heard interviews with witnesses before making his decision to keep Reeves in jail until his trial for second-degree murder. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bail hearing: Former Tampa Police captain Curtis Reeves, Jr (center) sits beside his defense attorneys Richard Escobar (right) and Dino Michaels as they listen to his taped interview by detectives during his bond reduction hearing . Denied: Reeves will stay in prison until he goes on trial for fatally shooting Chad Oulson, 43, and wounding his wife, Nicole, 33, during an argument January 13 over texting at the Cobb Grove 16 theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida . The judge heard a recording of he former cop telling detectives that he should never have shot Oulson. 'As soon as I pulled the trigger, I said, ""Oh, this is stupid,"" Reeves told police. 'There's no justification for what happened in there. If I had to do it over again, it would have never happened. We would have moved.' The court also heard that Reeves' wife Vivian . Reeves told detectives that Oulson used expletives, but didn't . make any threats to her husband. She cried during the interview and said she didn't . know why her husband fired the single shot. 'He was in law enforcement 20 years, and he never shot anybody,' she said. 'He's never threatened anybody with a gun.' Reeves did not react when the judge announced his decision. His attorneys say they will appeal.

Sumner Judicial Center in Dade City Friday . Wife of the accused: Vivian Reeves (left) and son Matthew Reeves listen as a tape of a sheriff's office interview with Curtis Reeves is played in court during a court bond hearing for Curtis Reeves . Judge Siracusa urged the court to remain calm as he announced his decision. 'I’ve . been doing this long enough that no matter what I say in the next five . minutes, there are going to be a lot of people who are going to be . unhappy,' he said. 'And . it’s when you’re initially unhappy you’re tempted to say or do . something that you wouldn’t normally do. There’s probably not a better . illustration of that than what brings us here today.' Oulson's . widow, Nicole Oulson, looked relieved and sat with her eyes closed for a . moment as the judge spoke. Later, she spoke to reporters. On film: The court saw grainy surveillance footage of the altercation between Oulson and Reeves (bottom left) Witness: Another movie goer can be seen walking towards where Oulson and Reeves were arguing . 'I'm just very happy and relieved by the judge's ruling,' she said. Nicole Oulson was struck in the hand by the bullet that killed her husband. According to the police interview, Reeves said Oulson hit him in the face, possibly with a cellphone, and he shot in self-defense. Yet other witnesses, including Reeves' wife, told authorities they never saw Oulson strike Reeves. Chad and Nicole Oulson were watching the previews before the movie 'Lone Survivor' at a Wesley Chapel theater when, according to authorities, Reeves became annoyed with Chad Oulson using his cellphone. Reeves, who was with his wife Vivian, went to complain about Oulson to the movie theater managers and when he returned, the argument escalated. The video shown in court today appears to show Reeves leaning over his seat repeatedly, telling Oulson to stop texting on his cellphone. Oulson appears to throw popcorn at Reeves, then shows Reeves sit down and remain seated after shooting Oulson. Reeves' defense argued that the apparent flashes seen, however, were from Chad Oulson's cell phone and not gunshots. Vivian Reeves did tell police that Oulson stood up and leaned over toward her husband just before the shooting, and the video appears to show some sort of contact between the two men. Defense attorney Richard Escobar seized on those inconsistencies during his closing arguments to the judge and said the witnesses in the theater were 'all over the place' and that the people who saw Oulson die in the theater that day 'want to do everything they can' to help Oulson in the courtroom. Escobar argued that Reeves should be released on bail because he is a decorated, retired police captain who has deep ties to the community. Reeves pleaded not guilty. If convicted, he could face a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years in prison. Victim: Chad Oulson with his wife Nicole and their young daughter . Broken family: Former Tampa Police captain Curtis Reeves, Jr's family, (from left) daughter Jennifer Shaw, wife Vivian Reeves and son Matthew Reeves watch as Curtis is led away into custody after being denied bond . Prosecutor Manny Garcia argued that Reeves should remain in jail without bail. 'Pointing the gun, firing the gun, and his statements constitute second-degree murder,' Garcia said. 'If he left the firearm in the car, we wouldn't be here today.' Prosecutors also played a recording of a police interview with Nicole Oulson. 'He kept saying stuff to my husband,' Oulson said of Reeves. She said she didn't immediately realize her husband had been shot. 'Immediately it didn't even register with me, I just saw a spark and saw him go down,' Oulson said. She said after the shooting, Reeves 'just sat in his chair, he just kind of leaned back and just sat there, didn't try to help.' 'As all the chaos was going on, he was just sitting there,' she said. Authorities said Reeves became upset when Oulson was texting during the previews before the matinee. The Oulsons were sitting in front of Reeves and his wife. Witnesses said they didn't see Oulson hit Reeves, but some saw popcorn flying toward him.

Calm before the storm: Curtis Reeves, Jr (center) talks with his defense attorneys Richard Escobar (right) and Dino Michaels before the start of his bond reduction hearing, which was denied . 'This happened so damn fast,' Reeves told Detective Allen Proctor in the recording. Reeves also said a woman with Oulson, later identified as Nicole Oulson, was 'holding' her husband back. The same bullet that struck Chad Oulson struck Nicole in the ring finger. Reeves was charged with aggravated battery charge in that injury. The bond hearing began Wednesday. Judge Pat Siracusa heard from Reeves' family, friends and former colleagues who testified he didn't have any anger problems and would not be a flight risk. Reeves told the detective that Oulson hit him in the face and that his glasses became crooked. Reeves said to the deputy that he might have been hit with a cellphone, but prosecutors disputed that suggestion. Sharing: Attorney TJ Grimaldi and Nicole Oulson appeared on The View to talk about the shooting death of Chad Oulson . Tragic killing: Nicole Oulson says her husband Chad Oulson was texting the couple's daughter's babysitter to check that she was OK when Reeves shot him . 'It scared the hell out of me,' said Reeves, adding that had he been younger, he would have 'wrassled' Oulson to the ground. 'The guy was very aggressive.' In an interview this week on ABC's 'The View,' Nicole Oulson said her husband was texting with their daughter's baby sitter. Reeves 'had confronted my husband several times, which my husband ignored and ignored and ignored. And it just got to a point where my husband spoke up,' she said.","Curtis Reeves was denied bail today and will remain in jail until his murder trial for shooting Chad Oulson, 43, in a cinema .

Michala Hulme, from Knutsford, Cheshire, received an AGFA box camera for her birthday and found an undeveloped film, which after processing revealed four photographs. The photos are of a group of relatives or friends at a train station, and are believed to have been taken in the 1930s or 40s. Snapshot in time: Michala Hulme received a vintage camera for her birthday and was amazed to discover undeveloped negatives showing a group of people inside . Miss Hulme's boyfriend bought the AGFA box camera at a Knutsford antiques shop . Intriguingly, it shows part of a sign behind the group with rail destinations including Bournemouth, Plymouth and Penzance. The camera was bought by Miss Hulme's boyfriend at a Knutsford antiques shop but originally came from an auction in Stockport, where the 31-year-old genealogist grew up. Now she is trying to find descendants of the people in the pictures. She said: 'I received the camera from my boyfriend for my birthday on Christmas Eve. It is a German-made camera from around 1939. I had the film developed straight away at a shop in Didsbury. She said: 'Being a genealogist I know how hard it is to get pictures of peoples' ancestors so I would love to be able to reunite these pictures with the family or persons they belong to' 'Eight pictures were developed but only four were clear. They seem to show someone either visiting relatives or someone going somewhere, and are all set at a train station. AGFA was the abbreviation for Aktien-Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Anilin-Fabrikation, given in 1873 to a company that had been founded in Berlin in 1867. It produced chemicals for photography. AGFA obtained the Rietzschel camera works in Munich from Bayer in 1925 and badged all its products with its distinct rhombus logo.

"By . Helen Collis . More than a third of patients infected with a new strain of bird flu died after being admitted to the hospital earlier this year, Chinese researchers report in a new study. Since the new H7N9 bird flu first broke out in China in late March, the strain has infected more than 130 people and killed 37. The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously described H7N9 as 'one of the most lethal influenza viruses' it has ever seen and said it appeared to spread faster than the last bird flu strain, H5N1, that threatened to unleash a pandemic. After making some adjustments for missing data, the Chinese scientists estimated the overall death rate to be 36 per cent. Precautions: An employee wearing a protection suit sprays disinfectant on chickens at a poultry market in Hefei, Anhui, China, last month . The outbreak was stopped after China . closed many of its live animal markets - scientists had assumed the . virus was infecting people through exposure to live birds. That makes the new strain less deadly than H5N1, which kills about 70 per cent of the people it infects. Still, H7N9 is more lethal than the . swine flu that caused a 2009 global epidemic. That had a death rate of . less than one per cent. The results were released in two papers on the H7N9 strain, published online Monday in the journal Lancet. One article compared the new H7N9 . strain with the H5N1 strain, using data from confirmed cases of H7N9 . (130 patients) and H5N1 (43 patients) that were reported until May 24, . this year. It found that both viruses were . related to exposure to poultry - 75 per cent of patients infected with . H7N9 and 71% of those with H5N1. New strain: Researchers found that the virus effectively mutated to resist treatment in three of 14 cases (file picture) Though there was little evidence, save for a small cluster, to show that H7N9 transmitted from human to human. The new flu strain appears to infect . older people more. Researchers found the average age of infected . patients was 62 years, compared with 26 for H5N1. Men in urban areas appear to be more prone to infection than women. 'The good news is that numbers of . (H7N9) cases have stalled,' Cecile Viboud and Lone Simonsen of the U.S. National Institutes of Health wrote in a commentary accompanying the . article. However, they warned that the threat . of the virus still 'persists' and predicted that the strain might return . in the winter, when flu viruses are typically most active. Resistant: Three Shanghai sufferers of a strain of bird flu which has killed 36 people in China have shown resistance to antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu (pictured) That assessment echoes the WHO, which earlier this month also warned of the virus adapting and becoming resistant to therapy. Shanghai doctors treating 14 . sufferers of the H7N9 virus recently found that it had become resistant . to Tamiflu in three of the patients. Researchers at the Shanghai Public . Health Clinical Centre said that while the drug reduced levels of the . virus in 11 of the patients, genetic testing of bird flu in the three . who did not respond to treatment showed it was able to effectively . mutate to resist Tamiflu.","Studies of 130 confirmed cases of H7N9 found one-in-three-death rate .

"By . Jill Reilly . An iceberg twice the size of Manhattan has torn away from one of Greenland's largest glaciers. For several years, scientists had been watching a long crack near the tip of the northerly Petermann Glacier. On Monday, NASA satellites showed it had broken completely, freeing an iceberg measuring 46 square miles. Break away: A satellite image taken on Monday shows the crescent-shaped crack (shown in the red circle) on the Petermann Glacier in northwestern Greenland . A massive ice sheet covers about four-fifths of Greenland. Petermann Glacier is mostly on land, but a segment sticks out over water like a frozen tongue, and that's where the break occurred. The same glacier spawned an iceberg twice that size two years ago. Together, the breaks made a large change that's got the attention of researchers. 'It's dramatic. It's disturbing,' said University of Delaware professor Andreas Muenchow, who was one of the first researchers to notice the break. Scrutiny: A 2010 image, (left) and 2012  provided shows the formation of the crack. Scientists had been watching the 15-mile long crack in the floating ice shelf of the glacier for several years . 'We have data for 150 years and we see changes that we have not seen before.' 'It's one of the manifestations that Greenland is changing very fast,' he said. Researchers suspect global warming is to blame, but can't prove it conclusively yet. Glaciers do calve icebergs naturally, but what's happened in the last three years to Petermann is unprecedented, Muenchow and other scientists say. 'This is not part of natural variations anymore,' said NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot, who camped on Petermann 10 years ago. Ohio State University ice scientist Ian Howat said there is still a chance it could be normal calving, like losing a fingernail that has grown too long, but any further loss would show it's not natural: . 'We're still in the phase of scratching our heads and figuring out how big a deal this really is.' Many of Greenland's southern glaciers have been melting at an unusually rapid pace. The Petermann break brings large ice loss much farther north than in the past, said Ted Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo. If it continues, and more of the Petermann is lost, the melting would push up sea levels, he said. The ice lost so far was already floating, so the breaks don't add to global sea levels. Northern Greenland and Canada have been warming five times faster than the average global temperature, Muenchow said. Temperatures have increased there by about 4 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 30 years, Scambos said. The new iceberg is likely to follow the path of the one in 2010, Muenchow said. That broke apart into smaller icebergs headed north, then west and last year started landing in Newfoundland, he said. It's more than glaciers in Greenland that are melting. Scientists also reported this week that the Arctic had the largest sea ice loss on record for June.","Formed a 46 square mile iceberg when it broke away on Monday .

"By . Andy Dolan . Warning: Sean Cawthray, 41, is being hunted by police after walking out of an open jail . A sex attacker is being hunted by police after vanishing from a notorious open prison. Sean Cawthray, 41, was locked up indefinitely in 2002 after attempting to kidnap a 14-year-old girl at a bus stop. He had previously served two jail terms for rape. Yet he was sent to the low-security prison HMP Leyhill in Gloucestershire, a category D prison for ‘low-risk’ inmates. Cawthray was seen in the prison at 5.30pm on Sunday. He is thought to have left at some point during the following three hours. Police yesterday admitted the rapist was a ‘potential risk’ and warned members of the public not to approach him, but to dial 999 immediately. A police spokesman said: ‘Officers work closely with HMP Leyhill and other police forces to track down absconders promptly and keep any potential risk to the public to a minimum.’ Cawthray was jailed for four years in 1990  for rape and attempted rape, and for a  second time for eight years in 1993, after a further rape conviction. He was then given an indeterminate sentence at Leeds Crown Court in December 2002 for attempted kidnap. He accosted his teenage victim in a bus shelter in the village of Kippax, east of the city, and dragged her by the hair into an alley as passers-by looked on. The court heard the kidnap attempt was foiled by seven-year-old Harvey Jordan, who was playing in a nearby garden and shouted to his grandfather upon hearing the teenager’s stifled screams. The grandfather, Edmund Wheeler, shouted at Cawthray who let the girl go and ran off. He was arrested within an hour. Missing: Cawthray was last seen at Leyhill Open Prison in south Gloucestershire at 5.30pm on Sunday and is believed to have left the unit before 8.30pm . Cawthray, who was living in Leicester . at the time, had grown up in Leeds and was visiting childhood haunts . when he pounced on the girl. He told police he did not know what he . planned to do with the victim. Judge James Spencer QC imposed an . indeterminate sentence with a minimum recommendation of five years . because of the ‘level of risk posed to young women’. He was told he would not be released until it was satisfied he no longer posed a risk, and would then be on licence for life. Leyhill, a minimum-security jail at . Wootton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, was built as a US military hospital . in the Second World War, and was converted into a prison in 1946. It . was once dubbed ‘The Savoy of Slammers’ for its cushy regime. It houses 508 inmates deemed to have . made progress at more secure institutions or who are approaching the end . of their sentences. It has no perimeter fence and hundreds of inmates . have walked out over the past 15 years. Police believe Cawthray may have . travelled back to Leicestershire and Leeds following his escape.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . President Barack Obama has nominated the U.S. Navy's top cyber warrior to head the National Security Agency. Navy Vice Admiral Michael Rogers, a cryptologist and head of U.S. Fleet Cyber Command, is not expected to immediately make major changes to the NSA, shaken by revelations by former contractor Edward Snowden. It is a move seen as a vote of confidence in a unit that is under fire for spying on Americans and their allies. 'This is a critical time for the NSA, and Vice Admiral Rogers would bring extraordinary and unique qualifications to this position as the agency continues its vital mission and implements President Obama's reforms,' Chuck Hagel, the defense secretary, said in a statement. In the hot seat: Navy Vice Admiral Michael Rogers, a cryptologist and head of U.S. Fleet Cyber Command, is not expected to immediately make major changes to the NSA . 'I am also confident that Admiral Rogers has the wisdom to help balance the demands of security, privacy and liberty in our digital age,' Hagel said. The NSA is under fire for monitoring the communications of Americans and allies abroad as well as those of potential U.S. enemies through a sweeping eavesdropping program, the scope of which was disclosed to the media by Snowden. The documents that Snowden stole and leaked to the news media exposed the reach of U.S. surveillance activities, including the bulk collection of telephone records of millions of Americans, as part of counterterrorism efforts. Under fire: The NSA is under fire for monitoring the communications of Americans and allies abroad as well as those of potential U.S. enemies through a sweeping eavesdropping program, the scope of which was disclosed to the media by Edward Snowden (pictured) If confirmed by the Senate, Rogers would take over as head of both the NSA and the military's Cyber Command from Army General Keith Alexander, who is likely to retire in March or April. Rogers is a 30-year Navy veteran well versed in electronic surveillance. 'Obama is reaffirming his fundamental support for NSA and its surveillance projects despite the Snowden affair,' said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst who has sometimes advised the Obama administration. In response to criticism over the NSA's surveillance practices, Mr Obama vowed earlier this month as part of a series of reforms to ban eavesdropping on the leaders of allied countries and to begin reining in the collection of vast amounts of Americans' phone data. No more eavesdropping: In response to criticism over the NSA's surveillance practices, Obama vowed earlier this month to ban eavesdropping on the leaders of allied countries and to begin reining in the collection of vast amounts of Americans' phone data . Retired Gen. Michael Hayden, former director of both the NSA and the Central Intelligence Agency, said the nomination of Rogers was a vote of confidence in the signals intelligence community. 'This is a very solid team and one whose selection will calm anxieties at NSA over fears of new, misguided policies in the wake of the Snowden revelations,' he said. Mr Hagel also said Rick Ledgett had been appointed as deputy director and senior civilian leader of the NSA. He replaces Chris Inglis, who retired this month. Rogers will also lead Cyber Command, the military force responsible for defending the United States against cyber attacks. Mr Obama had initially considered splitting the leadership of the two organizations, but decided against it.","V. Adm Michael Rogers is a cryptologist and heads Fleet Cyber Command .

"By . Sam Adams . A 64-year-old farmer has become the sixth person to die from a deadly new strain of deadly bird flu in China - while 14 others are known to have contracted the H7N9 virus. The man is the second victim of the outbreak in Zhejiang province, while the others are believed to have died in Shanghai. Another person is being treated for flu-like symptoms authorities in Shanghai have announced. The deadly strain, previously . unknown in people, has begun to mutate into a form more likely to cause a . human pandemic, scientists say. Scroll down for video . A nurse attends to patients being treated on drips in a hospital in Shanghai. The city has activated an emergency response plan following four deaths of the strain of bird flu . A 48-year-old man who worked in poultry transportation in the eastern province of Jiangsu died in a hospital in the nearby city of Shanghai . A strain bird flu in China appears to have mutated so that it can spread to other animals, raising the potential for a bigger threat to people . Chinese authorities are studying the . dangerous strain, as Japan and Hong Kong have stepped up vigilance . against the virus and Vietnam has banned imports of Chinese poultry. All poultry markets in Shangai have been shut to contain the outbreak. The H7N9 bird flu strain does not appear to be transmitted from human to human but authorities in Hong Kong raised a preliminary alert and are taking precautions at their airport. In Japan, airports have put up posters at entry points warning all passengers from China to seek medical attention if they suspect they have bird flu. Authorities in Shanghai have discovered the H7N9 virus in a pigeon sample taken from a traditional wholesale market, Xinhua added, believed to be the first time the virus has been discovered in a animal in China since the outbreak began. '(China) will strengthen its leadership in combating the virus... and coordinate and deploy the entire nation's health system to combat the virus,' the Health Ministry said in a statement late on Wednesday on its website. An official lets a dog sniff out items of possible quarantine concern at Incheon International Airport in South Korea as health authorities stepped up quarantine measures to fight against a bird flu outbreak in China . Health authorities nationwide are studying the dangerous new strain and preparing isolation units for possible new infections with H7N9 avian influenza . A worker catches chickens at a market in Nanjing, eastern China's Jiangsu province. Flu experts across the world are studying samples isolated from the patients to assess the human pandemic potential of the strain . In Hong Kong, authorities activated the preliminary 'Alert Response Level' under a preparedness plan for an influenza pandemic, which calls for close monitoring of chicken farms, vaccination, culling drills, and a suspension of imports of live birds from the mainland. All passengers on flights in and out of Hong Kong were being asked to notify flight attendants or airport staff if they were feeling unwell. Vietnam said it had banned poultry imports from China, blaming the risk of H7N9 for their clampdown. Just . days after authorities in China announced they had identified cases of . H7N9, flu experts in laboratories across the world are picking through . the DNA sequence data of samples isolated from patients to assess its . severity. Other strains of bird flu, such as H5N1, have been circulating for many years and can be transmitted from bird to bird, and bird to human, but not generally from human to human. 'The gene sequences confirm that this is an avian virus, and that it is a low pathogenic form (meaning it is likely to cause mild disease in birds),' said Wendy Barclay, a flu virologist at Britain's Imperial College London. 'But what the sequences also reveal is that there are some mammalian adapting mutations in some of the genes.' Poultry is displayed for sale at a stall in a market, in Hanoi, Vietnam. The country has banned imports of Chinese poultry and other countries have quickly introduced procedures to try and keep the strain out . A Chinese vendor holds up a black chicken, often used in herbal soup, for sale in a poultry stall in a market in Beijing. The country reported its fourth death from H7N9 avian influenza today . Vietnam has banned Chinese poultry imports after China reported eleven human cases of the mutant strain . This, she said, meant the H7N9 virus has already acquired some of the genetic changes it would need to mutate into a form that could be transmitted from person to person. In Beijing, the Health Ministry said the government would swiftly communicate details of the new strain to the outside world and its own people, following complaints it had been too slow to report on the outbreak and suspicion of a cover-up. Chinese internet users and some newspapers have questioned why it took so long for the government to announce the new cases, especially as two of the victims fell ill in February. The government has said it needed time to correctly identify the virus. In 2003, authorities initially tried to cover up an epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China and killed about 10 percent of the 8,000 people it infected worldwide. While the official Xinhua news agency said it was unfair to compare SARS with H7N9, as the new bird flu virus had yet to show signs of human-to-human transmission, it did warn that the government's credibility was on the line. 'If there is anything that SARS has taught China and its government, it's that one cannot be too careful or too honest when it comes to deadly pandemics. 'The last 10 years have taught the government a lot, but it is far from enough,' it said in a commentary.","Latest victim of H7N9 virus is 64-year-old farmer from Zhejiang province .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Problem: Around 60 per cent of children have been asked to take an explicit self-portrait on their mobiles . Teachers should look through pupils’ mobile phones to delete  sexual photos, a minister said yesterday. Norman Baker, a Home Office minister, said young people had to be taught about the risks of sending intimate photographs of themselves by text, email or instant messaging – a practice known as ‘sexting’. But he came under pressure to go further and ban teenagers from owning smartphones if they are caught using handsets for bullying. The Internet Watch Foundation revealed last year that as well as being shared on teens’ smartphones, tens of thousands of explicit self-portraits taken by teenagers are ending up on websites viewed by paedophiles. Children's charity ChildLine also warns that young people are taking huge risks by taking and sending the sexual images. Some are being driven to the brink of suicide when photos sent to one person they think they can trust become widely shared online. The government has given teachers powers to search pupils for any electronic device, which human rights groups claimed amounted to an ‘excessive’ intrusion into children’s lives. Opponents likened the new rules to police controls to investigate terrorists. But Mr Baker insisted teachers must take responsibility for images on pupil’s phones, if they are being used to intimidate and harass other children. He told the Commons: ‘We have given teachers stronger powers to tackle cyber-bullying by searching for and, if necessary, deleting inappropriate images or files on electronic devices, including mobile phones. ‘It is critical to educate young people about the risks of sending intimate photographs.’ However, unions said it was not the job of teachers to police the contents of pupils' devices. Chris Keates, General Secretary of the NASUWT, said: 'It is completely inappropriate for teachers to be placed in the position of ‘policing’ pupils’ phones. 'Schools can make a valuable and important contribution to advising pupils on how to keep safe when using the internet and social media but it is not teachers’ responsibility to scrutinise and censor phones.' Home Office Norman Baker said teachers now have the power to delete images from phones, but Tory MP Sarah Wollaston called for a smartphone ban for bullies . The Child Exploitation and Online . Protection Centre has drawn up specific guidance for teachers on how to . tackle sexting in schools. This . month David Cameron announced he wanted children to be taught about the . dangers of online bullying and ‘sexting’ in sex education classes. The Prime Minister said he wanted youngsters to be warned about the perils of using the internet and smartphones. But Tory MP Sarah Wollaston called for the government to go further and ban children from using smartphones altogether if they are caught using sexting images to bully other pupils. She said: ‘Many young people have been pressured into sending intimate photographs of themselves only to find that those images are sometimes posted, distributed or shared without their consent, which is an important form of bullying and harassment.’ She asked Mr Baker: ‘What measures have been taken, and do you support measures to prevent smart phone use by those who are not mature enough to understand that it can result in an important form of bullying?’ Charities warn that some children are being driven to the brink of suicide after photos they have taken became widely shared . But Mr Baker insisted: ‘There are numerous laws in place that can be used to deal with those who behave in this appalling manner.’ ChildLine director, Peter Liver, said the rise of classroom sexting was linked, in part, to the widespread availability of porn online. One teenager, 17-year-old James, told the charity: 'Sexting is pretty normal at my age. It seems like everyone's doing it.' James said he still engaged in sexting despite the dangers. 'I do worry about who is behind the phones of the people I sext with - obviously if you don't know the person in real life there's no guarantee they are who they say they are,' he added.","Home Office Norman Baker says teachers must use powers to search .

"By . Rebecca English . Queen Elizabeth is set to get an inflation-busting pay rise of 22 per cent for 2014/2015 . The Queen is set to receive an inflation-busting 22 per cent ‘pay rise’ over two years, according to new official figures. The monarch is said to be ‘down to her last £1 million’, leaving her vulnerable to ‘unexpected costs’, a report has said. She is now expected to be given £37.9 million in 2014-15 to run her Household and conduct official engagements, up from £31 million in 2012-13. The figures were released yesterday by the National Audit Office which has, for the first time, been allowed to examine all aspects of the Queen’s funding as Head of State. But while recommending the increase, their report goes on to highlight what it describes as ‘significant reductions’ in the monarchy’s funding over the last 20 years. It says that grants for royal travel on official engagements both at home and abroad has been slashed by 76 per cent in real terms. The maintenance for royal palaces, including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, was similarly reduced by an impressive 60 per cent. That has left, according to the NAO, a huge backlog in property maintenance, with 39 per cent of occupied royal palace being deemed below their ‘target condition’. In order to cope with the shortfall the Queen’s money men have been dramatically scaling back their spending, reducing net expenditure by 55 per cent in real terms. According to the figures, that led to real-term expenditure of £32.9 million in 2011-2012, compared to £72.6million in 1991-92. In order to help meet the shortfall, the Queen has repeatedly eaten into her savings - known as ‘drawing down on reserves’ - over the years and is, apparently, down to her last £1 million in the bank. Queen Elizabeth II, shown meeting King Tupou VI of Tonga at Buckingham Palace. The National Audit Office has, for the first time, been allowed to examine all aspects of the Queen's funding as Head of State . The NAO, which scrutinises public spending for Parliament and is independent of government, says this poses serious questions about the palace’s ability to cope in an unexpected crisis if, say, the roof of Buckingham Palace fell down. ‘As part of its long-term planning the Household may need to consider whether the Reserve is adequate to meet unexpected costs,’ it says. The NAO report will be put before parliament’s powerful Public Accounts Committee on Monday as part of as investigation into royal finances. Until last year the monarch was funded by a complicated combination of civil list payments and government grants. Following an extensive review of royal finances by the government, the Queen now receives one single pot of money known as the Sovereign Grant to largely spend as she wishes on everything from funding her office to repairing the palace roof. The maintenance for royal palaces, including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, has been reduced by 60 per cent over the last 20 years . In each of the last six years, the Queen’s programme has on average seen her conduct more than 300 engagements in addition to 3,000 trips by the rest of the Royal Family , six gardens parties and more than 26 investitures. The money is taken from the Crown Estate, a wealthy portfolio of agricultural land, buildings and property - ranging from a retail park in Liverpool to London’s Regent Street - which historically belonged to the monarchy but the profits of which have, since the reign of George 111, gone to the Treasury. This year the Crown Estate announced record revenue of £253 million . As a result of protracted - and sometimes combative - negotiations with Downing Street, the monarch is now, for the first time in two centuries, entitled to keep 15 per cent of its profits with the rest going to the Treasury. This year the Crown Estate announced record revenue of £253 million. Its entire holdings are now worth an astonishing £8.1 billion and the NAO says that profits are likely to continue to rise, meaning the Queen will enjoy further increases in funding to come. The palace insists most of its extra cash will be spent on a ‘massive backlog’ of repairs to royal palaces, which the Queen holds in trust on behalf of the nation. It has long complained of having to put off millions of pounds worth of essential repairs due to those real-term falls in funding. Buckets are frequently used to catch water leaks in the picture gallery while none of the state rooms, regularly used for entertaining heads of state, have not been decorated in more than sixty years. The new NAO report also highlights the royal household’s efforts to increase income through money-spinning schemes such as renting out its facilities for commercial events. This has generated a rise of 54 per cent in profits, £11.6 million last year alone. Other nuggets in the report show that the monarch’s 436 staff cost her £19.5million a year, although anyone earning more than £21,000 has had their pay frozen since 2011 in a bid to cut bills. Last year the family spent £4.5 million on travel, a real term reduction of 30 per cent in the last decade, as royals were told to stop using private jets and take scheduled flights instead. Of that £900,000 was spent on rail journeys last year and £1.6 million on helicopters. The royal train, which was used just 15 times last year at an average cost of more than £25,000 is now under review again. Joanne Harris receives an MBE from the Queen at an Investiture Ceremony at Buckingham Palace in central London yesterday . If you’re worried that your children or grandchildren will grow up more interested in iPads than fairytales, you’re not alone. In fact, you have an unlikely new champion – the Queen. She . has shared her fears that children are more likely to play computer . games or read e-books than settle down with a traditional story. It is highly unusual for the Queen to openly express an opinion on such issues. She . made the comments as she presented author Joanne Harris with an MBE for . services to literature at Buckingham Palace yesterday. Miss Harris is perhaps best known for her bestselling novel Chocolat. Asked . about her chat with the Queen yesterday, Miss Harris said: ‘She asked . me what I thought about e-books and computer games and said that she . feared children were playing with those more than they were reading . books. ‘So I told her that we start them on e-books and computer games and TV and then try to get them on to books later.’ She . added of her MBE: ‘It’s wonderful to be recognised and it’s wonderful . to see the world of literature be recognised every time this happens to . one of us.’ Earlier . this year, the National Literacy Trust revealed that most children . preferred to read on screens rather than from books, but those who used . the new technology had weaker literacy skills. And research published this week shows tablets have become a  ‘must-have accessory’ for toddlers. Half of Britain’s two and three-year-olds use one, the OnePoll  survey revealed. Chris Heaton-Harris, Conservative member of the Public Accounts Committee, who set to quiz the Queen’s chief ‘bean counter’, Keeper of the Privy Purse Sir Alan Reid, on Monday as part of the royal finances investigation said: ‘It is the first time the PAC or parliament has had this level of access to the Royal Household’s accounts. ‘We want to show we take our responsibilities very seriously and be sure the Royal Household is giving good value for money. ‘I think this kind of scrutiny can only be good for the monarchy.’","Monarch set to be given £37.9million next year, up from £31million this year .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Firefighters battled a giant blaze fueled by 5,600 tons of rubber Saturday at the Port of Savannah, where a towering column of black smoke could be seen from miles away. By late Saturday, the fire department said its crews had contained the fire, but it could take a while for the flames to burn out inside a warehouse covering 226,000 square feet at the port's Ocean Terminal just west of downtown Savannah. 'It is contained,' Savannah Fire and Emergency Services spokesman Mark Keller said late Saturday afternoon, after the fire had burned for at least five hours. 'Will it burn all night? There's no telling. It's solid blocks of rubber that are burning.' Grey day: Smoke darkens the sky over the port in Savannah as a rubber fire burns . Burning rubber: Firefighters battle a blaze in a warehouse at the Georgia Ports Authority Ocean Terminal . Keller said firefighters were surrounding the warehouse with hoses on three sides and using industrial pumps to suck water from the Savannah River and blast in through water cannons. Crews will continue soaking into the night and Sunday if necessary. The cause of the fire wasn't immediately known, but all port workers were accounted for and unharmed. Savannah-Chatham County police closed some streets near the port terminal and smoke slowed traffic on the Talmadge Bridge that spans the Savannah River to South Carolina. Police also asked a few hotels near the port terminal and the Savannah College of Art and Design, which has buildings in the area, to either evacuate or keep people inside.

'We're not worried about the fire getting over there at this point,' said police spokesman Julian Miller. 'It's the smoke. It's going to be heavy, oily and ugly.' Robert Morris, spokesman for the Georgia Ports Authority, said the burning area contained about 5,600 tons of imported raw rubber used in manufacturing. 'The warehouse is full of rubber, so it's a rubber fire,' he said. According to KISSFM, a firewall in the middle of the warehouse helped contain the fire to half of the building and only half the cargo or about 5,600 tons of bulk rubber from Indonesia is affected by the blaze. Smoky: The sun behind Savannah City Hall is obscured by a black column of smoke as Savannah firefighters battle the blaze in a warehouse . June Kramarczyk of Bluffton, South Carolina, and her husband were traveling to Savannah when they saw the smoke plumes rising in the distance. They pulled over once they reached the river to get a better look. 'It's covering the whole sky in front of us, almost as if there was a volcano going off,' Kramarczyk said. 'We could see the smoke from 15 miles away. My husband said, ""That's got to be a huge fire.""' Morris said smoke could be seen from Tybee Island, about 18 miles east of the port terminal. The Port of Savannah is the nation's fourth-busiest seaport for containerized cargo.

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Martin Whitmarsh’s position at the head of McLaren Formula One team has been usurped by Ron Dennis, the marque’s legendary former team principal, in a coup d’etat. It was announced on Thursday that Dennis has taken over as group chief executive – the most senior position Whitmarsh held, in addition to his title of team principal. Dennis will conduct a root-and-branch investigation into the team’s failure to finish on the podium last season. Former glory: Ron Dennis, returning as McLaren Group CEO, oversaw Lewis Hamilton's title triumph in 2008 .

It is probable that Whitmarsh will be replaced, possibly moving . sideways within the business. In . what may have spelt out Whitmarsh’s fate, Dennis told the team at their . Woking headquarters in Thursday that ‘there will be changes’ and that . ‘we will win again’. His 20-minute speech was met with prolonged . applause. Perhaps tellingly, Whitmarsh was not in attendance, unlike other senior staff. It . is not thought Dennis will take over as team principal himself, given . that he has a wider brief not only as chief executive now but in . remaining as chairman of McLaren Automotive. Ross Brawn, who left Mercedes in November, is among the leading contenders having spoken to Dennis – a one-time adversary – at a shoot at the end of last year. There now appears no personal animus between the two giants of the sport to prevent such a move. Time's up: Whitmarsh's future as team principal appears untenable following the return of Dennis . Centre of attention: Dennis is back in the spotlight . 'My . fellow shareholders have mandated me to write an exciting new chapter . in the story of McLaren, beginning by improving our on-track and . off-track performance, said Dennis. 'Over . the coming weeks I intend to undertake a thorough and objective review . of each of our businesses with the intention of optimising every aspect . of our existing operations, whilst identifying new areas of growth that . capitalise on our technologies, and where appropriate further investing . in them.

Dennis, 66, has long wished to shake-up the Formula One side . of the business but met objection within the board.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Spanish artist inspired by the artwork of Salvador Dali has transformed a dead sheep into a bedside table. Oscar Tusquets created his new furniture collection as a tribute to the famous Spanish artist. He denied his latest work was inspired by a means of helping being get to sleep counting sheep. Oscar Tusquet's stuffed sheep table is part of a 21-piece collection in tribute to Spanish artist Salvador Dali. The £50,000 table and other limited edition pieces are on display in Barcelona . He said: 'We broke up the . painting, ""Interpretation Project for a stable-library"", where there . appears a characteristic Dali drawer, made up of a little lamp-table.' Deyrolle, the taxidermist business from Paris that inspired Salvador Dali was also involved in creating the tables. Many of Dali's pieces - bears, lions, lobster and swans, were linked in with Deyrolle. Emile Deyrolle who died in 1917 was a French naturalist who took over his family taxidermy business that was opened on the rue du Bac in 1881. It is still there to this day selling a wide variety of stuffed animals. The bizarre table features a typical Dali drawer and bronze legs and is currently on display in Barcelona. This sheep is part of a limited collection of 21 pieces - there were 20 white sheep and one black sheep with white legs, a reference to the popular Catalan expression 'a black sheep with white paws' meaning something that it is impossible.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The $13.6million prayerbook: This Renaissance Prayerbook is now the most valuable manuscript of its kind after selling for $13.6million at auction . This 500-year-old prayer book has fetched more than £8 million at auction, making it the most valuable of its kind in the world. The 10in high, 7in wide  manuscript sparked a bidding frenzy at Christie’s in New York. Called the Rothschild Prayerbook, it was made in the Netherlands in about 1505 and contains ornate paintings of scenes from the Bible. The 67-page book – once owned by the Rothschild banking dynasty but stolen by the Nazis – was bought by a European collector bidding by phone. Christie’s called it ‘one of the most prestigious and exquisite examples of Flemish manuscript illumination’ Known as the Book of Hours, the ornate manuscript depicts scenes from the Bible with a collection of texts, prayers and psalms and was the work of a number of master illustrators in Ghent or Bruges. But it was confiscated from Baron Louis Nathaniel von Rothschild after the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938. The Rothschild collections were earmarked for Hitler's personal art reserve, the Fuhrervorbehalt. After the war, the Rothschilds - who had fled to safety - did not return to their Vienna homes, which had been occupied by the Gestapo. They requested the return of their art collection but the Austrian government forced the family to 'donate' a third of it to Austria in order to be able to take the rest abroad. The Renaissance prayer book was not returned to the Rothschild family until 1999. They sold it at a Christie's auction in London to a private buyer for a then world record $13.4 million. Masterpiece: The 'Book Of Hours' was made in about 1505 by a number of master illustrators in Ghent or Bruges in the Netherlands . Christie's Nicholas Hall said: 'Every aspect of this book of hours - from the quality of the parchment to the wealth and refinement of the decoration - marks the Rothschild Prayerbook as one of the most prestigious and exquisite examples of Flemish manuscript illumination. 'Christie's is honoured to be entrusted with its sale for the second time in a generation.'Drawings in the book include scenes of peasant life and and shepherds dancing in a Nativity sequence. Ahead of the auction, the book went on a world tour that took in branches of the auction house in London, Moscow and Hong Kong. The manuscript is closely related to another book in the British Library. Piece of history: Nazis confiscated the prayerbook from Baron Louis Nathaniel von Rothschild in Austria in 1938.

"By . Rosie Taylor . It may be 200 years old, but this beautiful automaton silkworm still runs like clockwork. The jewel-covered 'Ethiopian Caterpillar' was made for Chinese aristocracy in the early 19th century and is one of just six or seven in existence. Now it is expected to fetch up to £200,000 when it is sold at auction by Sotheby's on Wednesday. Extravagant: The gold and enamel automaton silkworm is studded with seed pearls, rose diamonds and rubies . Automated: The 'Ethiopian Caterpillar' uses a hidden clockwork mechanism to move like a real-life silkworm . Life-like: The caterpillar's movement is triggered by a tiny lever which starts a clockwork-powered mechanism to drive tiny wheels on its underside . Made around 1810 by Swiss watchmaker Henri Maillardet, the silkworm uses a hidden clockwork mechanism to crawl and mimics the undulating movement of real-life caterpillars. Its 7cm-long body is made of gold, decorated with coloured enamel and studded with seed pearls, rose diamonds and rubies. The extravagant decoration is carefully coloured to make this example the most life-like of all the automated silkworms known to exist. Five of the others are held in European collections, including one at the Patek Phillippe museum and two in the Sandoz collection. The others are in private hands. It . was titled the 'Ethiopian Caterpillar' when Maillardet, in partnership . with legendary watchmaker Jaquet Droz, organized an exhibition to show . off his menagerie of miniaturised automata in London in 1811. He created exotic-sounding names to attract the public, hence the invention of the 'Ethiopian Caterpillar', which was accompanied by the 'Egyptian Lizard' and the 'Siberian Mouse'. According to . Sotheby's, which sold a similar caterpillar for £200,000 in 2010, it . has also been referred to as the 'Vers de soie' - meaning 'silkworm'. Treasure: The automaton silkworm is believed to have been made for the Chinese Imperial Court . Exhibition: A collection of automaton creatures was shown at the Gothic Hall, Haymarket, in 1811 . The caterpillar forms part of the auction house's Treasures: Princely Tastes sale of 49 items of furniture and decorative arts which were commissioned by or made for great European rulers and dynasties such as Catherine the Great and Napoleon. Other items in the sale include a pair of Louis XVI ivory vases, a medal cabinet made for Napoleon and a rock crystal vessel from the early 16th century featuring portraits of Pope Clement VII and Alessandro de Medici, who is thought to be his illegitimate son. Mario Tavella, deputy chairman of Sotheby’s Europe, said: 'Each of the magnificent pieces in this sale meets the definition of a “treasure”. 'In addition to their desirability relating to the sumptuous materials of which they are composed and the craftsmanship of the greatest artists of their time, these treasures - formerly the preserve of kings, princes and popes – each carry with them a fascinating story. 'The very few similar examples known today are preserved in the world’s most important museums. 'Many of the lots presented in July have been in the same collections for centuries and the sale represents a once in a lifetime opportunity to acquire them.'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . London's landscape has featured in countless images over the years but none can evoke what it's really like to be among the bustling crowds of the city centre, or to sit under the trees in Regents Park. To try and capture the unique sounds of the city, archivist Ian Rawes has created the London Sound Survey - an online collection of field recordings, sound maps, early BBC radio actuality and more. As part of this project, Rawes travelled London's canals and rivers during during 2011 and 2012 recording ambient sounds along the way and has plotted these on his Underground-inspired Waterways map. Click the image below to listen to the original recordings (opens in a new tab) Rawes travelled along Regents Canal, Grand Union canal, Beverly Brook and more. Each waterway was assigned a colour from the London Underground map . Although the map follows London’s . canals and smaller rivers, noises from other landmarks including the M4 . bridge, London Zoo and Victoria Park are also featured. The recordings are grouped together based by location and tube lines. To . use the map, click a placeholder name to listen to the recording. As . the recording plays, the file details are shown above the map. These . details include how long the clip is, the date and time it was . recorded, the location and a brief description about what can be heard. Click play to listen to the sounds of Little Venice, the M4 bridge and London Zoo . To listen to a recording, users can click a placeholder name, such as Little Venice, pictured left, to listen to the ambient sounds around that location. The recording of Little Venice, stock image pictured right, was recorded on 15 July 2011 at 6.15am and features a narrowboat's propeller churning through the water . For . example, the Victoria Park recording was taken on 9 July 2011 at 11am. It was recorded by Regent's Canal at Victoria Park, Hackney, in east . London and includes ‘loud birdsong from nearby trees and buddleia . bushes, traffic in background, a bicycle passes making a noise on loose . concrete paving slabs.’ Rawes travelled along canals, brooks and more. Each waterway has been assigned a colour from the London Underground map . ‘Listening . to a recording of the sounds of a place or event gets the imagination . working and recreates some of the sense of being there,’ explained . Rawes. ‘It feels like a worthwhile end in itself simply to share those experiences with whoever's willing to listen.’ Ian Rawes got the idea for the project while working at the British Library Sound Archives. Describing why he feels sound is the best way to document the city, Rawes told Ear Room: ‘I’d lived away from London for about ten years and found it hard to settle for a while when I moved back. 'London struck me as very anonymous and indifferent. Literary attempts to describe the city as an organism or having some sort of enduring spirit just seemed fanciful.’ Rawes admitted that the Thames is one of his favourite places because ‘you get a mixture of industry, scraps of marshland, housing, and seemingly un-owned bits of land which are used for scrambler bikes and clay-pigeon shooting’, along with Brixton that has a ‘wide array of soundscapes because it’s the pole star of Caribbean culture in London and there are several indoor and street markets.' The recordings are grouped based on where they were taken. For example, locations along the River Lea, pictured, are shown along the green line, which would traditionally represent the District Line on the original tube map .","London Sound Survey was set up by sound archivist Ian Rawes .

And in the past 11 months, Russian couple Murad Osmann and Nataly Zakharova have taken their signature picture in many more exotic locations, wearing ever more elaborate outfits. Murad, 28, who documents their travels by taking photos from his point of view as he is led to the four corners of the . globe by Nataly, 27, is now set to release a book of their romantic pictures. Scroll down for video . Nataly wears traditional dress as the couple visit the Moscow Kremlin on one of their shoots . At the Hotel Du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, France . Murad and Nataly at the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey . From the gondolas of Venice to the jungles to the Far East, each image shows his extended hand holding onto his partner's in front of him. With her back turned away from the camera, we never see her face as she guides the viewer to some of the globe's most exotic and iconic landscapes. She is seen in a variety of outfits, from hoodies to dresses and bikinis to barely anything at all. Murad, an executive producer for the film company Hype Productions, started his journey in Barcelona in October 2011, then travelled to dozens of locations, including Moscow, Hong Kong, Singapore and Bali. The couple have since visited to Madrid, New York City, Miami, Monaco and Istanbul for Murad's work. Nataly soaks up the sun in a bikini as she takes a picture on Miami Beach, Florida, USA .

The pair look out to sea in the village of Eze, France . Murad said his Nataly, a journalist from Moscow, was the inspiration for the project. 'The first photo happened in Barcelona while we were on vacation,' he told MailOnline. 'Nataly was a bit annoyed that I was always taking pictures of everything, so she grabbed my hand and tried to pull me forward. 'That said it didn't stop me from doing photos while she was pulling me. So that's how it all started.' Murad graduated as a civil engineer from Imperial College London, but later decided to pursue a career centred around his passion of photography and started his own production company.

"By . Fiona Macrae . Nature not nurture: Men are more likely to be gay if they have older brothers, according to a series of studies . The more older male siblings a man has, the greater chance he will be gay, according to a series of studies. Scientists say the phenomenon cannot be explained by the youngest boy being babied and mollycoddled or other differences in the way they are brought up. Instead, it has a biological basis, claim researchers. They believe the immune response a woman mounts against having a male baby in her womb increases with each son, raising the odds of ‘feminising’ the foetus’s developing brain. In one study, Canadian scientists collected data from almost 1,000 men, including some who had been adopted or brought up with stepbrothers and stepsisters. This revealed that having lots of brothers raised a man’s odds of being gay – but only if they were blood brothers. Stepbrothers did not have an effect, the research by Brock University in Ontario found. However, biological brothers who were brought up separately did. This suggests that the link can be explained by nature rather than nurture, New Scientist reports. Each older brother raised the odds that a man was homosexual by a third. This means that if a first-born son has a 3 per cent chance of being gay, the figure for the second son will be 4 per cent. Hormones: Scientists believe the immune response a woman mounts against having a male baby in her womb increases with each son, raising the odds of 'feminising' the foetus's developing brain . By the fourth son, the odds will have more than doubled. It . is thought that carrying a male baby in the womb triggers an immune . response in the mother,  creating antibodies that attack part of the . unborn child’s brain linked to sexual orientation. New claims: A study revealed that having lots of brothers raised a man¿s odds of being gay ¿ but only if they were blood brothers . This response gets stronger the more boys a woman carries, raising the odds of homosexuality. Genetics and exposure to hormones in the womb are also likely to be important, while some argue that upbringing plays a role in sexuality. Female foetuses do not provoke the same reaction and no link has been found between having lots of sisters and lesbianism. This week’s New Scientist reviews other studies that link physical and psychological traits to a person’s place in the order of siblings – or parity. Studies show eldest children to be more cautious but also more intelligent. Middle children tend to be more sociable while youngest children are less likely to suffer from allergies and asthma. The science magazine states: ‘Not all younger siblings will be spoilt and allergy-free, not all middle-borns will be social butterflies and not all older siblings will be tall, intelligent, responsible leaders, but our place in  parity provides fascinating insights into the complexity that makes each of us unique.’","Canadian scientists found each older brother raises odds of homosexuality by a third .

"By . Amie Keeley . One in four hip replacements may be unsafe, new research has found. Researchers at Oxford University found that 24 per cent of all hip implants available to surgeons are not backed by evidence of safety or effectiveness. They also concluded that one in 12 devices that have been used on patients, or around eight per cent, were not backed by information that they were safe. Metal on Metal: Patients with these hip replacements would need annual checks . The researchers warned that the system for regulating hip implants ‘seems to be entirely inadequate’, almost two years after a widespread scandal resulted in an alert being issued to the NHS. In February last year, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) announced almost 50,000 patients with ‘metal on metal’ hip replacements would need annual checks - including blood tests - over concerns they could cause serious health problems. Those devices were linked to muscle and bone damage and neurological issues. Tiny metal ions made up of cobalt and chromium were thought to break off from the implants and leak into the blood. Today’s research, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), involved a review of all hip implants used in surgery in 2011, taken from the National Joint Registry for England and Wales. The team concluded: ‘This systematic review of the literature shows that 8 per cent of primary hip replacement prostheses implanted in 2011 and recorded by the National Joint Registry had no readily available evidence relating to their safety or effectiveness. ‘This is likely to be an underestimation of the true problem, as much of the evidence that does exist for the other unrated prostheses is of low quality or relates to short-term outcomes only. ‘This is of great concern, particularly in light of the widespread publicity surrounding recent safety problems with regard to some resurfacing and other large diameter metal-on-metal joint replacements.’ Research: Oxford University found that 24 per cent of all hip implants are not backed by evidence of safety . An MHRA spokesman stressed that most patients who have hip replacements are not at risk. ‘The majority of patients who receive hip implants have well-functioning hips and are at a low risk of developing any serious problems,’ he said. ‘The European regulatory system for medical devices such as hip implants is currently being revised and the MHRA has argued that there needs to be more stringent audits and clearer requirements relating to the consideration of clinical evidence. ‘We also want information on the performance of devices to be more transparent and freely available. ‘In addition, a new system called “beyond compliance” is being established that promotes the availability of short- to mid-term clinical data and strengthens the evidence base for new implants in a more transparent manner. ‘This should decrease the complication and the revision rates that may be associated with newly introduced hip implants, resulting in better patient care, better patient quality of life and decreased costs to the health services.’","Oxford University found 24 per cent of hip implants not backed by evidence .

"By . Jill Reilly . Romance blossoms in the most hostile environments and even losing their homes, jobs and in many cases loved ones can not stop couples from getting married in Jordan's largest refugee camp. Hundreds of weddings have taken place in Zaatari refugee camp since it opened in 2012 and is home to 127,000 people who fled the conflict in Syria. Adjusting to camp life is a harrowing experience and CNN correspondent Atika Shubert said she was overwhelmed by the sheer number of desperate people flocking from the Syria-Jordan border to Zaatari. But she also told how she was encouraged by the residents' dogged determination to turn the camp into a home. Romance blossoms in the most hostile environments and even losing their homes, jobs and in many cases loved ones can not stop couples from getting married in Jordan's largest refugee camp . Rowaida Abu-Zaid, is a mother of two and owner of Alma's Salon for Women which is one of three wedding dress shops set up inside the camp . 'I expected it to be more grim once I . got inside the camp,' she admitted when discussing her visit to the area earlier this month to make a documentary for CNN. Shubert was particularly surprised by the camp's main street, known as the 'Champs Elysees', which features 3,000 shops, restaurants and food vendors. And of course, three wedding dress outlets. 'I had heard it was a thriving city, but the hundreds of shops were outstanding,' she explained. The UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, is . trying to create a sense of normality in the camp by encouraging trade . and services and many people who have access to cash have set up shops. A hairdresser borrowed some money and bought a variety of colourful dresses which now hang proudly on the wall of her shop inside the camp which is open every day from dawn to dusk . Her most popular rental is the first one she bought which she has nicknamed the 'Good Luck' dress  - it is adorned with crystals and has a large veil skirt . Atika Shubert has a facial at Rowaida's salon. It is profitable as at least ten weddings take place every week in the camp, according to the UN Refugee Agency . Shubert met Rowaida Abu-Zaid, a mother-of-two and owner of Alma's Salon for Women which occupys a small space in the sprawling camp. Rowaida fled the fighting with her husband and children and has lived in the camp, which is about eight miles from the Syrian border, for a year and a half. She was a hairdresser in Syria and her sister was a make-up artist, but she only came up with the idea of opening her own business when one of her clients suggested she rent out wedding dresses - it is profitable as at least ten weddings take place every week in the camp, according to the UN Refugee Agency. Rowaida borrowed some money and bought a variety of colourful dresses which now hang proudly on the wall of her shop which is open for business every day from dawn to dusk. More than 127,000 people have fled to the sprawling desert encampment since it opened in June 2012 . Thousands of people flock from the Syria-Jordan border to Zaatari to escape their war-torn homeland . In the summer Rowaida rents out four dresses a day and offers a wedding day package to customers which includes hair and make-up before they get married in one of the camp's many mosques. Rowaida has to be competitive as the other wedding dresses are rented out by her 'rival's for dinars (around £8). Her most popular rental is the first dress she bought which she has nicknamed the 'Good Luck' dress - the white garment is adorned with silver crystals and has a large veiled skirt. 'They (her customers) feel like home when they come here,' she explains. Several women refused to be filmed, but Rowaida was delighted to show off her business and Shubert reflected: 'I was really taken by her fearless attitude and candid views. 'She showed me how the simple act of applying lipstick is an act of resilience for the women of the camp.' But behind the glamour of the spa shops Shubert tells MailOnline that there is sometimes a darker reason for the high number of marriages in the camp. 'The sad reality is that families are getting their daughters married younger and younger for several reasons - it can be to another refugee with better prospects.' This is a point backed up by Rowaida who explains: 'The problem is even though they are . young their parents get them married because they are afraid about their . future. 'As in Syria there are alot of rape incidents, a lot of sexually assaulted woman that the parents have been worried about... and . want to get them married.' Many of Zaatari's children bear the physical and emotional scars of war . More than 1.7 million Syrian refugees have fled to nearby countries to escape fighting that began as protests against the government in March 2011 . More than 127,000 people have fled to the sprawling desert encampment . Shubert spent five days touring the camp and got first hand accounts of how many of Zaatari's 23,000 children bear the physical and emotional scars of war. She met six-year old Safah who survived a rocket attack on her family home in Aleppo, but was hit by a second rocket outside Damascus. When her father finally found Safah in hospital following the blast, he was distraught to discover his daughter's leg had been amputated. Now Safah, who was a bubbly child, spends her days in a wheelchair, watching as her identical twin sister dances and takes part in classes in the camp. More than 1.7 million Syrian refugees have fled to nearby countries to escape fighting that began as protests against the government in March 2011 and has degenerated into civil war with an increasingly sectarian dimension. And Shubert met dozens of Zaatari residents who all told her different, but equally heartbreaking stories of the lives they left behind in Syria. But they all share one thing in common, she explains: 'Every single Syrian refugee I spoke to said the same thing: if the war stopped today, I would be home tomorrow.' Atika’s documentary on Zaatari camp, ‘Life After War’, airs on CNN International, Saturday 22 February at 9.30am, 2pm and 9.30pm .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . These extraordinary pictures show a never-before-seen gathering of thousands of dolphins swimming together off the coast of Costa Rica. The so-called superpod of dolphins is thought to include anywhere from 3,000-5,000 creatures. In the footage, the animals can be seen propelling themselves out of the water before joining scores of others swimming deep under the water's surface. Scroll down for video . Never-before-seen: A superpod of dolphins (pictured) was filmed by documentary makers using robot cameras off the coast of Costa Rica . Some of the footage was taken by cameramen both in and above the water, using long-lens and slow motion techniques. But the most amazing, detailed scenes came from cameras installed 'spy creatures' - fake animals with cameras built into their mouths and eyes. Filmmakers created the underwater cameras - which are capable of going at least 25 meters below the surface - in turtles, tuna, and squids to produce the footage, which shows ocean life in more detail than ever. Jumping: The group of animals was thought to contain anywhere between 3,000-5,000 dolphins . In these pictures of the dolphins, footage from above the water was filmed by 'turtle cam' and below by 'tuna cam'. The remarkable footage was filmed as part of a new natural history documentary Dolphins - Spy in the Pod, aired for the first time last night on BBC One. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, series producer Rob Pilley said: 'It is about the animals accepting the cameras. 'First of all, if you want to get close to them, you have to look like things that are familiar to them. 'The close proximity that these devices gave you is something that a cameraman or woman could not get. Remarkable: Filmmakers used robotic turtles and tunas to capture some of up-close shots . In action: Some of the 'spy creatures' didn't make it through filming, with one squid cam falling victim to a giant fish . 'About 40 to 50 per cent of the footage has never been seen before, let along never been filmed.' However, some of the spy creatures didn't make it through the filming process. 'Squid cam was eaten by a giant fish,' Mr Pilley added. As well as showing the animals in amazing detail, the documentary makers discovered some, perhaps surprising habits the dolphins had. Mr Pilley said, just like humans, dolphins visit a sort of day spa to remove any dead skin. Habits: As well as some amazing footage, the documentary makers learned about the living habits of the creatures . He added: 'We found there was a certain rocky outcrop on this coral reef off the coast of Mozambique which dolphins on a daily basis would visit. 'They go and have a good old scrub session.' The producer created the series with director John Downer - who has used the technique in several documentaries previously, most recently Penguins - Spy in the Huddle, filmed in the Antarctica. Mr Downer said: 'It all started with boulder cam when we were filming lions. 'That's where it all started and now this is our eighth one.' Dolphins - Spy in the Pod began on January 2 on BBC One at 8pm.","Never-before-seen footage of 3,000-5,000 dolphins filmed by 'spy creatures'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Brighton bomb hero Brian Murray, who died on March 16, was awarded the British Empire Medal for his heroism . An ambulance man credited with saving Norman Tebbit in the aftermath of the Brighton bombing has died. Brian Murray, 76, was one of the first paramedics on the scene after the IRA targeted the Grand Hotel in the 1984 attack. Mr Murray ran into the hotel before  he had time to put on his safety equipment to save politicians staying there during the Conservative Party conference. He rescued Lord Tebbit, who was trapped on the ground floor, before returning to pull Chief Whip John Wakeman and MP Sir Walter Clegg to safety. Lord Tebbit led the tributes to Mr Murray, who was awarded the British Empire Medal for his bravery. He said: ‘My wife and I remain profoundly grateful to all of those in the emergency services who played their part in rescuing us and others at The Grand. My recollections of that night are not unnaturally blurred but I remember the kindness and gentleness with which the paramedics including Mr Murray took me from the hands of the firemen who dug us out and took us to the hospital. ‘The last thing I remember of that evening was one of the paramedics, perhaps Mr Murray, asking me if I was allergic to anything. I said: “Only bombs”.’ Mr Murray, who lived in Brighton with his wife Gillian, 64, received messages at the time from the Queen and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who escaped the bombing, praising him for his selfless actions.

Ed Miliband is turning off voters with ‘vacuous sloganeering’ and the ‘torturous repetition of political mantras’ like ‘One Nation’, one of his leading backbenchers said yesterday. Simon Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale, complained that Labour MPs are ordered to ‘parrot’ the phrase in every public utterance. Mr Danczuk is regularly used by the Labour press office as an attack dog, supplying quotes condemning the Conservative Party. Warning: Simon Danczuk, MP for Rochdale, has warned the party's leader to find a new handle for the election . But in an article for PR Week yesterday, he sank his teeth into the Labour leader, warning that voters are repulsed by the ‘on message’ discipline once imposed by Tony Blair’s spindoctor Alastair Campbell. Mr Miliband made the catchphrase ‘One Nation Labour’ a centrepiece of his 2012 speech to the Labour Party conference and the party even has a magazine called ‘One Nation’. But Mr Danczuk complained: ‘We’ve already been told, from the very top, to intertwine ‘one nation’ into every policy statement we make, to build it into speeches, to continually repeat the phrase ‘one nation’ at every opportunity. ‘I’m beginning to worry we haven’t moved on from the 1990s. But I’m no longer sure simply repeating a key message or phrase has the same resonance with electors that it once had.’ Mr Danczuk praised the ‘One Nation’ speech as ‘excellent’ and a ‘land grab moment’ for Mr Miliband. ‘But please,’ he added, ‘it’s not a General Election winning strapline is it? The public isn’t as accepting of such simple messaging any more. Indeed, I’ve come to believe the public is actively turned off by the torturous repetition of political mantras. Caution: Danczuk described Miliband's speech last year as a 'land grab moment' but now MPs are being ordered to 'parrot' the phrase in every appearance as they try to garner votes for the general election . ‘I don’t think it’s a coincidence that neither the Tories nor the Lib Dems have invested effort in coming up with a strapline that is expected to have so much resonance among the electorate - I think they understand such an approach is too simple and outdated.’ Mr Danczuk argued that the MPs most trusted by the public are those who demonstrate ‘authenticity’ by speaking their minds. ‘It’s about showing character, imagination and a deeper understanding of people’s lives,’ he said. ‘It isn’t a coincidence that people like Boris Johnson, Frank Field, Tom Harris or Nigel Farage have the ability to communicate more effectively with the wider public - it’s because they are perceived to speak their mind, to say not what their party wants them to say, but what they think. ‘Those involved in politics need to speak as they find, they need to show a more emotional, common sense connection with the things that matter to voters and, yes, be a little less message-disciplined.’ Mr Danczuk also criticised Tory ministers for spouting David Cameron’s favourite buzz phrases ‘global race’ and ‘hard-working families’ - a sentiment shared by a large number of Conservative MPs. Competition: He cited London Mayor Boris Johnson (left) and Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right) as leaders that capture the public's attention by appearing to speak their mind, not what their party wants them to say . ‘When the Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps pops up on the news and tries to crowbar the phrase “for hardworking people” into every sentence no one honestly thinks he has any connection with the lives of people striving to do right for their families,’ Mr Danczuk said. ‘It’s just vacuous sloganeering.’ But he made clear that the same applies to his own leader. ‘While being on message still holds sway in the Labour Party I would argue that an opposite approach would be much more beneficial. ‘It needs to be less about a slogan, such as “one nation” and much more about developing an understanding amongst the electorate that we’re on their side, that we understand their worries and that we have the solutions to help them get on. This cannot be achieved through sloganeering.’ Tory MP Stewart Jackson said: ‘The curtain is lifted on Ed Miliband’s empty One Nation rhetoric. ‘This vacuous slogan belies Labour’s core philosophy of more spending, more borrowing and more taxes, exactly what got us into an economic mess in the first place. ‘As Simon Danczuk points out, Ed Miliband can’t move on from the policies that brought this country to its knees under Labour and no amount of short-term gimmicks will con the public into trusting Labour on the economy again.’","Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk says Labour MPs ordered to 'parrot' phrase .

"By . Rob Waugh . Scientists are using the world's biggest telescope, buried deep under the South Pole, to try to unravel the mysteries of tiny particles known as neutrinos . The discovery could shed light on how the universe was made. The mega-detector, called IceCube, took 10 years to build 8,000ft below the Antarctic ice. At one cubic km, it is bigger than the Empire State building, the Chicago Sears Tower - now known as Willis Tower - and Shanghai's World Financial Center combined. The final Digital Optical Module (DOM) descends down a bore hole in the ice as it is deployed in the IceCube array, the world's largest neutrino observatory, built under the Antarctic tundra near the US Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station . The IceCube array uses strings of sensors taht are lowered down deep boreholes in the ice. The IceTop has two layers of detectors just below the surface. The Eiffel Tower is depicted, bottom right, to show the detector's size . Very little is known about neutrinos, . but they are believed to carry information about the birth of our . galaxy and the mystery of black holes. Physicists think that they are born . when violent cosmic events, such as colliding galaxies or distant black . holes, occur at the very edges of the universe. Able . to travel billions of light years through space without being absorbed . or deflected either by magnetic fields or by atoms, these mysterious . high-energy particles could provide answers to some of the most . fundamental questions about the universe. Designed to observe neutrinos, which are emitted by exploding stars and move close to the speed of light, the telescope is attracting new attention in the wake of last week's discovery of a particle that appears to be the Higgs boson - a basic building block of the universe. ‘You hold up your finger and a hundred billion neutrinos pass through it every second from the sun,’ said Jenni Adams, a physicist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, who works on IceCube. IceCube is essentially a string of light detectors buried in the ice through hot water drilling. When neutrinos, which are everywhere, interact in the ice, they produce charged particles that then create light, which can be detected. The ice acts as a net that isolates the neutrinos, making them easier to observe. It also protects the telescope from potentially damaging radiation. ‘If a supernova goes off in our galaxy now, we can detect hundreds of neutrinos with IceCube,’ Adams told reporters at the International Conference on High Energy Physics in Melbourne. ‘We won't be able to see them individually, but the whole detector will just light up like a massive fireworks display.’ Artist's impression of a 'Cerenkov light cone' passing through the IceCube telescope, left. IceCube will encompass . AMANDA (yellow cylinder), right, a smaller neutrino detector. The . coloured dots show where the passage of a neutrino has been detected by . the modules as it passes through the array . Scientists are attempting to track the particles to discover their points of origin, in the hope that will give clues on what happens in space, particularly in unseen parts of the universe known as dark matter. Before IceCube was completed in 2010, scientists had observed just 14 neutrinos. With the huge new instrument, paired with another telescope in the Mediterranean, hundreds of neutrinos have been detected. So far, all of those have been created in the earth's atmosphere, but IceCube scientists hope to eventually detect those from space. ‘Neutrinos ... will point back to where they came from,’ Adams said.","World's biggest telescope to hunt for mysterious 'neutrinos'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ryan Gorman . Not backing down: Billionaire Tom Perkins clarified his Saturday Nazi reference by comparing the 'Occupy' movement to pre-Nazi rise to power fascism in Germany . The California billionaire widely ridiculed after the Wall Street Journal published his letter comparing criticism of the super-rich to the Holocaust is at it again. Venture capitalist Thomas Perkins - worth about $8billion - wrote another letter Sunday, this time to Bloomberg, in which he compared the 'Occupy' movement to pre-Nazi rise to power fascism in Germany. 'In the Nazi area it was racial demonization, now it is class demonization,' wrote the Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers venture capital firm co-founder. He also expressed 'shock' over the windows broken at luxury dealerships and banks in San Francisco while the press 'focuses its wrath on the 1 percent.' The letter was written as a KPCB spokesperson immediately moved to distance itself from Perkins. 'Tom Perkins has not been involved in KPCB for years,' the firm tweeted. 'We were shocked by his views expressed today in the WSJ and do not agree.' The letter was written after Bloomberg contacted Perkins to clarify what he meant in his original letter to the Wall Street Journal, according to Business Insider. Perkins opened his letter to the Journal: 'Writing from the epicenter of progressive thought, San Francisco, I would call attention to the parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on its ""one percent,"" namely its Jews, to the progressive war on the American one percent, namely the 'rich.' Mr Perkins describing the hatred attracted by Google workers in San Francisco and an incident in which his former wife author Danielle Steele was branded a 'snob' in the San Francisco Chronicle in a row over the height of her hedge. 'This is a very dangerous drift in our American thinking. Kristallnacht was unthinkable in 1930; is its descendent ""progressive"" radicalism unthinkable now?' He continued. Kristallnacht translates as 'The night of broken glass' and refers to coordinated attacks on Jews in Germany on November 9 1938, as authorities looke on and did nothing. Superyacht: Mr Perkins commissioned the $150m yacht Maltese Falcon which he later sold . Mr Perkins, 82, was educated at MIT before gaining an MBA from Harvard. He founded Venture capitalist firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1973 and has served as a director on boards of companies including Compaq. He recently spent $150million building a super yacht called Maltese Falcon and lives on a 60th floor, 5,500ft penthouse overlooking San Francisco Bay. Before that, he was a general manager . credited with building Hewlett Packard into the huge company it is known . as today and started a successful laser company based on his own . invention. Comparisons: Mr Perkins referenced the Kristallnacht attacks on Jews in Germany in 1938 . Protests: Mr Perkins also discusses the protests in San Francisco against Google buses and tech workers driving up the area's cost of living . His comments comparing criticism of the rich to the Nazis persecution of the Jews that resulted in six million deaths raised many an eyebrow. 'The parallel of Nazi Germany and some people getting kind of annoyed by the tech bro dudes is exactly ZERO,' Kaili Joy Gray wrote on the Wonkette blog. Author and New York Times writer Steven Greenhouse tweeted: 'As someone who lost numerous relatives to the Nazi gas chambers, I find statements like this revolting & inexplicable.'","Thomas Perkins, 82, originally wrote a letter to the Wall Street Journal of the 'parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to [San Francisco's] war on [the rich] .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . New details have emerged in the case of a 20-year-old convicted violent felon accused of murdering an elderly Army veteran with his own gun after knocking on his door begging for help. Thomas Sonnenberg, 69, of Minneapolis. was shot dead Friday after letting Devon Parker inside his home after he said he was being pursued by assailants with baseball bats and asked for a gun - Parker then shot the retiree in the head, authorities said. These details have emerged as it has also been revealed that Sonnenberg's three daughters had been pleading with him and their mother to move out of the increasingly violent area. Sonnenberg had called police prior to being shot in the head, they arrived to find his dead body in the living room and may have saved his wife from a similar fate, according to officials. Kind-hearted: Thomas Sonnenberg (right) was shot dead after opening his front door to 20-year-old convicted felon Devon Parker (left) Parker, also of Minneapolis, began frantically knocking on the couple's door just before noon, claiming that he was being chased by a man with a bat, Elaine Sonnenberg, 68, told police. Sonnenberg answered the door to Parker begging to come in because he was in danger. He let the young man inside and closed the door before calling 911. He was 'frantic, paranoid and in some sort of distress,' asking for a gun, knife, hat and gloves, she added. Thomas Sonnenberg was shot shortly after he called 911, but Parker was unaware his wife was in the kitchen - she emerged after the gun discharged, said cops. 'When the murderer found out she was here, he threw her around and choked her, and he was going to rape her,' Raina Baldwin, the couple's daughter, told Mail Online. The front door locked behind Parker when he entered the house. When Parker realized, he threatened Elaine Sonnenberg to force her to give him the keys, says Baldwin. Police banging on the door received no response, but saw Thomas Sonnenberg's body slumped over a chair in the living room and began furiously beating the door. An officer saw Parker come up behind Elaine Sonnenberg just as she screamed that she could not unlock the door. The suspect was ordered to the ground at gunpoint while Elaine Sonnenberg ran to unlock the door. Parker was immediately arrested. Family home: Thomas Sonnenberg was shot dead inside the home on Aldrich St where he and his wife raised their three daughters . Police observed Thomas Sonnenberg's right hip gun holster empty, and later found a gun stashed under a bed in an upstairs bedroom. Police said Parker was on probation stemming from a 2011 felony assault conviction, he remains in jail pending a Tuesday court appearance. The horrifying murder came as the Sonnenberg's daughters had been begging them to move from the quickly declining neighborhood. Daughter Rachel Sonnenberg Baufield said she and her two sisters had been trying to convince their parents to move for years, but were unsuccessful because the pair were stuck in an underwater mortgage. Despite the area's rising crime, this was not the first time her father had opened the door to strangers. 'There have been other people who have come to my dad and begged for help, and my dad gave them money because he didn't want people hurting,' the grieving daughter said, 'and this is the repayment that he gets.' Police spokesperson John Elder earlier indicated that Parker and Sonnenberg were acquaintances, but Baldwin says that was not the case. 'No. Absolutely not,' she told the Mail Online through tears. 'He thought he was helping someone in need, that's why he let him into the house,' she said. Baldwin said she believes Parker was attempting to rob the house but did not realize that her mother was also in the home. Sonnenberg 'seems like an innocent victim. From all indications, this . is not a bad guy, a drug deal gone wrong, or anything like that,' Elder . told the Star Tribune. Records show Parker has been booked on numerous other felony charges, including shooting at a public vehicle or facility and throwing bodily fluids or feces and has drug and trespassing convictions. Arrested: Devon Derrick Parker was on probation when he arrived at the door of Thomas Sonnenberg . Long record: Parker's police record includes felony arrests for violence, drugs and trespassing . Sonnenberg has no police record. 'He had a big heart,' she said. 'He had helped people before who had come to his door. He was not stupid, he thought he was helping this person.' Elder says there is no indication that Parker was being followed or threatened, and he did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Thomas Sonnenberg and his wife have three grown-up daughters and several grandchildren. He was the second youngest of 10 kids who grew up on a vegetable farm in Brooklyn Center, Darrell Sonnenberg told the Star Tribune. 'He was a pretty good guy, pretty friendly, pretty nice,' Darrell Sonnenberg said. 'Not a tough guy. He took good care of his kids.' Another of Thomas Sonnenbergâ€™s daughters, Rachel Sonnenberg Baufield, posted about her father's tragic death yesterday. 'My DAD was cruelly taken from me and my family today. Please pray for justice for him and wish him to be at peace! I loved him very much! The world will be a much sadder place without him in it.'","Police say Thomas Sonnenberg, 69, was shot dead with his own gun at home by Devon Derrick Parker .

"By . Emma Reynolds . The ex-boyfriend of Amy Winehouse appeared in court today charged with two counts of rape. Reg Traviss, 35, had been seeing Amy for more than a year when she died aged 27 at her home in Camden, north London, last July. The film director is accused of twice attacking a woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, at his home address in Marylebone, central London, last New Year’s Eve. On trial: Reg Traviss arrives at court today, left, to hear the charges against him from New Year's Eve. The film director dated singer Amy Winehouse, right, for more than a year before she died a year ago . Traviss was first arrested over the allegations by the Metropolitan Police on April 28 and released on bail. Dressed in a charcoal grey suit, black trousers, white shirt, and black tie, Traviss spoke only to confirm his identity during a brief hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court today. These are two charges of rape from December 31 last year, in the early hours of that morning, against a female over the age of 16. Traviss’ lawyer said he would deny the allegations at the crown court. He was bailed to appear before Southwark Crown Court on September 12. Traviss, who has made films including Psychosis, starring Charisma Carpenter and Darkness frontman Justin Hawkins, has not yet entered pleas to the two counts of rape. On bail: Traviss, who is accused of twice attacking a woman at his home in Marylebone .

Last year, Traviss revealed that he and the Back to Black singer had been planning to get married. ‘It wasn’t planned as in this date or that date, but it was a topic of conversation and had been for some time,’ he said. He admitted that he still hadn't come to terms with the fact she has gone. Speaking to the Sunday Times he said: 'What felt surreal was not the cameras and the craziness but losing somebody, just like that. One minute I was speaking to her, the next she was gone . 'You might say we were halfway through a conversation in our life together and then, suddenly, she disappeared.' A friend claimed the rape allegation came out of the blue. ‘He does know the woman who made the report to police and he completely denies the allegation,’ the friend told the Daily Mail. ‘He wants to do everything in his power to fight this.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","The director dated the singer for more than a year before she died aged 27 .

"By . Richard Shears . A young woman from Alaska has been hailed a hero after she lifted her boyfriend’s foot from the accelerator of their car and grabbed the steering wheel when he was killed by a mystery object. Quick-thinking Danielle Oylear, 26, prevented a serious accident after the object smashed through the windscreen, striking Rutger Hale, 22, in the head as they drove in New Zealand. The object flew through the interior of the car and smashed out through the back window. But after a search of the lonely road between Hawea and Wanaka, in the south island, police remain mystified as to what it was. Fatal: Danielle Oylear with Rutger Hale, who was killed by an object that smashed through his windscreen . Detective Sergeant Brian Cameron said Miss Oylear had done a ‘remarkable job’ in the seconds after Mr Hale, from Auckland, was killed. ‘She has had to take control of the vehicle, grabbing the steering wheel while attempting to lift the driver’s foot from the accelerator,' he said. ‘She’s done a remarkable job of steering the vehicle to its final resting place without being involved in a secondary crash’ Detective Cameron told the Otago Daily Times. Miss Oylear, whom Mr Hale called Deezy Dee, was in the front passenger seat when the incident occurred. Police said Mr Hale had been working as a farm hand and the couple were staying at a holiday park near Lake Hawea. The popular New Zealander had recently returned to his home country after a road trip around America. Romance: Rutger with Danielle, who he met during a road trip around the U.S. Tragic accident: Danielle, left, had to grab the steering wheel when Rutger was killed by a mystery object . His Facebook page revealed he had bought a Jeep while in the U.S. and visited a number of  states, include Alaska, and Miss Oylear's home town of Anchorage. They revealed their excitement about returning to New Zealand when Mr Hale wrote on Facebook: ‘Let the count down begin. Aotearoa [the Maori name for New Zealand] here I come.’ Miss Oylear applied for a New Zealand work visa and traveled across the Pacific to her boyfriend’s home country. Last night she was staying with Mr Hale’s family where she was said to be trying to come to terms with her boyfriend’s death. New life: The couple had recently moved to New Zealand after meeting while Rutger was driving round the U.S. Police said they did not know what had smashed a fist-sized hole in the windscreen of the couple’s blue Subaru car, despite two days of searching.

"By . Mark Prigg . Facebook's share price today hit an all time low of $19.82 which values the social networking giant at almost half its May initial offering price of $38. The companyâ€™s stock dropped 88 cents on Thursday, dropping to its new low after the company posted disappointing earnings last week. It also directly followed the revelation today there are now more than 83 million fake users on its social network. Are your Facebook friends real? Mark Zuckerberg's site has been found to contain over 83 million fake profiles . The astonishing figure makes up 8.7% of all Facebook's 995 million active users. The true scale of the problem was hidden in a company filing published this week, the first since the firm went public. Duplicate profiles made up 4.8% of the fakes, user-misclassified accounts amounted to 2.4%, and 1.5% of users were described as 'undesirable'. There were 83.09 million fake users in total, which Facebook classified in three groups. The largest group were duplicate accounts, such as those set up by people to keep their activities from their partner. The firm defined them as 'an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account.' Since Facebook's original IPO in May the share price of the social networking giant has fallen to an all time low of $19.82 . Others imaginary users were described as 'user-misclassified' where, Facebook said 'users have created personal profiles for a business, organisation, or non-human entity such as a pet'. Users have created pages for cats, dogs and other animals. There were also a large number of 'undesirable' accounts were profiles deemed to be in breach of Facebook's terms of service. These accounts were believed to have been set up to send out junk email messages. The reason for the drop is due to the fact that Facebookâ€™s first tier of restrictions go away on August 16, . when about 271 million shares will be available for trading, . with another 243 million shares set to become available for . trading between mid-October and mid-November. But the day most investors are bracing for is Nov. 14, when . more than 1.2 billion shares will suddenly be available for . trading. The imminent lock-up expiration also means that Wall Street . analysts who participated in the Facebook IPO will once again go . quiet, for a 30-day period, potentially creating more . uncertainty in a stock that has experienced one of the rockiest . market debuts in memory. 'The sentiment on this thing is so negative,' said Topeka Capital . Markets analyst Victor Anthony. 'I think this thing may continue to tick . down until you see some sort of meaningful catalyst which unfortunately . may not show until third-quarter earnings.' On Wednesday, Facebook's director of platform partnerships, Ethan . Beard, and the director of platform marketing, Katie Mitic, each . separately announced plans to leave the company. They represent the . latest of several departures -- including that of Facebook's chief . technology officer in June -- since the IPO. The admission comes as Facebook is attempting to recover from a shambolic public offering. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is estimated to have seen his own personal fortune fall from $13.7 billion to just over $10 billion in the space of a week. Stock market issues: The revelations come after Facebook's shambolic public offering . It now hopes to make money by persuading firms to set up brand pages - but the sheer number of fake users could harm this approach and make the public wary of pages. A BBC investigation last month concluded that a rash of fake profiles was a major cause for concern for Facebook advertisers, although the firm told the BBC it had 'not seen evidence of a significant problem,' The BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones set up a fake company called VirtualBagel to investigate allegations of fake 'likes'. His investigation found that the large majority of 'likes' for the fake firm originated from the Middle East and Asia. The first American company to debut with a market valuation of more . than $100 billion, Facebook has fallen out of favor on Wall Street as . investors fret about its slowing revenue growth. In the second quarter, Facebook reported revenue growth of 32 . percent, compared with the more than 100 percent growth it delivered at . the same time last year.","Facebook's stock fell to an all time low of $19.82 a share at one point today .

"By . Adam Shergold . Members of the American athletics team have launched a protest against strict corporate sponsorship rules which prevent competitors promoting non-official brands during the Olympic Games. Dozens of track and field athletes have taken to Twitter, Facebook and personal blogs to demand reform of ‘Rule 40’ which forbids them to advertise their own personal sponsors if they are not approved Olympic partners. The 100m hurdler Dawn Harper even posted a photograph on Twitter of her mouth gagged with duct tape with ‘Rule 40’ written on it. The American hurdler Dawn Harper posted this picture on Twitter in protest at restrictions against sponsorship at the Olympics . The International Olympic Committee issued guidelines to all athletes prior to the London Games saying they could be sanctioned if they openly promote other brands. The IOC wanted to protect the exclusivity of companies such as Adidas, McDonalds and BMW, who have paid more than £609m towards the Games, and say there would be no Olympics without big-money sponsors. But the athletes argue that they are missing out on the biggest opportunity to promote their own sponsors, who often pay for their equipment, training facilities and travel to competition. At the forefront of the protest is 400m runner Sanya Richards-Ross, who pointed out that while Olympic stars can command million-dollar sponsorship deals, many other amateur members of the squad don’t receive any funding and have to combine training with study or part-time jobs. Richards-Ross, a gold medal winner in the Athens and Beijing Olympics, is married to NFL American football star Aaron Ross, who plays for the Jacksonville Jaguars on a three-year $15.3m (£9.75m) contract. But she spoke out for her teammates . yesterday, saying: ‘People see the Olympic Games, when athletes are at . their best but they don’t see the three or four years before when many . of my peers are struggling to stay in the sport. The US sprinter Sanya Richards-Ross is leading the protest about Olympic sponsorship. She is married to NFL star Aaron Ross, who plays on a $15.3m (£9.75m) deal with the Jacksonville Jaguars . Richards-Ross spoke out on behalf of her teammates at a press conference yesterday just days before the start of the athletics events at London 2012 . Richards-Ross, as well as the American athletics team, are sponsored by Nike. The official partner of the 2012 Games is rival Adidas . ‘The majority of track and field athletes don’t have sponsors. In the sport, a lot of my peers have second and third jobs to be able to do this. ‘We understand that the IOC is protecting its sponsors but we want to have a voice as well.’ She claimed that only two per cent of American athletes would be able to tweet about their sponsors because they are in line with official Olympic brands. Richards-Ross was also leading the protest on Twitter, where the hashtags #WeDemandChange and #Rule40 were trending yesterday. She was supported by other members of the US Olympic team, including long distance runner Bernard Lagat, javelin thrower Kara Patterson, sprinter Lauryn Williams and many others. Sanya Richards-Ross has been leading the protests on Twitter . A tweet by sprinter Lauryn Williams asking why athletes are unable to advertise personal sponsors . A Facebook post by runner Leo Manzano in protest at requests to remove pictures of his running shoes . Harper later tweeted the duct tape gag picture alongside the message:  ‘Goodnight world… Can anyone guess what’ll be in my dreams? #Rule40’ Rule 40 of the Olympic Charter states: ‘Except as permitted by the IOC Executive Board, no competitor, coach, trainer or official who participates in the Olympic Games may allow his person, name, picture or sports performances to be used for advertising purposes during the Olympic Games.’ The rule was reinforced by a 20-page briefing note sent to all athletes and agents by Games organisers LOCOG. It explains: ‘Ambush marketers have, in the past, used their association with athletes to suggest or imply that they have an association with the Olympic Games. This undermines the exclusivity that Organising Committees can offer official Games and Team sponsors, without whose investment the Games could not happen.’ The distance runner Bernard Lagat was among the many American athletes who pledged their support to the protest . The IOC said today that they would be summoning officials from the United States Olympic Committee and asking them to ‘reach out’ to their athletes to quell the protests. In response, the USOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky said the athletes should appreciate the investment of official sponsors. He said: ‘While the athletes are the heart of the Olympic Games, and the Movement more broadly, without the support of our official partners, the Games would not be able to happen. ‘Our partners provide 40 percent of our budget. If the value of those sponsorships declines because we can no longer provide exclusivity, then our level of support for athletes overall will decline. The result of loses by these standards will be less money to athletes, not more.’ This will come as little consolation to some American athletes, who now look likely to lose money on the London Olympics. The middle-distance runner Leo Manzano said he was ‘disappointed’ after being made to take down pictures of his shoes and comments about their performance from his Facebook page. ‘This rule is very distracting to us athletes, and it takes away from our Olympic experience and training,' he said. 20km walk athlete Maria Michta wrote an opinionated blog entry in which she talked about the difficulties of making ends meet while training for the Olympics. She wrote: ‘I have no big brand coropoarate sponosor [sic] who gives me free gear, pays me a salary, and gives me a bonus for making it to events like the Olympics or rewards my spotlight in the media with another bonus check. ‘No my sponsors are my family, my friends, my high school community, the family of race walkers around the country. My sponsor bonus comes from each and every dollar thrown in my bucket and every donation on my website.’ The rebel athletes have gained the support of Ed Moses, Olympic hurdles champion in 1976 and 1984, who said track and field was trailing professional sports in terms of earning potential. RULE 40 FROM THE OLYMPIC CHARTER: . 'Except as permitted by the IOC Executive Board, no . competitor, coach, trainer or official who participates in the Olympic Games . may allow his person, name, picture or sports performances to be used for . advertising purposes during the Olympic Games.' THE BRIEFING NOTE SENT OUT TO ATHLETES BY LOCOG: . ‘Ambush marketers have, in the past, . used their association with athletes to suggest or imply that they have . an association with the Olympic Games. This undermines the exclusivity . that Organising Committees can offer official Games and Team sponsors, . without whose investment the Games could not happen. ‘The implication of an association . with the Games through use of athletes is particularly powerful during . and immediately before the Games.’ It adds: ‘Participants who do not . comply with Rule 40 may be sanctioned by the IOC and/or by the BOA in . accordance with the Team Members’ Agreement which provides for wide . ranging sanctions, including amongst other things removal of . accreditation and financial penalties.’","American track and field stars take to Twitter and blogs to demand changes to 'Rule 40'

EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos says that it is an ‘important measure for bringing about sustained changes in children’s eating habits’. But Jenny Stratford, president of the Women’s Food and Farming Union, said cheese and yogurt were a vital part of a healthy diet. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘Cheese is hugely beneficial for children. It gives them calcium and helps with bone development. ‘Yogurt can have high levels of sugar but if it’s low fat and low sugar, it’s fine.’ The proposal is included in a shake-up of European programmes which subsidise school food. The EU wants the £190 million annual grant, shared by all member states, to focus on fruit and vegetables. But Conservative MP and Devon farmer Neil Parish said: ‘If you don’t give children food they like at school they are more likely to eat takeaways. 'We’ve got too hung up about fat and sugar content. Children need them for energy, and cheese and yogurt provide that.’ Judith Bryans, chief executive of Dairy UK, added: ‘It seems wrong that children who may not be milk drinkers and prefer to consume yogurt or cheese may not have access to these products.’","EU plans to cut payments for dairy products over obesity fears .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Banksy artworks controversially ripped from public view amid cries of theft is to go under the hammer in the biggest ever sale of its kind. The mutli-million auction will include No Ball Games, taken from the side of a shop in north London last July. The sale will also feature Liverpool Rat, taken from a boarded up pub in Liverpool last year. Vandalised: No Ball Games was created in September 2009 in Tottenham Green, north London, and had been repeatedly defaced until it was removed in 2013 . Striking: The Liverpool Rat, Britain's biggest creation by Banksy, was painted on The White Horse pub, on the edge of the city's China Town on Berry Street in 2006 where it remained until it was removed in 2013 . Other works up for sale include Old Skool, taken from an east London garage, Sperm Alarm, daubed on a hotel wall, and Silent Majority, sprayed on a trailer at Glastonbury festival. The Hackney work Balloon Girl and 2 Rats from Berlin will also feature at Stealing Banksy? event, which will see the works go on display for four days from April 24 to 27. The exhibition and auction will be at the ME London Hotel, in The Strand, in the centre of the capital, with limited tickets available to the public. For sale: Banksy's 'Old Skool' work, pictured, which was removed from the wall of an east London garage is going under the hammer in April . Stolen: Banksy's 'Sperm Alarm' was stolen from a wall of the four-star Hesperia Hotel in Victoria in 2011 then recovered . Early work: Silent majority was painted onto the outside of an 'Overlander' semi-trailer at the Glastonbury festival in 1998 . It is being organised by Sincura Group, which has handled the controversial removal and sale of a number of Banksy pieces in recent years. The company said: 'Stealing Banksy? is the 2014 project exploring the social, legal and moral issues surrounding the sale of street art. 'The exhibition showcases the most expensive collection of Banksy artworks ever assembled under one roof and is the culmination of a 12 month project to uncover, salvage and lovingly restore these pieces that have shaped the capital we live in.' Unique: Banksy's '2 Rats' was created in Berlin on the corner of Kopernicker and Adalbert Strabe when Banksy participated in a local art festival in 2003 . Recovered: The Girl with the Red Balloon in Hackney was covered from view for the last decade until it was removed in 2013 . The company said No Ball Games is likely to fetch more the £1million with the money being donated to charities. It added: 'Having been carefully sourced from around the world, over £5 million of the most controversial artwork will be on display. 'The show will be the first and only time these pieces will ever be seen in their fully restored state.' See www.stealingbanksy.com . Is this Banksy? A man in blue overalls was shot near a work in progress in New York last year . Reclusive graffiti artist Banksy has managed to pull off an incredible trick; keeping his true identity a secret despite worldwide curiosity about the man behind the spray can. He has apparently been caught on camera overseeing the creation of one of his artworks in New York. A man in a flat cap and paint-spattered overalls was photographed trying to fix a 'moving painting' in a van which had broken down, as part of the artist's month-long 'exhibition' in the U.S, last year. But no one has yet been able to confirm his identity. The artist's real name is thought to be either Robin Banks or Robin Gunningham, but all that is known for sure is that he is from Bristol. Previously photographs purporting to show Banksy were taken in Santa Monica in 2011 and East London in 2007. Both images feature a white man in his 30s of average build with brown hair - making them compatible with the latest image, which was taken in the East Village neighbourhood of Manhattan. Banksy, whose work has been painted on the sides of buildings around Bristol, London and other cities, has always insisted he will never reveal his true identity.","Work by the secretive artist will be sold over four days in April .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An unwed teacher at a Roman Catholic middle school in Montana has been terminated after getting pregnant, the Diocese of Helena confirmed this week. Catholic Schools Superintendent Patrick Haggarty said Tuesday Shaela Evenson ‘made a willful decision to violate the terms of her contract,’ which requires her to respect the moral and religious teachings of the Catholic Church in both her professional and personal life. ‘The Catholic moral teaching is that the sacrament of marriage is a holy union between a man and a woman,’ Haggarty said. ‘And we certainly believe and we teach our children who attend our schools about the sacrament of marriage. That's as old as our church. Ousted: Literature and physical education teacher Shaela Evenson was fired from Catholic Butte Central school in Montana for getting pregnant out of wedlock . ‘Not only do we teach that to the children kindergarten through 12th grade, but we're held to that standard as well.’ Evenson, a physical education teacher at Butte Central, told The Montana Standard that she is pursuing legal action. Butte Central elementary and middle school Principal Kerrie Hellyer told the paper that Evenson was let go January 10 after the diocese received an anonymous letter about her pregnancy. The woman taught sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade literature and physical education for just over eight years.Civil Right . ‘She was an excellent teacher,’ Hellyer said. One of Mark Zmuda's students conducted the interview after pupils rallied in support of the vice principal (pictured center) and his new husband (right) The diocese doesn't investigate the personal lives of its employees, but it was forced to act when it learned about the pregnancy, Diocese spokesman Dan Bartleson said. ‘A Catholic school teacher enters into an agreement not only with the district but with parents and teachers ... to follow a lifestyle in line with Catholic teachings,’ Bartleson said. Cincinnati attorney Brian Butler told KXLF he plans to file a discrimination charge with the Federal Equal Opportunity Commission alleging the school violated Evenson’s rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Evenson's dismissal sparked a backlash in the community, where some Catholics pointed out that even Pope Francis has been signalling lately that unwed mothers should not be shunned by society. Last month, the pontiff baptized a child born out of wedlock inside the Sistine Chapel, and in September, he offered an unmarried woman who had chosen not to have an abortion to personally baptize the baby. ‘I don't think it’s right,’ Toynet Wassberg, whose grandson attends Butte Central, told NBC Montana. ‘I know they say she was a bad influence, but I think something could have been worked out.’ Pope Francis today baptised the child of an unmarried couple (not pictured) during a ceremony in the Sistine Chapel in Rome . Some people have taken to social media to support Evenson, calling for Haggerty to be fired under the hashtag #Justicefor Shaela on Twitter. The firing comes after a Catholic school in a Seattle suburb drew attention in December for forcing out a gay vice principal. Eastside Catholic School in Sammamish said Mark Zmuda was aware of Catholic doctrine and violated his employment agreement.","Shaela Evenson was let go January 10 after Diocese of Helena in Montana got an anonymous letter about her pregnancy .

"By . Mark Nicol . Nearly 500 military personnel a month are asking to be treated for traumatic disorders after serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. The impact of a decade of conflict on Britain’s hard-pressed Armed Forces is revealed in new Ministry of Defence figures. A study of the 1,472 new cases of Servicemen and women seeking help in the first three months of the year shows some clear trends. Female personnel are twice as likely to suffer mental ill-health, and lower ranks are more vulnerable than officers. Constant demands: Nearly 500 soldiers are seeking help for mental health issues each month due to the ceaseless rigours of the Afghan and Iraq conflicts, new figures reveal (file picture) Trends emerging: The study of 1,472 cases this year found that lower-ranked troops are more vulnerable to mental ill-health than officers (file picture) The figures are the first to be compiled since the launch of the ‘Don’t Bottle It Up’ campaign, an initiative by the Ministry of Defence intended to encourage more soldiers, sailors and airmen to seek help for mental or emotional issues. The campaign is intended to break the stigma around these issues. According to previous reports, soldiers have suffered ridicule and contempt from their colleagues for admitting they are struggling to cope. The findings by Defence Analytical Services and Advice, a research  arm of the MoD, found that soldiers serving two or more tours of duty are six times more likely to suffer than those on one tour. Concern for the veterans of these long campaigns is underlined by the fact that more former servicemen have committed suicide since the 1982 Falklands War than died in battle, when 255 were killed. Earlier this year, Lance Sergeant Dan Collins, 29, committed suicide. In a note he described the guilt of surviving an incident in Afghanistan that killed two comrades. Collins was found hanged in a quarry near his home in Cardigan, West Wales. Taking its toll: Earlier this year, Lance Sergeant Dan Collins (right) committed suicide over the guilt of surviving an incident in Afghanistan that killed two comrades, including Lance Corporal Dane Elson (left) The MoD found that across the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, the Army and the Royal Air Force, reservists show higher rates of mental problems than regular personnel. Yesterday, a former reservist soldier described his struggle to be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and to get financial support. Lance Sergeant Jake Wood, 39, left his job as a business analyst for an investment bank to serve two tours  of Iraq and one of Afghanistan. He admitted: ‘In Iraq, I shoved  my pistol into my throat. I wanted to “check out”. Only my fears for my family stopped me. On the same tour, in 2004, a local kid pointed a weapon at me and I was so depressed I actually wanted him to shoot me. Warning: Former Army Colonel Bob Stewart, MP for Beckenham, Kent, said manpower cuts could trigger more cases of mental ill-health . ‘I went to Afghanistan in 2009 and my mental and emotional health got worse. I saw my mates die and we were outnumbered by the Taliban every day. ‘It wasn’t until December 2010 that I got the package of treatment and compensation I need. Getting help and support can be very difficult. I needed really good doctors and lawyers. The Ministry of Defence fought the case.’ L/Sgt Wood now receives 75 per cent of his salary at the time of his mobilisation. The Army is committed to cutting 20,000 soldiers before 2018. Many of those made redundant will be veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq and their places on the frontline are expected to be filled by reservists such as L/Sgt Wood. Military charity Combat Stress warned that more must be done to support reservists’ mental health. Andrew Cameron, the chief executive of Combat Stress, said: ‘Reservists are more likely to suffer post-traumatic stress than regular counterparts because they spent less time among their peers and must switch between the military and civilian communities quickly and regularly. ‘It is very important as we increase our reliance on reservists that these men and women are properly prepared and supported. This means before, during and after their deployments. Combat Stress has created two liaison officers to work specifically with reservists to ensure they receive the support they require.’ The manpower cuts could trigger more cases of mental ill-health, according to former Army Colonel Bob Stewart, MP for Beckenham, Kent. He said last night: ‘Soldiers want to be treated among their own. They always have done and they always will. Today’s problems seem to be obvious and as more soldiers leave the regimental system and find themselves in civilian life they will not have their friends close at hand. ‘Only they really appreciate the  difficulties of spending so long on  the frontline.’ The MoD said: ‘The mental health  of service personnel is a top priority and we have robust systems in place to identify and treat those with mental health issues. 'We are also committed to reducing the stigma associated with mental illness such as through briefing Service personnel, their families and the chain of command.’","New study reveals impact of conflicts on UK's hard-pressed Armed Forces .

"By . Beth Stebner . If a picture is worth a thousand words, than a picture taken with a gigapixel camera must be worth millions. Scientists at Duke University have built an astonishing prototype camera that, not unlike many smartphones, allows the viewer to zoom in and focus on certain aspects of the photograph – all while maintaining incredible clarity. The experimental camera takes shots containing up to 50 gigapixels of data – or 50,000 megapixels. While most point-and-shoot cameras come equipped with around 10-16 megapixels, the scope is truly dizzying. Scroll down for more high-resolution images . Duke scientists combined 98 . individual cameras to create the Aware-2, which allow the camera to have . a resolution five times better than the so-called perfect 20/20 vision . in humans. The result is a . picture that is comprised of billions of pixels, which are single points . in an image that together converge into recognisable images. Even the . best professional cameras on the market only top 20-30 megapixels. Described in an article appearing in Nature, the . pictures show wide-angle shots of various locations, and how the . gigapixel camera allows for tight and precise views of objects . relatively far away. The camera uses a spherical lens to . capture every iota of detail in its range, mounted with nearly 100 14-megapixel . microcameras. Because of the nature of the lens, it has a view of 120 . degrees by 50 degrees. The lens actually takes 100 individual pictures, which are then pieced together by a computer. Electrical engineer David Brady told . Nature, which published his team’s findings: ‘Scanning a scene with . these cameras, you can see a lot more than if you were actually there.’ In . one wide-angle shot of the Seattle skyline, various buildings can be . seen, with the traffic moving at a decent pace. But with the gigapixel . camera, suddenly a truck can be seen driving down one of the streets . blocks away, and the ‘in’ and ‘out’ signs on a parking garage a . half-mile away can clearly be read. Dr . Brady added that taking a picture with a traditional camera, such as a . point-and-shoot, is like ‘looking through a soda straw since you can . only see a narrow part of the scene.’ But he compares the prototype camera to a fire house, saying: ‘The world comes at you full (blast.)’ The . camera uses a spherical lens to capture every iota of detail in its . range, mounted with 96 14-megapixel microcameras. Because of the nature . of the lens, it has a view of 120 degrees by 50 degrees. The . lens actually takes 100 individual pictures, which are then pieced . together by a computer, Nature said. But, the scientists note that the . Aware-2 is far from the commercial market, as it is still too cumbersome . and requires space for its various electronic boards. Not . to mention its sizable weight – around 100 pounds – and its bulk. It . takes about 18 seconds to shoot a photograph (not unlike the old . daguerreotype) as the camera takes in all the data. The . result is stunning; the slightest details –like licence plates and . street signs – can be perfectly read from a picture taken a half-mile . away. The Aware-2 can only . currently produce pictures in black and white, though researchers at the . North Carolina school are looking to build a colour gigapixel camera . soon. Their research was . supported by DARPA, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency. Michael J. Fitzpatrick, who is a professor at Duke’s Pratt School of . Engineering, as well as other scientists from the University of Arizona . and the University of California – San Diego participated in the . ground-breaking research. Dr . Brady hopes that once the technology catches up to the concept, . gigapixel cameras could replace their megapixel cousins.‘As more . efficient and compact electronics are developed,’ he said. 'The age of . hand-held gigapixel photography should follow.’ Shutter to think: Scientists at Duke University created the massive lens, which uses nearly 100 microcameras to capture individual images which are then reassembled .","Prototype camera developed by Duke University scientists captures images up to 50,000 megapixels .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Complaints about the  use of Tasers have been increasing as police gear up to put the controversial 50,000-volt devices in the hands of more officers. Among those who have complained are a 14-year-old girl, a ‘good Samaritan’ who was trying to help police, two cyclists and a man who said he refused to take off his underpants in custody. Critics said the complaints, running at the rate of one every three days, should make chief constables think even more carefully about expanding use of the potentially deadly weapons. Complaints: One complaint about the use of tasers is issued every three days. A 14-year-old girl is among those who have raised concerns . But rank-and-file police are hopeful they will soon receive Government backing for their bid to give every front-line officer access to a Taser. Figures obtained by the Daily Mail using Freedom of Information laws revealed that at least 399 complaints have been made about Tasers over the past three years. One came from a 14-year-old  girl who was accidentally shot as officers tried to arrest a suspect  in Nottingham. On Monday, the Mail reported that Tasers are used against children under 18 more than 140 times a year. In Lancashire, officers are investigating a case in which a man said he was tasered for refusing to take his pants off while in custody. A Devon and Cornwall officer  was disciplined after tasering a  man and then shocking him again after he was handcuffed and lying on the ground. In Lincolnshire, a man accused police of ‘excessive force’ after he was tasered while riding his bicycle, making him fall off. A similar incident took place in Humberside. A handful of forces paid compensation after confrontations involving Tasers. Durham police paid £4,000 to a man who said he was shot while trying to help officers catch a suspect. Under fire: 399 complaints have been made about tasers in the last three years. Critics claim those hit by tasers can suffer cardiac arrests, burns, and serious head wounds from falling . Of the 37 forces who responded  to the survey, the vast majority  of complaints, 151, were received by the Metropolitan Police, Britain’s largest force. Officials at the Independent Police Complaints Commission are concerned at Tasers being used in police custody, confined spaces and on vulnerable people. Simon Chesterman, the UK’s most senior officer responsible for Taser use, said the weapons have reduced the number of assaults on officers and made the public safer. But the West Mercia Deputy Chief Constable agreed that it is unacceptable to taser someone on a bicycle. He added: ‘I would never describe Taser as a risk-free option, but there are also risks to being hit with a baton or bitten by a police dog.’","A 14-year-old girl and two cyclists among those who have raised concerns .

"By . Emma Reynolds . These spectacular pictures of Niagara Falls show its natural beauty lit up with brilliant neon lights. The cascading curtain of water looks particularly magical at night, with the spray glowing bright pink, blue and yellow against the dark sky as it crashes into the river below. Photographer Rajeev Nair, from Connecticut, US, captured the extraordinary pictures of the annual light show by spending hours at the world famous landmark. Rainbow at night: The famous waterfalls that straddle Canada and the US emit a remarkable glow in the ethereal pictures . Pink passion: The vibrant colours make the water look like silk and the spray like clouds of light . Electric dreams: Photographer Rajeev Nair waited for his moment to capture the majesty of the famous tourist attraction turning turquoise . Purple haze: The natural wonder of the waterfall is emphasised by the astonishing display . He said: 'I have always dreamt of taking such photos - I have a special interest in waterfalls and seascapes and Niagara Falls provided me with a great opportunity to fulfil my interests. 'I think the Niagara light show is one of the most beautiful attractions and I was determined to capture it in my lifetime.' Mr Nair, 34, waited patiently each night for the right moment to get the perfect images of the illuminations, biding his time until an hour after sunset to photograph the beautiful blue hour. He said: 'Taking the pictures at this time helped to create the silky effect of the falls due to the long exposure. Golden memories: The lights look like sunbeams despite the late hour as the droplets spring into the night air . Spice of life: The foremost of Niagara's three waterfalls is almost obscured with pink, while another can be seen shining in yellow in the background . Phenomenal power: More than six million cubic feet of water falls over the crest every minute in high flow . 'This way you can also capture all the details of the light falling on the Niagara Falls. 'After taking a couple of photos, I started to get the desired effect and composition. Then it was just a matter of taking pictures at each change in the colour.' Mr Nair, who works as a financial reporter, used a Canon Rebel T2i camera and an 18-55mm kit lens to achieve the remarkable shots taken from beside the American Falls - one of the three waterfalls that make up Niagara. The magnificent illumination of the falls has been organised by local authorities since 1925. It is constantly changing, as each of of the falls glows in a rainbow of colours to complete the vast, awe-inspiring sight. More than six million cubic feet (168,000 m3) of water falls over the crest every minute in high flow, straddling the border of the Canadian province of Ontario and the US state of New York.","Each year, the astonishing illuminations make the vast landmark glow against the night sky .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Gangs of child abusers use Facebook and other social networking sites to trawl ‘menus’ of potential victims and plan sickening sex parties, a devastating report warns today. Naive young people are ‘wandering round’ in the ‘thicket’ of the internet, which plays a central role in grooming and planning abuse. Sue Berelowitz, deputy children’s commissioner for England, claimed groups of men use ‘menus of girls’ and warned that it was ‘rare’ to find abuse cases where technology such as mobile phones and computers were not in some way connected. The interim report by the deputy children's commissioner Sue Berelowitz warned Facebook is used by gangs to arrange 'sex parties' where children are abused . This includes encouraging girls to swap sexually explicit images on mobiles, adults grooming children on social networking sites such as Facebook, and the viewing of extreme or violent pornography and discussing it during sexual assaults. Children groomed online are taken to ‘parties’, where they are drugged or plied with alcohol ‘so that they did not know what was happening to them’, the study found. ‘This made it impossible for them to identify the perpetrators.’ The interim report found that 2,409 children and young people were confirmed victims between August 2010 and October 2011. A further 16,500 children were at 'high risk'. of sexual exploitation between April 2010 and March 2011. Ahead of the report's publication senior government sources branded it 'hysterical' and half-baked. There was particular criticism that the report appeared to play down the significance of Asian men targetting white girls. But speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron backed Miss Berelowitz. He told MPs: 'This is a very serious issue that is being examined. It is an interim report that has been produced which we need to study very carefully.  It has some extremely disturbing findings. 'We need to give every encouragement to the Children’s Commissioner to ensure the final version of the report is produced.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also defended the report. He said: 'There has been some idiotic response from someone within Government, an absurd response. This is obviously a serious and credible report that needs to be taken seriously and taken seriously by the Government.' According to the interim study, in one abuse network, 2,900 vulnerable children were connected to the main perpetrator who used social networking sites to maintain contact with potential victims. The report highlighted the case of Becky, not her real name, a 13-year-old White British girl, who was sexually exploited by a group of boys form her school. When her parents were not at home a group of boys went round for a ‘sex party’ which was advertised on Facebook. ‘Following the incident Becky was coerced into throwing further ‘sex parties’ whenever her house was empty,’ the report said. Teegan, a White British teenager, revealed ‘a book being available with photographs and ages of all of the girls being sexually exploited by this particular group. Men could choose which girls they wanted’. The deputy children's commissioner warned that thousands of youngsters in England were being abused every year . Aged 13, she was taken by a Turkish man to a variety of ‘parties’ across England at several smart houses and ‘mansions’. The report found groups of men aged 14 to 70 trawled Facebook and other social networking to groom vulnerable children and arrange parties where there would be raped. Miss Berelowitz said: ‘We’ve found people who are perpetrating these terrible crimes against children up to men in their 70s, so sometimes they are organised, and yes, there are different models, so sometimes we have organised groups of Pakistani males in relation to white girls, but that is not the only model. ‘It is desperately important that people wake up to all the evidence. I’ve seen, for example, hard evidence from police. I’ve got a picture in my mind of an enormous piece of paper with photographs on it of victims and offenders in one part of the country. The vast majority of the offenders there were white, so everybody needs to recognise that this is happening in a number of different cases in various communities,’ she told Sky News. Social networking sites like Facebook have come under growing pressure to act amid claims they are used by perpetrators of child abuse. Shadow Children’s Minister Lisa Nandy told the Daily Mirror: ‘Companies such as Facebook and other social media should be called before MPs to explain what they are doing to stop this happening.’ A Facebook spokesman said: 'We have a zero tolerance policy for child exploitative behaviour on the site and such activity is rare. 'However, when illegal behaviour is detected Facebook works with law enforcement agencies such as CEOP to ensure that these people are brought to justice.'","Thousands of vulnerable children are targeted through social networking sites, deputy children's commissioner warns .

"By . Damian Ghigliotty . and Damien Gayle . An alien planet spotted by Nasa's Kepler space telescope is the best candidate yet for an Earth-like world beyond our solar system, Scientists claim. The planet - whose existence is yet to be positively confirmed. has a radius that is just 1.5 times that of our own and orbits in the 'habitable zone' of a star similar to our own Sun. That means the planet would likely have a similar amount of gravity as Earth and liquid water could exist on its surface - making it a prime candidate to host alien life. Distant worlds: An artist's impression of Earth-like exoplanets . This artist's illustration represents the . variety of planets being detected by NASA's Kepler spacecraft: Nasa astronomers have revealed the discovery of a potential planet that could be the closest to Earth yet found . 'This was very exciting because it's . our fist habitable-zone super Earth around a sun-type star,' said Nasa . astronomer Natalie Batalha at the annual meeting of the American . Astronomical Society this week. The announcement comes after it was . revealed at the same meeting that analysis of data from Kepler had shown . there are 17billion planets in the galaxy that are Earth-like in size. The possible planet is called KOI . 172.02 - with the initial trio of letters standing for Kepler Object of . Interest, a prefix given to all planetary candidates found by Kepler . until their existence is confirmed. Dr Batalha said the find had the . potential to be the closest so far to an Earth-twin beyond the solar . system. It orbits a G-type star that is only slightly cooler than our . own Sun, she said. 'Previously the ones we saw were orbiting other types of stars,' she was quoted as saying by SPACE.com. An artist's impression of Kepler-20e, one of the planets identified by the Kepler space telescope mission . Analysis of Kepler's data indicates . that the object takes 242 days to orbit its star, from which it is about . three quarters as distant as the Earth is from the Sun. Astrophysicist Mario Livio, of the . Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, told SPACE.com that the . find was a 'big deal'. 'It's definitely a good candidate for life,' he said. Christopher Burke of the SETI . Institute announced the discovery of the planet along with a batch of . 461 new planet candidates spotted by Kepler since February last year. Latest findings released by NASA show that since February last year there have been 461 potential new planets discovered. These bring the total number of potential planets that have been identified by the Kepler mission to 2,740 and they orbit 2,036 stars. A breakdown by size of potential planets identified by the Kepler mission. Among the most dramatic increases is in the number of Earth-sized and super Earth-sized planets. Discoveries of Earth-sized planets increased by 43 per cent while those of super-Earths rose by 21 per cent. Caltech planetary astronomer John Johnson said: 'We are showing that there is about one planet per star, and that gives us a total of about a hundred billion planets throughout our galaxy. 'The vast majority of those planets are orbiting stars that are very much different from our sun.' Several of the planets being identified are in the same solar system, just as Earth is one of eight planets orbiting the Sun. 'The large number of multi-candidate systems being found by Kepler implies that a substantial fraction of exoplanets reside in flat multi-planet systems,"" said Jack Lissauer, planetary scientist at Ames. 'This is consistent with what we know about our own planetary neighborhood.' The Kepler space telescope was launched by NASA in 2009 with the intention of finding Earth-like planets. It pinpoints potential new planets by measuring the dimming of starlight as planets pass between stars and the telescope. Not all dimming is caused by planets and it is only once dimming has been observed three times that it is formally attributed to a potential planet. Further measurements and observations are required to confirm the identification. In the last year the number of confirmed planets pinpointed by Kepler has risen from 33 to 105.

Harvard-Smithsonian Center presented the latest Kepler findings at a . meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Long Beach, California, . on Monday. The Astrophysical Journal has accepted a paper detailing the research for publication. Christopher Burke, a scientist at the . SETI Institute which researches signs off extra-terrestrial . intelligence, said that 58 planets found so far are believed to be in . their host stars' habitable zones. That means that any water on them has a chance of being in liquid form because the region is close enough to the star to be warm enough for ice to melt but not so close that it all evaporates. Near death: A new photo of Eta Carinae system's largest star suffering a near-death experience before it goes supernova in the near future . Planets orbiting close to their suns are likely to be infernos while planets in distant orbits are likely to be icy, he said. Burke also analyzed the latest Kepler data. The Kepler Space Telescope launched on March 7, 2009, and has been active for 3 years, 10 months and 1 day as of January 8, 2013. The space observatory was named in honor of the 17th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler. Kepler is part of NASA's Discovery Program which runs relatively low-cost scientific research missions. The observatory’s mission going forward is to find and document Earth-sized planets at greater distances. The more planets discovered with Earth-like orbits in their habitable zones, the greater the chances of extra-terrestrial life, scientists say.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Iran has arrested the killers of two of its nuclear scientists, as the row continues over claims that Israel and the U.S. 'sabotaged' the country's controversial nuclear program. The suspects are accused of assassinating a physicist at Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation (AEOI) and a deputy director at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility using magnetic bombs that were attached to the vehicles they were in. Tehran has accused Israel and the United States of plotting the killings to set back its nuclear program. Washington has denied any U.S. role, while Israel has declined to comment. The killing suspects are accused of assassinating a physicist at Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation (file picture) AEOI physicist Majid Shahriari was killed in 2010 and Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan in January this year. 'The key perpetrators of the assassinations...were identified and, in a series of rapid and authoritative operations, were arrested and transferred to detention facilities,' read a statement from the intelligence ministry, published by Press TV's website. Iran denies Western accusations that it is developing a nuclear weapons capability, saying it simply wants to generate electricity and radio isotopes for medical treatment. Tehran is due to hold talks with world powers in Moscow on June 18-19. Killed: Masoud Ali-Mohammadi, left, and Majid Shahriari were both killed by bombs . Sabotaged: Iran's nuclear facilities have also . been attacked using computer viruses, even though none of them are . connected to the internet . At least four scientists associated with Iran's nuclear program have been assassinated since 2010 and a fifth - Fereydoun Abbasi Davani, now head of the AEOI - was wounded. Last month, authorities hanged 24-year-old Jamal Fashi for the murder of one of the scientists, Massoud Ali-Mohammad, in January 2010. Iran said Fashi confessed to travelling to Tel Aviv to receive training from Israeli intelligence agency Mossad before returning to Iran to plot the assassination, details that were greeted with derision by Israel. Israel has a policy of not commenting on the allegations but an unnamed Israeli source previously said the daylight killings had provoked panic in the scientists' colleagues which hindered Iran's nuclear progress.","Physicist Majid Shahriari was killed in 2010 and Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan in January this year .

"By . Jill Reilly . The Prince of Wales has urged world leaders to adopt a better, more integrated approach to issues like climate change. In a pre-recorded speech to a UN sustainability conference in Brazil, he warned of the potentially 'catastrophic' consequences of inaction on issues such a climate change and global food security. In the video address, shown to the Rio+20 High Level Dialogue on Global Sustainability, Prince Charles said: 'I have watched in despair at how slow progress has sometimes been and how the outright, sceptical reluctance by some to engage with the critical issues of our day have often slowed that progress to a standstill. Strong words: Prince Charles made the comments in a pre-recorded video address at a UN sustainability conference in Rio, Brazil . 'Already levels of CO2 have exceeded 400 parts per million; 450 parts per million is the tipping point we have to avoid so every day of delay threatens to make the change more dramatic.' He added that scientific evidence shows the potential consequences and warned we can no longer ignore the risk. He said: 'One thing is clear. We need to be much more informed about the actual state of the planet. We do not have nearly enough knowledge on which to base the decisions that will be the best for the long term. 'Until we do, we expose ourselves to the mounting danger of major shifts in policy that are not well conceived, but come as panicked responses to crises that could have been avoided.' Greener: Plants in the Arctic region are growing greener and taller as a result of global warming, scientists claim . Pointing to the work of his International Sustainability Unit (ISU), a foundation set up to campaign on global sustainability, Prince Charles said a better picture of environmental problems was needed before effective policy could be implemented. He said data on energy, water, biodiversity, forestry and soil, which is collected separately, needed to be combined and and analysed as a whole. 'If this could happen, at least then we would know what the state of the planet actually is - and then plan accordingly,' he said. Prince Charles added: 'We do not have long to capture such a comprehensive picture, and so I would appeal to you as you meet here in Rio to make an even greater and concerted effort to persuade policy and decision-makers to act before it is finally too late.' Rio+20 (the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development) takes place this week in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and marks the 20th anniversary of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in Rio de Janeiro.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:29 EST, 14 July 2011 . It is the moving picture that taps into America's nostalgia for the iconic Space Shuttle program. In a fitting testament to three decades of scientific ingenuity, father and son Chris and Kenneth Bray have recreated a picture taken 30-years-ago at the launch of the first shuttle with the vehicle's final flight into the heavens last week. The astronomy buffs - who witnessed the inaugural 1981 Columbia launch and Atlantis' swansong - created the image as a tribute to NASA's mighty flying machine. Testament to a shared passion: Father and son Chris and Kenneth Bray watch the first and final shuttle launches 30 years apart . Standing on a causeway at Kennedy space centre in 1981, father and son are seen with binoculars in hand and camera at the ready. And 30 years later the pair are snapped in exactly the same pose, wearing near identical clothing as they prepare to witness history for a second time. Speaking to Universe Today Chris said that this was the picture 'we waited 30 years to complete.' 'In addition to being astronomy buffs for as long as I can remember, Dad and I have been big fans and followers of the space program - including all the private endeavours. 'We’ve only been to the two Shuttle launches. I live in NYC and he lives in NJ, so it’s not always the easiest and most convenient trip to make.' The pair had an unlikely connection with the program. Kenneth Bray is a jewellery designer, and in the early shuttle days designed the pin badges for each mission. Chris added: 'Dad was a jewellery designer and made some of the official shuttle pins for the early STS missions.' 'So that’s why we were down there for the first launch.' The end: Space shuttle Atlantis is seen as it launches from pad 39A, 30 years after father and son saw Columbia lift off . First: The inaugural shuttle launch of Columbia in 1981 was a milestone for space exploration . After father and son heard NASA would scrap the program, they both decided they had to come and witness the last launch for themselves. 'We were lucky enough to get in the lottery for STS-135 and scored some tickets to the Astronaut Hall of Fame viewing site. 'But . we almost didn’t make it! Our flight out of Newark on Thursday the 7th . was delayed five or so hours and we didn’t get to Orlando until about 2:30 . am. 'On top of that, all the rental cars were gone and despite having a reservation for a car we had no transportation. 'We . eventually were able to rent a 15 seat passenger van (the last . available car) from a small rental company and drove straight to the . site, bailing on our hotel.' The picture, which was posted on Flickr, has been viewed by more than 550,000 people so far. David Waters, a former space shuttle contractor and media relations officer, wrote on the site: 'Everyone I used to work alongside in the shuttle program that I've forwarded this shot think its so cool, and get [sic] chills.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A killer virus blighting lambs and calves has spread across the country, infecting the majority of farms, experts said yesterday. Schmallenberg virus, which has already killed hundreds of lambs and calves or caused them to be born with serious deformities, has been detected in every county in England and Wales. Those figures are now expected to rise into the thousands as the new lambing season begins. The disease has been discovered on 976 British farms, compared with 276 in August. Spread: Schmallenberg virus has already killed hundreds of lambs or calves or caused them to be born with serious deformities . The virus, which is spread by bloodsucking midges, has travelled across the country since it arrived last year. Chief veterinary officer Nigel Gibbens said there is â€˜likely to be a majorityâ€™ of farms infected. Adult animals infected recover after a few days, but if they are pregnant it can affect foetuses. Sheep are thought to be at greater risk of having dead or deformed offspring than cows. No humans have caught the virus and the Food Standards Agency say there is no evidence that they will.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Hitting the high seas for a day of sailing requires a lot of kit, but now there’s a compact dingy that can fit in the boot of a car. A French company has created what it claims to be the first high performance inflatable sailing dinghy for water sports that can travel at high speeds on a windy day. The Tiwal 3.2 weighs just 111 lbs (50kg) and folds away into two bags that can easily fit in the boot of a car. Scroll down for video . A French company has created what it claims to be the first high performance inflatable sailing dinghy for water sports that can travel at high speeds on a windy day . Length: 10.5ft (3.2metres) Weight: 111lbs (50kg) Sail area: 56 sqft (5.2 metres squared) or 75 sqft (7.2 metres squared) Maximum load: 418lbs (180kg) Capacity: Two adults or one adult and two children . Bags: One bag for the hull and another for the sail and structure . Price: €5,490 (£4,521) or €5,840 (£4,809) Its creators, based in Vannes, north-west France, claim the whole inflatable vessel can be assembled in just 20 minutes. The dinghy’s ‘versatile design allows for both high performance solo use and leisure sailing in pairs,’ the company said. The boat measures just over three metres in length and has a sail measuring 56 square feet (5.2 metres squared) – and a larger 75 square feet (7.2 square metres) size is also available. The Tiwal 3.2 weighs just 50kg and folds away into two bags that can easily fit in the boot of a car (pictured) It is designed to be used competitively in rough waters as well as for leisurely trips for multiple sailors on calm seas. Using its sails, the dinghy can reach a top speed of around 13 mph (22 km/h) which, according to Gizmag is double the speed of other dinghies on the market. ‘It’s a leisure boat, a boat for thrills and a multi-purpose vessel,’ the company said. The vessel has a V-shaped underbody and claims to be more stable than conventional rigid dinghys, as well as a boomless sail with high clearance so that sailors have maximum mobility on deck. The dinghy's creators, based in Vannes, north-west France, claim the whole inflatable vessel can be assembled (pictured) in just 20 minutes . The boat measures just over three metres in length and has a sail that is slightly larger than five metres squared and a larger seven metres squared size is also available . The wide underbody also allows the dingy to accelerate quickly to reach planing speed – when a boat's centre of gravity moves up so there is less resistance from waves - in three to four force winds, which is a light to moderate breeze. In the event of capsizing, the boat can be righted by facing it into the wind and pushing the underwater wing down, while pulling on the daggerboard. The boat can be stored in two bags, each weighing 62lbs (28kg) which are designed to be easy to stored – perhaps even in a cubby hole of a larger yacht.

Made from the same PVC material used to build motor boats, the dinghy’s hull is created to be robust and to withstand occasional scrapes. The Tiwal 3.2 costs €5,490 (£4,521) for the vessel with a smaller sized sail and €5,840 (£4,809) for the model with the seven metre sail, although ironically shipping costs have to be negotiated with the company. The compact yacht is light enough to be carried to the water by two people, although the company is also rolling out a trolley so that one person can handle the craft - from the boot of their car to the sea - independently .

"By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . The head of the GCHQ is standing down amid controversy over the damaging revelations made by US whistleblower Edward Snowden. Security sources insisted that Sir Iain Lobban, 53, who has run the Cheltenham listening post since 2008, was always due to quit, labelling the timing ‘pure coincidence’. But insiders made clear that the crisis engulfing the eavesdropping agency may now lead to an outsider being installed as the new director general. Write caption here . The Snowden leaks lifted the lid on the scale of GCHQ’s role with America’s National Security Agency in monitoring electronic communications around  the world. A spokesman for the Foreign Office confirmed that Sir Iain would be leaving later this year. Officials stressed that he is ‘moving on’ not ‘stepping down’ but did not say where he is moving on to. Some senior figures are understood to believe that his successor needs to be better at convincing the public that GCHQ is a vital cornerstone of national security, rather than the threat to freedom that critics have claimed. Sir Iain’s counterparts at the NSA, General Keith Alexander and his deputy John Inglis, are also stepping down this year. Sir Iain Lobban will leave his role in November and an advertisement seeking his successor has begun circulating in Whitehall. Scrutiny: Sir Iain appeared in a rare public session before Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee last year alongside Andrew Parker and John Sawers, the heads of MI5 and MI6 respectively . A senior Downing Street source described the timing as ‘pure coincidence’ and added: ‘He was doing a very strong job.’ Among those being tipped to succeed Mr Lobban is Charles Farr, director of counter-terrorism at the Home Office. Whitehall’s leading ‘securocrat’, Farr began his intelligence career as a frontline officer with MI6. Oliver Robbins, who recently left the post of Deputy National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister and Robert Hannigan, director-general of Defence and Intelligence at the Foreign Office could also be considered if officials want to pick an outsider. A Whitehall source told the Mail: ‘Charles Farr is always going to be in the frame. We will look inside GCHQ and outside GCHQ. There is no rush. It’s an important job and we’ll make sure we get the right person.’ Whoever gets the job will command a staff of 6,000 and control the bulk of the £2 billion intelligence budget, which also pays for MI5 and MI6. Tough job: Whoever takes over at GCHQ (pictured) will command a staff of 6,000 and a £2 billion budget . Sir Iain is a career GCHQ officer and insiders at the Cheltenham HQ are keen to have another one of their own in charge. Richard Aldrich, Professor of International Security at the University of Warwick and author of a history of GCHQ, said the appointment would be a ‘litmus test’ of the Government’s confidence in the agency. ‘If they appoint someone from outside GCHQ, that will be interpreted inside the organisation as a smack in the face,’ he said. 'GCHQ remain far too secretive, they have . refused to explain what they do and why it is important. They’ve left a . huge vacuum which has been filled by Snowden’s version of events' - Professor Richard Aldrich, Warwick University . ‘There is a strong case for an insider. One thing we have learnt from the Snowden revelations is just how successful GCHQ has been in raw intelligence terms - it has about 15 per cent of the budget of the National Security Agency but does 30 per cent of the business of its American partner. ‘But they remain far too secretive, they have refused to explain what they do and why it is important. They’ve left a huge vacuum which has been filled by Snowden’s version of events. ‘The next director has to be someone who will take GCHQ out of the shadows but also be someone who understands the business.’ Sir Iain seemed uncomfortable with the limelight when he was questioned by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee alongside the heads of MI5 and MI6, Andrew Parker and Sir John Sawers. Lord Foulkes, a former member of committee, said: ‘I think he was doing a good job. He impressed when I was on the ISC. GCHQ is vital for national security and the recent publicity may have undermined this.’ Sir Iain’s counterparts at the NSA, General Keith Alexander and his deputy John Inglis, are also stepping down this year.","Sir Iain Lobban, 53, has run Cheltenham listening post since 2008 .

Port Authority insider admitted to the New York Post that the incident . was troubling and said they would take the security firm Durst . Organization to task. Embarrassing: A security camera is positioned next to a barbed wire fence outside Ground Zero and One World Trade Center on March 21, 2014 in New York City. Earlier this week a teenager successfully evaded security, climbed One World Trade Center and posted photos of the view to social networking sites . Durst spokesman Jordan Barowitz confirmed that Basher 'was terminated on the spot after he was found sleeping on the job.' Construction workers at the nearly completed tower were infuriated by the image. 'There’s our hardworking security right there . . . What a joke!' one said to The New York Post. In a week where security at One World Trade Center has dominated the news, the base jumpers who filmed as they leaped off One World Trade Center in a daredevil stunt have said they didn't mean to be disrespectful. James Brady and Andrew Rossig, who leaped off the 104th floor of Freedom Tower with their friend, Marko Markovich, in September, said the jump was supposed to be a private moment. But, after handing themselves into police Monday, the friends uploaded footage of the jump, made at 3am on September 30, last year. The video has quickly gone viral, with more than 200,000 views in just over one day. Collared: CNN producer Yon Pomrenze, 35, and . 26-year-old cameraman Connor Boals were arrested Tuesday after trying . three times to break into the World Trade Center site . Their actions were condemned by the Port Authority and New York Police Department, which said the jump 'violated the spirit of respect and reverence for this sacred site that almost all connected with the WTC project feel'. This followed the news that 16-year-old Justin Casquejo, of Weehakwen, bypassed security and climbed to the top of 1 World Trade Center. The teen was arrested at 6am on Sunday and charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass, said Joe Pentangelo, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site. The teen accessed the construction site of the nearly completed tower by slipping through a 1-foot opening in a fence at around 4.00 a.m., Pentangelo said. He then allegedly entered the tower by climbing scaffolding. Captured: Police allegedly seized the GoPro video of the BASE jump during a search of the four men's home last month, and it was not posted online until Monday . Going down: The initial free-fall from the 1,776ft tall One World Trade Center tower is several hundred feet . City that never sleeps: One of the jumpers descends on the streets of New York City . Confessed: James Brady, left, and Andrew Rossig, right, are accompanied by attorney Timothy Parlatore as they turn themselves in to police on Monday . 'He’s a skinny kid who got through a skinny hole,' a police source told the New York Post. Casquejo is said to have taken an elevator up to the 88th floor despite not having any identification, according to the paper. He was let off at the 88th floor and hoofed it up to the 104th floor where he sneaked past a sleeping guard to access the roof. That guard has since been fired, the spokesman said, but the elevator operator was ab;e to keep his job because he is in a union. Sneaky: Weehawken, New Jersey teen Justin Casquejo, 16, was arrested after successfully making it to the top of One World Trade Center in the middle of the night on March 16 . And as part of an investigation to expose perceived lapses in security, CNN producer Yon Promrenze, 35, and his 26-year-old cameraman Connor Boals tried to break in on Tuesday night. The two men first tried blatantly walking through a security gate on Vesey and Washington Streets but were stopped by an officer, Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman said. 'If a 16-year-old can get on the site, we should be able to get in as well,' one of them allegedly told the officer.","Embarrassing lapse of security exposed again at One World Trade Center .

"By . Eddie Wrenn . A 100 kilometre-wide crater has been found in Greenland, the . result of a massive asteroid impact a billion years before any other . known collision on Earth. The previously oldest known crater on Earth formed two billion years ago . and the chances of finding an even older impact were thought to be . astronomically low. Now, a team of scientists from the Geological Survey of . Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) in Copenhagen, Cardiff University in Wales, Lund . University in Sweden and the Institute of Planetary Science in Moscow has upset . these odds. Explosive: This simulated image shows how the impact would have looked - it would have wiped out all forms of higher life if it happened later in Earth's history . Hidden in the runes: Evidence came in the form of broken-up, contorted, melted and hydrothermally altered rocks affected by the impact and influx of sea-water during the impact . The spectacular craters on the Moon formed from impacts with . asteroids and comets betweenthree3 and four billion years ago. The early Earth, with . its far greater gravitational mass, must have experienced even more collisions . at this time - but the evidence has been eroded away or covered by younger . rocks. Following a detailed programme of fieldwork, funded by GEUS and the . Danish ‘Carlsbergfondet’ (Carlsberg Foundation), the team have discovered the . remains of a giant three billion-year-old impact near the Maniitsoq region of West . Greenland. 'This single discovery means that we can study the . effects of cratering on the Earth nearly a billion years further back in time . than was possible before,” according to Dr Iain McDonald of Cardiff . University’s School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, who was part of the team. It is possible or even likely that the meteorite hit the sea, for the . preserved rocks have been intensely altered by circulating hot aqueus . fluids. These fluids were likely derived from sea water that would have . been able to penetrate deep into the Earth's crust through the numerous . fissures and crush zones generated by the impact. Boris A. Ivanov at the Institute of Planetary Science, Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, has carried out a series of provisional model calculations, which suggest that the impacting meteorite at Maniitsoq may have had a diameter of more than 30 km, i.e., about twice the size of the Vredefort meteorite and with a mass about ten times larger. If this meteorite had hit the Moon, the final crater structure would have had a diameter well above 1000km and easily visible from Earth. However, due to the much stronger gravity of our planet, the Maniitsoq structure may have had a diameter of 'only' some 500-600km . Clues: Finnefjeld mountain, which is around 1050m high, is believed to be the crushed core of the structure . The dull grey rocks were crushed to fine powder by the impact, and then cut by white melt sheets . Making an impact: The asteroid is believed to have hit close to where the town of Maniitsoq in Greenland . If an impact of this size hit the Earth today, it would not only be . able to pulverise a medium-sized national state but its global effects . would also kill all higher life. Then, three billion years ago, there was not . much life to extinguish, but as yet no depositional rocks of matching . age have yet been identified that could enlighten the effects of the . Maniitsoq impact such as extreme tsunamis, deposition of re-condensated . atmospheric glass particles from the evaporated meteorite or other signs . of global atmospheric and marine effects. Finding the evidence was made all the harder because there . is no obvious bowl-shaped crater left to find. Over the three billion years since . the impact, the land has been eroded down to expose deeper crust 25km below . the original surface. All external parts of the impact structure have been . removed, but the effects of the intense impact shock wave penetrated deep into . the crust - far deeper than at any other known crater - and these remain . visible. However, because the effects of impact at these depths have . never been observed before it has taken nearly three years of painstaking work . to assemble all the key evidence. If you look at the Moon on a clear night through a pair of ordinary, . hand-held binoculars, you'll see a multitude of meteorite craters. Some are larger than 1000 km in diameter and readily visible with the naked eye. Through the first 500 million years of Solar System history, both the . Moon and the Earth were constantly bombarded with a multitude of small . and large meteorites and comets. Some scientists even think that life was brought to the Earth by comets. The Moon has preserved the remains of thousands of impacts, but on . Earth only about 180 such impact structures are known, and most of them . are very small, young and repidly decaying. Contrary to the Moon, the Earth is a dynamic planet with plate . tectonics, mountain belts and erosion, which means that most impact . structures are eroded away, destroyed by mountain building processes or . buried by younger deposits over geological time. Until recently, the 2.02 billion years old and 300 km wide Vredefort . crater in South Africa was considered to be both the oldest and largest . impact structure on Earth. It is estimated that the impacting meteorite had a diameter of about . 15 km. During the development of the final crater structure, a . kilometre-thick layer of sedimentary rocks containing the World's . largest gold deposits collapsed into the cavity excavated by the . meteorite and in this way became protected from erosion and preserved . until today. Also the second largest impact structure on Earth, the 1.85 billion . years old Sudbury crater in Canada, hosts world-class mineral deposits - . in this case nickel-rich minerals that were melted and concentrated by . the extreme heating caused by the impact. 'The process was rather like a Sherlock . Holmes story,' said Dr McDonald. 'We eliminated the impossible in . terms of any conventional terrestrial processes, and were left with a giant . impact as the only explanation for all of the facts.' Only around 180 impact craters have ever been discovered on . Earth and around 30 per cent of them contain important natural resources of minerals or . oil and gas. The largest and oldest known crater prior to this study, the 300 . kilometre wide Vredefort crater in South Africa, is 2 billion years in age and . heavily eroded. Dr McDonald added that 'It has taken us nearly three . years to convince our peers in the scientific community of this but the mining . industry was far more receptive. A Canadian exploration company has been using . the impact model to explore for deposits of nickel and platinum metals at . Maniitsoq since the autumn of 2011.' The international team was led by Adam A. Garde, senior . research scientist at GEUS. The first scientific paper documenting the . discovery has just been published in the journal ‘Earth and Planetary Science . Letters’.","100km (62mile) wide crater discovered in Greenland - and it is possible crater is more than 500km in size .

"By . James Black . Student representatives claim that fingerprint records will infringe privacy rights . University students may have to scan their fingerprints in future to prove they are going to their lectures. Newcastle University plans to introduce biometric scanners to bring the  institution in line with the UK Border Agency (UKBA) and clamp down on illegal  immigrants. Students and staff at the North-East university will be monitored through the  Student Attendance system from the start of next academic year. Exactly how it will work is still in question but one option being discussed is  to introduce finger scanners at lectures and classes. These readers would recognise students' fingerprints and collect data on which  sessions they have attended. Newcastle University claims the move is a necessary step to meet their  obligation to UKBA and ensure international students don't use student visas as  a way to sneak into the country and work illegally. But the university also believes the new system will keep on top of attendance  and help identify home students who are in need of support.   But some students and staff claim the move is 'unnecessary and intrusive'. A student group at Newcastle University claims biometric scanning is over the  top and infringes their privacy. Newcastle Free Education Network has organised protests against the plans,  claiming the scanners would 'turn universities into border checkpoints' and  'reduce university to the attendance of lectures alone'. In a referendum at the Students' Union, 1,200 students voted against the  scheme, with just 320 voting in favour. Dr Kyle Grayson, a senior lecturer in international politics at the university,  spoke at a student meeting. He said finger scanning risked ruining the university's reputation overseas. Dr Grayson said: 'I have had international students say that they don't pay  thousands of pounds a year to be treated like they are on probation. 'Part of the problem is that the Government has created the issue about student  visas being an easy way to get into the country and work illegally, but it has  been blown out of proportion. 'The majority of students, especially at a university like Newcastle, are  genuine. 'They are creating this whole surveillance operation to deal with  something which isn't a big problem. 'If you asked a student in the USA whether they wanted to go to Newcastle and  be biometrically scanned three or four times a week, or to St Andrews, or  Northumbria, or elsewhere where they don't have to do that, it is an easy  choice.' The university has tabled the move to comply with a Border Agency crackdowns on misuse of student visas . Dr Grayson said home students had also raised concerns about how the data could  be used, or what would happen if it was breached. Jeannette Strachan, academic registrar for student and academic services at the  university, said various options are being considered. She said: 'As part of UKBA licence agreements, every university is obliged to  carry out attendance monitoring to be able to certify at any time, to any visit  by the UKBA, that an international student is present on campus and engaged in  their studies. 'If either a student or a university does not comply with UKBA requirements  then that student and university is at risk of severe sanctions.'","Biometric scanners to be introduced in line with the UK Border Agency measures .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Prince Harry made a grovelling apology and Tory MP Aidan Burley attracted public vilification. But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls yesterday offered no hint of shame for wearing a Nazi uniform while at university, brushing it off as ‘a laugh’. In an interview likely to be seen as deeply insensitive, Mr Balls said he was ‘not embarrassed’ by the photo unearthed by the Daily Mail four years ago, saying the costume was handed to him as a prank by fellow students at Oxford. Shameless: Ed Balls, on the left, wearing Nazi . uniform. Mr Balls said he was 'not embarrassed' by the photo taken at a Christmas dinner while . he was a student at Oxford in 1987 and brushed it off as 'a laugh' He was speaking ahead of the keynote speech by leader Ed Miliband at the Labour party conference in Manchester, in which he is set to tell delegates how his parents fled Nazi persecution. ‘Of course I’m not embarrassed by it’, Mr Balls told the Huffington Post website. ‘If I had the choice again, would I do it? No. Is there a difference between being 20 and being 40? Yes. 'I went along with it for a laugh. In retrospect I wouldn’t do it again.’ He told an interviewer the uniform was handed to him by ‘the left caucus’ at Keble College, Oxford at the end-of-term Christmas dinner in 1987. Then known as Eddie, the future . cabinet minister, was then president of the Junior Common Room, the . college’s elected student body and had during that term vetoed student . calls for a rent freeze - in favour of an unpopular 2.5 per cent rise. Not an 'alpha male': Mr Balls insisted he shares cooking and shopping at home with his wife Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary . Mr Balls had, shortly before the photo emerged in 2008, called for pupils from every school in Britain to visit Nazi death camps in Poland - and when David Cameron criticised the scheme as a gimmick, described it as a ‘disgraceful remark’. He was more bashful about the incident when questioned last year when he told a magazine: ‘At the Christmas dinner, the members decided that the committee should be required to wear costumes. 'Mine was chosen by them. They decided I was a dictator. ‘When you’re 20, and it’s the Christmas dinner, do you make a stand as a matter of principle, or do you go along with it? I went along with it. Everyone has their regrets, I’m sure.’ In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Balls was asked what he would like to be written on his tombstone, to which he replied: ‘I think I probably couldn’t give a flying toss. He went on: ‘There is something fabulous and noble and tragic about people whose reputations are finally rehabilitated and discovered thirty, forty or fifty years later. 'In some cases, that can almost be the most selfless thing. Those people are not the kind of people who worry about what’s on their tombstone.’ Asked about what he might do if his political career ended, he said he was full of admiration for doctors, and had thought about following his father - an eminent professor of cell biology - into medicine, but said he had ‘sight of blood issues’. If choosing again, he said he would be a head teacher. Asked about his image as a ‘bruiser’ or ‘attack dog’, he was said to become irritated, saying: ‘If I was 5’ 5” and 11 stone they wouldn’t call me a bruiser.’ He added that he did not consider himself an ‘alpha male’, saying he did the cooking and shopping in the home he shares with his wife, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and their three children. ‘This morning, before I got on the train, I spent three-quarters of an hour doing my piano lesson,’ he added.","Photo taken at Oxford University Christmas dinner .

Captain Alan G Poindexter, 51, was on a stationary jet ski with his 22-year-old son yesterday afternoon when his 26-year-old son crashed into them with another one. An emergency responder told the Pensacola News Journal: 'Zachary hit the rear of the jet ski the father and his brother were . on. Respected: Astronaut Captain Alan Poindexter, 51, died in a jet ski accident at Pensacola Beach in Florida after his 26-year-old son Zachary (right) crashed into him . 'Captain . Poindexter was then knocked off his jet ski.' Poindexter was pulled from the water around 1.30pm at Little Sabine Bay, Pensacola Beach in Florida where friends performed CPR. The married father was taken to Baptist hospital but died a short time later, said a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission official. An investigation is underway. His son Samuel, 22, who was riding with him, and brother 26-year-old Zachary Poindexter were not injured. Tragedy: The respected astronaut was at Little Sabine Bay (pictured) with his two sons on Sunday afternoon when the two jet skis collided . Love: Captain Poindexter with his wife Lisa. The couple have two sons who were also involved in the tragic incident where the astronaut died . The retired astronaut is married to Lisa Pfeiffer Poindexter, originally from Florida. Poindexter, known was 'Dex', piloted the Atlantis space shuttle in 2008. On their Facebook page, NASA wrote: 'The NASA family was sad to learn of the passing of our former friend, and colleague Alan Poindexter who was killed today during a jet ski accident in Florida. 'Our thought and hearts are with his family.' Captain Alan G Poindexter, known affectionately to colleagues as 'Dex', was a decorated naval officer and space shuttle pilot. The married, father-of-two gained a masters of science in aeronautical engineering before serving as a naval pilot from 1988. He made two deployments to the Persian Gulf during Operations Desert Storm and Southern Watch. He was selected for NASA in 1998, rising to commander of shuttle Discovery in 2010. An astronaut colleague Gregory Johnson wrote on Twitter: 'He was a talented, courageous Navy veteran with gifts. 'Dex was a lovable guy with a strong work ethic.' The astronaut was born in Pasadena, California but grew up in Rockville, Maryland. Poindexter went to high school in Coronado, California before receiving an associate's degree in engineering from Pensacola Junior College in 1983. He went on to Georgia Tech, graduating with a bachelor's degree of aerospace engineering in 1986 before earning his masters from the Naval Postgraduate School. Following military service, he was . selected by NASA in 1998. He made his first trip into space in 2002 to . the International Space Station.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . JPMorgan Chase said Friday that a bad trade cost the bank $5.8billion this year, almost triple its original estimate, and raised the prospect that traders lied to cover up the multi-billion blunder. The bank said managers tied to the bad trade had been fired without severance and that it planned to revoke two years' worth of pay from each of those executives. The infamous so-called ‘London whale’ trader Bruno Iksil, who  placed the extremely risky bets on the credit market prompting the massive loss, has also left the bank. A whale of a drop: JPMorgan Chase's share price dropped dramatically after the news of the multi-billion-dollar blunder surfaced in mid April but is now on the rise, coming in at $36 just before noon on Friday . Trouble: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is seen entering the bank Friday before announcing that a bad trade lead to $5.8billion in losses in the past quarter, nearly three times the amount it was expected to lose . Achilles Macris, who headed the Chief Investment Office in Europe, and a third colleague, Martin Javier-Artajo, were also no longer listed in the company's internal employment database as of Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Friday. The company in May accepted the early retirement of Ina Drew, who headed the overall Chief Investment Office and worked for the bank for more than 20 years. She was the one to report that the bank lost an additional $1.4billion in the first three months of the year. Preparing: Jamie Dimon, seen inside the New York headquarters, has close ties to President Obama but that didn't stop him from appearing before two House investigation committees . CEO Jamie Dimon spoke highly of Drew’s talents and integrity, saying she volunteered to leave and to repay the maximum 'clawback' amount of the $31.5million she was awarded in 2010 and 2011. 'I got several letters from former chairmen who talked about her contribution,' Dimon said. 'One even said she saved the company. She has acted with integrity and tried to do what was right for the company at all times, even though she was part of this mistake.' The $5.8billion loss total is up from their earlier report that a trade lost $4.4billion from April through June, which was double the initial May 10 estimate by Dimon that the bank only lost $2billion. Speaking broadly about the trading loss on Friday, Dimon told analysts: 'We don't take it lightly.' He added: 'We're not making light of this error, but we do think it's an isolated event.' Dimon said the bank had closed the division of the bank responsible for the bad trade and moved the remainder of the trading position under its investment banking division. Dimon told Congress last month that the trade was meant to hedge risk to the company and protect it in case 'things got really bad' in the global economy. Instead, the trade has backfired and damaged the bank's reputation. 'This has shaken our company to the core,' CEO Jamie Dimon said. As part of the long scandal, the bank organized an internal investigation. Since looking over employees’ emails and voice messages, they announced Friday that they believe some traders may have lied while setting the values for certain bets in order to mask losses elsewhere. Paltry estimates: CEO Jamie Dimon initially thought that the bank would lose $2billion from the bad trade but that has ballooned into $5.8billion according to a statement Friday . Retired early: Ina Drew had been at the bank for over 20 years and retired amid the scandal and quickly offered to give back the $31.5million she earned in the last two years . The bank said that it was reducing its . net income for the first quarter by $459million because it had . discovered information that 'raises questions about the integrity' of . values placed on certain trades. Adding . to the perception problems facing JP Morgan, the bank said it earned . $5billion, or $1.21 per share, for the second quarter, which covers . April through June and includes the bank's disclosure of the trading . loss on May 10. This marks . an unexpected profit, as analysts surveyed by FactSet, a provider of . financial data, had expected JPMorgan to earn 76 cents per share. JPMorgan's . stock climbed $1, or 3 per cent, to $35.05 after Dimon seemed to . indicate that the losses from the trade were contained. Dimon said that . the trade might not lose any more money. Investors were also cheered to hear that the bank might resume its plan to buy back its own stock. Dimon said the bank was in discussions . with the Federal Reserve and would submit a plan in hopes of buying back . stock starting late this year. The company suspended an earlier plan to . buy back $15billion of its stock after reporting the trading loss. Just three months ago, JPMorgan was viewed as the top American bank, guided by Dimon's steady hand. Since the disclosure of the trading loss, however, that reputation has been eroded. President Obama didn't seem too . perturbed by Dimon's andling of the situation, and stuck by his friend . when asked about the financial sector during an appearance on The View. Mr Obama said Dimon 'is one of the smartest bankers we got, and they still lost $2billion and counting.' Dimon, who originally dismissed . concerns about the bank's trading as a 'tempest in a teapot,' appeared . before Congress twice to apologize and explain himself, and several . government agencies have launched investigations. Explanation: Dimon appeared twice in front of the House Financial Services committee to apologize and explain the loss and many described his attitude as cavalier . The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. JPMorgan has lost about 15 per cent of its market value since the loss came to light. Dimon said Friday that Ina Drew, the bank's former chief investment officer, who left after the trading loss came to light, had volunteered to give back the maximum possible amount of pay. The maximum appeared to be two years' worth of pay. Drew made $15million in 2011. Mike Cavanaugh, who is leading a team of JPMorgan executives overseeing the trading loss, said the bank would also seek to revoke two years' worth of pay from other top managers tied to the trade. That procedure is known as a 'clawback.' It would be the first time JPMorgan exercised such a procedure. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that three other employees of the bank tied to the trade, including one who was known as the 'London whale,' had left the bank. Under close questioning from lawmakers in June about his own role in setting up the investment division responsible for the mess, Dimon declared: 'We made a mistake. I'm absolutely responsible. The buck stops with me.' The trading loss has raised concerns that the biggest banks still pose risks to the U.S. financial system, less than four years after the financial crisis erupted in the fall of 2008.","Company initially said risky trade would lose $2billion but announced Friday the total is now $5.8billion .

'I have a friend in Latvia who dresses like a goth but people think she is Satanic.' Katie’s mum said: 'I love the way Katie dresses, I find it fascinating because it’s just so alien to my world. 'There’s always a risk that people will misinterpret it, but that’s not a reason to stop doing it. 'I think it’s important to let children be anyone who they want and explore different ways of living.' But as well as being a way of expressing her creative side, Katie says her doll-like appearance often attracts attention from the opposite sex. Support system: Katie admits she owes her confidence to her mother Jill (L) who has always supported the way she dresses . Despite dressing provocatively, Katie insists she only gets positive comments. She said: 'I get a lot of attention from men, but I think my piercings scare them off. 'Most people are just intrigued by what I’m wearing. I get a lot of nice comments. 'The other day a white van man drove past. I thought he was going to shout something rude, but he just smiled and said ""it’s good to be different."" 'I usually get nice comments from middle aged men who say my hair is really cool or they like my face. 'Admittedly there are some people who think I’m doing it for attention but that’s not the case - I’m doing it because I enjoy it.' Individual: Katie doesn't even think twice about what people think about her because she's always been told it's OK to look how she does by her own mother (L) Age 6, (R) age seventeen . As she was: After leaving school, where she was bullied, Katie created her own YouTube channel Iska Ithil to show her 10,000 followers how to achieve her look . Since the age of four, when she got a PlayStation for her birthday, Katie has been fascinated with characters from computer games. She owns hundreds of video games and has spent as long as 24 hours at a time playing games like Final Fantasy with boyfriend Adam Woods, 20, who studies music at Goldsmiths, University of London. Katie said: 'We met playing video games at a friend’s house, but Adam doesn’t dress up. I suspect we look like a bit of an odd couple when I’m all dressed up and he’s in his beige trench coat. 'But it doesn’t bother me in the slightest. As long as he’s comfortable in what he’s wearing that’s fine with me.' Katie even goes to meet ups with best friend Holly Allen, 19, and dresses up as her favourite character from Final Fantasy - the scantily clad Serah Farron. Hobbies: She owns hundreds of video games and has spent as long as 24 hours at a time playing games like Final Fantasy with her boyfriend . The role-play game originates from Japan and is known as Cosplay - costume play. Katie said: 'Ever since I was a teenager I’ve enjoyed creating new characters and becoming them. 'It guess there is an element of escapism - the people at the Cosplay meetups are usually the ones who got bullied. 'They are trying to find a happier way of doing things. 'You can go to a meetup and be as weird as you like and no-one cares - you’re allowed to be who you want to be - even if you can’t be that person in reality.' Despite the fact that Katie refuses to compromise on her look, Jill isn’t worried that her job prospects will be affected in the future. She said: 'People see Katie in the street and say, ""look at the state of that."" 'I’ve also heard people say ""how do you think you’ll ever get a job?"" 'But Katie never rises to it. I think that’s really sad that someone couldn’t get a job and take part in society because they’re not conforming with their appearance. 'I know Katie won’t have a problem because she will only work in an area where her look is accepted. She’s not looking for an office job. 'But if she needed to in order to survive, I think her look would be a problem for her, and I just think that’s sad.'

"By . Christine Challand . and Jonathan Petre . The pancreatic cancer sufferer who sparked outrage  for declaring in an advertising campaign ‘I wish I had breast cancer’ last night insisted: ‘I meant it and still mean it.’ Kerry Harvey, 25, has been hit with hate messages since the provocative advert first appeared, including one from a Twitter user wishing her dead. Even TV presenter Gloria Hunniford, whose daughter died of breast cancer, denounced the campaign, saying it had made her feel ‘almost sick’. Inflammatory: Kerry Harvey, 25, in the campaign for the pancreatic cancer ad . But Kerry is adamant she had no regrets about appearing in the shock campaign to raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which has far lower survival rates than breast cancer. She said: ‘I know I upset a lot of people by saying what I did, but it’s true. If I had breast cancer rather than pancreatic cancer, it is almost certain I wouldn’t now be dying. Instead I’ve been told I’ve only got four to five months to live. ‘Hopefully the campaign will lead to more money being spent on research into pancreatic cancer. It won’t help me, but I hope it will mean others will have a better chance than I have.’ Kerry’s comments follow attacks by . breast cancer campaigners, who say it is ‘utterly misleading’ to suggest . breast cancer might be a more desirable form of the disease. Kerry with fiance Matt Biggin in 2011 before the illness was diagnosed . But the charity Pancreatic Cancer Action defended its tactics, saying that while 85 per cent of breast cancer patients will survive for at least five years after their diagnosis, that figure falls to just three per cent for pancreatic cancer sufferers. Kerry, one of three sufferers to appear in the campaign, said: ‘I will never regret saying it publicly. I’m not saying that breast cancer is easier to deal with. 'But I wish I had it because I would have a fighting chance of survival. In the past couple of weeks, cancer lumps have grown on my head and in my breasts so I know I won’t be coming back from this.’ Kerry said she plans to use the time she has left campaigning and is determined to marry her fiance Matt Biggin in May. Matt, 30, who is now Kerry’s full-time carer, is sickened by vicious jibes at her on Twitter and Facebook. One Twitter  user said they hoped Kerry wouldn’t be in the three per cent of patients who survive. ‘It’s a sick, sad thing to do, but we’re just ignoring it and it won’t make any different to our support for the campaign,’ said Matt. ‘I have always been proud of Kerry and the way she has dealt with her illness. She’s amazing.’ Kerry began suffering from acute stomach pains in November 2012. It took five A&E visits spread over four months before doctors confirmed pancreatic cancer in February last year. In November, doctors told her to focus . on palliative care rather than further treatment. She said: ‘I’ve . received so much support from Pancreatic Cancer Action so I didn’t . hesitate when they asked me to join the campaign.’ Shameful: It took five A&E visits over four months for doctors to diagnose Kerry with pancreatic cancer . Gloria Hunniford, who set up the Caron Keating Foundation  in memory of her daughter who died in 2004, called the campaign ‘very insensitive’. She said: ‘I feel almost sick when I read the words “I wish I had breast cancer”. ‘I watched my daughter battle breast cancer for seven years. At no time would she have said, ‘‘I’ve have preferred another form of cancer.’’ She didn’t want it at all. You can’t play one cancer against another.’ But Ali Stunt, Pancreatic Cancer . Action founder and survivor of the disease, defended the campaign, . admitting she knew it would shock people – although she apologised to . anyone who had been upset by it. She . said: ‘The words that have been used are how genuine people with . pancreatic cancer feel. It’s about raising awareness for a disease that . gets  little attention.’ Kerry with Matt who has become her full time carer, left, and on the day she shaved her head for the first time . Every day in the UK, 23 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and average life expectancy is less than six months. A spokeswoman for Pancreatic Cancer Action added: ‘We’re all campaigning for the same cause – to improve everyone’s chance of beating cancer. 'We just have to shout that little bit louder to get heard. ‘We are trying to create a discussion and a debate to make people realise that when faced with a pancreatic cancer diagnosis and a survival rate of only three per cent, it is not unreasonable to wish for a significantly better chance of staying alive.’","Kerry Harvey has been bombarded with hate messages since ad appeared .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Maine babysitter is accused of fatally dropping a 5-month-old baby and then choking the infant's three-year-old brother after the toddler kicked him in the groin. Samuel Moore, 25, of Bangor was indicted Wednesday by a grand jury and is facing one count of depraved indifference murder as well as the manslaughter for the March 3 incident, which caused the death of Korbyn Garfield Antworth two days later at Eastern Maine Medical Center. Police say Moore had been babysitting the brothers for their parents, William and Brittany Antworth, and had been 'tossing (Korbyn) around' when the couple's 3-year-old son 'struck him in the groin' to get him to stop shaking the baby. Charged: Samuel Moore, 25, pictured, of Bangor was indicted Wednesday by a grand jury and is facing one count of depraved indifference murder as well as the manslaughter for causing the March 5 death of Korbyn Garfield Antworth at Eastern Maine Medical Center . Tragic: Korbyn Garfield Antworth, pictured, at Eastern Maine Medical Center was seriously injured on March 3 and died in hospital two days later . More told investigators that he then dropped the baby from approximately 6 feet and 'he was not caught and did strike the floor,' according to Bangor Detective Brent Beaulieu. The 25-year-old then 'choked [the elder boy] out of anger,' an affidavit reveals. Korbyn suffered 11 rib fractures and had bleeding in his brain. Both injuries are consistent with shaken baby syndrome. The toddler's face was covered with petechiae, small red or purple spots that indicate a minor hemorrhage, police said. Family: Parents William and Brittany Antworth, pictured, hired Moore as a babysitter. The couple's 3-year-old, pictured center, was allegedly strangled by Moore . Injuries: Korbyn, pictured left with his mom and right, suffered 11 rib fractures and had bleeding in his brain - injuries consistent with shaken baby syndrome . Held: Moore is being held at the Penobscot County Jail on $100,000 bond for the alleged murder of little Korbyn, pictured . Of the elder boy's injuries, Moore told the Ms Ashworth the child had 'ended up choking himself with a makeshift cape that he had tied around his neck himself,' according to Bangor Daily News. However the alleged assault was uncovered by detectives. When questioned about the child's injuries, Moore first told police that he 'had performed a wrestling move' on the boy that caused him to lose consciousness, the affidavit said. 'Moore admitted that [the boy] was limp for 10 to 15 seconds and this had scared him.' Moore was also indicted Wednesday on one count of aggravated assault for the allegedly choking. Moore is being held at the Penobscot County Jail on $100,000 bond. The baby's cause of death has not been released.","Samuel Moore, 25, of Bangor is facing one count of depraved indifference murder as well as the manslaughter for the March 3 incident .

"By . Ashley Collman . A 52-year-old Michigan man accused of murdering his sister and her husband in a crime of incestuous passion became combative in court this week when he took to the stand to answer questions about his inappropriate sibling relationship. Prosecutors argued that it was Ryan Wyngarden's sexual history with sister Gail Brink that caused him to fatally shoot her and husband Rick out of jealousy on November 21, 1987 - just 18 months after the couple were wed. The Brinks' murder was a cold case for many years until Wyngarden's wife Pam came forward to authorities, saying her husband confessed to killing the couple as well as revealing the fact that he had an incestuous relationship with his sister. Combative: Wyngarden had to be warned several times not to talk out of order when he became argumentative in court yesterday . Suspect: Ryan Wyngarden, 52, argued with prosecutors in court yesterday as they questioned him about the incestuous relationship he had with his sister, who was murdered along with her husband in 1987. Wyngarden is pictured in court on Tuesday . Crime of passion: Rick and Gail Bring were found murdered in their Park Township, Michigan home on November, 21 1987. Prosecutors are arguing that their deaths were carried out by a jealous Wyngarden . At a hearing last year, Pam recounted the moment Wyngarden allegedly told her he had carried out the murders in November 1987, just three months after they first started dating. Case reopened: The Brink murders were a cold case for many years until Wyngarden's wife came forward, and told authorities that her husband confessed to the crimes. He was arrested last year and wrote 29 letters to wife Pam, trying to discourage her from testifying . 'He was upset and crying,' she told the court. 'And I asked, ""What's wrong?"" and he said, ""I shot and killed Rick and Gail"". I asked if he had called the police, and he said no.' When she asked him why he had killed them, 'he said the reason he shot them was he didn't want Rick to find out the intimate relationship between him and Gail and that he was jealous', she said. But in court this week, Wyngarden tried to convince the jury that those sexually-related incidents wouldn't have provided a motive for killing his sister. In his testimony, Wyngarden admitted to having three sexual experiences with Gail, but denied the two ever had intercourse. The first instance happened when Wyngarden was 12 and his sister was nine. He said they were naked and 'just playing around...comparing body parts' when their mom came into the room. 'There was nothing sexual about it,' he said. The next time the two had a sexual encounter was one or two years later when the siblings were smoking marijuana. 'We just groped on each other a little bit. There was no clothing that ever came off. That was pretty much that,' he said. The final instance happened when Wyngarden was 15 and again involved marijuana.Wyngarden described the encounter as 'consensual' and says the two touched genitals but it didn't escalate to sex. 'My sister did not lose her virginity to me,' he said. Those he confided in about the incest, including his other sister Lynn, say he wanted to apologize to Gail because 'he felt like he raped her'. 'I wouldn't have killed my sister over this,' an emotional Wyngarden said. Having to talk about the sexual encounters caused Wyngarden to become antagonistic with the prosecutor, constantly talking out of turn. At one point the judge had to order the jury out of the court room so he could warn Wyngarden not to talk over the prosecutor. 'Mr. Wyngarden, you canâ€™t argue with me,' the judge said. 'This isnâ€™t going to end well for you with the jury.' It was also revealed in court this week that Wyngarden tried to convince his wife Pam not to testify in the trial after he was arrested for the murders last year. Secret-keeper no more: Wife Pam Wyngarden cries as she takes the stand to testify against her husband on Tuesday, March 25, 2014 . Happier times: The Wyngarden couple pictured together before the startling revelations . He sent 29 letters to Pam in the span of six months while he was in jail waiting for arrival, sometimes threatening her with God's spite. 'I am beyond belief that Pam sticks to this lie, but I truly believe God's light will bring the truth' he wrote in one letter. Wyngarden's defense attorney is arguing that the Brinks were victims in a case of a mistaken identity. The couple had recently moved into a home vacated by residents who had links to the narcotics trade and connections to a Detroit-area biker game. Wyngarden is facing two charges of first-degree murder and could serve life in prison if convicted.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The U.S. Secret Service's latest brush with booze-related embarrassment in the Netherlands last week comes as the agency's higher-ups already were on high alert about agents' alcohol use following an incident involving two agents earlier this month, according to published reports. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson had reportedly warned supervisors about agents' alcohol use after two counter-sniper officers were involved in a car accident on March 7, during a presidential visit to Miami. The agent driving the vehicle passed a field sobriety test and was not arrested. However, it was suspected that alcohol was involved. Under fire: Secret Service supervisors were warned about alcohol use prior to last week's incident in the Netherlands . Warnings: Secret Service Director Julia Pierson is catching criticism for last week's drunken incident in the Netherlands . The Washington Post, which broke both the story about the incidents in the Netherlands and in Miami, cites 'people familiar with the incidents' as the paper's sources. Last week, three Secret Service agents tasked with protecting President Obama on his trip to the G7 summit in the Netherlands were sent home and suspended after a night of drinking after one of the agents was found passed out on the floor in their hotel. When the U.S. Embassy in Amsterdam learned of the incident from the management of the hotel, the agents' superiors responsible for the president's travel plans were immediately notified. Scandal: Three of President Barack Obama's Secret Service agents (not pictured) were disciplined and sent home from the Netherlands after getting drunk in a hotel a day before the commander-in-chief's arrival Monday . On Tuesday, Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan confirmed that the federal agency 'did send three employees home for disciplinary reasons.' The unnamed agents were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. Anonymous sources familiar with the embarrassing episode told The Post that the agents are members of the elite Counter Assault Team. The Secret Service staffers allegedly got sloshed the day before Mr Obama arrived in the Netherlands for the high-level G7 talks with other world leaders to discuss the crisis in Crimea. The incident comes on the heels of a 2012 scandal where a dozen Secret Service agents hired prostitutes in Cartagena, Columbia, during preparations for President Obama's visit to the South American country. In the aftermath of the reported debauchery, Pierson was named the first female director of the male-dominated Secret Service last March. In a bid to change the culture of the agency, the Secret Service has adopted a new set of rules that prohibit any staffer from consuming alcohol 10 hours prior to being on duty while on an official trip. The agents at the center of the incident in the Netherlands were part of a large entourage consisting of military and State Department personnel sent as an advance team to prepare for President Obama's week-long trip to Europe and Saudi Arabia. Drunk: The hotel Huis ter Duin was where a Secret Service agent was found passed out drunk in the hallway . Official entourage: The agents in question were members of a large team of Secret Service, the military and State Department personnel who were sent ahead to make preparations for the president's week-long trip . A source told the paper that one of the agents caught drinking just hours before a briefing Sunday was a 'team leader.' The Counter Assault Team is considered the most elite of all Secret Service units, its highly trained members responsible for protecting the president if he comes under attack. Secret Service Director Pierson traveled aboard Air Force One with Mr Obama and is expected to accompany him to the Middle East on the next leg of his trip. Sources tell the Post that the Netherlands incident enraged Secret Service managers because it happened so close to the incident in Miami. Following the Miami incident, the two officers involved were sent back to Washington D.C. The two officers involved are part of the uniformed division, sources told the paper, and following the wreck they notified their superiors. They were ordered back to Washington as part of the agency's 'no tolerance' policy. Both officers continue to work for the Secret Service. The Secret Service says the Sunday incidents haven’t compromised Obama’s security.","Just weeks before a drunken incident in the Netherlands, Secret Service agents were warned about alcohol use .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Darren Shearer has been jailed for possessing images of child abuse and distributing them to other paedophiles on the internet . A former BBC engineer who downloaded tens of thousands of child porn images and stashed many of them on computer equipment stored at his work was jailed for 20 months yesterday. Darren Shearer, 26, spent five years collecting a catalogue of indecent images and videos including 270 pictures at the most serious level 5 category. Many of the images were discovered on a computer hard drive at the BBC’s Mailbox studios in Birmingham where he worked as an outside broadcast engineer. Shearer also used chat messaging services to contact other paedophiles on the internet to discuss sexual abuse of children. Many of the images depicted teenage boys who had 'gone through puberty', a court heard. Shearer was working for the BBC at the time of the offences which took place between December 2008 and February this year. Yesterday he was jailed for 20 months at Worcester Crown Court after previously admitting 18 counts of making indecent images and five charges of distributing them. He was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register for 10 years and served with a 10 year Sexual Offences Prevention Order. After intelligence was received by West Mercia Police about Shearer downloading indecent images from a file sharing network, officers executed a warrant at his home in Worcester. He was arrested and his computing equipment was seized. The force’s High-Tech Crime Unit found clear evidence that Shearer was knowingly distributing to a large number of people pictures and videos graphically showing the sexual abuse of children by adults. Police went on to find Shearer had also saved abuse images on computers at the BBC in Birmingham, but he denied they were his and tried to blame their presence on . He also used chat messaging services to ask for images and discuss the sexual abuse of children with others. They went on to find Shearer had also saved abuse images on computers at the BBC in Birmingham, but he denied they were his and tried to blame their presence on colleagues. Investigating officer Detective Constable Sarah Wood, of West Mercia Police, said: 'Behind every child abuse image is an abused child, an exploited and helpless victim. 'When these images are circulated online, they can live on forever. 'Shearer fervently denied the allegations and it took the intensive efforts of the forensic investigators at the High-Tech Crime Unit to prove he was responsible for not just viewing some terrible images of child abuse, but distributing them to other offenders. The Mailbox, Birmingham, where the BBC is located. They said that Shearer was dismissed as soon as the BBC heard of the crime . 'As an organisation we were not deterred by Shearer’s denials. It is our responsibility is to protect children wherever they live and to bring criminals to justice wherever they operate. 'Our investigation has led us to other paedophiles, who we are now investigating and prosecuting; one other man has already be convicted as a result of this case. 'Shearer did decide to admit his crimes but only at a late stage when the trial was almost underway. The sentence reflects the seriousness of his offences and I welcome it. 'We are grateful to the team from the High Tech Crime Unit for their assistance as well as the BBC for co-operating fully with our investigation.' A BBC spokesperson said: 'Darren Shearer no longer works for the BBC - he was suspended at the earliest opportunity upon hearing of the shocking allegations and was dismissed in March 2013.

"By . Margot Peppers . and Ap . The founder of a sexually transmitted disease information app called Hula said he doesn't plan to change the name despite an online petition asking him to do so. But he said he now understands why the tagline 'getting lei'd' is culturally insensitive. Hula CEO and founder Ramin Bastani told The Associated Press on Wednesday that his Los Angeles-based company is working hard to understand concerns raised by some in the Native Hawaiian community. An online petition, which had more than 700 signatures on Change.org, says the name exploits a beloved cultural art form. Backlash: Ramin Bastani, the founder of STD information app Hula, has been forced to apologize after a petition was launched by native Hawaiians claiming the name is culturally insensitive . Mr Bastani said he immediately removed any references to 'getting lei'd' when concerns were brought to his attention by a Native Hawaiian health expert last month. 'We didn't realize that it was offensive,' he said. 'We removed any connection to it.' But the name Hula will remain, he said: 'We want to do the right thing. Changing the name, for us, doesn't make sense.' The petition was started by three college students who went to high school at Kamehameha Schools, which gives admission preference to students with Native Hawaiian ancestry, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The petition notes that the arrival of Europeans exposed Native Hawaiians to foreign diseases such as gonorrhea and syphilis. 'My culture is more than a tourist destination,' Kelly Luis, a student at Columbia University, told the newspaper. 'We didn't realize the term ""getting lei'd"" was offensive. We removed any connection to it' 'It is more than a place to go for the summer. It's more than just sexy hula girls on the beach. There is a culture there.' The app was originally named Qpid.me, . but it sounded too similar to a dating site and was changed to Hula . because the company wanted to evoke a 'sense of beauty and being . relaxed,' Mr Bastani said. 'It was a pop culture sense of the name.' 'We loved the idea of calm and beauty . of anything Hawaiian,' he said, 'which is the antithesis of anything . having to do with health care.' Cultural mainstay: 'Hula was and still is a sacred art form of the Hawaiian people,' reads the petition. 'It recounts the history of our people' Response: Mr Bastani removed references to 'getting lei'd' after learning it was offensive, but the name Hula will remain, he said: 'We want to do the right thing. Changing the name, for us, doesn't make sense' Learning about Hawaiian culture has taught him that dancing hula is a 'communication tool' used to pass on information among generations. 'That plays very well with what we actually believe as the core of the company,' he said. Mr Bastani said he apologizes to anyone who has been offended and that he never meant any harm. He also noted that there have been some Native Hawaiians and others in Hawaii who are supportive of the name. In the past, he has worn a lei when making presentations about the company, he said. 'Now that we know that's an insensitive way of doing it, it's not something we'll do anymore,' he stated. Hula, which was launched last month, promises to make the dating world 'less awkward' with a profile feature that displays which STDs you've been tested for . It not only helps you find local test centers, but it also has healthcare providers send your results directly to the app, where you can share them with others on the social network. STD social network: Hula, which was launched last month, promises to make the dating world 'less awkward' with a profile feature that displays which STDs you've been tested for . Of course, if you'd rather keep that information private, you can opt out of sharing results publicly on your profile. Hula also lets users review STD clinics and sends out reminders about getting tested regularly. And Hula users can rest assured that . the STD results posted on profiles are always accurate, since they come . directly from a doctor, noting exactly when the user was tested. 'My culture is more than a tourist destination. It's more than just sexy hula girls on the beach. There is a culture there' Hula founder and CEO Ramin Bastani told the Huffington Post that he hopes it can reduce the risk of spreading of STDs by having sex with people who meet on location-based dating apps. 'In the not too distant future you'll be able to see a badge on someone's dating profile showing they've verified STD status by Hula,' explained Mr Bastani, who is currently collaborating with MISTER - a dating app for gay men - to encourage users to get tested and share their results. 'That can help you make better decisions about how you want to connect,' he added.","An online petition, which had more than 700 signatures on Change.org, says the name exploits a beloved cultural art form .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A frozen pink world, lurking in the far reaches of the solar system, has been nicknamed Biden after the American vice-president. The planet, which is seven and a half billion miles from the Sun, was found by astronomers searching an area of space beyond Pluto. Although it won't officially be named for a while, dwarf plant '2012 VP113' is being referred to as VP, or Biden, by scientists as they continue their research. Discovery: Dwarf planet 2012 VP113, which has been nicknamed Biden, is in an area of space beyond Pluto . Namesake: A newly discovered dwarf planet has been nicknamed Biden after the vice-president . Biden is the second planet to be spotted in what had been considered a celestial wasteland. In 2003 astronomers tracked Sedna, a planet named after a mythical Inuit goddess. Yale University's senior research scientist David Rabinowitz, who was on the team that found the earlier planet, said the new discovery showed 'Sedna is not a freak'. Since Sedna's discovery, astronomers have been looking for similar dwarf planets. Their findings so far on Biden are detailed in the journal, Nature. It was tracked using a new camera fitted to a ground telescope in Chile by Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Instituition for Science in Washington DC, and Chad Trujillo of Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. 'It goes to show that there’s something we don't know about our Solar System, and it’s something important,' Trujillo, who was part of the team that discovered Sedna, told Nature. 'We’re starting to get a taste of what’s out beyond what we consider the edge.' Biden is about 280 miles across, and bitterly cold, with temperatures believed to be about minus 430F. And, unlike Sedna which is bigger, shinier and red, Biden is fainter and pink, making it hard to detect. In comparison, Earth is about 7,900 miles across and only 93 million miles from the Sun. Tracked: Astronomers used a camera on a ground telescope to find Biden, pictured here in November 2012 . Sedna and Biden reside in an area known as the inner Oort cloud in the outer edge of the solar system, where some comets such as the Sun-diving ISON are thought to originate. ISON broke apart last year after brushing too close to the sun. 'Finding Sedna so far away seemed odd and potentially a fluke. But this one is beginning to make it look like that might be a typical place for objects to be. Not at all what I would have guessed,' Mike Brown, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology, said. Brown, the self-proclaimed Pluto killer, led the Sedna team, but was not part of the new discovery. Far from being deserted, Sheppard and Trujillo estimate there are probably thousands of similar objects in the inner Oort cloud. 'These objects are not unique. There's a huge number out there,' Sheppard said. Not all of them will be visible to telescopes because they are so far away, and it takes a long time for them to swing by the Sun. Sedna and VP Biden were spotted at their closest approach to the Sun, which allowed light from the Sun to hit the objects and bounce back to observatories on Earth. Exploration: An artist's impression of Sedna, which was discovered in the same region of space in 2003 . VP is currently the third farthest object in the solar system after dwarf planet Eris and Sedna, but it has an eccentric, elongated orbit that can take it out to 42 billion miles from the Sun. Sedna can loop out as far as 84 billion miles from the Sun at its farthest point. Now that Sedna has company - and likely lots of it - scientists are searching for more objects in an effort to learn how they, and the solar system, formed and evolved. In a separate discovery published in Nature, a team led by Felipe Braga-Ribas of the National Observatory in Brazil found a pair of rings around an asteroid-like interloper in the outer system named Chariklo. While not as dazzling as Saturn's rings, it's the first time rings have been discovered outside of the four gas giants - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. How little Chariklo got its rings remains a mystery, but scientists think they may have formed from debris from a violent collision.","Astronomers find faint pink, frozen world in region of space beyond Pluto .

"By . Associated Press . More Americans than ever are dissatisfied with President Obama according to a new poll released Wednesday. The poll conducted by the Associated Press and GfK reports that the president's disapproval rating hit a high of 59 per cent, which is still a far cry from former President George W Bush's record high of 72 per cent in October 2008. Still, Obama's 41 per cent approval . rating is a sobering number for fellow Democrats running in this fall's . House and Senate elections. Bad news: A poll released Wednesday revealed that President Obama's disapproval rating hit a record high of 59 per cent. Mr Obama is currently in Europe, pictured Thursday at a news conference with the Italian prime minister . Americans are now divided over which party they would rather see in control of Congress. Democrats held a slight edge over Republicans in the January AP-GfK poll. Obama gets lowest marks for his handling of the federal budget, immigration and the economy. Support for Obama's education policies, which had been a strong point, dipped into negative territory this month, too. Republicans have long criticized the president as too weak in asserting American power abroad. Yet until now, foreign policy hasn't been a drag on Obama's second term: Americans were about as likely to endorse his actions as to disapprove. Foreign policy used to stand out as a not-so-bleak spot in the public's waning assessment of Barack Obama. Not anymore. Now he's hit a new low on international relations — just 40 per cent approval. Majorities say they dislike Obama's handling of the Ukraine situation (57 per cent) and his interactions with Russia (54 per cent). Almost half of those polled say they support imposing tougher sanctions if Russia pushes into new regions or other countries; only 14 per cent are opposed. That backs up threats from Obama and Western allies to target Russia's economy with damaging sanctions if President Vladimir Putin goes further. Close to 9 out of 10 Americans support sanctions as a response to Russia's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, the poll indicates. About half of that group says the U.S. sanctions so far are about right, while the other half wants to see them strengthened, the AP-GfK poll found. Toughen up: Most Americans support even stricter sanctions on Russia, following the incursion on Crimea. Above, Ukrainian soldiers transport their tanks from their base in Perevalnoe, outside Simferopol, Crimea on Wednesday . Most Democrats say the sanctions were OK, while a majority of Republicans find them too weak. 'We're supposed to be a country that helps smaller countries in need,' said Christopher Ashby, 29, a Republican in Albemarle, North Carolina, who wants a more powerful response. 'Ukraine at this time is definitely in need.' Ashby, a stay-at-home dad caring for three young daughters, said, 'When I look at Obama, I see my 5-year-old daughter looking at something that just happened and saying, ""What do I do?""' About a third of those surveyed said they oppose giving monetary aid to nations targeted by Russia. Only about 20 per cent approve of financial support, while the biggest share is neutral. This week Congress is considering $1billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine sought by Obama. The idea of lending any type of military support to Ukraine is unpopular, the poll says. Obama has said there are no plans to use military force to dislodge Russia from the Crimean Peninsula. Richard Johnson, a politically independent retiree in Redmond, Washington, said the United States shouldn't have gotten involved at all, especially since many Crimean residents favor Russia. 'They're protesting in both directions, right?' Johnson said. 'So I just feel like we've got enough problems here at home, why are we looking for more trouble?' Johnson, pausing from wiring work on his do-it-yourself kitchen remodel, said he still supports Obama nevertheless. 'He's trying to do what he believes is best,' said Johnson, 62. The AP-GfK Poll was conducted March 20-24 using KnowledgePanel, GfK's probability-based online panel designed to be representative of the U.S. population.  It involved online interviews with 1,012 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points for all respondents. Respondents were first selected randomly using phone or mail survey methods and were later interviewed online. People selected for KnowledgePanel who didn't otherwise have access to the Internet were provided with the ability to access the Internet at no cost to them.","The newest disapproval rating is still far below former President George W Bush's high of 72 per cent in October 2008 .

"By . Sara Malm . A stillborn jaguar was brought back to life after a dedicated vet gave it mouth-to-mouth. Dr Patricia Garrido gave the kiss of life to the jaguar cub, christened Ali, after it was found not to be breathing following a rare caesarean at a vet clinic in Madrid, Spain. Ali's mother, Xena, had been taken from the local zoo to undergo the c-section as she had killed her two previous cubs shortly after giving birth. Scroll down for video . Saved: Ali the jaguar cub was given the kiss of life by a vet after he was stillborn at an animal clinic in Spain . The dramatic operation was captured on camera by fellow vet Antonio Rodriguez at the El Bosque Veterinary Hospital in Madrid, Spain. He said: ‘The experience of seeing an animal start living and breathing after our help is really amazing. It is indescribable.’ The operation involved a team of 12 vets, nurses and assistants, and began well when they successfully deliverered a young male. However, it was soon found not to be breathing and they began to perform CPR to kickstart its tiny heart. They then began using a pump to force air into its lungs and when that failed Dr Garrido incredibly began mouth to mouth resuscitation. When little Ali failed to start breathing following the surgery, one veterinarian resorted to giving mouth-to-mouth to bring him back to life . Heroes: A vet, believed to be Patricia Garrido, poses with the cub's mother Xena before the caesarean . The battle begins: Ali, pictured shortly after being removed from his mother's womb, was stillborn and the team struggled to get him to start breathing . After a frantic eight minutes the team were relieved to find a heartbeat. They then made sure to dry the cub, who has since been named Ali, and keep it warm as it recovered from the traumatic birth. Mr Rodriguez said: ‘Ali could have died in eight minutes if it was not for the efforts of the team. ‘I do not have words to explain the emotion. I'm really happy with my team's work and we got a great reward. ‘Many of the workers are mothers themselves and they have a special sensibility to newborns.’ Following surgery, Xena has now been returned to a local zoo where she lives with her mate, Tango. Ali is being hand-raised at another, smaller zoo as he cannot be returned to his potentially dangerous mother.

"By . Associated Press . An Army soldier accused of strangling his pregnant wife during a sex game so he could pocket $500,000 in insurance and  benefit money, was convicted Thursday by a military judge. The case hinged on dueling medical experts who couldn't agree on how the woman died. Pvt. Isaac Aguigui, 22, of Cashmere, Wash., was on trial for four days during a Fort Stewart court-martial. He was convicted of murder and causing the death of an unborn child after his wife, 24-year-old Sgt. Deirdre Aguigui, was found dead at their apartment July 17, 2011, when she was about seven months pregnant. The charges carry an automatic life sentence. Money trail: An ex-girlfriend of Pvt. Isaac Aguigui, pictured at his preliminary hearing on August 30, 2012, testified that the soldier told her to expect 'a lot of money' just hours before his wife was suffocated to death leaving him to collect $500,000 in insurance . Expectant mother: Sgt. Deidre Aguigui, 24 (pictured left and right in 2011) was seven months pregnant when she was found dead July 17, 2011, with abrasions on her wrists in her bedroom strewn with sex toy . The verdict should have little impact on Isaac Aguigui's overall fate. He's already serving life without parole at a Georgia prison after pleading guilty last summer to murder charges in a double slaying that occurred nearly five months after his wife died. Prosecutors had no problem presenting a possible motive for why Aguigui would want his wife dead. The Army paid him $100,000 to cover funeral costs and other expenses after his wife died, and a month later her life insurance policy paid out $400,000. The court heard how Aguigui's rocky marriage and the hefty insurance payout prompted him to kill his wife, who was about seven months pregnant. A former Army buddy testified earlier this week that Aguigui told him that he handcuffed his wife during sex and suffocated her by putting a plastic bag over her head. Evidence showed that hours before his wife died, Aguigui sent a text message to a former girlfriend that read: 'We'll have plenty of money. All need is your body whenever I want it.' But evidence of what specifically killed Deirdre Aguigui proved scant. The military's autopsy found more than 20 bruises and scrapes on the body including on her head and back, but nothing fatal. Wounds on both wrists appeared to match a pair of handcuffs found on the couple's bed. Aguigui (right), pictured here in 2011 with his co-defendant Sgt Anthony Peden (left), is already serving a sentence of life without parole in a Georgia state prison after he pleaded guilty last year in a double slaying . Aguigui told them he had woken up from a nap to find his wife dead on the couch. Paramedics found marks on her wrists, but no other obvious wounds. Military police found a pair of handcuffs on the couple's bed, along with a number of other sex toys scattered around the room. Aguigui told them he had cuffed his wife during consensual sex earlier in the evening, before he nodded off for a nap, said Justin Kapinus, the Army's lead investigator on the case. 'He stated that she enjoyed being tied up and that night they used the handcuffs,' Kapinus said. 'He said she enjoyed having her hands behind her back and laying on the handcuffs.' But the official cause of death was not determined. The military couldn't decide whether she had been slain or died from natural causes. Last year, a Georgia state medical examiner offered a second opinion. By ruling out illnesses, drugs or poisons, allergic reactions and other potential causes â€” and by noting the wrist wounds and other injuries â€” Dr. James Downs concluded Deirdre Aguigui was strangled while struggling violently against handcuffs behind her back. He said a certain chokehold taught to Army soldiers could kill while leaving virtually no telltale marks. 'That's why this is such a great way to kill someone if you want to get away with it,' Army prosecutor Janae Lepir said in her closing argument. 'You put this hold on someone and it could leave almost no finding.' Aguigui didn't testify during the trial. The defense's only witness was its medical expert. High stakes; Aguigui, seen in court in July 2013, now faces the rest of his life in jail after being convicted of killing his wife . Defense lawyers noted in closing arguments that the military medical examiner and three additional specialists who took part in the autopsy were unable to find a decisive cause of death as Downs had. Another medical expert called by the defense said it was more likely Deirdre Aguigui suffered a sudden heart attack, though prosecutors insisted his diagnosis was based on a faulty reading of her medical history. Radicalized: Aguigui, pictured at the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota, allegedly founded an anti-government militia group called F.E.A.R . 'All the government has presented here . today is one man's theory that is no more possible than any other . possibility that no other doctor could rule out,' said Capt. Scott Noto, . one of Aguigui's Army defense lawyers. A . former Army buddy, Michael Schaefer, testified that a month after his . wife's death, Aguigui gloated that he had handcuffed her during sex and . strangled her with a plastic bag over her head. Defense . attorneys noted that Schaefer, who had spoken to Army investigators and . testified previously at a pre-trial hearing, had never before mentioned . a confession. Aguigui told investigators his wife liked to have her hands bound during sex and that she wore the handcuffs consensually. The judge, Col. Andrew Glass, deliberated about three hours before convicting Aguigui. The soldier showed no visible emotion as the verdict was read. As the judge heard testimony before sentencing, Deirdre Aguigui's parents said they and their six surviving children are still grieving nearly three years later. When one of their daughters married recently, the family left an empty seat for Deirdre. ""One of the hardest questions for me still is how many children do you have,"" said Alma Wetzker, the slain woman's father. ""How do you answer that? I still don't know."" Last July, Aguigui pleaded guilty in the December 2011 slayings of former soldier Michael Roark and his girlfriend, Tiffany York, who were shot in the head in rural Long County near Fort Stewart. More victims: Michael Roark, 19 (left) and his girlfriend Tiffany York, 17 (right) were found shot in the head in December 2011 to stop them from revealing F.E.A.R.'s illegal activities . Combination photo of Isaac Aguigui (L-R, top row), Christopher Salmon, Michael Burnett (L-R, bottom row) and Anthony Peden pictured in this Long County, Georgia, Sheriff's Office booking photograph . Civilian prosecutors say Aguigui used the money from his wife's insurance policy to fund an anti-government militia group of disgruntled soldiers and ordered the couple killed to protect the group. Records show he bought at least $30,000 worth of guns and ammunition. Army prosecutors never mentioned the militia allegations and said Aguigui wanted the insurance money and the weapons to start a private security business.","Pvt.

"By . Louise Boyle . Mary Kennedy, the ex-wife of Robert Kennedy Jr, was left so impoverished by her former husband that she could not afford to buy food, it has been claimed. Mary, 52, was found hanged in a barn on the family's estate in Bedford, New York on May 16 by her ex-husband. The mother-of-four was allegedly so destitute that she was forced to borrow money from parents of children's classmates in her final months while her former partner piled on pressure in their divorce battle, questioned her capability as a mother and flaunted his new girlfriend in public. Tumultuous: Robert Kennedy and his estranged wife, Mary were in the middle of a bitter divorce battle which left her with money worries . A source told the  New York Post: 'Somebody living in a fifth-floor walk-up in The Bronx with cash could do more than she could.' It was also revealed in court documents that Mary Kennedy's divorce attorneys had not been paid $278,000 in legal fees promised to them by Robert F Kennedy Jr. The harsh tactics employed by Kennedy apparently left his estranged wife without a $20,000 credit card approved by a court. It meant that she had struggled to live day to day, without the money for groceries, gas or medical care while battling depression and alcoholism. Before Mary's death, RFK Jr had taken to . appearing at public events with their four children - Kyra, Aiden, Conor and William -  who he had full . temporary custody of, and his new girlfriend, 46-year-old actress Cheryl . Hines. Mary Kennedy was found dead by her husband and a housekeeper in an out building at her $2million mansion in upstate New York. The domestic turmoil surrounding her life extended into . preparations for her funeral. One of Mary's brothers went to court in an . attempt to get custody of her body, while the Kennedys planned to bury . her near the family's seaside compound in Hyannisport, Massachusetts. However at her funeral, her devastated former husband, son of assassinated senator Robert F Kennedy and nephew of JFK, told the congregation: 'I know I did everything I could to help her.' Troubled: Robert and Mary Kennedy, pictured with three of their children in 2008, were fighting over custody and property . He revealed to mourners that he had . spoken to her the day before her death, and that she told him: 'You know . me better than anyone in the world.' He continued: 'She said, ""I was such a good girl."" I said, ""I know you are - and you still are.""' A special summer exhibit on Jackie Kennedy's life on Cape Cod has opened at the John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum. The exhibit includes photos, handwritten letters and other artifacts from her time on the Cape. The curator said the exhibit captures Kennedy enjoying carefree days with her family, a different side to the international public figure. It includes a 1953 Life magazine pictorial depicting time she spent on the Cape with John F. Kennedy when they were engaged. Other images chronicle Jackie Kennedy's life on the Cape during her husband's presidency, when the couple and their children would frequent Hyannis Port. The exhibit also includes a display on Jackie Kennedy's 1962 India visit as first lady. Under an agreement made in October, RFK Jr was to pay Mary's household and legal expenses. Both partners were also to have a credit card with a $20,000 limit each month. Robert F Kennedy's decision to cut her off was aimed at putting pressure on his wife while they hammered out the details of a bitter divorce, including who would be left with property and custody of the couple's four children. Last month, details from a a sealed affidavit . written by Robert F Kennedy Jr were made public. Portions of the 60-page confidential divorce document filed in 2011 claimed that Mary Kennedy blackmailed her husband, killed the family dog, drank until she passed out and often . threatened suicide in front of the children. Mary's family dubbed the revelations 'vindictive lies' as the family continued to battle over the late mother's legacy. Mary and Robert Kennedy, who had four children together, married in April 1994 when Mary was six-months pregnant. Their famously tumultuous . relationship began in 1993 while Robert’s marriage to his first wife Emily was coming . to an end after ten years and having two children, Bobby III and Kathleen . ‘Kick’, together. Both regulars at AA, Robert and Mary each suffered from addictive personalities, an article by Newsweek reported. Robert . had infamously battled a drug addiction while Mary had suffered from . anorexia since she attended Putney School in Vermont, where she shared a . room with Robert’s younger sister, Kerry. As the couple's marriage fell apart, . their finances dwindled with legal bills soaring to over $1 million, on . top of the monthly $40,000 cost to maintain the staffed estate. Speaking after Mary's funeral, her . old school friend Kerry Kennedy said that Mary had suffered from mental . illness the entire 37 years they had known one another. Tragic ending: Two years after Robert filed for divorce, Mary was found dead in the family estate's barn. Depressed, in debt and fearing losing custody of her children permanently Mary hanged herself. She was 52 . 'She . struggled so hard, for so long, with mental illness, which so many . Americans suffer with,' Kerry Kennedy said after her death. 'She fought . with dignity, and in the end, the demons won.' Mary and Bobby separated after 16 years of marriage, and while he filed for divorce in 2010 it never went through. The case was pending when she died. Shortly after the split, her internal struggles became public when she was arrested twice on charges of driving while intoxicated. Things appeared to have spiraled out of control in recent years and friends claimed she was drowning in credit card debt, feared she would lose both her home and her children. Bobby Kennedy filed multiple restraining orders against his estranged wife in recent months and sought full custody of their children by claiming she was an unfit mother. Robert Kennedy's lawyer Norman Heller told the Post he had not read the court filings but that the allegations were 'very serious'.","Estranged wife of Robert Kennedy Jr had to ask parents of her children's school friends for money .

"By . Steve Robson . Junior defence minister Philip Dunne revealed that almost 10,000 experiments were conducted on animals at military research base Porton Down last year . The number of animals being used for military experiments has increased by more than 1,000 in the last three years. Almost 10,000 pigs, rabbits, monkeys and rodents were used in top-secret tests at the Porton Down military research base in Wiltshire last year, it has emerged. The figures were revealed by junior defence minister Philip Dunne in response to Lib Dem MP Mike Hancock who raised concerns about the facility in parliament last month. The British Union for the . Abolition of Vivisection highlighted 'disturbing and cruel' experiments which include live pigs being blasted with explosives . and forced to inhale mustard gas, monkeys being infected with anthrax . and guinea pigs being killed with nerve agent. And the number of procedures being carried out is on the up. Mr Dunne listed the number of animal . procedures undertaken at DSTL Porton Down over the last three years. The figure has risen from 8,452 in 2009 to 9,582 in 2010 and 9,882 last year. Currently 21 licensed animal procedures are under way at Porton Down Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL). Most of these fall into the 'substantial' severity category which may cause 'significant or prolonged animal suffering'. Lib Dem MP Mike Hancock said he was shocked by the number of animal experiments being carried out at Porton Down in Wiltshire every year . Six of the projects cover work funded directly by US defence agencies. Mr Hancock said he was shocked by the statistics which, until now, were never made generally public. He said: 'I was shocked to . learn that almost 10,000 animal experiments are taking place at Porton . Down every year, including ones inflicting substantial levels of . suffering. 'The . details were not included in the annual statistics published by the . Home Office and many people will be totally unaware that this suffering . is occurring. 'It . is important that the Ministry of Defence routinely gives more . information on its use of animals so the public can be fully informed.' Mr Dunne stressed that DSTL operates in 'strict accordance' with the Animals(Scientific Procedures) Act. 'All the research projects that involve animals are licensed by the Home Office. As part of the licensing process, the researchers have to convince the Home Office that the work is required, that the results cannot be obtained without the use of animals and that every step has been taken to minimise pain and suffering to the animals involved,' he said. But BUAV chief executive Michelle Thew said: 'It is alarming that almost 10,000 animal experiments for military purposes took place in 2011 and that many animals were subjected to the most extreme suffering categorised by the Government. 'Some of the animal research conducted at Porton Down was even funded by the US defence agencies. 'The BUAV is calling for an end to the use of animals, including monkeys and pigs in these gruesome experiments. We need to ensure the safety of soldiers and civilians but the answer does not lay in blowing up or exposing animals to lethal chemical warfare and nerve agents.' Campaigners say the military research on animals such as pigs is 'gruesome' and any evidence it saves lives is 'questionable' All scientific experiments on animals, including those at Porton Down, have to be licensed by the Home Office under the proviso that suffering is minimised as much as possible. Procedures are graded according to the severity of harm or suffering they inflict. Of the 21 'active' projects at Porton Down, four are 'unclassified', three are 'mild', six are 'moderate' and eight are categorised as 'substantial'. A moderate procedure may cause animals a 'noticeable degree of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm', according to the Home Office definition. Substantial severity 'may cause a major departure from the animal's usual state of health or well-being with significant or prolonged animal suffering'.","Pigs, monkeys, rabbits and rodents used in 'gruesome' tests .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Charged: Convicted sex offender Kathy Perkins has been accused of kidnapping her stepchildren . A Washington state sex offender has been accused of kidnapping her step-children and trying to disguise them as she started a new life with her boyfriend. Kathy Kay Perkins, who is on the sex offenders' register, was charged earlier this month with kidnap, after a school contacted police with concerns about some new students. Perkins allegedly dyed the hair of ex-husband's children and tried to enroll them at an elementary school using new names. A counselor at Hazelwood Elementary School contacted police in Auburn last October, after becoming suspicious of Perkins. The 42-year-old is accused of taking the young girls from their Oregon home in March or April last year. She took them to California, where she told a court she was their mother and that she was filing a restraining order against the children's father, according to court papers seen by Seattle PI. Her stepdaughters were enrolled at a school in California under fake names, but Perkins is accused of fleeing with them again when police started to investigate. During the time the children were away from their father, Perkins was using the surname of the new man she was dating. She is accused of trying to convince the children that she was their real mother, and their father was not biologically related to them. Raise the alarm: Hazelwood Elementary School staff contacted police after Perkins enrolled the girls under a fake name . 'The girls would later disclose in an . interview that Kathy had told them multiple times that she was their . true mother and [their father] was not their real dad,' a detective . said in charging papers. Perkins, who had been ordered to sign the sex offenders' register over an indecent liberties charge from 2004, used several aliases, including the surnames Brown, Hall, Fox, Woods, and Johnson, as well as the name Rios Hall. She was already wanted for failing to register as a sex offender and now faces two counts of custodial interference.","Kathy Perkins took girls from their home in March last year and created new identities for them .

"By . Ian Sparks . French film star Gerard Depardieu has sparked fresh outrage in France by defending Vladimir Putin's clampdown on his opponents and declaring: 'The masses are stupid.' The actor - who recently became a French tax exile and was given a Russian passport - also defended sending the three members of Pussy Riot to a Russian labour camp. And in an extraordinary comparison, he said the trio - who staged an anti-Putin protest in a Moscow church - would have been 'executed' if they had done the same thing in a mosque. Controversial: Gerard Depardieu has spoken out to defend Vladimir Putin's Russian regime . France's Metro newspaper today branded the Gallic screen legend 'a spokesman for the Kremlin'. The 64-year-old actor spoke out on state-run TV Channel Russia 24 at the weekend, when he attacked the millions who accused the Russian president of rigging last year's parliamentary election. Depardieu - who has been offered the post of culture minister of the Russian republic of Mordovia - told viewers: 'The Russian opposition has no programme. It has nothing. 'Unfortunately, the masses are stupid. Only the individual is beautiful.' Depardieu said the opposition had some 'very smart people' such as former chess champion Garry Kasparov in its ranks. But he added: 'That is good for chess, and not much else.' Allies: Putin arranged for the French actor to be granted Russian citizenship earlier this month . Passport: Depardieu is leaving France in protest at the country's 75 per cent tax rate for millionaires . And he said of Pussy Riot, the all-female punk band who performed in Moscow's main cathedral last year: 'Imagine if these ladies walked into a mosque - they would not have come out alive. 'But when I say such things in France, I am considered an idiot. I know lots of Russians who lived in France, but have now returned to their homeland because they missed the human warmth they find there.' Former French minister and now MEP Corinne Lepage said of the actor: 'If Gerald Depardieu wants to be culture minister in a republic that still has prison labour camps and make a ""man-sandwich"" with Vladimir Putin, that's his business.' The Cyrano de Bergerac star is among flood of wealthy French people to have come under attack for quitting the country over plans for a new top tax rate of 75 per cent on earnings over â‚¬1million. Electronic music icon Jean-Michel Jarre and tycoon optician Alain Afflelou are both moving to Britain, while France's richest man Bernard Arnault has tried and failed to get Belgian nationality. Pals: Depardieu with outspoken FIFA president Sepp Blatter in Zurich last week . New home: The actor's face on an ad on the side of a bus in St Petersburg . Depardieu was branded 'shabby and unpatriotic' by French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault after announcing last month that he was moving abroad. But the furious star hit back with an open letter to Mr Ayrault in Le Journal du Dimanche, storming: 'I don't ask to be approved of, but I could at least be respected! 'All those who have left France have not been insulted as I have been.' Depardieu said he had always paid his taxes and asked the prime minister: 'Who are you to judge me in this way? 'I also give you back my passport and my social security that I have never used.' Jailed: Pussy Riot were sent to a labour camp after staging a protest in a Moscow cathedral . Paris estate agents have also said France's luxury property market has hit a 'selling panic' as the super-rich flee to 'wealth-friendly' countries like Britain and Switzerland. Daniel Feau said: 'Some 400 to 500 residences worth more than â‚¬1million have come onto the Paris market since May. It's nearly a general panic.' And British estate agent Knight Frank said the socialist's tax plans had sent French interest in luxury London homes rocketing. David Cameron angered the French in June when he said Britain would 'roll out the red carpet' to wealthy French wanted to relocate to the UK. He added: 'And they can pay tax in Britain and pay for our health service and schools and everything else.' The comments left French MP Claude Bartolone so offended he suggested Mr Cameron must have been 'drunk' when he made them.","Actor says punk trio deserve to be in prison camp for cathedral protest .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A cat that suffered serious burns and 'acute stress' when her twisted owner microwaved her in retaliation for scratching him has been re-homed. When RSPCA inspectors found the black and white cat, named Nancy, she felt hot to the touch, her head was hanging low and she was breathing heavily. She was rushed to the Stubbington Ark rescue centre, near Fareham, Hampshire, after being placed in the cooker for five seconds. Cruel: Pet cat Nancy suffered serious burns and 'acute stress' when her former owner microwaved her in retaliation for scratching him . However, Nancy has now been nursed back to health by new owners Taff Jones, 64, and his wife Pam, 41, from Southsea. The couple adopted Nancy after Mrs Jones said she wanted a cat for her 40th birthday. Mrs . Jones originally picked a three-legged cat because she wanted to give a . home to a cat she thought had no other chance of adoption. However, by the time her husband visited the Ark, the three-legged cat had been adopted - and he then spotted Nancy. He . said: 'I was looking a the cubicles and this little face was looking . out at me. She adopted me, rather than the other way around. 'I . thought she was beautiful and I knew I had to adopt her. When I put a . reserve on her in the reception, the whole place fell quiet. 'They told me her story and I had to sit down as I felt physically ill. To think someone could do that. 'They said ""Do you still want her?"", and I said ""Of course!"".' Mr Jones now made Nancy the star of a children's book, named Tales Of Nancy Jones and featuring three stories about Nancy's life. 'They are tales of friendship and kindness, which is how Nancy lives her life,' said Mr Jones. 'Children reading these tales will grow up to be good people.' New life: Nancy has now found a new home with Taff Jones, 64, and his wife Pam, 41, and is the star of Mr Jones's new children's book Tales Of Nancy Jones . The couple will donate a percentage of their profits from the sale of the book to the Ark, as a way of saying thank you for saving Nancy. It will go towards the centre's Paws4Help appeal, which hopes to raise 250,000 pounds for a new cattery. Mr Jones added: 'The Ark saved her life. She was with them for nine months while the vets got her right. 'They are still not sure if there is any lasting damage, but she's very affectionate and she is part of our family.' Mr Jones hopes to print volume two of Tales Of Nancy Jones soon, and is already working on the plot for volume three. The book also features photographs and drawings of Nancy. It is being sold on Amazon for Â£7.95, and is also available from the Ark. The previous owner was banned from keeping animals for life and given a 16 week suspended prison sentence for causing unnecessary suffering. He denied the charge but was convicted at trial in 2011. The sentencing magistrate said at the time: 'It was a deliberate act to seriously injure the animal, causing a high level of stress and unnecessary suffering against a defenceless animal.'","When RSPCA officers found pet cat Nancy she felt hot to the touch .

"By . Damien Gayle . Scientists are gearing up for fierce solar storms next year by setting up a worldwide chain of monitoring stations to study the so-called 'solar maximum'. Massive increases in the numbers of sunspots are expected to cause changes in the Earth's ionosphere, the shell of plasma at the top of our atmosphere. There are fears because the current generation of satellite navigation technology has never experience a 'solar max', and changes in the ionosphere could cause problems with GPS and other signals from space. Sun spots are seen as the moon moves into a full eclipse position seen in the U.S. in May: Late summer will see the Sun reach the maximum point of its 11-year cycle, resulting in an increase in such activity . Activity increasing: This graph shows how solar and geomagnetic indices . are on the rise again after a lull following the last solar max. Sun spot levels are shown in orange; solar flux levels, showing total energy output, are green; geomagnetic indices tracking magnetic storm levels around Earth are in blue and pink . Discovered by 20th-century radio pioneers who bounced long-wave radio signals off it, the ionosphere is a layer of electrically charged particles strongly influenced by the Sun. With the coming of the Space Age, radio signals started passing through the ionosphere to and from orbiting satellites and today everyday life is more reliant than ever on these space systems. During solar maximum, large numbers of sunspots appear and the sun's irradiance output grows by about 0.1 per cent, with the increased energy output thought to affect global climate and weather patterns. The ionosphere becomes most turbulent as the Sun’s warming thickens it, and then again in the evening as cooling leads to turbulence – including the production of 'plasma bubbles'. Sun's impact on the ionosphere: It  becomes most turbulent as the Sun¿s heat thickens it, and again in the evening it cools. The state of the ionosphere is often measured in terms of Vertical Total Electron Content . The effect on radio systems includes signal delay – a major problem factor for satnav, where ranging is based on timing accurate to a billionth of a second – and signal-scattering ‘scintillations’ rendering the signal unstable. To monitor the effects of the solar max on Earth's upper atmosphere and the consequences for satellite navigation and communications, the European Space Agency is setting up a worldwide chain of monitoring stations. 'The current Monitor network is still being developed but has already been detecting mild ionospheric storms,' said Roberto Prieto-Cerdeira, the scientist in charge of the project. Monitor station based in Malindi, Kenya: The station's task is to pick up GPS signals more accurately than usual and take note of signal delays or scintillations to observe disturbances in the ionosphere . Network: The ESA has set up sensor stations across the planet, paying particular attention to the equator where the interference in the ionosphere is expected to be highest . The solar maximum is the period of greatest solar activity in the Sun's 11-year cycle. The Sun's magnetic field lines are the most distorted at this time due to the magnetic field on the solar equator rotating at a slightly faster pace than at the solar poles. This causes large numbers of sunspots appear, and the Sun's irradiance output grows by about 0.1 per cent. The increased energy output of solar maxima can impact global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns. The solar cycle takes an average of about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next, with an observed variation in duration of 9 to 14 years for any given solar cycle. Large solar flares often occur during a maximum. For example, the Solar storm of 1859 struck the Earth with such intensity the northern lights could be seen as far south as Rome. The last solar maximum was in 2000. In 2006 NASA initially expected a solar maximum in 2010 or 2011, and thought that it could be the strongest since 1958. However, more recent projections say the maximum should arrive in autumn of 2013 and be the smallest sunspot cycle since 1906. Monitor stations work by measuring variations in GPS signals with greater accuracy than existing systems. 'We are placing sensor stations around the globe, but the vicinity of the equator is a particular focus of interest,' added Dr Prieto-Cerdeira. 'It exhibits much more dynamic behaviour than the mid-latitudes so we have established stations at Cape Verde off West Africa and Malindi, Kenya, on the other side of the continent. 'In addition, through a deal with French space agency CNES, we will have access to stations hosted by existing tracking sites at Libreville, Gabon and Ascension Island in the mid-Atlantic, the latter site being where the magnetic equator diverts from the geographic equator. 'Further sensor stations under consideration are Maspalomas in the Canary Islands and Kourou in French Guiana. 'Stations in Kevo and Sodankylä in the Arctic, provide high-latitude coverage.' At solar maximum, the Sun's magnetic field lines are the most distorted due to the magnetic field on the solar equator rotating at a slightly faster pace than at the solar poles. The solar cycle takes an average of about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next, with an observed variation in duration of 9 to 14 years for any given solar cycle. Large solar flares often occur during a maximum. For example, the Solar storm of 1859 struck the Earth with such intensity that the northern lights could be seen as far south as Rome, approximately 42° north of the equator.","The Sun reaches the most active period of its 11-year cycle in summer 2013 .

He's back: American Idol's David Archuleta returns home from Mormon mission after two years away . Throughout his mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Chile he took the opportunity to share his vocal talents. While at the Missionary Training Centre he performed in a missionary choir and two Christmas productions which took place at the Santiago Chile Temple. Two years ago footage captured at a concert showed Archuleta overwhelmed with emotion and crying when he revealed his plans which led to a standing ovation from the crowd. 'It's not because someone told me that I'm supposed to do it, and not because I no longer want to do music, but because it's the feeling that I've felt I need to do this with my life,' Archuleta said at the time. Archuleta was 16 and one of the youngest contestants when he competed on the seventh season of American Idol.

"By . Lydia Warren . and Associated Press . A Montana woman who pushed her husband off a cliff just eight days after their wedding was today sentenced to 30 years behind bars. U.S. District Judge Don Molloy sentenced Jordan Linn Graham, 22, to 365 months in federal prison, with no possibility of parole after saying he did not believe she was remorseful for the killing. Molloy said he kept waiting for Graham to say she was sorry for pushing Cody Johnson, 25, to his death in Glacier National Park last summer - but that it never came. Her defense attorney Michael Donahoe had previously said in a motion that her â€˜extremely reckless but unintentional actâ€™ only warranted 10 years in prison. Locked up: Jordan Graham, pictured leaving court last year, has been sentenced to 30 years for pushing her husband off a cliff just eight days after they were married . On Tuesday, Graham asked the judge to allow her to withdraw her guilty plea, which she made in December, but Molloy denied it. She claimed she had pushed him off the cliff following an argument. Graham had faced a maximum sentence of life at Thursday's hearing in Missoula. Prosecutors dropped a first-degree murder charge and a count of making a false statement to authorities. Graham, of Kalispell, was charged with killing Johnson on July 7. His body was found at the bottom of the cliff three days after he was reported missing by a friend and co-worker. Before he accepted her plea in December, the judge asked Graham to tell him what happened. Graham . said she was having second thoughts about being . married so young and they went to the park to talk about it. Unsure: Prosecutors said she pushed Cody Johnson because she was having doubts about their marriage . Tragic: When Johnson got angry, his new wife pushed him and he fell over the edge of the cliff . They went over a retaining wall along the Going-to-the-Sun Road and climbed down a rocky, steep slope to the edge of a cliff and a steep drop of a couple hundred feet to a ravine. There, . facing the void, she told Johnson that she wasn't really happy and that . she was not feeling like she believed she ought to be married, . she said. They . argued and it escalated, culminating with Johnson grabbing her, Graham . said. She thought he was going to pull her toward him - and that's when . she became angry. 'I wasn't thinking about where we were,' she said. 'I just pushed.' She . said she brushed away his hand and then pushed her new husband with one . hand on his back and one hand on his shoulder, and he went over the edge. Hidden doubts: An image from the couple's wedding on June 29 shows Johnson just days before his death . It . wasn't planned, but she said it was 'definitely reckless with an . extreme disregard' for life. Afterward, she ran back to where the car . was parked. She drove back home to Kalispell, . about an hour away, without seeking help. She sent text messages to . friends on the drive back - but told nobody what had just happened. 'At that moment, I was so scared, I didn't know what to do,' she said. Johnson was reported missing July 8 when he failed to show up for work. Graham . initially told investigators that Johnson left their house July 7 with . friends. But his friends testified they were suspicious of the story and . suspected Graham played a role in his disappearance. Jailed: Graham, pictured center last year, had wanted to withdraw her guilty plea, but the judge refused . Heartbreak: Cody Johnson's mother Sherry broke down outside the court following Graham's guilty plea in December last year . Graham showed police a fabricated email - purportedly from a friend of Johnson - that said Johnson was dead and to call off the search. She later told Glacier rangers she had found Johnson's body near The Loop because it was a place he wanted to see before he died. Ultimately, Graham acknowledged she was with Johnson on the cliff after investigators confronted her with a security camera photo of the couple entering the park.","Jordan Graham was sentenced to 365 months without the possibility of parole for pushing her husband following an argument last summer .

"By . Claire Bates . The remains of one of the oldest homes in Britain, built more than 10,000 years ago, . have been unearthed near Edinburgh. The dwelling was found in the path of the new Forth bridge and has been dated to around 8240 BC. A large oval pit measuring nearly seven metres and studded with post holes was all that remained standing of the home from the Mesolithic period. Remains of several fireplace hearths were discovered at the site. This illustration shows how it may have looked like . The holes would have held wooden posts supporting the walls and roof, which experts believe would . have been covered with turf. Remains of several fireplace hearts were also discovered. The ancient people who lived in the area were hunter gatherers and charred bone fragments on the site suggest they ate birds, fish, wild boar and possible deer.  Large quantities of charred hazelnut shells were also found. The residents were among the first settlers in Scotland after the last glacial period (a time within an ice age marked by colder temperatures). Archaeologists also recovered more than 1,000 flint artefacts including stone tools that would have been used for tasks including hunting, skinning and food processing. Ed Bailey, Project Manager for Headland Archaeology, the company that carried out the works, said: . 'The discovery of this previously . unknown, and rare type of site has provided us with a unique opportunity . to further develop our understanding of how early prehistoric people . lived along the Forth. 'Specialist analysis of archaeological and . palaeoenvironmental evidence recovered in the field is ongoing. This . will allow us to put the pieces together and build a detailed picture of . Mesolithic lifestyle.' An archaeologist at the dig site . Stone tool fragments were found at the site . The archaeology team also found the . toe bones - most likely from a wolf - within the house. It's not known . if this came from a wolf pelt that would have been worn or used to line . the floor for warmth. The Mesolithic people were hunter gatherers, anatomically indistinguishable from modern humans, who would have subsisted on a diet of wild foodstuffs. They were among the first settlers in Scotland after the last glacial period (a time within an ice age marked by colder temperatures). Archaeologists have evidence from the Forth bridge site that they may have eaten birds, fish, wild boar and possibly red or roe deer. As well as for their meat animals would also been hunted for their hides, sinew, bones, fat and other by-products. It is not possible to say if the house was a community hub but there was definitely no cattle or other domesticated animal present. Animal domestication does not begin until the Neolithic, over 4,000 years after the date of the Mesolithic House. The . team believe the house was a semi-permanent structure not occupied all . year round, but possibly for seasonal use in this case over the colder . winter months. It would most likely have belonged to a family grouping, . probably including extended members. They said they weren't surprised to find no evidence of domesticated animals, as this did not begin until the Neolithic period, over 4,000 years after the date of the house. Historic Scotland Senior Archaeologist, Rod McCullagh, said: 'This discovery and, especially, the information from the laboratory analyses adds valuable information to our understanding of a small but growing list of buildings erected by Scotland’s first settlers after the last glaciation, 10,000 year ago. 'The radiocarbon dates that have been taken from this site show it to be the oldest of its type found in Scotland which adds to its significance.' Transport Minister Keith Brown said: 'This ancient dwelling, which was unearthed as part of the routine investigations undertaken prior to construction works, is an important and exciting discovery. 'We now have vital records of the findings which we will be able to share to help inform our understanding of a period in Scotland's ancient history.' All of the artefacts will be preserved.","Ancient dwelling was found in the path of the new Forth bridge .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Banks are to extend their opening hours to meet demand for low-deposit mortgages backed by the Government. David Cameron announced last night that the Help To Buy scheme, which provides 95 per cent mortgages, will start next week – three months ahead of schedule. Brushing aside accusations that it will lead to a housing bubble, the Prime Minister said he had acted to prevent first-time buyers’ dreams of owning a home being ‘trashed’. Home: Minster David Cameron toured the Egerton Green housing development with James Oliver and Emily Jones as he announced more help for first-time buyers . State-owned RBS bank said last night . it was expecting to be so inundated with applications that many of its . branches would remain open later. The three-year, £12billion Help To . Buy scheme will give tens of thousands the chance to buy a house worth . up to £600,000 with just a 5 per cent deposit. The Government will . underwrite an additional 15 per cent of the loan to make the deal . attractive to lenders. RBS and NatWest will be the first to . start offering the cheap mortgages, followed by the Halifax. HSBC, . Santander, Nationwide and Barclays have yet to decide whether to take . part. Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr . Show at the start of the Tory conference in Manchester, Mr Cameron said: . ‘The Bank of England said expressly, “There isn’t a bubble”. The housing market is recovering, but . from a low base. If you look at prices outside London and the South . East, they’re only going up by 0.8 per cent. Adverts: NatWest and RBS have launched a marketing campaign as it prepares to extend its opening hours to deal with demand for the state-backed mortgages . Building: The government hopes the Help to Buy scheme will encourage construction firms to start work on more new homes . David Cameron would block a mansion tax after the next election, even if he was forced into another coalition. The Liberal Democrat's have long argued for a levy on multi-million pound homes, with Labour also backing the idea. But Mr Cameron made clear that for as long as the Tories are in power he will block the plan. But he suggested council tax and stamp duty could be used to raise more money. He told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'I don't think this is a good idea. 'I want to live in a country where people work hard, they save and they put money into their homes. 'I think it's right people pay council tax, it's right people pay stamp duty - and we put that up - but to go after someone's house every year with a wealth tax, I don't think that's a sensible thing to do. 'I have never been in favour of this idea. I think it's a bad idea.' Asked if voters could be sure that there would be no mansion tax if he was Prime Minister after the next election, Mr Cameron added: . 'That's correct. Stamp duty yes, council tax yes, but I think wealth taxes are not sensible for a country if it wants to support wealth creation, wants to reward saving and people who work hard and do the right thing.' ‘Talk of a housing bubble to people here in Manchester and they will laugh in your face. ‘As Prime Minister, I’m not going to . stand back while people’s aspirations to get on the housing ladder, to . own their own flat, to own their own home, are being trashed. That’s why . we need to act.’ He said a housing market that . required young professionals to pay a £50,000 deposit was ‘broken’, . adding: ‘If you haven’t got rich parents you can’t get that sort of . money.’ Ross McEwan, the new boss of RBS . Group, said details of  a range of mortgages for first and second-time . buyers will be released within days to help at least 25,000 people. He added: ‘Despite the economy . recovering, we know many families are finding it tough  to get a . mortgage deposit together. We are committed to helping as many people . as  possible across Britain to get on with their lives, to buy their . first home, to move to a bigger house as their family grows.’ But Business Secretary Vince Cable warned that it ‘could inflate the market’ and create a housing bubble. Former Bank of England  governor Lord King suggested it was ‘too close for comfort’ to a general scheme to guarantee mortgages. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘If . David Cameron is serious about helping first-time buyers, he should be . bringing forward investment to build more affordable homes. Under this Government, housebuilding is at its lowest level since the 1920s.’","Help To Buy .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A dirty bomb attack is a ‘real threat’ faced by Britain, the Foreign Office warned today. The government claims nuclear terrorism is still one of the biggest threats to global peace. Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt used a speech in London to warn of the dangers posed by a rise nuclear weapons being smuggled around the world. Alistair Burt will say countries around the world face a 'real and global threat' of a nuclear terror attack. South Korean radiologists are pictured taking part in an exercise in dealing with a possible radioactive terror attack at the Kimpo airport . He warned  that information freely available on the internet combined with nuclear material become more widely available means an attack, once ‘unthinkable’ is not a ‘real and global threat’. Mr Burt, who has responsibility for our counter-terrorism policy, said the UK’s National Security Strategy identified nuclear terrorism as a primary danger to Britain. He said: ‘Nuclear terrorism is a real and global threat.  A successful attack, no matter where in the world it came, would be catastrophic. ‘Catastrophic for the immediate devastation and terrible loss of life, and for the far-reaching consequences – psychological, economic, political, and environmental. ‘Such an attack was unthinkable just a generation ago.  But it is now a possibility we need to confront with the utmost vigilance.’ Mr Burt said nuclear material is becoming ‘more available’ as more countries develop nuclear energy. Mr Burt warns there is more information about nuclear weapons on the internet than ever before . ‘In today’s world of modern . communication, information is spreading faster.  Like nuclear energy, . this brings huge benefits, but it also brings significant risks.  There . is more information about nuclear weapons on the internet than there . ever has been. ‘As is the case in cyberspace, the . danger is stateless in geographical space.  It is impossible for any . national government or police force, no matter how advanced, to contain . on its own. ‘Global smuggling networks are thriving.  Criminal cells operate across borders and across continents.’ He said the UK has been at the ‘forefront’ of tackling illicit trafficking of nuclear material. ‘It was an issue very much at the forefront of our security preparations . for our hosting of a successful London Olympics this summer.’ He also lifted the lid on the UK’s . secretive Atomic Weapons Establishment which works on detecting the . trade in nuclear material.  ‘This is a rare opportunity to publically . acknowledge that their work has been central to the defence of the . United Kingdom for over 50 years,’ he said. Mr Burt’s stark warning came as he addressed a meeting in London of experts from around the world discussing ways to prevent a devastating attack. His warning comes as global experts gather in London to plot how to thwart catastrophic attacks that could kill thousands. Fears were high that a bomb attack would target the London Olympics this summer, Mr Burt will admit. Last month Senior Foreign Office Minister Baroness Warsi warned: ‘Nuclear  terrorism remains one of the greatest threats to our global peace and security. ‘A successful attack, no matter where in the world it came, would be catastrophic.’ The Foreign Office is working with dozens of countries to bolster the UN Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. The convention allows for international cooperation in the investigation, prosecution and extradition of anyone plotting terrorist acts involving radioactive material or a nuclear device.","Minister Alistair Burt uses speech to warn nuclear terrorism, once unthinkable, is now a real possibility .

"By . Leslie Larson . A group of Montana parents are saying that the sound of the angelic voices of children singing Christmas carols is NOT a joyful noise. They have accused the Chief Charlo Elementary School in Missoula, Montana of creating an environment that allows bullying by including yuletide tunes that reference Jesus Christ at a school holiday concert. The protesting parents say their children are 'forced to be reformed to what is seen as the majority' by singing the holiday melodies and claimed their children would be 'singled out' and 'targeted' if they did not join in with the caroling. Caroling caroling now we go: Parents at a school in Montana have complained at the inclusion of religious songs at a Christmas school concert (pictured The Trinity Church Choir in November) For the concert on December 12, students from kindergarten to the third grade sang, 'Joy to the World,' 'Up On a House Top,' 'Jolly Old St. Nicholas,' 'O Christmas Tree,' 'O Come Little Children,' 'Deck the Halls,' a Polish lullaby, a Hanukkah song, a pinata song, a Nutcracker rhythm piece and 'We Wish You a Merry Christmas' for the finale. Students in the fourth and fifth grade had a separate concert where they sang, 'Season of Bells,' 'Dreidel Spins,' 'Good Christian Men Rejoice,' 'Merry Merry,' 'Jolly Old St. Nicholas' and 'Go in Peace,' for the concluding song. An anonymous letter was sent to the school superintendent last week, expressing outrage at the repertoire of holiday tunes. 'We pay the taxes for this school. It is a public school. I have no problem with children having personal religious practices at school but to choose one religion and make it part of the curriculum is wrong,' the author, who only identified themselves as representing 'Chief Charlo Concerned Parents,' wrote. Target: Some parents at the Chief Charlo Elementary School in Missoula, Montana have said singing carols at school can give way to bullying since students will feel singled out in they don't join in . 'My children are crying because they don't want to be singled out but what they are doing in school directly conflicts with their faith,' the parent continued, claiming students would be 'targeted' if they expressed discomfort at singing a religious carol. 'Bullying is such a hot topic, yet that seems to be what is occurring here,' the parent wrote, adding that the students were being 'forced to be reformed to what is seen as the majority.' But the school denied that the selection of holiday songs was creating antagonism among the students, according to John Combs, the fine arts director for the school district who oversaw the musical selection. 'If I thought students were being bullied we would take measures to ensure that wasn't happening,' he told the MailOnline. According to Combs, the musical offerings try 'to strike a balance' between the different traditions of the holidays. 'We want the students to be exposed to a number of things. There will be some years where there will be no sacred music and some years there is.' 'Every year we get comments from one side or the other. Either the concert is too religious or it's not religious enough.' Discomfort: An unidentified parent wrote to the school, explaining how their child was traumatized by the caroling tradition . Though the unnamed parent threatened to take legal action against the public school for mentioning the name of Jesus in a song, a First Amendment legal specialist doubted the case would have much merit. 'It doesn't create a constitutional crisis to sing Christmas songs at Christmastime,' David Cortman, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), told the MailOnline. Mr Cortman noted the educational importance of the concert as a 'truncated view of our culture and of music in general.' 'If every time there was a piece of art or classical musical with a religious theme, we censored it - we would be eliminating much from the students' education.' Mr Cortman added there is no 'basis for a legal challenge' in the complaint from the Montana parents, who have yet to identify themselves. He noted another example that occurred in late October, when an atheist group complained that students at the Terry Elementary School in Little Rock, Arkansas were invited to a local church to see a performance of 'A Charlie Brown Christmas.' Though the trip was voluntary and the program not religious in nature, a statement from the Arkansas Society of Freethinkers said, 'The problem is that it's got religious content and it's being performed in a religious venue and that doesn't just blur the line between church and state, it oversteps it entirely.' Christmas or X-mas? The conservative group, the American Family Association, has alerted members to declare their support for Christmas (left) while secularists say it is better to keep the holiday neutral . Similar to the Montana case, an anonymous parent of an Arkansas student was angered by the invitation and said that even though she could opt to not allow her child to attend, she agreed to let her daughter participate because she feared the girl would be singled out. Some have gone as far to say that there is a 'War on Christmas,' with religious imagery and even the word Christmas being deemed offensive. A conservative Christian group, the American Family Association, has even compiled a list of retailers and rated the brands based on how overtly they incorporate Christmas into their holiday retailing. They assign a top Blue rating to brands that promote Christmas on an 'exceptional' basis in their marketing efforts and a Green rating to stores that refer to Christmas on a regular basis. A Yellow rating means the company refers infrequently to Christmas infrequently and a Red rating is left for those brands that use Christmas sparingly. Reason for the season: Religious references, like this nativity scene at a home, have increasingly come under scrutiny . Despite all the buzz regarding the religious songs on the program at the Chief Charlo school, Combs reported that the December 12 concert was a success. Several hundred proud parents and family members turned out to watch the show and the kids were excited as ever to get dressed up and perform. He said the school wants to give a 'flavor of the the rich tradition in Americas' of different faiths and different cultures. 'We're not advancing or inhibiting any religion,' he clarified. He said he has received complaints in the past and it disappointed that this parent has chosen to not identify themselves and provide specifics of a potential problem. 'If someone is really upset at singing a song, nobody makes them do it.' 'I would need for the parent to be a more specific as to how their children was being bullied, in order to know how to prevent it,' he added.","'Bullying is such a hot topic, yet that seems to be what is occurring here,' an anonymous parent wrote about carols at school concert .

"By . Matt Blake . The FBI has arrested six suspected British hackers accused of masterminding a global network of online fraudsters trading in stolen bank and credit card information. They were among 24 suspects snared yesterday following a painstaking two-year undercover sting spanning four continents, described as the biggest of its kind against financial cyber-crooks. 'Operation Card Shop' targeted 'sophisticated, highly organised' criminals, involved in selling stolen identities, credit cards, fake documents and sophisticated hacking software, the FBI said. Scroll down for video . Swoop: The Brits were among 24 suspects held across four continents following a two-year undercover operation described as the biggest of its kind to be launched against financial cybercriminals . The international gang is believed to have raked in millions of pounds though online scams and black-market trading. Agents said the sting began in June 2010, when the FBI established an undercover 'carding forum', that mimicked those operated by criminals to buy and sell information. Agents reeled the crooks in through the fake website, called 'Carder Profit', with which they hoodwinked their targets into believing they were on the hunt for stolen information. Instead, they eavesdropped on discussion threads and private messages, and tracked genuine thieves through their IP addresses after they logged on. Credit card fraud: The arrests came after undercover FBI investigators set up a bogus website where fraudsters involved in carding schemes could buy and sell stolen information and programmes . Authorities from 30 different countries are believed to have been involved in the operation. Agents were also able to notify the credit card providers of more than . 411,000 compromised credit and debit cards, and 47 companies, government . entities, and educational institutions that their networks had been . breached.

The alleged fraudsters, operating out of various countries in America, Europe, Asia and Australia, would have pocketed a further £131 million from . debit and credit cards had they not been stopped, the FBI said. A . total of 11 people were arrested in the US, while suspects were held in . 12 other countries including the UK, Norway, Italy and Japan. All are accused of buying and selling hacking programs and stolen personal information online. One of those arrested in America, called Mir Islam, who uses the name 'JoshTheGod', claimed to be a member of UGNazi, a group that has claimed credit for numerous recent online hack attacks. He was also a founder of Carders.Org, a carding forum on the Internet. Officials said he had information for more than 50,000 credit cards. The FBI said it seized the web server for UGNazi.com, and seized the domain name of Carders.org, taking both sites offline. In a separate development, a security report Tuesday said a wave of cyber attacks has likely stolen at least $80 million from bank accounts in Europe. Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara said: 'As the cyber threat grows more international, the response must be . increasingly global and forceful. 'The coordinated law enforcement actions taken by an unprecedented number of countries around the world demonstrate that hackers and fraudsters cannot count on being able to prowl the internet in anonymity and with impunity, even across national boundaries. 'Clever computer criminals operating behind the supposed veil of the Internet are still subject to the long arm of the law.' Between £48million and £1.6billion has been stolen from bank accounts in a massive cyber bank raid where fraudsters raided dozens of financial institutions around the world. The ‘highly sophisticated’ ring had bypassed physical chip and pin identification to siphon large amounts from high balance accounts, a study by global security firm McAfee and bank secuity specialist Guardian Analytics found. More than 60 firms have suffered from what it calls an ‘insider level of understanding’. The report says: ‘With no human participation required, each attack moves quickly and scales neatly. ‘This operation combines an insider level of understanding of banking transaction systems.’ The criminals created a computer code which automatically finds a victim’s highest value account. It then transfers money to a prepaid debit card which can then be drained quickly and anonymously. The ‘malware’ is so advanced that it can stay on the victim’s computer to conceal the theft, altering the target’s bank statement. The report said: ‘If all of the attempted fraud campaigns were as successful as the Netherlands example we describe in this report, the total attempted fraud could be as high as 2billion euro (£1.6bn).’ VIDEO: Mir Islam aka ""JoshTheGod"" leaves Manhattan Federal Court...","They were among 24 people arrested across the world .

"By . James  Nye . If he had won he would arguably be the greatest of all time -  instead Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning barely kept his temper in check during an interview after Super Bowl XLVIII when asked if he felt he embarrassed himself during the game. The 37-year-old five-time MVP became visibly irritated when asked by a reporter if he thought that the Broncos 43-8 loss and his worst performance of an otherwise record-breaking year was humiliating.

'There’s a lot of professional football players in that room, that locker room, who put a lot of hard work and effort into being here and into playing in that game. 'The word embarrassing is an insulting word, to tell you the truth.'

"By . Simon Walters . The Labour quango chief blamed by flood victims for wrecking homes and livelihoods has effectively been told to quit by No 10. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, now put in charge of handling the flooding crisis by David Cameron, said Environment Agency chairman Chris Smith should make a public apology for its mistakes. And asked whether Lord Smith, a former Cabinet Minister, should resign, Mr Pickles said bluntly: ‘He has to make his own decision.’ Brutal: New floods chief Eric Pickles, left, castigated Environment Agency chairman Lord Smith, pictured right with his Tibetan terrier Jinny . He used brutal sarcasm to pile on the pressure, adding: ‘I don’t see myself becoming the advocate of the “Save Chris Smith” campaign or printing “Save The Environment Agency One” T-shirts.’ He accused Lord Smith of playing ‘divide and rule’ by ‘trying to set town against country’, letting the EA become ‘riddled with politically correct’ eco-fanatics opposed to dredging, presiding as the organisation ‘lost its way’ and spending 20 times more money on its bloated bureaucracy than on keeping rivers clear. Mr Pickles’s comments came 24 hours after Lord Smith visited the flood-hit Somerset Levels and refused to resign. The Minister showed little sympathy over the mauling local residents gave Lord Smith, who lives in a £1 million London apartment with beloved Tibetan terrier Jinny. ‘It’s always good to get feedback from your customers,’ Mr Pickles observed drily. ‘At least he’ll never have to hire a focus group to know what people are thinking.’ Ignoring Labour claims that the Government is ‘scapegoating’ Lord Smith, Mr Pickles urged him to give in to demands to say sorry for the EA’s alleged failings. ‘It’s not a sign of weakness. A bit of reaching out and humanity and humility is good for everybody, whether a distinguished quangocrat or a member of the Cabinet.’ Condemned: Mr Pickles' comments came 24 hours after Lord Smith visited the flood-hit Somerset Levels and refused to resign . Mr Pickles added: ‘Being flooded is like a burglary: Afterwards, the effect continues. It’s not just the drying out or loss of precious possessions and memories. Every time it rains people wonder, “Is it going to happen again?” ’ Mr Pickles was asked by Mr Cameron to take charge of the crisis last week after Environment Secretary Owen Paterson had to have urgent treatment for a detached retina. Mr Paterson, who is married to an aristocrat’s daughter, had been criticised for visiting the Somerset Levels in town shoes, not Wellington boots. He was accused of seeming ‘shrill and aloof’ in interviews and in dealing with flood victims. By contrast, plain-talking Yorkshireman Mr Pickles was born into a Labour-supporting family and has the common touch you would expect of an Essex MP. Mr Pickles said the EA had blundered by stopping dredging. ‘The Somerset Levels were man-made and dredging was a fundamental part of keeping it going, just as it is with any land below sea level right across the world. You need to continuously dredge. ‘It worries me that in a politically correct attempt to be more environmentally sound than the next person, something as basic as this has been forgotten.’ No one has ever accused Eric Pickles of being a slave to political – or any other – fashion. By contrast, culture vulture Lord Smith was a New Labour Minister who cut his teeth in trendy, Labour-run Islington, the urban fount of political correctness. ‘Chris Smith tried to play divide and rule by setting town against country [when he said that the EA had to protect one or the other]. That is a false choice. ‘The people on the ground have done a fantastic job, but the agency has lost its way and become riddled with political correctness. Pickles said the people on the ground had done a fantastic job but the agency had become 'riddled with political correctness' It is not the first time he has clashed with the EA’s eco warriors. ‘Don’t even start me on my arguments with them about fortnightly rubbish collections,’ he roared. The flood has submerged the homes and lives of thousands of people. And if Mr Pickles has his way, the EA and Lord Smith will join the casualty list. He plans to force town halls to spell out on council tax bills how much money each household is contributing to the EA’s eye-watering £1.2 billion annual budget. He said: ‘The EA hiked up the council tax by around 20 per cent in the West Country last year with little to show for it. ‘ . He added: ‘It must not be invisible any more. They need a clear leadership and to understand that people matter. People are entitled to feel safe in their homes. ‘The EA gets £1.2 billion a year but paid out £395 million on staff last year and just £20 million on improving maintenance of culverts and channels to ensure the free flow of water.’ It was the most expensive agency of its type in Europe, costing nearly as much as in the USA. Mr Pickles had no truck with green activists who say people on the Somerset Levels chose to live below sea level and should move. Environment Agency chief Lord Chris Smith discusses the water level where the River's Tone and Parrett meet near Burrowbridge, Somerset . ‘That’s bad news for most of the Netherlands isn’t it?’ he quipped, with trademark deadpan humour. ‘I am certainly not in retreat. I want people back in their homes and animals back in their farms.’ Mr Pickles said he was determined to restore train links to Cornwall after the track crumbled into the sea in Dawlish in Devon. But he does not rule out re-routing the track inland in the future. And he plans a massive ‘storm audit’ of all coastal road and rail links to find out whether other changes are needed. ‘We will look at all our strategic infrastructure to ensure it is as  clear as possible from disruption from storms.’ He is due to visit areas hit by the floods in a few days. When he does, unlike Mr Paterson, he will definitely be wearing Wellingtons. Are they black or green? ‘Black, of course,’ laughed Mr Pickles. Green Wellies are for the posh kids, like Messrs Paterson and Cameron.","Communities Secretary wants Environment Agency chairman to apologise .

"By . Martin Beckford . Police Minister Damian Green mistakenly signed a law allowing England's most notorious football hooligans to attend the World Cup finals . A minister mistakenly signed a new law to allow England’s most notorious football hooligans to attend the World Cup finals this summer. Police Minister Damian Green thought the signature he put to the legal document would ban them from Brazil. But the dates were wrong and he barred them from just the opening day instead of the entire tournament. The blunder would have left 2,500 of the worst troublemakers free to cause mayhem, but thankfully one of Mr Green’s team spotted the mistake and redrafted the law with the correct dates. Every season thousands of fans arrested for hooliganism are given banning orders. And for each World Cup, police and Home Office officials draw up measures to make sure thugs cannot attend the tournament by forcing them to surrender their passports between certain dates. But the so-called Statutory Instrument stated a travel ban would start on June 2, ten days before the opening ceremony, but mistakenly added it would end on June 13, rather than July 13. June 13 is the first full day of matches, while England’s opening game against Italy is on June 14. The law was laid before Parliament on January 29, but the Home Office said officials then spotted the mistake. A corrected version went before Parliament on Thursday. ‘An amendment order was drafted immediately,’ a spokesman said.

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has called for the firm to work with arch rival Google and produce a phone running Android software. He believes there is nothing stopping Apple from taking on Samsung and other Android phone makers. He said he believes an android iPhone would 'compete very well.' Wozniak believes there is nothing stopping Apple from taking on Samsung and other Android phone makers. He said he believes an android iPhone would 'compete very well.' 'There’s nothing that would keep Apple out of the Android market as a secondary phone market,” Wozniak told Wired magazine. 'We could compete very well. People like the precious looks of stylings and manufacturing that we do in our product compared to the other Android offerings. 'We could play in two arenas at the same time.' Experts say that although highly unliklely, an Android iPhone is technically possible. Firms such as Samsung and Motorola already have their own 'skins' for Google's software. Amazon has gone one step further and created its own version of Android, known as a fork, for the Kindle tablets it makes. Doing this would allow Apple to keep its Android handset looking similar to its own iOS software. However, it would also require Apple to pay Google to license its apps such as Gmail and Maps. Wozniak also defended called for apple to quickly release radical new product categories such as a Tv ans watch. Wozniak also admitted to Wired that he owned all three colours of Apple's iPhone 5S . Apple President John Sculley, flanked by co-founders of Apple, Steve Jobs (left) and Steve Wozniak (right), unveiled the new briefcase-size Apple IIc to more than 3,000 dealers and software sector representatives at Moscone Center in April 1984 . 'The great products really come from secret development,' he said. 'You put small teams of great people on them and they aren’t bothered by other people commenting on what they’re doing while they’re doing it. 'A whole new category of products doesn’t happen very often. It might happen once a decade. Sometimes you have to wait for one of those to come about.' It is not the first time Wozniak has called for apple to work with Google. The Apple co-founder told the BBC he wishes ‘to God' his tech firm and Google will be partners in the future. He also admitted Apple’s voice recognition service Siri can't always live up to the same standards as Google’s Android version. A partnership between the two firms could make phones better, he continued. In the interview with BBC Click, Wozniak, 63, said: ‘Sometimes I say 'Go to Joe's Diner' and [Siri] doesn't know where Joe's Diner is. 'And very often usually I find out that Android does.’ He continued that Google’s success is down to the fact Android has the benefit of being directly linked to the California-based firm’s search engine and results – something Apple doesn’t have the benefit of. Wozniak adds that Android is the ‘future of intelligence for computers getting smarter’ and wishes the two companies could join forces. If the two companies combined, Wozniak claims the information that could be shared would benefit all those involved, and ultimately benefit the paying customers.

"By . Bianca London . It was given the royal seal of approval when Princess Beatrice and Zara Phillips stepped out wearing it this month, and it seems that royals, celebrities and the British public can't get enough of New Look. The high street store has been crowned British women's favourite place to shop on the high street, knocking last season's winner, Zara from the top spot. According to new research conducted by leading brand recommendation site dressipi.com for its annual FBI (Fashion Brands Index), New Look beat the likes of H&M and Topshop to take first place. Royal seal of approval: When Zara Phillips (left) stepped out in this £49.99 maternity coat and Princess Beatrice (right) in a £34.99 skirt from New Look, the store was firmly placed on the fashion map . In the survey of 10,000 women conducted over a six-month period, almost a quarter (24 per cent) of respondents named New Look as their favourite of all high street brands. The results for the six months from June to December 2013 reveal that the once unassailable Zara has slipped to second place in consumers’ affections as the favourite brand of 23 per cent of women. This figure represents a 10 per cent drop on the brand’s ratings among British women in the twelve months since December 2012. Further down the FBI top ten, H&M and Topshop vie for third place, with an equal share of 21 per cent of votes, both posting a slight decline of 1 per cent on the previous six month period. Fifth and sixth placed retailers were Next and River Island with Dorothy Perkins in equal seventh with new entrant Primark. Famous fans: Lucy Watson in a £59.99 coat, Billie Faiers in a £17.99 skirt and her sister Sam in a £59.99 jumpsuit from the high-street store, which has clinched the top spot in the nation's affections . A spokesperson for Dressipi said: 'We . could see from the New Look autumn/winter press preview earlier in the . year that it was going to be a strong season for the retailer - way . before the clothes had even hit the stores. 'Their . trend translation is spot-on without being too obvious, with pieces . that easily work a number of outfits in a number of wardrobes spanning a . good age range. 'It would be easy to put New Look's success over Zara down to price points, but really where the high street is concerned these days it is also very much a case of cleverly getting the balance of trend, basics, versatility and wow-factor product right. 'New Look has been an increasingly important force in UK fashion for a while now, but really broke through in 2013 with strong spring and summer collections and a couple of smart celebrity collaborations, including one with Kelly Brook.' Contender: New Look, famed for its purse-friendly, fashion-forward designs, has beaten Topshop and Zara to be crowned the nation's favourite high street store . New Look was founded in 1969 and its first ever store was in Taunton, Somerset. Fast forward to 2013 and New Look now operates across a chain of over 1,000 stores internationally.

"By . Anna Edwards . The former vice-madam plans to publish a book describing her alleged connection with the politician . The former dominatrix has had her home raided by police weeks before the release of her autobiography in which she makes fresh claims about George Osborne. Up to 12 drugs squad officers searched Natalie Rowe's flat for two hours but found nothing. Miss Rowe, who once used the name 'Miss Whiplash' claimed it was an attempt to smear her ahead of the book's publication later this month. Her memoirs are expected to be embarrassing for Mr Osborne, who was allegedly a regular guest at parties at her flat in the early 1990s. Mr Osborne was embroiled in a scandal in 2005, when a picture surfaced showing him in his twenties sitting alongside Miss Rowe when she was working as a dominatrix known as 'Mistress Pain'. Miss Rowe said her home, in Chelsea, west London, was raided just 48 hours after a paper revealed the book's release date. She claims that while they raided her home one officer asked her about the book and another told her it would open 'a whole can of worms' if she complained. She told the Sunday People: 'I'm not into conspiracy theories. 'I'd like to think the fact that I've been unfairly targeted by the police has nothing to do with the fact that my book is about to be published, which happens to be very embarrassing for the Chancellor. 'But it's certainly made me wonder.' The former madam claims that her home was raided on October 2, and she was locked in her living room while police searched her home. They told her they had been tipped off by a member of the public that there were drugs in her property - a claim that Miss Rowe strongly denies. She claims that she was not allowed to call a lawyer and officer spent nearly two hours combing her home for drugs, but they did not find any. Apparently the autobiographical book will contain 'embarrassing revelations' about George Osborne, who was pictured with Miss Rowe when he was in his twenties . She says that she warned them not to read the manuscript of her book, which she had left on her bed, and was asked if she was 'writing her memoirs'. Miss Rowe also claims that when she called up . to complain about how police stormed her home, she was told that she was . about to 'open up a whole can of worms'. The former dominatrix has made an . official complaint to Scotland Yard and plans to contact the Independent Police . Complaints Commission. When Miss Rowe met Mr Osborne, she was dating William Sinclair, a member of one of the country’s biggest landowning families. He and the future Chancellor were members of Oxford University’s Bullingdon Club, a male-only institution with a reputation for heavy drinking and riotous behaviour. Miss Rowe has previously claimed that Mr Osborne knew that she had an escort agency and once discovered whips and sex toys in her apartment. She said he had 'found it quite amusing.’ She said the party at which Mr Osborne was photographed was held to celebrate her becoming pregnant by Mr Sinclair. She added: ‘It was definitely cocaine on the table. ‘I remember vividly on that particular night I said to George, jokingly, ""When you are prime minister one day I will have all the dirty goods on you"" and he laughed. Although the picture was taken before Mr . Osborne entered politics, it was published when he had taken centre . stage in the Conservative party as shadow chancellor. His response was to deny that there was cocaine on the table and insisted that any suggestion that he took drugs was 'defamatory and completely untrue.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Following information received, officers based in Kensington and Chelsea obtained a warrant to search an address under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 on October 2. 'No drugs were found and no one was arrested. 'A formal complaint was received on October 9. It has been referred to the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS). We are not prepared to discuss further.'","Mr Osborne was pictured in his twenties sitting alongside Natalie Rowe when she was working as a dominatrix known as 'Mistress Pain'

"By . Nick Mcdermott . Scrabble purists watch out, the word is that someone wants to change the rules. A U.S. academic and Scrabble fan has proposed altering the value of some letters to reflect changes in the dictionary and how easy they are to play with other letters. Dr Joshua Lewis, who created a computer programme to recalculate the values, is likely to outrage purists by awarding just six points for a Z, which is the highest scoring tile alongside Q, with both worth ten points. He says only Q should remain a ten-point tile, with X relegated from eight to five. The game was invented 1938 by Alfred Butts, who calculated the scores based on how frequently letters appeared on the front page of the New York Times. Calls for change: A researcher claims that the letter values in Scrabble - which was invented 75 years ago - are outdated . Updated: Researcher Joshus Lewis has devised a new scoring system where letter values - such as Z and X - have been changed to better represent how frequently they are now used in the English Language . Mr Lewis gives the letter Z as a prime example, claiming that by today's standards it should only be worth six points instead of the traditional 10. He also suggests that X - worth eight points in the current game - should only be worth five points. But while many of the letters would decrease in value under the system devised by Mr Lewis, some letters would go up in value. Mr Lewis recommends that the letter U increase from one point to two points and G go from two to three. Q, however, is still apparently a tricky word to play and should still count as 10 points, Mr Lewis adds. Researcher Joshua Lewis has made a new scoring system so the value of letters better represent how often they are used in the modern day English language. Here is what each letter is worth in his software programme called Valett: . A: 1 - Stays the same  B: 3 - Stays the same . C: 2 - Down from 3      D: 2 - Stays the same . E: 1 - Stays the same  F: 3 - Down from 4 . G: 3 - Up from 2           H: 2 - Down from 4 . I: 1 - Stays the same    J: 6 - Down from 8 . K: 4 - Down from 5       L: 2 - Up from 1 . M: 2 - Down from 3      N: 1 - Stays the same . O: 1 - Stays the same  P: 2 - Down from 3 . Q: 10 - Stays the same R: 1 - Stays the same . S: 1 - Stays the same   T: 1 - Stays the same . U: 2 - Up from 1            V: 5 - Up from 4 . W: 4 - Stays the same  X: 5 - Down from 8 . Y: 3 - Down from 4        Z: 6 - Down from 10 . Mr Lewis told the BBC: 'The dictionary of legal words in Scrabble has changed. Among the notable additions are all of these short words which make it easier to play Z, Q and X, so even though Q and Z are the highest value letters in Scrabble, they are now much easier to play.' Mr Lewis has devised a new software programme called Valett which awards points using a scoring system based on how frequently letters are used in the English language today. The new system takes into account the frequency of the letters in the English language, the frequency of how many times a letter appears in two, three, seven, and eight-letter words and how easy it is to play the letter with other letters. But Mr Lewis is far from the first to devise a new scoring system for Scrabble, which was invented in 1938 by American architect Alfred Butts, who calculated letter scores by measuring how frequently they appeared on the front page of the New York Times. The co-president of the North American Scrabble Players Association, John Chew, says he hears from people at least once or twice a year saying that the tile values are incorrect. But he warns there would 'catastrophic outrage' around the world if the game rules were now changed. He told the BBC: 'Some people would just continue playing with the old tile distributions because people who've played the game often enough tend to remember that the Q is worth 10 points, the Z is worth 10 points and so on.' Mr Chew added that letters such as S and blank tiles, that while low scoring alone, are a great help in joining words and achieving multiple word scores in one go. But while there may be many who would relish the chance to see an end to the 10 point Z, which can so often play the deciding tile in a closely-fought game of Scrabble, the makers of the game have no intentions of changing it. Philip Nelkon, the UK representative for Scrabble makers Mattel, said: 'Mattel has no plans to change Scrabble tiles. It is not a game where fairness is paramount, it is a game of luck and changing the tile values wouldn't achieve anything.' Mr Lewis admitted that his new way of scoring, while making the game fairer, may not suit everyone. He said: 'That might be desirable in tournaments but it might not be as good in casual play where you want the less skilled players to have a shot periodically at beating the more highly skilled players.' Traditionalists need not panic: The makers of Scrabble, Mattel, say they have no plans to make any changes to the game .","Board game was invented 75 years ago by American architect Alfred Butts .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Tate art gallery has agreed to return an oil painting by John Constable after evidence showed the picture had been stolen by the Nazis. The 1824 work, entitled Beaching A Boat, Brighton, is understood to have been looted from wartime Hungary.

"By . Becky Barrow . 'A full frontal assault on poor value for money': How Pensions Minister Steve Webb dubbed the move to cap charges at 0.75 per cent . Rip-off charges which can wipe out more than a third of the value of a worker’s pension pot will be banned next year. Pensions Minister Steve Webb described the crackdown in which charges will be capped at 0.75 per cent as ‘a full frontal assault on poor value for money’. Over the next ten years, workers who diligently save into a pension will be around £200million better off as a result of yesterday’s announcement. This is because the money will go into their pension pots, rather than being siphoned off in high charges by well-paid fund managers. Mr Webb said: ‘Pension savers have paid too much for too long. It is time to put the saver first. We are going to put charges in a vice, and we will tighten the pressure, year after year.’ His announcement is a major victory for the Daily Mail, which has long campaigned against sky-high fees and charges on investment funds and pensions. Moneymail’s Fair Play on Charges campaign has been calling for lower annual fees on people’s life savings, highlighting how they could strip tens of thousands of pounds from even a modest retirement pot. Moneymail editor James Coney said: ‘These types of charges are iniquitous because savers never realise the damage that’s being done to their nest egg. ‘This charge cap is a major step forward and now needs to be applied to older types of pension as well as new ones.’ Pension charges – an issue which few understand or can decipher on their annual pension statement – are levied each year as a percentage of the value of the pot during an employee’s working life. Their impact can be devastating. Take the example of a £700,000 pension pot. If the annual charge is 1.5 per cent, it eats up £236,000 of the total value of the pension pot. If the charge is 0.75 per cent – the level at which the cap will be introduced next April – charges wipe out only £132,300. The 0.75 per cent cap will cover all pension schemes into which around 11million workers are being ‘automatically enrolled’ by their boss. Since October 2012, bosses must pay into pensions for their workers. An independent review, due to report at the end of the year, is deciding whether a crackdown on older company pension schemes is also necessary. The cap does not apply to non-workplace private pensions. The Mail, September 20, 2013: Mr Webb's announcement is a major victory for the Daily Mail, which has long campaigned against sky-high fees and charges on investment funds and pensions . Mr Webb told MPs the cap will be reviewed in three years’ time and might be ‘reduced further’. Consumer group Which? is calling for a cap of 0.5 per cent. Other charges will also be banned over the next two years, such as imposing higher fees on workers’ pensions if they have left the firm. The long-awaited crackdown is the latest move in an extraordinary nine days, which Mr Webb, a LibDem, described as ‘truly a pensions revolution’. In last week’s Budget, Chancellor George Osborne scrapped the rule that forces workers to buy an annuity, an income for life, from an insurer when they retire. Instead, from next April, they can take the money out of their pension pots and be taxed on it.","Workers who save into a pension will be around £200million better off .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The number of singletons has risen by 3million in a decade, as more of us choose to live on our own, according to new research. A detailed analysis of the state of the nation reveals that in some areas more than half of people are unattached, with Islington topping the league tables where almost two in three men and 57 per cent or women are single. But anyone looking for love in East Devon is going to struggle, because just a quarter of men and fewer than a fifth of women are on the market. The Office for National Statistics has published an interactive map showing the areas where all the single men, and women, live. Scroll down for interactive map . The Office for National Statistics released a interactive series of maps showing where single people live, including this one which shows the percentage of those aged 16 and over who were not living as a couple in 2011 . In 2011 over 15.7 million adults or 35 per cent of people aged 16 and over England and Wales had never been married, a rise from 12.5 million (30 per cent) in 2001. Including people who have been married before but are now divorced or widowed, the total number of singletons hit 23 million in 2011. This equates to 51 per cent of the population, outnumbering those in couples for the first time. In 2001 there were 19.4 million people classed as ‘not married’, 47 per cent. The ONS said: ‘The rise in the single population could be the result of a number of factors, including the proportional decline in marriage since the 1970s and the increased social acceptability of remaining single or cohabiting (either never marrying or not re-marrying following divorce or widowhood).’ People who live near the seaside may be more prone to divorce, a new report suggests. The divorce hot spots of England and Wales are all coastal areas, according to the ONS. The local authority with the highest proportion of divorcees was Blackpool where 13.1 per cent of the population were divorced. In Hastings 12.8 per cent of people were divorced while 12.2 per cent of those in Torbay had been through a marriage breakdown. Weymouth and Portland, Thanet, the Isle of Wight, Gosport, Eastbourne, Great Yarmouth and Worthing also made up the top 10 places with the highest proportions of divorced people. 'The top 10 were all in coastal areas, and mainly on the South coast of England apart from Blackpool and Great Yarmouth,' the report states. 'Higher levels of divorced population may relate to the affordability of housing and living costs in some of these areas resulting in divorced people with reduced economic assets living there.' The single population is also ageing, in part as a result of more older people being divorced and widowed. In 2011, the median age of the . adult population who had never been married was 27.5, a rise from 26.9 . in 2001. Those who were not married in 2011 had a median age of 35.6, a . rise from 35.0 in 2001. Of those who had never been married, women were younger than men, with a median age of 26.9 compared with 28 years. The . ONS said: ‘This is linked to the trend for women to marry men who are . older than themselves.However, not married women were on average older . than men (39.3 and 32.9 years respectively). This is most likely due to . the higher proportion of widows in the population (10 per cent of adult . women compared with 3.3 per cent of adult men).’ Islington in North London has the highest proportion of single men (63 per cent), followed by Lambeth (61 per cent) and Hackney (60 per cent). In Tower Hamlets, Hammersmith and Fulham and Manchester 59 per cent of men were classed as single. By contrast, just 24 per cent of men in East Devon were single, with 27 per cent single in South Northampton, East Devon and North Kesteven in the East Midlands. Islington is also the capital of single women, with 57 per cent unattached, ahead of Lambeth on 56 per cent and Hackney 55 per cent. In Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth and Camden, 53 per cent of women were single. But in East Dorset just 18 per cent of women were single, followed by Richmondshire (20 per cent) and several areas where only 21 per cent were single. ‘The majority of the top 10 local authorities with the highest proportions of those who were either never married or unmarried were in London,’ the ONS said. ‘Local authorities with high proportions of single people had younger populations. Oxford, for example, appeared in the top 10 for both groups. ‘The area with the lowest proportion of both never married and not married was East Dorset where 21% of the adult population had never been married and a further 18% were divorced or widowed. ‘This reflects the older age structure in this area and higher proportions of the population who were widowed.’ While the top 10 for men and women were dominated by the same areas, in some parts of the country there were marked differences. In Richmondshire in North Yorkshire there were 21 men to every 10 women who had never been married. In the small village of Scotton in Richmondshire, there were 97 men to every 10 women – because it has a large army barracks in the area. There were more women than men who were not married in coastal areas such as Rother (East Sussex) and Christchurch (Dorset) where there were around 13 women who were not married to every 10 men who were not married. The ONS added: ‘These coastal areas have an older population and as women have higher life expectancy, this is likely to be due to the number of widows in the population.’","More than half of women and two thirds of men in the London borough of Islington are single .

"By . Sam Adams . UPDATED: . 09:31 EST, 18 October 2012 . Tragedy: American journalist Charles Horman (pictured here with his wife Joyce) disappeared in Chile in 1973 . Chile's Supreme Court has approved an . extradition request for a former U.S. military officer who is wanted . over the 1973 killings of two Americans - including one whose . disappearance became the focus of an Oscar-winning film. Former U.S. Navy captain Ray E. Davis is accused of being 'criminally responsible' for the deaths of journalist Charles Horman and student Frank Teruggi, who were killed during the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet. Attorney, Sergio Corvalan, who represents Mr Horman's widow Joyce, said the Supreme Court has approved a request by Judge Jorge Zepeda to seek Capt Davis' extradition to face trial in Chile. An unnamed court official said the vote would be formally announced today, according to the Associated Press (AP). Capt Davis commanded the U.S. military . mission in Chile at the time of the 1973 coup that ousted the . democratically elected government of Marxist President Salvador . Allende. Mr Corvalan said the ruling by Chile's Supreme Court accuses Capt Davis of being 'criminally responsible as author of the . crimes of qualified homicide of Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi.' Mr Corvalan added that Supreme Court prosecutor Monica Maldonado said 'a . homicide was committed' that could have been prevented by Capt Davis. Iron rule: More than 3,000 people disappeared or were killed under the regime of General Pinochet in Chile . Capt Davis was investigating the two Americans . as part of a series of covert intelligence operations by the U.S. Embassy in Santiago targeting those considered subversives or radicals, . Corvalan said. The Supreme Court considered the . killings of the two Americans to be crimes against humanity, he added. A conviction on the charges against Capt Davis carries a penalty of 10 . years to life in prison. After he was charged a year . ago his wife, Patricia Davis, is reported to have said her husband . denied any involvement in the . killings. She said he no longer talked because of Alzheimer's disease . and was in a nursing home. Campaign: The search for Mr Horman by his wife, Joyce (pictured), and his father was the topic of the 1982 movie 'Missing,' which starred Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemmon in the roles . According to court papers, Mr Horman, a . freelance journalist and filmmaker, was arrested on September 17, 1973, two . weeks after the coup and taken to Santiago's main soccer stadium, which . had been turned into a detention camp for General Pinochet's suspected enemies. He was 31 years old. A national truth commission formed . after the dictatorship ended said Mr Horman was executed the next day while . in the custody of Chilean state security agents. The commission said Mr Teruggi, then a 24-year-old university student, was executed on September 22. The search for Mr Horman by his wife and . his father was the topic of the 1982 movie 'Missing,' which starred . Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemmon in the roles. Spotlight: Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek in the Oscar-winning film 'Missing' The film won a best . screenplay Oscar. 'Missing' suggested U.S. complicity in . Mr Horman's death and at the time drew strong objections from U.S. State . Department officials. The case was practically ignored . in Chile until 2000, when Mrs Horman went to the country and filed a lawsuit . against General Pinochet. She said she was acting on behalf of all victims of . the dictatorship. The truth commission has determined that 3,095 people were murdered or 'disappeared' by government agents during General Pinochet's rule.","Journalist Charles Horman and student Frank Teruggi disappeared in Chile in 1973 .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A four-year-old dog had her throat ripped apart and was left for dead after being mauled during a dog fight. Staffie Lexi was found collapsed in a back yard with horrific injuries to her throat and neck and blood pouring from her wounds. It is thought she was dumped in Nelson, Lancashire, after being used for bait in a dog fight. Four-year-old Staffie Lexi suffered horrific throat injuries after being mauled in a dog fight and was left needing several stitches in her neck, pictured. Her rescuers fear she may have been used as bait for other dogs . Lexi has had several operations since the attack and is now on the road to recovery after vets stitched up her throat. She has a temporary tube in her neck to stop unwanted fluid and blood building up in her throat . She was taken to the vets by a passer-by before being taken in by rescue centre, Pendle Dogs in Need. On the charity’s Facebook page, workers described Lexi as having ‘obvious signs of being used as a bait dog’ after she was found on March 12. A post, accompanied by a picture of Lexi, read: ‘This little dog has horrific injuries. She collapsed in the vets due to the amount of blood loss from her injuries. ‘Please be aware that this barbaric sort of thing does happen and it’s happening on our doorstep. ‘Please keep your dogs close by and safe, this could happen to anyone's beloved pet. ‘Apart from her injuries this girl does look and act like she's been well loved.’ Rescuers who found Lexi after she was dumped in a back yard in Lancashire on March 12 described her as having 'obvious signs of being used as a bait dog'. She is now temporarily being cared for by rescuers . Lexi’s collar’s micro-chip suggests she was originally from the Bolton area, but the chip’s details are out of date so her owner cannot be located. Workers at Pendle Dogs in Need, Lancashire, are desperate to locate Lexi’s owners. They said: ‘She's a very sweet natured calm little girl who has quite obviously been well loved and looked after prior to this happening to her. ‘She knows her basic commands and is well mannered and happily gives a paw for a treat. ‘Was Lexi stolen/sold or just given away as many of this wonderful breed are? Where are the people who have so obviously cared for and loved this little girl? 'Are they looking for her?

"By . Sara Malm . Vladimir Putin is hoping to return the Russian people to its former vigour – by re-introducing Soviet-era mass exercise. This week, Putin signed an executive order to bring back the Ready for Labor and Defence programme, to improve the fitness of the population. The Russian President, who in 2008 released an instructional judo DVD called 'Let's Learn Judo with Vladimir Putin', will use unused funds from the Sochi Olympics to revive the plan. Scroll down for video . All together now: The Russian president leads by example, and has . even released released an instructional judo DVD called 'Let's Learn . Judo with Vladimir Putin' Speaking in the Kremlin on Monday, Putin said that reinstating the plan, first introduced in the 1930s under Joseph Stalin and known in Russia by the acronym GTO, would ‘pay homage to our national historical traditions’. During the Soviet days, Russians of all ages were expected to participate in GTO. In the final years of high school education, teenagers were enlisted in the Strength and Courage-programme, where they would undergo basic military training. Men aged 40 to 50, and women aged 35-55, would take part in the Vigor and Health-programme, and local branches of GTO would hold their own annual championships. This week Putin said the leftover Sochi funds support sports venues and promote healthy lifestyles among Russians from the age of six. People's (healthy) President: Vladimir Putin, pictured riding a horse during during his holidays in Southern Siberia, wants to encourage his people to exercise . Point and shoot: Putin will use leftover funds from the Sochi Olympics to pay for the new mass-exercise programme . ‘The Olympics and Paralympics have demonstrated that we are again becoming one of the leaders in global sports,’ Putin said, after his country hosted the $50-billion games. Putin frequently harks back to the Soviet era to appeal to nostalgic Russians, and the move coincides with the recent annexation of Crimea. Bioth the U.S. and the EU have imposed sanctions on Russia over the move, even excluding Putin from the G8 group. However, the annexation of Crimea has boosted Putin's popularity at home, where almost half of Russians said the move, according to a poll by the independent Levada Center published earlier this month. Putin's own approval ratings were at 72 per cent, up from 65 per cent at the beginning of the year, according to another poll published by Levada this month. The president has been seeking to increase Russians' life expectancy and stem a demographic decline that has seen the population fall to below 142 million in 2011 from 148.6 million in 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed.","Putin revives mass exercise programme introduced by Stalin in the 1930s .

"By . Mark Duell . Getting better: Ben Maycock was left minutes from death after the horrific unprovoked attack . A 21-year-old man who doctors thought would die after he was left with half a head following a hammer attack has finally taken his first steps. Ben Maycock, of Leicester, was left minutes from death after the horrific unprovoked attack - and he was in a coma for three weeks. Doctors at Nottingham's Queen’s Medical Centre had to cut away part of Mr Maycock’s skull to relieve the swelling on his brain - and his grief-stricken family were told to prepare for the worst. But four years later, Mr Maycock is starting to piece back together his life after working hard to regain the movement in his legs - having had Botox injected to help him walk again. Mr Maycock said: ‘It has been a long and slow process and there have been days when I’ve wanted to give up. But I worked hard every day to try and get my movement back. I just want to have a normal life again.’ And his 46-year-old mother Karen said: ‘It has been a hard journey for Ben. He has had his youth taken away for him. He should be out enjoying himself like other lads his age and instead he is stuck indoors.’ Leicester City FC fan Mr Maycock has been undergoing gruelling physiotherapy sessions three times a week to help regain the use of his limbs, which were left paralysed since the attack. He must practise moving his limbs daily and also having weekly speech therapy sessions to help him communicate. He also has Botox injected into his limbs every three months to help his muscles relax. Mr Maycock is forced to take a daily cocktail of pills to help control his fits and spasms - a lasting side effect of the attack. But he is trying to stay motivated. He said: ‘When I got up out of my wheelchair for the first time and took a few steps unaided it was an amazing feeling and I really want to have a chance at a normal life. ‘It’s my dream to take my Labrador Benjy for a walk. Hopefully I will get there one day - but at the minute it would be Benjy taking me for the walk, not the other way round.’ Mrs Maycock said: ‘He has his down days - we all do - but life is looking more positive since he has started moving about on his own. This time four years ago we didn’t think he would be with us - his recovery has been remarkable.’ Road to recovery: Leicester City FC fan Ben Maycock (left) in June 2010 when he was 17, and (right) now, as he is starting to piece back together his life after working hard to regain the movement in his legs . He has even managed to go and watch his football team play with his 50-year-old stepfather Paul. Mr Maycock said: ‘By getting my movement back has meant I’ve been able to go watch Leicester City play football for a few weekends, and it’s a great feeling to be out and about. But his mother said it has been hard for him to cope with the reaction of others since over the past four years - especially due to the dent in his skull left from his lifesaving surgery. Mrs Maycock said: ‘People don’t stare at him because he is in a wheelchair but they would stare at the dent in his head. People are ignorant and rude, but Ben just gets on with it.’ Mr Maycock had a sizable portion of his skull removed after a hammer was plunged into his head during the attack in 2010. Difficult time: Mr Maycock with his mother Karen, 46, who said it has been a 'hard journey' for her son . Dent: Mr Maycock had a sizable portion of his skull removed after a hammer was plunged into his head . This left him with a dent in his head - but he has been able to have a titanium plate inserted in an attempt to reshape his head. 'When I got up out of my wheelchair for the first time and took a few steps unaided it was an amazing feeling - and I really want to have a chance at a normal life' Ben Maycock . He said: ‘When I first saw my head I was in a state of shock. I was just glad that I was alive. But when I would go out in my wheelchair people would stare. The operation has really helped my confidence. ‘And now that I am able to walk I am overjoyed - four years ago I didn’t think I get here.’ Daniel Hammonds, then 28, was jailed for six years and Jeremy Barnett, then 23, was jailed for 20 months at Leicester Crown Court in 2010 for their parts in the ‘merciless’ hammer attack. Mrs Maycock said: ‘We didn’t think Ben would pull through at all so to see him, making progress every day is a blessing. He didn’t ask for this to happen and I am still angry. But he is very dedicated and recent developments have given us a lot of hope.’","Ben Maycock was left minutes from death after horrific unprovoked attack .

"Maurice Travis, 33, who stabbed to death a fellow inmate during a cookery class and is on the run . A convicted murderer who formed a 'blood bond' while serving time with a racist killer dubbed 'The Madman' has gone on the run while on day release. Maurice Travis, 33, was serving life for stabbing another inmate to death - but he had been granted 'temporary licence' after serving almost 16 years of his sentence ahead of being parole. He was last seen on Wednesday in the Werneth area of Oldham, Greater Manchester where his family used to live. Despite his criminal history police say is not believed to be 'significant' threat to the public - although the public are warned not to approach him. Travis was serving five months for robbery in a young offender institution when he met and shared a cell with shaven headed Robert Stewart - who has a cross and the words RIP tattooed on his forehead. He and Stewart would 'incite' each other with violent fantasies and later Travis killed fellow inmate lan Averall, 17, in jail during a row over a piece of birthday cake. After the killing Travis and Stewart swapped letters and phone calls talking about carrying out a further murder - and Stewart later beat an Asian cellmate to death as he lay sleeping their cell. During a statement to a public inquiry Travis claimed he were Stewart were going to kill Averall together and added: 'He follows me its like he worships everything I do. 'I know it wouldn't be long before he killed somebody. There was a situation when we spoke on the telephone or wrote and I suggested to him that he killed his padmate. 'I just told him to do it to him and he did it. I am prepared to take some of the blame for this.' Det Ch Insp Mike Mangan said of Greater Manchester Police: 'While we do not believe Travis presents a significant threat to the public, he is unlawfully at large and he needs to be returned to prison. 'I would ask anyone with information about where he currently is, has been or could be heading contacts us in confidence.' Travis is white, 5ft 9in tall and has short cropped brown hair. He was wearing black jeans, black jacket with white motif on top of left shoulder and white trainers. He has links to Tameside, Oldham and Salford areas . Travis was serving five months for robbery in a young offender institution when he met and shared a cell with shaven headed Robert Stewart (left).  On 21 March 2000, Stewart battered Zahid Mubarek (right), 20,  in the middle of the night . Travis and Stewart had originally been cellmates at Hindley Young Offender Institute in Wigan in the 1990s where they admitted started fires at the jail because they thought it was 'funny.' In 1997 a nurse overheard the pair talking to each other about their violent fantasies, and was so shocked that she wrote a security report warning that they could 'endanger their own lives and possibly others'. But the report was never acted on. Then, on June 23 1998 after they were transferred to Stoke Heath in Market Drayton, Shropshire Travis, stabbed inmate lan Averall on his 17th birthday during a cookery class. It was believed Stewart has planned the killing talking of cutting convicted burglar Averall's throat. But although he was arrested on suspicion of murder - and even handed Travis the murder weapon - he was not charged. Travis and Stewart had originally been cellmates at Hindley Young Offender Institute in Wigan in the 1990s where they admitted started fires at the jail because they thought it was 'funny' Stewart was transferred to Feltham young offender institute in connection with a separate trial. He was later moved into the same cell as Zahid Mubarek . It emerged the fatal stabbing happened shortly after Averall had taunted Travis by saying he could not have a piece of his birthday cake, which had been prepared during a lesson. Travis was later given life in jail after he admitted murder. After the killing Stewart wrote a letter for Travis saying: 'What's done is done. Everyone thinks am next. Let's wait and see. If I get out in four weeks, it could be the first murder of the millennium! Ha ha. Another said: 'After all dat bisness, I got the orderly job in the cooking class. Handling knives all day. Ha! Ha!' Shortly into 2000, following the sending of this letter, Stewart was transferred to Feltham young offender institute in connection with a separate trial. He was later moved into the same cell as Zahid Mubarek. On 21 March 2000, Stewart battered Zahid, 20, with a table leg in the middle of the night.Stewart, now 33, was jailed for life in November 2000 for Zahid's murder and has been held in Woodhill Category A prison. A public inquiry later said prison chiefs missed 14 chances to save Zahid and seemed 'oblivious to the danger' of placing psychopath Stewart, in the same cell as the 19-year-old. According to the Commission for Racial Equality's report on the murder, one prisoner said of Stewart: 'I called him Madman. Other prisoners had names for him like Sicko.'","Maurice Travis, 33, serving life for stabbing another inmate to death in 1998 .

The historic national census is to move online to save the taxpayer almost £400 million, national statistics chiefs said yesterday . When . the next census is run in 2021, the Office for National Statistics . expects to hire an army of enumerators equipped with iPads or similar . devices to help the elderly and others unsure of how to use the internet . to complete their questionnaires. Census-takers will also turn to . tax and NHS records to try to fill in any gaps left by the online census . and to try to keep population estimates up to date during the 10-year . gap between each full-scale census. National Statistician Jil . Matheson said yesterday that Parliament will need to pass new . legislation to allow the use of publicly-held data for the census. She . said: ‘I recognise that this legislation, desirable as it is for . statistics and their users, requires understanding and support form an . informed general public, and appropriate safeguards to protect personal . privacy.’ The first national census was taken in 1801, propelled by . official fears of the risks of a population explosion, and the count has . been repeated every decade since, except in 1941. Questions over its . future were raised after 2001, when a poorly-organised census missed a . million people, but the 2011 exercise managed to draw returns from 94 . per cent of the population. Its successes included detecting half a . million Eastern European immigrants who moved to Britain after 2004 but . who had escaped the notice of other attempts to estimate the population. Cabinet . Office Minister Francis Maude has been anxious to win savings by . reforming the census. The 2011 census cost £500 million, but repeating . the paper exercise in 2021 would cost an estimated £1 billion. The first national census was taken in 1801, propelled by official fears of the risks of a population explosion, and the count has been repeated every decade since, except in 1941 . ONS officials indicated yesterday that they believe an on-line census can be brought in for £625 million. Miss . Matheson said: ‘The general public is ready to move to a fully on-line . census, as long as there is appropriate help and support for those who . cannot or will not go on-line.’ She said using administrative data alone . - using information from public databases like birth and death . registers, the electoral roll, NHS registers, school and university . lists, and benefit and tax records - had a high risk of failure. Such . information is mainly used to count the population in European countries . which have population registers and identity card schemes. The ONS . already use child benefit statistics and birth and death registers to . count population, Miss Matheson said. However, public records could not . be used to build up a reliable picture of, for example, the ethnicity of . the population.

Swathes of the South will be revelling in the sunshine all weekend, with temperatures soaring to 19C on Saturday and 20C on Sunday. The mild weather is another dramatic shift as, even today, parts of the North and Southwest were buried under a layer of snow. This snowfall is expected to continue, particularly the Dartmoor area, tomorrow, but will be thawing by the start of the weekend. A car battles through the frost on Dartmoor. Weather today and tomorrow is predicted to be chilly, despite forecasts for temperatures of up to 20C this weekend . Frost covering Princetown, Dartmoor. Wintry showers and hail storms have also been reported across the country in what could be the last gasp of the winter months . Snow has been settling on Dartmoor just days before the start of British Summer Time should mark the shift in seasons . As well as the higher temperatures in the South, caused by warm air blowing in from the continent and moving up the country, this Sunday marks the beginning of British Summer Time (BST), meaning the clocks move forward by one hour. As a result, sunset in the Southeast - which will enjoy the warmest evening - will not be until 7.31pm. The high of 20C on Sunday is twice the average for this time of year and will see the mercury rise higher here than in Athens, Greece or Algiers, Algeria and match, degree for degree, the temperature in Tehran, Iran. It will be twice as hot in southeast England as in Ankara, Turkey. Even hay fever sufferers will be able to enjoy the weather, with the pollen count peaking at a moderate level in central and southern England and remaining low across the rest of the country. UV levels will also remain low, peaking in the southeast, at midday on Saturday, at just three out of six. However, it won't be sunbathing weather for everyone as temperatures will be closer in the northern regions. The coldest area will be northern Scotland, particularly the Shetland Isles, where the Met Office predicts an optimistic high of 8C. The weather forecast for the next three days. Unsettled weather today and tomorrow will give way to a milder weekend, with temperatures peaking on Sunday . The sharp change in the weather is just another instance in a year of extremes for the British climate . While Dartmoor, pictured, is cold at the moment, it will have milder weather by Saturday. However, northern regions of the UK will be chilly throughout the weekend . A car navigates frosty roads near Widecombe-In-The-Moor in Devon. Next week should see temperatures settle into the teens with the possibility of showers . A last shot of winter has hit parts of Britain with a flurry of snow before temperatures are set to rise at the weekend. Parts of south west England received a dusting of white as well as higher ground on the Cumbrian and Northumberland border. Wintry showers and hail storms have also been reported across the country. Snow ploughs were seen clearing snow near Hartside Top Cafe, in Cumbria, which claims to be the highest cafe in England. Paul Knightley, forecast manager at MeteoGroup, said: 'There's been a covering of snow over Dartmoor, some in places in Scotland and other parts of high ground. 'Over the next few hours a few more showers of snow will continue towards the south west of England and a little bit for the Pennines too. Cumbria and Northumberland are two regions currently blanketed in snow, the North and Southwest will get more cold weather before it improves on the weekend . Temperatures this week have been average or just below for this time of year but this weekend will soar to twice what would be normally expected . The weather in Nenthead, on the Cumbria and Northumberland border, has been snowy and will get further light showers today and tomorrow . A terrier, Woody, plays with ponies in Dartmoor. The snow may be gone in a matter of days but people are making the best of it while they can . 'As we get towards the weekend there will be a change in the wind which will pull warm air from the continent and temperatures in London might get up to the 19 or 20 degrees.' 'Some areas will enjoy the warmer weather but there also will be exceptions. Further to the east and above the Humber area there be will a south east wind which will be chilly.' However, for the rest of the country, the reappearance of the sun means the chill will begin to melt away. Dan Williams from the Met Office . said: 'It is looking mainly dry, with a fair bit of cloud, but some . brighter spells in the far west, so parts of west Wales and southwestern . England on both Saturday and Sunday. 'After seeing a some slightly normal temperatures for this time of year - perhaps slightly cooler during this week - as of Saturday we should see temperatures get a bit of a bump up. 'We could see 19 or 20 maybe, perhaps . in the southeast of England, as we see warmer weather move up from the . continent, bringing slightly warmer temperatures than we have seen . recently. 'The average maximum temperature for this time of year . is about 10 degrees in England. But while temperatures will be a above . average, it is not unusual to see them rise above average.' However, . as the clocks go forward an hour on Sunday and we all lose some sleep, . the prospect of summer is not something all Britons can look forward to. Mr Williams warned that . northeastern and eastern parts of the UK will still feel the chill that . gripped much of the nation this week. He said: 'It will continue to feel fairly chilly and it will be colder in the northeast with some showers expected on Sunday.' However, he added that come Monday, most of the country will see temperatures in their mid-teens, despite the risk of some more rain. Scientists have discovered a shift in the seasons, with spring arriving early and autumn being delayed. Peter . Atkinson, professor of geography at the University of Southampton, has . examined satellite images of vegetation across the northern hemisphere . from the past 25 years and found signs that winter is becoming shorter. Earlier . this month, supermarkets Waitrose and Tesco both announced that English . strawberries were ripening early and hitting the shelves a week earlier . than last year. Professor . Atkinson said: 'There is much speculation about whether our seasons are . changing and if so, whether this is linked to climate change. Our study . is another significant piece in the puzzle, which may ultimately answer . this question.' The . researchers examined a range of vegetation types with forests which . have not been affected by human intervention acting as the best . signifier for the changing seasons. The . most pronounced change found by the researchers was in the broad-leaved . deciduous and needle-leaved deciduous forest groups, showing that . autumn is becoming significantly later with an early onset of spring. Professor . Atkinson said: 'Previous studies have reported trends in the start of . spring and end of autumn, but we have studied a longer time period and . controlled for forest loss and vegetation type, making our study more . rigorous and with a greater degree of accuracy. 'Our . research shows that even when we control for land cover changes across . the globe, a changing climate is significantly altering the vegetation . growth cycles for certain types of vegetation. Such changes may have . consequences for the sustainability of the plants themselves, as well as . species which depend on them, and ultimately the climate through . changes to the carbon cycle.'

"By . John Hall . David Beckham and other members of Manchester United's famous 'Class of '92' squad are poised to front a £2billion takeover of the club, it has been claimed. The takeover is believed to be funded by the oil-rich Qatari royal family and brokered by Beckham - who spent several months playing for Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain before retiring last season. Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt are said to be in detailed talks to become the frontmen of a multi-billion consortium hoping to buy a 90 per cent stake in the club from Americans Joel and Avram Glazer, who purchased Manchester United in 2005. The claims, made in The Sun today, have not been confirmed by the former players and a spokesman for the club said it had not received any bids. Scroll down for video . Stars: (From left): Manchester United legends Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and David Beckham. The players are said to be in detailed talks to front a multi-billion pound takeover of the club . Shares in Manchester United rose by $16.14 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday amid speculation over the prospective takeover bid. The club is currently valued at $2.6 billion, equal to £1.6 billion, despite having one of their worst seasons in living memory - including losing 3-0 to local rivals Manchester City on Tuesday. The club's underachievement this season has seen players past and present complain publicly about the way the club is performing. Following the defeat to Manchester City, striker Wayne Rooney admitted that rivals are no longer afraid of coming to Old Trafford anymore because United are simply not good enough. Rooney was left to reflect on another poor performance after admitting the team had lost their Old Trafford 'fear factor'. Owners: The 'Class of '92' stars are said to be hoping to buy a 90 per cent stake in the club from Americans Joel and Avram Glazer (pictured), who purchased Manchester United in 2005 . Shares in Manchester United rose by $16.14 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday amid speculation over a prospective takeover bid by the 'Class of '92' stars . The players involved in the alleged takeover bid were all members of Manchester United's 1992 youth team. They include Gary Neville (back row, second from left), Nicky Butt (back row, second from right), David Beckham (bottom row, second from left) and Paul Scholes (bottom row, second from right) Legends: Ryan Giggs (left) and Phil Neville (right) are another two Manchester United stars linked to the bid. Both were considered members of the club's famous 'Class of '92' Many Manchester United fans have been unhappy with the ownership of the Glazer family since they purchased a controlling stake in the club for £810million in 2005. The initial protests came as a result of the takeover itself, as the Glazers performed a highly leveraged buyout - effectively dumping £525million debt on the club overnight. Manchester United's board had earlier branded the Glazer family's plans 'aggressive'. Debt: The Glazer family (Avram left and Joel right) performed a highly leveraged takeover of Manchester United - effectively dumping £525million debt on the club overnight . Although they paid £270million from their own funds, the rest of the money used to purchase Manchester United came in the form of loans - the majority of which were secured against the club's assets -  which have since incurred interest payments of more than £60million a year. In the four years up to June 2009, when Manchester United last published their accounts - the club became liable to pay more than £325million in interest alone, not including interest not paid. This increased the debt the Glazers loaded on to the club to about £700million. Many supporters felt the Glazer family - who also own the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers - had taken a great risk in their financial dealings. Fans accused them of using Manchester United purely for financial gain and to remove debt from their US-business interests, adding that they had failed to understand the significance of owning one of the most successful and best supported clubs in the world. The Glazers have always denied this to be the case. Unpopular: Supporter groups have taken to wearing green and gold in protest at Glazer ownership. The colours were originally worn by Newton Heath FC, who changed their name to Manchester United in 1902 . As a result of the anger, from 2009 supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold - the colours of Newton Heath FC - which was the original name for Manchester United. The protest was seen as a way to remind the Glazers of the long history of the club and to remind them there was more at stake than money. Green and gold scarves and hats have become a symbol of resistance against the Glazers ever since, and remain a common sight at the club's 76,000-seater stadium Old Trafford. Troubled: The tactics used by David Moyes (pictured) have led to fan and even player unrest at United . Just over a week after describing . their 3-0 defeat by arch-rivals Liverpool as one of the worst days he . had ever had in football, the England international found himself trying . to explain a similar scoreline at home to neighbours City. The poor performance has led to rumours the club's owners may be happy to walk away. 'The Glazers have lost interest. Everyone knows the club is effectively up for sale,' a source told The Sun. Middle Eastern bidders have reportedly approached the Glazers several times about a prospective takeover, with the only sticking point on each occasion being the price, the newspaper reported. In 2010 the club were subject to a takeover bid . from a local group dubbed the Red Knights, but they also failed because they couldn't meet the Glazers' asking price. Earlier this week Paul Scholes gave credence to rumours of discontent at the club when he gave a scathing review of current manager David Moyes during an appearance on Sky Sports. Despite saying the club needs to stick by Moyes, Scholes was highly critical of the current crop of players and the tactics being deployed in the post Sir Alex Ferguson-era. Lost interest? There is speculation the Glazer family (Avram pictured centre) are ready to sell the club .

Protect: Stewards were seen guarding a banner declaring David Moyes 'The Chosen One' from angry fans after United's defeat to Manchester City on Tuesday . Despite rumours that the 'Class of '92' players may be involved . in the purchase of Manchester United, Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs are . also said to be close to purchasing Salford City FC. In a move that may see the club renamed Salford 92 and Paul Scholes appointed manager, the club are believed to be aiming for Championship-level football within 15 years. A . spokesperson for Manchester United said: 'We haven't received any bids . for the club. If we had we would have informed the New York Stock . Exchange.' Ryan Giggs, 40 . Giggs was the first of the so-called Class of '92 to break into the Manchester United first team, and is the only member still playing professional football. Now a player/coach under David Moyes at United - the club at which he has spent his entire career - Giggs signed a reported £80,000-a-week contract last year that will expire this summer. With an estimated total wealth of £34million, Giggs is the co-owner of GG Hospitality - a hotel and restaurant management company which he set up with Gary Neville. Gary Neville, 39 . Neville retired from football in 2011 after making 400 appearances for Manchester United. He joined Sky Sports at the start of the 2011–12 season, taking over as match analyst on Monday Night Football from Andy Gray to much acclaim. A year after taking the job, Neville was appointed assistant manger to Roy Hodgson with the England national team. Worth about £20million, Neville is understood to have a growing property portfolio alongside his business interests, which includes the aforementioned GG Hospitality business he set up with Ryan Giggs. Phil Neville, 37 . Gary Neville's younger brother Phil retired as captain of Everton at the end of last season. Despite speculation he may join his brother in the coaching setup, Phil was appointed as Manchester United First Team Coach under David Moyes in time for the start of this season. Phil Neville has raised over £20million for the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital where his daughter has been treated for her cerebral palsy. Nicky Butt, 39 . Although a dynamic defensive midfield player, Nicky Butt's post-playing career has been reasonably unremarkable. Finishing his playing days in Hong Kong with South China FC, Butt took a year-long break before becoming a reserve team coach at Manchester United. Nicky Butt is estimated to be worth around £14million. Paul Scholes, 39 . A true legend of the Manchester United midfield, Paul Scholes first retired in 2011 before returning a year later to help Sir Alex Ferguson to lift the Premier League title. Retiring alongside the only manager he ever played under, 'shy' Scholes has made limited television and radio appearances as a pundit and is understood to be keen to get into coaching and eventually management. If the Salford FC takeover goes ahead, Scholes is rumoured to become the team's manager. David Beckham, 38 . Without doubt the most high profile of the Class of '92, Beckham played for many of the world's biggest clubs - including AC Milan and Real Madrid - before finishing his playing career at Paris Saint-Germain. Worth £165million - much of which has been accrued through endorsements - Beckham has been among the top earners at every club he has played for. David Beckham's wife Victoria is a successful pop star and clothing designer in her own right, with the fashion company they co-own - Beckham Ventures Ltd - declaring a turnover of £15.4 million in 2012. Earlier this year Beckham announced that he was a prominent stakeholder in a proposed £15million Miami MLS franchise - which would ensure he will be a major figure in US soccer for many years to come.","Manchester United stars said to be involved in multi-billion pound takeover .
