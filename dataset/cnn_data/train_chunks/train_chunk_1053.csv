"It might come as a surprise to those struggling to comprehend accents from Glasgow, Newcastle or parts of London but the Birmingham accent really is the hardest one to get your tongue around. But, say authors and language experts David and Ben Crystal, there are some bonuses in being from Birmingham. While the accent might not be the most popular at home, it sounds positively mellifluous to those hailing from foreign climes. Now the pair have penned a book in which they decode the mysteries of the British accent - and some of it is nothing short of eye-opening... Baffling: The stars of BBC drama Peaky Blinders needed extra help to master the tricky Birmingham accent . Some accents are harder to imitate than others, and the Brummie accent is one of the hardest - but with some strong competition from Geordie. Of course, difficulty is relative. It depends where you're coming from. A five-year-old growing up in Birmingham will have mastered the accent with no trouble at all. But if you compare it to Received Pronunciation - the British prestige accent used by the Queen, and the traditional voice of the BBC - it's easy to see why Brummie is felt to be tricky. When you notice a regional accent, what you're chiefly noticing are the way people pronounce their long vowels (in words like see, saw, and sue) and diphthongs (in words like say, so, sow, soy, and sigh). Appreciated: As Ozzy Osbourne and Cat Deeley have found, the Brummie accent gets a big welcome abroad . English has quite a few of these, and the more an accent sounds them differently from the way you speak, the more difficulty you'll have in 'picking up' that accent. Some accents will be very close to your own, so you would have only a few features to learn. But Birmingham and Geordie are two that - compared with Received Pronunciation - have lots of really noticeable differences, such as these three: . • The diphthong in words like float has a much more open onset, so that it sounds more like RP flout. • The diphthong in words like nice begins with a back and rounded quality, so that it sounds like ‘noice’. • The diphthong in words like loud begins with a front and higher quality, so that it sounds more like ‘le-ood’. No wonder actress Helen McCrory looked for help while working on the first series of Peaky Blinders, asking a Birmingham-born actress for guidance about her accent. No bar to office: Neville Chamberlain, who was Prime Minister between 1937 and 1940, had a Brummie accent . BRUMMIE ACCENTS ARE LOVED ABROAD . In Britain, during the 20th century, thanks to the way it was portrayed on radio and television, the Brummie accent picked up all kinds of negative atitudes. But abroad, it's perceived in a very different way. Once, in a summer school for foreign learners of English, I played the students a dozen British accents and asked them to rate them for beauty. Brummie came top. More evidence: Not long ago, a nightclub owner in Israel advertised in Birmingham's Sunday Mercury for staff to come and work in his club during the winter months. The owner said: 'I love the accent, and nightclub-goers can't get enough of it over here. I believe you can go a long way if you can speak the Birmingham way'. And he concludes: 'I've heard enough holiday-makers from the region to know it's the best accent by far'. RECEIVED PRONUNCIATION HASN'T BEEN AROUND VERY LONG . Received Pronunciation is only around 200 years old. It emerged towards the end of the 18th century as an upper-class accent, and soon became the voice of the public schools, the civil service, and the British Empire. When the BBC began broadcasting, in the 1920's, its founder, Lord Reith (a Scot) opted for RP as the BBC's voice on the grounds that it would be the most widely understood. BRITAIN HAS MORE ACCENTS THAN ANYWHERE ELSE . There are more accents per square mile in Britain than in any other part of the English-speaking world. This is because of the hugely diverse history of English in the British Isles, with the originally Germanic dialects of Europe mixing with the Norse accents of the Vikings, the French accents of the Normans, and wave after wave of immigration from the Middle Ages down to the present day. But it's also because of the rise of 'mixed' accents, as people move house around the country and pick up features of the accent wherever they find themselves. WE ALL HAVE MORE THAN ONE ACCENT . Everyone has more than one accent. Our pronunciation changes subtly depending on who we're talking to and how we get on with them. Linguists call it 'accommodation'. Some people have a natural flair for picking up accents, but everyone does it to some extent. Unconsciously, of course. You only notice you've done it when someone asks 'Are you from round here?' and you can't think of a satisfactory reply. BRITISH IS NO LONGER THE ONLY 'ENGLISH' ACCENT . There are now far more English accents outside the British Isles than within. Accents express the identity of a community, so in every country that English has come to be used - and that means everywhere - a new accent has evolved. And when you think that there are over two billion people speaking English now, that's a lot of accents.","The Birmingham accent sounds positively mellifluous to non-Britons .

"A protester in Ferguson was arrested during a demonstration on Thursday night - and live-tweeted her entire experience. Brittany Ferrell, a nursing student at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis, was one of 13 people detained by officers in the conflicted Missouri city for 'noise disruption'. The detention has sparked an investigation by the American Civil Liberties Union as lawyers accuse officers of overstretching their powers. Scroll down for video . Arrested: This is Brittany Ferrell, the nursing student and protester who live-tweeted her arrest in Ferguson . Tweeting in handcuffs, she then took her thousands of followers through the uncertain few hours before the nine women and four men eventually learned what they had done wrong and managed to secure their release. She started with the tweet: 'We are all arrested', apparently referring to herself an other members of the advocacy group Millenial Activists United. 'Tweeting while cuffed,' she wrote, adding: 'We were arrested while on the side walk by the way'. According to her Twitter feed, she was piled into a wagon with seven other people and not told where they were going. Enraged, she then reported the reason the group was arrested: 'They said we violated the ""noise"" ordinance"" it's been 50+ days... NOW they effort a noise ordinance. Bull****'. The group started chanting 'no justice, no peace!' in the back of the wagon. 'They think it's a game,' she said. 'Noise disruption': Ms Ferrell was one of 13 people from the advocacy group Millennial Activists United who were arrested on the side walk during a demonstration (pictured) on Thursday following Michael Brown's death . Her followers informed her clergy were en route to the prison to offer support. Arriving at St Ann Police Station, they were dressed in orange jumpsuits, placed in a cell and 'treated like criminals', while officers said the bail would be doubled for anyone who had been arrested before. Ms Ferrell's bail was set at $2,300, she said. More than three hours after the arrest they were informed they would be released before the night was over, but Ms Ferrell said: 'no one can give us clear answers on anything though. aside from the fact that we will be out and that people are working on it now.' She added: 'Again, all 13 of us are still in jail,' tweeting pictures of the four men and eight women she was sat with. Around an hour later, after crowds swarmed around the police station, the group was released. Local media reported protesters lay on the ground around the arrestees' cars to stop them from being towed. Many of the jail bonds were waived, according to the Argus Streaming News account on Twitter, but not for all. Later, Ms Ferrell told her followers: 'They straight criminalized us. made us stand in a cage. asked us if they turned their backs would we cause trouble. we are protestors!' 'The way we've been treated you would think WE are murderers, con artists, robbers. the mentality of the officers that handled us was insane.' Tony Rothert, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union office in St. Louis, said several complaints have been lodged about Thursday's arrests and the ACLU is investigating. 'There do appear to be, if not bogus, at least unnecessary arrests,' said Rothert, who had no details about why the protesters were arrested. He also questioned why they'd be jailed on a 24-hour hold. 'Holding people unnecessarily long, arresting them when it's not necessary — that's an indication of overreach,' Rothert said. 'It certainly appears that the purpose is to discourage people from coming to Ferguson to protest.' Released: The nine women and four men celebrated as they were released and uncuffed hours later . Investigation: Lawyers will now launch an investigation into unnecessary arrests made by Ferguson police . Conflict: Last week, the police department was condemned by the Department of Justice for refusing to effect change as it emerged numerous officers were still not wearing identification or covering their badges . Hundreds of people have been arrested during nearly two months of protests in Ferguson, including journalists and clergy members. The incident comes amid volatile outbursts in the city, where citizens and the Department of Justice are accusing police of failing to take action to repair racial divides. In a letter to the Ferguson Police Department (FPD) last Tuesday, the department said its own investigators have spotted officers without name tags and refusing to identify themselves to members of the public. The practise violates FPD rules, the department pointed out, and is illegal in many states. It added: 'The failure to wear name plates conveys a message to community members that, through anonymity, officers may seek to act with impunity'. Just days later the letter was followed by a second on Friday, as it emerged the first one had been ignored. 'It further was reported to us that some officers affirmatively displaying these bracelets had black tape over their name plates. 'The practice of not wearing, or obscuring, name plates violates your own department's policies, which we advised you earlier this week when we requested that you end the practice imrnediately.' The second letter also addressed the news that officers were sporting 'I Am Darren Wilson' bracelets in an apparent show of solidarity to the man that shot Michael Brown.","Brittany Ferrell, nursing student, was arrested with 12 people on Thursday .

"A mother walked into her 28-year-old son's bedroom to find his boyfriend's dead body wrapped in plastic on his bed, police have said. The unnamed woman had just returned from work when she went into her son Jermaine Jackson's basement room at their home in Baltimore, Maryland, on Saturday. There, she discovered the body of Jackson 's partner Andre Nicholas, also 28, lying in swathes of green plastic. She called the police and Mr Nicholas was confirmed dead from 'multiple stabbings'. Couple: Jermaine Jackson (left) has been charged with the murder of his boyfriend Andre Nicholas (right) Now, Jackson has been arrested on charges of first and second-degree murder and first and second-degree assault, as well as dangerous weapon charges. According to court documents, Jackson's mother left him and Mr Nicholas, both of whom lived with their parents, in the basement in the 2500 block of Garret Avenue while she went to work. However, when she returned at around 9pm that evening, her son allegedly came upstairs and told her to gather all of her 'important papers' together because they had to leave. When she asked why, Jackson replied that there was a dead body in his bed, police wrote in court papers obtained by The Baltimore Sun. Alleged murder: Jackson's mother had just returned from work when she went into her son's bedroom at their home in Baltimore, Maryland, and found the body of Mr Nicholas. Above, Jackson (right) and Mr Nicholas . Scene: Mr Nicholas's body was wrapped in plastic at the house in the 2500 block of Garret Avenue (above) He then reportedly went on to say he had choked and stabbed Mr Nicholas 'because the victim wanted him to do something he didn't want to do,' although it was not clear what this was. Jackson's mother then ventured into his bedroom and discovered 'what she believed to be a body wrapped in plastic on the defendants bed', police said. It was later confirmed to be Mr Nicholas. Mark McLaurin, a friend of Mr Nicholas, said the victim and Jackson had been in a relationship for more than a year, and had appeared happy together. He told the newspaper: 'They had their ups and downs, but I really am shocked by this,"" McLaurin said. ""In my estimation, they really did love each other.' Victim: Jackson reportedly told his mother he had choked and stabbed Mr Nicholas (left and right) 'because the victim wanted him to do something he didn't want to do,' although it was not clear what this was . He added that Mr Nicholas was well-known in the area's gay community, worked at Club Bunns on Lexington Street and volunteered with various political campaigns. 'He was an incredible presence in the community,' he said. 'I honestly don't know people who were better known than him and so universally well-liked.' At around 4pm today, two days after the alleged murder, an image showing a large object wrapped in plastic on a basement floor was posted to the Facebook page of Jackson while he was in jail. Employer: Mark McLaurin, a friend of Mr Nicholas, said the victim was well-known in the area's gay community, worked at Club Bunns (pictured) on Lexington Street and volunteered with various political campaigns . Baltimore police are investigating how and by whom the picture - which could be an image of Mr Nicholas's body in Jackson's bedroom - was uploaded. Detective Jeremy Silbert told the newspaper that police 'are certain that the suspect does not have access to his cellular phone in jail.' The disturbing photo was later removed. Jackson, who has previously been arrested on charges of theft, burglary and violating protective orders, remains at Central Booking without bond. He has no listed attorney.","Mother went into son Jermaine Jackson's room after returning from work .

"The mummified remains of a stroke victim who went missing from his hospital bed three years ago have been found in a store cupboard just metres from his room. Primo Zanoli, 65, was being treated at Baggiovara Hospital in Modena, Italy, when he disappeared on New Year's Eve in 2011 and was never seen again. Italian media reports have said the family have never stopped looking for Mr Zanoli. Friends even set up a Facebook page called 'Don't Forget Primo Zanoli' but had not had a single response to their pleas for information about what happened.

"The median household income for Americans living in Washington DC in 2013 was $66,583. But according to a new graph, you would have to earn $688,000 a year in order to be considered among the top 1 percent of earners in the state. Business Insider have used the 2012 American Community Survey to calculate how much a household would have to make in order to be considered among the elite of their state. While some business pundits say the results are surprisingly low, given the amount of billionaires living in the United States, the map illustrates a giant gap between the rich and middle-class America. Do you qualify? This map, put together by Business Insider using figures from the the 2012 American Community Survey, estimates what residents of each state would have to earn in order to be considered among the top 1 percent. Washington D.C. topped the list with $688,000, while Idaho came in at the bottom, with their elite needed at least $274,000 . Washington D.C. topped the estimates. Other cities on the east coast also proved to earn big, with Connecticut coming in at $642,000 and New York $511,000. The west coast calculated slightly lower, with California's upper echelons earning at least $433,000. Further up, oil rich North Dakota came in at an impressive $455,000, one of the highest in the country. Down south, states like Texas and Louisiana came in much lower, with $391,000 and $335,000 respectively. The lowest of the high earners were found in Idaho, where residents earning $274,000 made the top 1 percent. Despite the calculations, New York accounts for nearly one-quarter of all the wealth of all 'high net worth individuals' in the US, according to Vox. That's more like it: The Census Bureau reported earlier this month that the median household income in 2013 was $51,939 . The average U.S. one-percenter would have to earn at least $368,549 using the figures on the map, according to The Houston Chronicle. However Business Insider stressed the figures should be taken as estimates.","Map calculated by Business Insider using figures from the recently-released 2012 American Community Survey .

"With her latest album on course to achieve record-breaking first week sales, Taylor Swift has removed her entire back catalog from the popular music-streaming service Spotify. While the 24-year-old singer underwent a promotional frenzy last week to promote the release of her fifth album, one place where fans couldn't hear 1989 was on Spotify. Now the singer has gone even further and removed all her songs including current single Shake It Off, which had been the most streamed track on the service in the U.S., the U.K. and globally. Scroll down for video . Taylor Swift has removed her entire back catalog from the popular music-streaming service Spotify - just as her record label boss is attempting to sell his business . In a statement posted on Spotify’s website, the company said it was trying to get the hit maker to change her mind. ‘We love Taylor Swift, and our more than 40 million users love her even more – nearly 16 million of them have played her songs in the last 30 days, and she’s on over 19 million playlists. ‘We hope she’ll change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone. 'We believe fans should be able to listen to music wherever and whenever they want, and that artists have an absolute right to be paid for their work and protected from piracy. 'That’s why we pay nearly 70 percent of our revenue back to the music community.' The decision may have been instigated by Swift's record label, reports Billboard. Big Machine Label Group is up for sale and a source said the decision to leave Spotify was aimed at driving up the sales price. New album 1989, which wasn't available on Spotify, looks set to earn the largest first week sales of any album since Eminem in 2002 . 'Big Machine is in the process of selling itself, and that can't be forgotten here. [They're looking to] increase the multiple for the sale of that company. [Owner] Scott Borchetta is a very old-school thinker. He's wrong,' said the source. It isn't unusual for major artists to wait a while before releasing new material to the streaming service - Coldplay, The Black Keys and Beyoncé have all withheld their latest albums in a bid to encourage greater first week physical sales. Swift's last album, Red, didn't make it onto Spotify until eight months after it was first launched. More unusual is the singer's decision to remove her back catalog from the service, while her older albums currently remain available on rival Beats Music, which is owned by Apple. In the past Spotify has drawn criticism from some artists who claim it doesn't pay them enough in royalties. Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke withdrew his project Atoms for Peace from Spotify in 2013 and launched an angry Twitter tirade over its royalty rates. 'Make no mistake new artists you discover on #Spotify will no get paid,' he posted. 'Meanwhile shareholders will shortly being rolling in it. Simples.' According to the latest Spotify figures, the service has ten million paying customers and 30 million free users. The 24-year-old singer underwent a promotional frenzy last week to promote the release of her fifth album 1989 - including this appearance on The Talk . According to Billboard, 1989 is on course to beat Britney Spears' record sales week for a woman. In 2000, Britney sold 1.319 million copies of Oops! …I Did It Again according to Nielsen SoundScan. Industry forecasters predict Swift could have sold over 1.3 million copies by November 2. Billboard reveals that 1989 is also set to earn the largest sales week for any album since 2002, when Eminem's The Eminem Show sold 1.322 million in its first full week on sale. All will be revealed on November 5, when the album's official debut week sales figure, as formulated by SoundScan, will be announced. The album will be Swift's third consecutive album to sell more than a million copies in its first week, making her the only act ever to earn three million-selling weeks. The Seven-time GRAMMY winner announced The 1989 World Tour on Good Morning America, which will kick off on 20 May, 2015 in Louisiana, USA. The 1989 World Tour will encompass eight countries and span four continents including North America, Europe, Australia and Asia.

"Czech President Milos Zeman launched a foul-mouthed tirade against Russian protest group Pussy Riot during a bizarre radio interview. The 70-year-old leader described the band, who regularly protest against Vladimir Putin as 'f****d up' and 's****'. Swearing in both English and Czech, Zeman asked the interviewer: 'You know what pussy means in English?' He then translated the word into the Czech for c***, leading to dozens of complaints. Czech President Milos Zeman, pictured, swore repeatedly during a recent radio interview in Prague . President Zeman used a wide vocabulary of swear words during the weekly interview with state radio . Zeman used his radio interview to claim that Pussy Riot, who were jailed in Russia because of their outspoken views, are not his idea of political prisoners. He pointed out the band uses vulgar language in its songs. Czech prime minister, Bohuslav Sobotka condemned Zeman's interview as undermining the nation's credibility abroad, AFP reported. He said: 'The president should not speak in such a way as it damages the reputation of the presidency, sets a bad example and does nothing for our reputation abroad.' It is understood the Czech state media watchdog received hundreds of complaints about the controversial interview, which took place on Sunday. During a recent visit to Beijing, President Zeman, pictured, said he thought Taiwan was part of China . Zeman was criticised during a recent trip to Beijing when he said Taiwan was part of China. The territory considers itself a separate nation from China, though Beijing insists the island is a rogue province. The standoff is a raw diplomatic nerve around the world. The centre-left politician denied claims he had attended a public function earlier while under the influence of alcohol, instead blaming his poor performance on that occasion on flu. So far, Zeman has refused to apologise for any offence caused by his radio interview. According to the Telegraph, Czech Radio could face a fine of up to £281,000 if it is found to have put at risk 'the moral development of children' with the broadcast. However, Zeman's spokesman claimed the president was simply responding to his political opponents 'who tolerate such language'.","Milos Zeman was giving his weekly interview to Czech state radio on Sunday .

"Nearly two years after a banker who vanished was wrongly declared dead, he was sentenced Tuesday to 30 years in prison as he faced angry investors who lost millions of dollars entrusted to the former preacher who turned his persuasive powers into a career as an investment adviser. Aubrey Lee Price, 48, fled southeast Georgia in summer 2012 after committing acts of fraud that consumed most of the $40 million he raised from 115 clients and left the small Montgomery Bank & Trust, where Price served as a bank director, depleted of its assets and reserves. The bank closed several weeks later. Price was captured alive in a traffic stop near the Georgia coast in December 2013 and months later pleaded guilty to three federal fraud counts, saying he lied to clients and gave them phony financial statements to cover his tracks as he lost their money in speculative trading and other high-risk investments. Contrast: Price, left, before his disappearance and right, after 18 months on the run living like a vagrant on the outskirts of the Florida town of Citra. He has now been jailed for 30 years . Back in court for sentencing Tuesday, Price gave a rambling 40-minute speech that blamed the bank's managers and others for financial losses that he said he tried to fix by making bad investments. Price sidestepped the year-and-a-half he spent as a fugitive and asked those he'd betrayed to trust him to get their money back. 'I understand the pain these people feel. I understand their bitterness and their anger,' Price said. 'In prison or wherever I am, I will find a way to make restitution for my debts.' Mary Jo Peters wasn't buying it. The former Delta Air Lines worker took the witness stand during Price's sentencing, saying she invested all her retirement savings with Price and lost every penny. After Price vanished, she sold her furniture, appliances, clothing and even plants in her yard in a desperate effort to avoid losing her home. Peters said she now works two jobs to pay her bills. 'I'm glad he's not out there able to do it to someone else,' said Peters, who declined to say how much money she invested with Price. 'But you don't feel any justice or closure, because I'm still struggling to make ends meet.' Caught: The banker was picked up on New Year's Eve during a routine traffic stop in Brunswick, Georgia, after cops cited him because the windows of his 2001 Dodge Ram truck were tinted too dark . Michael Smith, who recalled Price coming to dinner at his home and leading a prayer before each meal, said he lost more than $894,000. He applauded Judge B. Avant Edenfield's sentence as just, but added, 'I don't think we'll ever see a dime.' Price's sentence requires him to pay back investors as best he can, though the exact sum remains unclear. Prosecutors said Tuesday the latest estimate was more than $45 million. A federal receiver appointed by the courts to recoup assets says Price has been cooperating. The receiver reported July 30 that about $3.3 million had been collected, but that includes $1.8 million in life insurance payments that the insurers are trying to take back. Price insisted he's as broke as his former clients. Prosecutor Brian Rafferty said there's no evidence he pocketed any of his victims' money. 'The reason he's here is his own arrogance, his own pride prevented him from admitting, then or now, that he just wasn't very good' at investing, Rafferty said . Meanwhile, Price's wife and children sent letters to the judge asking for mercy, though none could explain his actions. When he vanished in June 2012, Price left his family and others long letters that strongly hinted he planned to commit suicide by drowning himself. He was last seen boarding a ferry in Florida. It was Price's wife who got a Florida judge to declare him dead in December 2012. The family he left behind: Betrayal: Rebekah and her four children have had to deal with the shame of his crimes, abuse from those he conned but  admits the kids are happy that their father is alive after all . Raid: Price raised $40million from more than 100 investors in Georgia and Florida through an unregistered investment fund that he managed . Web: Price allegedly forged bank documents to hide the millions of loses his investors suffered, so that they would continue giving him money . Spotted: This June 2012 file photo released by the FBI shows Aubrey Lee Price in Key West shortly before he disappeared . Green: Pot head: Marijuana plants were growing inside the rented home that Price was living in on the run. Over 200 plants were discovered in the home he rented in Georgia, after his arrest . Rebekah Price wrote that her husband of 23 years was dragged down by a deep depression in 2011, after he was involved in purchasing the Montgomery Bank & Trust. 'The strong, secure man that I knew became very fragile and emotional,' Price's wife wrote. '... I cannot explain why he made the choices he did, but I know that he was under more stress than anyone I had ever seen.' John Robert Anderson, a Baptist minister, said he first came to know Price as a talented youth pastor his church hired in 1989. Price told the judge it was a decade later that he became an investment adviser, though his family warned him dabbling with Wall Street would be 'the start of my road to hell.'","A former Georgia investment adviser who vanished after losing millions of clients' dollars and was mistakenly declared dead has been sentenced to 30 years in prison .

"A California-based trade group for the adult film industry has lifted a moratorium on production spurred by a feared HIV exposure on an out-of-state film set. The Free Speech Coalition (FSC) ended the five-day production hold Monday, saying in a statement that testing has been completed and 'the performer pool has not been compromised.' The group first called for a three-day moratorium that was extended through the weekend. Safe for work: The Free Speech Coalition  has lifted a moratorium on porn production spurred by a feared HIV exposure on an out-of-state film set . The group said in the statement 'A production hold was called when it was determined that a performer in the PASS [Performer Availability Screening Services] database might have been exposed to HIV in late September, after off-set contact with a performer from an out-of-state set that was not observing PASS protocols. 'We called a production hold while we conducted precautionary testing with that performer and anyone he or she performed with. All precautionary testing has been completed and there is a medical determination that the performer pool has not been compromised.' The organization didn't name the state where the film set was located. The group's head Diane Duke said she knows the lack of information provided in such cases is frustrating, but medical privacy is essential for performers. Though there was another production moratorium in August, the adult performer tested did not have the virus, the FSC said at the time.

A retired City banker who cheated churchgoers out of millions in a vast fraud told one victim over the phone: ‘God has told me to give you a ring.’ Over five years Patrick Coppeard collected nearly £5.4million, most of which he blew in online gambling while trying to make up for losses. When he finally handed himself into police and was asked how much he had left in his account, the former broker for investment bank Merrill Lynch replied: ‘Zip-a-dee-doo-dah.’ The married father of three, a former magistrate, has now been jailed for six years after admitting a single charge of fraud by abuse of position. He had already moved out of his £1.25million house in Loughton, Essex, and into a more modest home near Harlow. Victims, many left virtually penniless by the scam, complained yesterday that the sentence was ‘pathetic’. David Jacques, 53, a fellow member of St John’s Church in Buckhurst Hill, said he was phoned by Coppeard two days after selling his house. ‘He told me, “David, you may not believe this but God has asked me to give you a ring”,’ Mr Jacques said. ‘He guaranteed the money himself and offered me 6 per cent interest.’ The power-wash business owner invested £50,000 before ploughing another £283,000 into the bogus scheme. He added: ‘I’d known him for 20 years from church. I knew he was a financial man and a magistrate so I trusted him. I’m now saddled with a £33,000 credit card debt … I think the sentence is pathetic for what he’s done.’ Another victim, former next-door neighbour Rob Smith, 50, said Coppeard had been one of his closest friends before the ‘immense betrayal’. ‘We thought we were investing into a share trading club and Patrick was handling it on our behalf due to his experience as a stockbroker,’ he said. The retired business owner added: ‘He had all the credentials – magistrate, church warden, successful stockbroker … That’s why people trusted him.’ Coppeard retired from Merrill Lynch in 2000 due to kidney disease and got into financial trouble after losing £1million of his own money following the banking collapse of 2007. Many of his victims were parishioners at St John's Church in Buckhurst Hill, Essex - the same church that hosted the funeral of reality TV star Jade Goody in 2009 . Coppeard has since moved out of his £1.25 million six-bedroom house in Loughton, Essex, (above) to a more modest property on the outskirts of Harlow, Essex . David Jaques, one of Coppeard's victims, was told that 'God has told me to give you a ring' when he started looking for an investment . In a bid to recover his position he began persuading people to hand over money which he used for spread betting and online gambling. The huge fraud, known as a Ponzi scheme, ran from January 2008 to May last year and took in the church and 61 individuals, who handed over a total of £5,356,497, of which £3,382,000 was lost. Coppeard, who resigned as a magistrate last year, managed to keep the scheme afloat by making occasional payouts to some investors. Days before handing himself in to police, in May last year, he was telling some victims he could double their money in days. Peter Gair, prosecuting, told Chelmsford Crown Court Coppeard ‘effectively jumped before he was pushed’, adding: ‘In recent weeks and days he was being chased by a number of his victims for payment.’ Victims are likely to receive just 10p for every pound invested when a proceeds of crime hearing takes place next year, the court heard. Coppeard’s wife, Irene, 53, is understood to be standing by him. Judge Anthony Goldstaub told Coppeard: ‘You attempted to square the circle in a dead market by spread betting and [online] casino gambling. This was always bound to fail – the house having the benefit of the odds. ‘Upon the good work you did and your excellence of character you constructed a web of financial deceit … you trapped a mass of trusting and vulnerable people … [who] believed in you and you brought them to financial ruin.’ Detective Constable John Vickers said: ‘Coppeard preyed on his closest friends and family for his own gain. He has devastated the lives of a considerable number of people.’ A spokesman for St John’s Church said members were ‘distressed’ to see a fellow Christian in such a ‘predicament’.","Patrick Coppeard, 49, conned 62 people out of millions in Ponzi-style scam .

"Ronald Koeman will ask Southampton's board for January transfer reinforcements to boost his side's chances of staying the Premier League's top-four course. Boss Koeman has admitted Saints have 'a long way to go' to learn how to handle life at the Premier League's sharp end. The former Holland defender will target seasoned campaigners who know how to secure Champions League football if handed a sizeable January transfer kitty. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman will ask the board to sign players in January . Southampton surrendered second place in the Premier League after losing 3-0 to Manchester City . Koeman is determined to bolster Southampton's strength and depth, admitting the St Mary's club lag behind traditional Premier League powers in squad size. 'I will speak to the board of the club, about what we need and what we would like to do,' said Koeman. 'This is the hardest league (in the world) because you can lose against everybody. 'You have to be prepared every game and you can't play on 70 per cent. 'You have to be 100 per cent and that's difficult for us, because we need everybody. 'Everybody needs to be fit and we don't have the numbers and players that the big teams have, and that's difficult.' Adam Lallana (left) was one of several high-profile players to leave Southampton in the summer . The early season's great success story, Saints face a daunting December run of seven games in 25 days, Wednesday's trip to Arsenal preceding clashes with Manchester United, Everton and Chelsea. Saints surrendered second spot to Manchester City on Sunday, with Yaya Toure, Frank Lampard and Gael Clichy completing a routine 3-0 win for Manuel Pellegrini's men. Manager Mauricio Pochettino's summer departure to Spurs sparked a player drain of top talent that had all and sundry tipping Saints to struggle for survival. Instead new boss Koeman has recruited wisely, shaken off those pre-season fears and guided Saints to even greater heights. Now the former Barcelona star has called on Saints to cast aside disappointment after Sunday's loss to City, to adapt quickly to life at the Premier League's sharp end. 'We can talk about how to handle it all, we can show them clips from games for example, but finally that is for the player by himself to change and to learn off that, and we speak about that,' said Koeman. Saints striker Graziano Pelle (centre) has been one of the bargain buys of the season . 'The club doesn't have the experience of other teams. 'The players don't have that experience that the players of the big teams have, that's the difference. 'We'd like to be that: the club likes to be where we are and everybody wants to keep that position. 'That's difficult, because we have different players. 'We have younger players and we don't have that experience. 'That's always important to stay at the top, that's what we are working towards, but it's a long way to go. 'In the summer the first question was 'what about relegation', then two months later it was 'how about the Champions League'. 'Now people ask 'will you slip down', and that's understandable, that's football life. 'It means a lot to the start of our season, how other teams are looking at us. The Dutchman wants Southampton to buy some more experienced players to support his youngsters . 'They realise it's difficult to beat Southampton. 'We will not be nervous after Sunday's result, or nervous to be high in the table: situations are always changing so fast in football.

"The judge who sentenced British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford to death for drug-smuggling has died unexpectedly at the age of 55. Amser Simanjuntak, a senior official in Bali, was known to be extremely keen on the death penalty - meaning that Sandiford could have escaped with a lesser punishment if her trial had been delayed. He was found dead at his home on Friday after suffering a suspected heart attack, three months after sentenced the Briton to be executed by firing squad. Scroll down for video . In prison: Lindsay Sandiford is awaiting execution in a jail cell in Bali after being sentenced to death . Legal sources said that the Denpasar District Court judge had a reputation for issuing unexpectedly severe sentences in high-profile trials. Therefore, if Sandiford's trial had not taken place until after his death, she would probably have received a more lenient sentence from a different judge. Just three days before his death, Mr Simanjuntak told Bali Daily that his decision to ignore the 15-year prison sentence recommended by the prosecution was based on the evidence against the 56-year-old British woman. 'She was trying to smuggle a lot of drugs into Bali,' he said of the 11lb of cocaine she was caught with at the airport. 'I thought that the sentence was appropriate with what she had done. 'Drug smuggling is a crime that has a huge impact on the people here in our country. That's why I committed to give a heavy sentence to any drug smuggler.' Distraught: The British grandmother wept after she was sentenced in a court in Bali in January . Three other Britons who Sandiford said were involved in the smuggling attempt received sentences ranging from just one year to six years. She said at the weekend that she would prefer to be shot sooner rather than wait for many months as her appeal process drags on. During his long career on the bench, the judge delivered numerous controversial death sentences and issued many severe verdicts. Last November, he served on a panel of judges that issued a surprise ruling which sentenced to death a husband and wife for the murder of their employers. Smuggling: Sandiford was caught with 11lb of cocaine at the local airport in May last year . While serving in central Java between 2004 and 2008 he handed down his first death sentence after finding a man guilty of murdering a son of a local Muslim leader. The father of four lived alone at the Bali court's housing complex while his wife and children continued to live in the city of Yogyakarta. Police said initial investigations following the discovery of the judge's body in his home had failed to find any evidence of foul play. His family are understood to have refused a full autopsy.","Amser Simanjuntak gave Lindsay Sandiford death sentence in January .

"A Tasmanian devil was mysteriously found dead and may have been murdered at a New Mexico zoo this week. Zookeepers at Albuquerque BioPark Zoo were aghast when they found Jasper the Tasmanian devil lying on the ground in a puddle of his own blood when they went to care for him on Wednesday morning. Fox reports that Jasper was last seen alive on Tuesday afternoon. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Likely murdered: Jasper (not pictured) was discovered dead on Wednesday morning in a puddle of his own blood after it appears he was hit by a heavy piece of asphalt . Disappearing: A rare form of cancer is killing off the Tasmanian devils in Australia  so wildlife workers are trying to keep breeding the animals to keep them alive . Police are investigating the incident and believe that someone might have thrown a giant piece of asphalt at Jasper causing him to fracture his skull. If caught, the suspect could serve jail time for animal cruelty. Jasper was one of about 600 Tasmanian devils alive in captivity today. Zoo Director Rick Janser told Fox that a rare form of cancer is killing of the devil population on Tasmania in an Island off the coast of Australia. In New Mexico Jasper died of an unnatural cause, not cancer, that is likely foul play. 'It looks like there was a malicious intent and essentially our poor Tasmanian devil was killed, intentionally, by what seems to be blunt force trauma to the head,' Gilbert Montano, Mayor Richard Berry’s Chief of Staff, told KRQE-TV on Friday. Mysteriously Killed: Jasper was merely resting in his den when an unidentified suspect allegedly hit it with a giant and heavy piece of asphalt . Montano told reporters that one of the reasons they were keeping Tasmanian devils is to create a breeding ground. 'The whole idea to have the animals here was to create a breeding ground,' Montano told News. 'We have all the nucleus in place to receive breeding population,'said Janser. 'I don’t think this will impact it, but we need to look at our exhibits and know what happened.' Because the Tasmanian is from Australia, the zoo will need to notify the Australian government. 'This is the first time we’ve had an accident that’s taken the life of an Australian animal,'said Janser to KRQE. Visitors at the zoo are permitted to get a few feet away from the creatures. Surveillance footage of the zoo shows two boys and a man leaving the animal's enclosure at around 4:30 p.m. Police do not know the identity of the men spotted on film but they will continue to search fro suspects.

'I bought a ticket and sure enough we got on a flight,' he said. 'We had to circle for an hour over Goulburn, the storm was developing and then the pilot mentioned there had been a break in between thunder cells, a 15 minute window.' 'One last plane got in, so there was still some time left in the window, our aircraft happened to be sitting right in position to land, just luck the pilot decided to give it go.' Mr Harrington said the storm was localised so it was only in a vicinity area but according to BOM the storm cell was growing. 'Definitely a wild old storm, the captain said the winds were at 80 klilometres plus, it was amazing to be a guest right in the eye of the storm,' he said. 'We got in, it was pretty rough but these pilots are some of the best in the world and at no time did anyone feel uncomfortable.'

"Each victim of the Sandy Hook massacre now has a memorial playground that honors their life in a joyful way. The last of 26 playgrounds dedicated to the victims of the 2012 shooting opened Sunday at Veterans Memorial Park to a playful but respectful crowd of children and their parents. This final park was dedicated to Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, the principal at Sandy Hook, who came out of her office after she heard shots in the school and confronted Adam Lanza. Rebuilding: For the project, Where Angels Play built 26 playgrounds in towns affected by Hurricane Sandy that were dedicated to the memories of the 26 victims of Sandy Hook . But on Sunday, NBC reports, attention was focused on the happier memories that friends and family had of Hochsprung as they dedicated the playground in her memory. 'For 27 years of my life, my mom wasn't just my mom. She was my best friend. She was my mentor. She was my hero,' said Erica Smegielski. The family helped plan the park, which broke ground in a smaller ceremony last Tuesday. Hochsprung's grandchildren 'said from day one, ""We want pirates and we want poodles,""' said Smegielski. The family also planned the design of the park, which was done in yellow and purple, Hochsprung's favorite colors. Making this all happen was a firefighter from  New Jersey who had felt 'demoralized and crushed and depressed' after hearing of the shooting at Sandy Hook, reports the Los Angeles Times.

Heroes: Retired firefighter Bill Lavin says that the 'heroes of this project are the moms and dads and wives and husbands of Sandy Hook' who helped others after their own tragedy . 'The response from the families validated that I needed to do this,' said Bill Lavin, who worked for the Elizabeth fire department. The inspiration was work that the New Jersey Fireman's Benevolent Association in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Then, members of the association had traveled down to hard-hit Mississippi in order to build playgrounds in communities devastated by the storm. Now, with the help of retired firefighters and other volunteers, Lavin has accomplished the 'crazy' feat of building 26 playgrounds in northeastern towns affected by Hurricane Sandy. 'The heroes of this project are the moms and dads and wives and husbands of Sandy Hook who, while suffering maybe the worst tragedy imaginable, had the courage, strength and generosity of spirit to give to others,' Lavin said. Lavin's non-profit, Where Angels Play, says it now plans to build on the idea in other cities.

"At 22, Stephanie Gilmore was on top of the world with four surfing world championships under her belt. But in December 2010, the young champion's whole life came to stand still after a random attack left her in emotional turmoil with head and wrist injuries to boot. Now, the 25-year-old from New South Wales and the subject of the feature film Stephanie In The Water, has spoken out about how she overcame her trauma to rise back to the top of the surfing league. Scroll down for video . Five-time surfing world champion Stephanie Gilmore has spoken out about her rise back to the top in her new feature film, Stephanie In The Water . Ms Gilmore describes her attack as the day 'the whole universe just flipped upside down'. She had been making her way back to her apartment in Coolangatta, New South Wales, when she noticed a random man from a car park she'd walked through, run at her with a metal bar in one hand. 'The first time, he hit me in the head. I saw blood all over everything. I put my left wrist up to protect myself, and the second hit snapped my ulna and tore ligaments in my wrist,' she told ESPN news. 'I looked down and saw a big lump on my wrist. My body went into survival mode, and at the time, I didn't feel pain.' The 25-year-old revealed the emotional toll a random attack took on her in 2010, when she was left with head and wrist injuries . Her attacker was eventually jailed for four years, but the incident left her with both physical and emotional scars that would see her struggle in her next competition and only take out third place. The professional athlete was told by her doctors that she would have to spend the following six weeks, just before her next competition, out of the water. 'I lost my rhythm…I realised it was going to take more than just natural talent and intuition to win this world title,' she said of her time in Brazil in 2011. By 2012, after finally putting in that extra effort and giving it her all, Gilmore came away with her fifth world title in France. Ms Gilmore said she 'lost her rhythm' in 2011 after her emotional and physical injuries, only placing third in the world . But in 2012, after realising 'it was going to take more than just natural talent and intuition to win', she earned her fifth world title. Pictured: Winning . 'In 2011 and 2012, I really had to fight for something and I felt like I'd never really had to do that before,' she told Fairfax. 'Even chasing a sixth world title right now, I really have to work for it.' Since recovering from the attack, the the Laureus World Sports Award recipient claims her perspective on life and sport has changed. 'I've definitely moved on and I've learnt a lot from it and I've grown from that. In a sense, I've appreciated it for having happened and being able to move on,' she said. This year she won the Swatch Womens Pro, defeating Sally Fitzgibbons in the final on September 18 in California .","In December 2010, Ms Gilmore was attacked by a man with a metal bar outside her home .

The images, boasting complex slogans from 'Strike a body blow to capitalism' to 'The tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction', were part of the early work of acclaimed photographer Roger Perry but were last published in 1976. Lovers of art and underground culture have now succeeded in their bid to republish the collection, The Writing on The Wall, after raising more than £10,000 via the crowd-funding website Kickstarter. Body blow to capitalism: Striking photos of London's political graffiti which were taken in the 1970s including at King's Cross station (pictured) are being re-released after almost 40 years. They were part of the collection The Writing On The Wall by Roger Perry . Do not submit: This image in Clapton, north London, sends a statement in an era which saw tension between people and those in power . What does it mean? The new edition of The Writing On The Wall, which was last published in 1976 and is now hard to obtain, will include a new foreword and expand on some of the stories and messages behind the often cryptic messages - such as this one in Notting Hill . While taking the photos Mr Perry was the chief photographer for Time Out magazine, which he later left to work for The Sunday Times and The Observer colour magazines, where he helped document the emerging punk movement. The book is thought to have been the first completely dedicated to London graffiti, and tells the story of the capital's counter-culture and underground press through the poetic - and sometimes surreal - statements daubed on  houses and iron fences. Most of the graffiti in the book could be described as ‘Pre-Renaissance’, according to the fundraising campaign's founder George Stewart-Lockhart - as it was created before it was considered an art form in the eyes of many. While many of the slogans are political, there are also some which are irreverent and hard to decipher - from 'Beware the thunderous trowel surgeons' to 'Clapton is God'. Nowadays there is a wide gulf in styles of graffiti and how much they count as art. Scrawled tags cost the British Transport Police alone more than £3.5million a year to remove, and are a headache for authorities and residents alike. Fighting the power: This slogan was daubed on a wall in Ladbroke Grove, West London. Police complain that much graffiti nowadays is mindless 'tagging' which costs millions of pounds a year to clean up - though political slogans have certainly not died away . Meaningless? The messages raised the deeper questions about life, such as this one in Chalk Farm, near Camden, in around 1975 . Eat the rich: A woman walks past this slogan on a bridge - where there is also support for London football club Queens Park Rangers . But Scotland's Chief Constable Sir Stephen House recently claimed 'tagging' has declined - because social media has offered disaffected people a new platform to vent ideas which a decade ago 'would have been sprayed on the side of a building'. Political graffiti has not gone out of fashion either. In protests against the rise in tuition fees in 2010, students defaced London monuments including Nelson's Column and the statue of Winston Churchill with messages including 'Education for the masses' and '**** the police'. But many political slogans have now been worked into visual metaphors. The anonymous artist Banksy's satirical take on Ukip's rise in Clacton, Essex - which featured pigeons with placards reading 'Go Back to Africa' - fell foul of council officials who scrubbed it off after a complaint deemed it racist. Other modern graffiti artists, meanwhile, create complicated murals - often with the permission of a building's owner. A 300-metre tunnel  under London's Waterloo Station is nicknamed the 'graffiti tunnel' and attracts tourists and lovers of urban art, with similar walls in cities across Britain. Simple message: This slogan in Kentish Town, north London, appealed to a now-unknown cause. George Stewart-Lockhart, 21, who arranged a campaign to bring the book back into print, said: 'I ended up realising the incredible stories and people behind the pieces' Paperwork: This slogan in Notting Hill called on the state and fellow dwellers of counter-culture to do away with bureaucracy . Counter-protest: It seems not everyone was so happy with the array of political daubings adorning the capital's walls . Mr Stewart-Lockhart, 21, said: 'My friend and artist, Graham ‘Paris’ Dews, posted one of the images from the book on his Instagram. 'After fruitlessly trying to find a copy for less than £60 on the internet, I thought the best course of action would be to republish it.' He set out on a mission to have the book republished and managed to track down Mr Perry’s widow, Kate Bindloss. 'She seemed so thrilled at the idea,' said Mr Stewart-Lockhart. 'The more I researched, the more wonderful people I ended up meeting. From initially viewing it from the angle of a purely aesthetic graffiti book, I ended up realising the incredible stories and people behind the pieces. 'Some pretty unlikely names turned up along the way too.' George Melly, the late jazz singer, wrote the original introduction for The Writing On The Wall and in the new edition it will be supplemented with a piece by artist and writer Bill Drummond, and an extensive foreword by Mr Stewart-Lockhart. The book will go further than the original, outlining the stories behind the works and explaining their often cryptic sentiments, using exclusive first hand interviews with the people who painted the ‘anonymous’ statements. Mr Perry was based in London for the majority of his career, studying at Harrow School of Art before joining Time Out. Irreverent: Not all of the works by Roger Perry were political. This slogan was daubed on corrugated metal in Highbury, north London . Philisophical: Not much graffiti these days refers to radical 1920s art movements. This piece in Kentish Town, north London, did just that . Trowel surgeons: A non-political slogan adorns a wall in Ladbroke Grove, west London, in 1975. Much political and humorous graffiti has now moved into visual metaphors such as those created by the anonymous Banksy, while police are left to deal with simpler tags . Celebrity culture: Royal gossip (none of it true) infiltrated this piece of graffiti on a wall in Notting Hill, west London, in 1975 . Not for dogs: A pet stands before another surreal slogan in Richmond, south west London, in 1976. The collection of black-and-white images is being re-released after almost 40 years after a crowd-funding campaign by a 21-year-old art-lover raised more than £10,000 . Acclaimed: Roger Perry (pictured) took the photos while working for Time Out before he moved to The Sunday Times and the Observer . He was responsible for a number of iconic covers as well as music and fringe theatre photography. The Writing On The Wall was initially published in 1976 before Roger moved on to work for The Sunday Times and The Observer colour magazines, where he was instrumental in his documentation of the early punk movement. A number of his portraits are now in the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery, but his photography dwindled after he developing severe rheumatoid arthritis. In the mid 1980s, he moved to Suffolk and put his energy into restoring classic Lancia cars until his death in 1991. The book is being released exclusively via Kickstarter and has already reached its target.

"A teenager told she had range of ailments from a slipped disc to damaged ligaments was horrified when doctors realised she actually had cancer. Dion Yates, 15, had been in agony for months before her devastating diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma, a rare but deadly form of bone cancer that affects young people. By the time she was diagnosed, the cancer had spread to her spine, womb, bladder, bowel and pelvis. Dion Yates (left before her diagnosis and right, after treatment) suffered pains in her legs for months - and was diagnosed with a slipped disc and ligament damage before the devastating news she had rare bone cancer . By the time she was diagnosed, the cancer had spread to her spine, womb, bladder, bowel and pelvis. Dion is pictured with her sister Jacy (left) and mother Kerry (right) But teenager, from Moray, Scotland, says she is determined not to be beaten by the disease - and has just shown a remarkable response to treatment and a new drug. She told the Daily Record: 'When they told me I had cancer it was a relief because at least they knew what it was and they could start to believe me, as I was in pain for so long.' In the six months since she was diagnosed, Dion has endured seven rounds of life-saving surgery and been given more than 60 pints of blood. However she has already defied doctors' expectations by being active just weeks after gruelling treatment. Doctors had warned it was so intensive that Dion would need a wheelchair for two years. She has also lost her hair due to the drugs. Ewing's sarcoma is a rare bone and tissue cancer. It can occur any time during childhood and young adulthood, and rarely affects older people. The tumour can develop anywhere in the body, but is usually found in the long bones of the arms and legs, the pelvis, or the chest. It often spreads to the lungs and other bones. There are few symptoms, but the most common is pain, and occasionally swelling, at the site of the tumour. Fever may also develop. Treatment involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. The five-year survival for localised disease is 70 per cent to 80 per cent when treated with chemotherapy. Despite being back on her feet, she is expected to need hip replacement surgery in three years, due to bone damage from the treatment. However it does mean the tumour has already shrunk by more than half - and just days after finishing six months of treatment in hospital, Dion has returned to school. She told the Record she now can't wait to go on holiday with her family and swim with dolphins - and also wants to take up kick boxing. Her mother Kerry, 36, said: 'She never lets anything get her down.'Even when she lost all her hair she said, ""Oh well, it will save me having to do it in the mornings"". She always looks on the positive side of everything. The teenager's ordeal began when she got pains in her leg last November. They became so excruciating she would beg her mother for a hot bath in the middle of the night to ease the pain. Over the next six months, her mother took her to the GP, where she was given diagnoses ranging from a slipped disc to damaged ligaments. It took until she could barely walk for the condition to be taken seriously. After going to A&E in Middlesbrough, while visiting her father, Dion was given an X-ray and then an MRI scan. To the family's horror, this revealed there was a tumour pressing against her sciatic nerve, which runs down the leg from the buttock. In the six months since she was diagnosed, Dion has had seven rounds of life-saving surgery and been given more than 60 pints of blood . It is hoped that Dion, with older sister, Jacy (left), will finish treatment before her 16th birthday in March . By the next day, she had been admitted to a cancer unit in Newcastle, where she underwent nine rounds of chemotherapy at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary and six weeks of radiotherapy at the city's Freeman Hospital. The teenager  also took part in a drug trial. Six months on, her mother said: 'Never in a million years did we think she had anything like that. It's great to have her home.' It is hoped Dion, who has an older sister, Jacy, will finish treatment before her 16th birthday in March. She and her family are now raising money for the Teenage Cancer Trust - and have so far raised £10,000 through various events.

"A heroic father has spoken of the moment he saved Claudia Winkleman’s daughter after her Halloween costume caught fire. Jamie Poulton suffered second-degree burns when he plucked eight-year-old Matilda from a group of children and put out the flames with his bare hands. His brave actions not only saved her from worse injury, they prevented her from setting fire to nine other children crowded on to a narrow doorstep. Describing the terrifying accident for the first time, the restaurant owner said he was just feet away when he saw Matilda’s black ‘wizard’s costume’ turn into a ‘crackling ball of flame’. To his horror, the synthetic fabric melted in his hands as he tried to tear it from the screaming child. Scroll down for video . Restaurant owner Jamie Poulton suffered second-degree burns when he put out flames with his hands after Claudia Winkleman's daughter Matilda's costume caught fire . Mr Poulton said his daughter Talulah, five, and son Lewis, three, were left terrified after witnessing the accident. And he warned other parents who dress their children in novelty costumes never to allow them near open flames. The 45-year-old, who owns Randall & Aubin restaurant in Soho, central London, had joined Miss Winkleman, around five other parents and ten children on their annual west London trick or treating expedition. Although he did not see exactly what set Matilda’s costume alight, it is thought her cape touched a pumpkin candle. He told the Daily Mail: ‘Suddenly, Claudia’s daughter went up in a crackling ball of flame. All the children were wearing the same kit. It was like a potential horror film in front of me, because they were all going to go. Once she goes, then the next one catches and they are all going to go off. ‘They were all on the doorstep together, right next to each other. So I just picked her up and lifted her over the children, got her on the pavement and tried to put her out.’ Mr Poulton said time seemed to slow down as he tried to extinguish Matilda’s flaming costume. Shockingly, the fabric continued to burn as he patted her and rolled her on the pavement. He said: ‘This material just keeps reigniting and re-burning. And it is sticky, so it melts on the skin. It doesn’t cinder. It remains hot. It was horrific to be honest. ‘I was trying to put it out with my hand. It was a warm night so I wasn’t wearing a jacket. Claudia Winkleman with husband Kris Thykier . ‘There was nothing immediately to hand to put it out with. Ideally I’d have had something like a towel to douse it all out. But I didn’t have anything. There wasn’t much time to think. ‘I was trying to roll her and pat her clothes. I was trying to rip the costume off her, which didn’t really help because it just ripped and dropped back. It is very bad material. That stuff is terrible. ‘The costumes are very, very cheap to buy. They are nylon and they just go up.’ Mr Poulton’s bravery left him with severe burns, and a week after the accident three fingers on his right hand are still in bandages. It is thought Matilda has had several operations and may have to remain in hospital for several weeks. Miss Winkleman and her husband Kris Thykier, both 42, have said they are ‘hopeful’ their daughter will make a ‘full recovery’. Miss Winkleman, who was replaced on last week’s Strictly Come Dancing by Zoe Ball, will not appear on the BBC1 show tonight and has not said when she will return. Mr Poulton played down his actions, saying: ‘Any parent would have done exactly the same thing so I don’t think there is anything heroic about it.’ However, he admitted his own children have been left traumatised, adding: ‘My little girl is petrified of candles now. She went to a birthday party the next day and didn’t want to go near a candle.’ Last night, experts said children’s fancy dress costumes have to comply with minimum fire resistance standards set out in the European Union Toy Safety Directive. But they warned it is impossible to create completely fireproof clothes. Elizabeth Fox, of the National Childrenswear Association, said: ‘All clothes burn, some more quickly than others. The terrible irony is that fabrics such as polyester are actually more fire-resistant than cotton, but once they do set alight they are liable to melt and burn the skin further. Sadly there is no easy fix except to warn parents when their children are around open flames, especially in loose clothing such as Halloween cloaks.’","Jamie Poulton suffered second-degree burns when he put out fire on Matilda's costume .

"A scandal over pornographic emails being shared by employees at the attorney general's office spilled over to another department when it was revealed some porn emails were sent from a State Supreme Court Justice. The Allentown Morning Call reviewed 54 emails sent from Justice Seamus McCaffery's personal Comcast email address to an employee at the State Attorney General's Office and found at least 8 contained pornographic images and videos. The revelation that McCaffery sent pornography-laced email chains comes as Governor Tom Corbett is facing scrutiny for pornography being forwarded within the state's attorney general's office during his tenure there. Forward: Pornographic emails sent from the private account of State Supreme Court Justice Seamus McCaffery have increased attention on the governor and high-level staff . The emails at the State Attorney General's Office turned up during an internal review of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal by now-attorney general Kathleen Kane. A staffer under Corbett during his tenure as attorney general, from 2005 to 2011, requested his past emails at Kane's request, when a routine screening uncovered some questionable content. Subject lines like 'Devotion' and 'Courage' topped emails containing pornographic images of women loosely playing on that theme. There were also sex tapes and off-color but otherwise harmless jokes. After news of the emails came to Kane, both Corbett and State Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald Castille asked for copies of the chains to determine whether members of their departments were involved. Members of the media also submitted Right-to-Know requests, and late in September, Kane shared emails from the inboxes of eight former staffers at the attorney general's office. All eight men worked under Corbett during his tenure as attorney general, with some following him into his administration. Under fire: Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett in a file photo from 2011, who is now under scrutiny for a pornography scandal that occurred under his time as attorney general . Investigation: Current State Attorney General Kathleen Kane has led an investigation into the prosecution of Jerry Sandusky that turned up pornographic emails in inboxes of Corbett's staff, leading some to accuse Kane and other Democrats of settling political scores . Two of the owners of those inboxes, Christopher Abruzzo, Environmental Protection Secretary under Corbett, and Glenn Parno, a lawyer with the Department of Environmental Protection, have resigned. McCaffery's emails were revealed Wednesday by Morning Call as coming from the batch shown by Kane. The justice forwarded emails with titles like 'tan lines XXX' depicting nude centerfolds, though only eight messages were found with lewd content. Two more had off-color jokes but others were filled with mundane pet advice or political jokes about presidents Obama and Reagan. These messages were forwarded to a member of Corbett's attorney general's office, then sent on to a circle of former members of Philadelphia police, where McCaffery served for 20 years before becoming a judge in 1993. Justice McCaffery has so far declined to speak about the emails. Penn Live reports that if the emails were stored by members of the Attorney General's Office, it would be in violation of the office's police of 'appropriate use of computer resources.'","Gov Tom Corbett served as attorney general from 2005 to 2011, when the emails were sent .

"Test Match Sofa, the alternative cricket commentary which operates from central London not from Test venues, has this week been described as a 'predator' that needs to be 'nailed' and 'swept offline'. Here ANDREW MILLER, the editor of The Cricketer magazine, who owns TestMatchSofa.com, hits back at those allegations... Earlier this year, one of the oldest voices in cricket took a leap of faith and jumped into bed with one of the newest. The Cricketer magazine, established in 1921 by Pelham Warner, saw in Test Match Sofa, an irreverent online cricket commentary service established in Tooting in 2009 by Daniel Norcross, a spark of innovative potential that it simply could not afford to pass up. The tie-up was never going to be to everyone’s taste, but like two inter-joining circles on a Venn diagram, that was never really the point. In a print media market that seems to be shrinking as quickly as broadband speeds are rising, innovation is vital if you want to stay afloat. England expects: Alastair Cook (second, left) takes evasive action from a shot by Ajinkya Rahane of India 'A' during the final day of England's first warm-up match . Test . Match Sofa is an online broadcaster providing cricket ball-by-ball commentary for . all England test matches and selected One Day Internationals. The . station is available worldwide serving as alternative commentary to . the BBC's Test Match Special which is only available in the UK. The station began broadcasting from . the Tooting Bec home of one of the station's creators, Daniel . Norcross, but moved to a rented house in Nunhead, also in South . London, in August 2010. In January 2011, Test Match Sofa moved to an . undisclosed location, believed to be somewhere in central London. Listeners interact with the show's commentators through . Twitter, with this interaction often influencing the agenda. Follow Test Match Sofa on Twitter @TestMatchSofa . The Cricketer saw in Test Match Sofa a . cult following of young, technologically savvy cricket fans – a . demographic that it might not have attracted by any other means. In . return the Sofa was offered shelter and status, and a chance for that . seed of a concept to germinate. At a stroke, each had doubled their . potential audience, and shored up the other’s foundations. It was, and . remains, a win-win scenario. We . expected resistance to our venture, and it duly arrived – though not . from the quarters we had imagined. The ECB, recognising that we were not . breaching any rights, ceased correspondence on the subject back in May, . ahead of England’s Test series against West Indies. Test Match Special, . on the other hand, have taken the Sofa’s existence as a personal slight . – culminating in a declaration on Wednesday that it needed to be . 'nailed' and 'swept offline'. We're flattered by TMS’s attention, but baffled by their hostility. At what point in that magnificent programme's evolution did the promotion of cricket become a zero-sum game? To complain, as they do, that Test Match Sofa is a 'predator' that pays nothing for rights and gives nothing in return is a sad parody of the public access position the BBC once held dear. After a summer in which rain, the Olympics and the Tour de France combined to squeeze cricket to the margins of public interest, surely the game needs as many people as possible to make as much noise on its behalf as is feasible. Anyone who believes otherwise might also argue against letting schoolkids enter for free on the fifth day of a Test. The Sofa does not profess to fill the void by any means, but it provides a start. Through the use of Twitter (@testmatchsofa), every listener is offered a voice that, as often as not, will help dictate the narrative of the day’s play. In so doing, we aim to cement the enjoyment of a new breed of cricket listener – ones who, like those who will doubtless enter their blog comments below – want a conversation with their commentators, not a lecture. Different audience: The Test Match Sofa crew pose up . Surely, if any BBC institution could still be relied upon to uphold the company's Reithian principles it should be TMS, the voice of cricket for more than half a century and, let's be frank about this, the very reason why Norcross and his colleagues were inspired to establish the Sofa in the first place. Without exception, the Sofa team venerates TMS. Every one of the enthusiastic amateurs who give up their own time to watch cricket in a windowless studio do so because their youths were misspent with radios under their pillows and Wisdens in their stockings. Window to the world: Members of the BBC Radio Test Match Special team in the commentary box at Lord's with the window cut out on the far right. Front row, from left, Henry Blofeld, Jonathan Agnew and scorer Bill Frindall. Back row from left, producer Peter Baxter, assistant producer Shilpa Patel, Vic Marks, Mike Selvey, Christopher Martin-Jenkins, Colin Croft and Tony Cozier . Test Match Special (known as TMS) provides ball-by-ball coverage of most Test cricket, One Day International, and Twenty20 matches and tournaments involving England. It is, rightly, considered by most cricket lovers THE place to listen to coverage of England matches. BBC Radio was the first broadcaster to cover every ball of a Test match. TMS is broadcast on Radio 4 long wave (198 LW). At times of cricket matches, the normal BBC Radio 4 schedule continues on its FM frequencies, while longwave is taken over by the cricket. This has sparked controversy with some Radio 4 listeners unable to change frequencies. The shipping forecast is, however, retained. TMS can also be heard via the Internet. TMS's coverage of England's tour to India had been under threat over fees demanded by the Indian board to broadcast from the grounds. However, TMS producer Adam Mountford revealed on Twitter on Thursday that a deal had finally been reached. 'We are pleased to confirm that Test Match Special will broadcast England's cricket tour of India from the grounds,' he said. Follow Adam Mountford on Twitter @tmsproducer . Jonathan Agnew and Christopher . Martin-Jenkins remain two of the greatest broadcasters of any . generation. But as a homogenized TMS leans more and more on ex-pros and . multi-sports specialists to fill the vacancies that crop up in the . course of time, one wonders where the next John Arlotts and Brian . Johnstons will appear to infuse cricket commentary with the whimsy and . digressions of old? I’d suggest, right now, the Sofa is the likelier of . the breeding grounds. And yet, TMS is still the undisputed master of the airwaves. Earlier this year, the question was put to me, rhetorically, what would happen if the BBC chose to stop broadcasting from the grounds and tried to do it off the telly? On account of the India access row, we might be about to find out … and I think the answer has come as a greater surprise to the BBC. Peter Baxter, the former TMS producer, understood the value of his product (and by extension the rights that the BBC pay) when in 1999, he demanded that a special window be cut in the middle of the enormous sheet of glass covering the front of the new Lord’s media centre. Quite rightly, he wanted to be able to dangle his effects mike into the crowd to provide total aural immersion to TMS’s legions of listeners. That sense of being there is priceless – it’s the hum of contented silence that tells you you’ve twiddled your long-wave radio to the right frequency – and it’s something that the BCCI, rarely slow to spot a changing trend, have recognised. Radio rights per se are irrelevant in the internet age. You can no sooner stop Test Match Sofa from commenting on the action than demand silence while fans watch it in the pub. The true value lies in being able to call it from the ground. Remarkably, it has taken the Sofa’s existence to remind TMS quite how important they are. Andrew Miller is editor of The . Cricketer magazine, who own TestMatchSofa.com . After reading the Cricketer on Thursday, Test Match Special presenter Jonathan Agnew tweeted: 'I've never read such hypocrisy & assumed knowledge as that spouted by the once great Cricketer magazine today. I won't be reading it again.' England's Twenty20 captain and former Sportsmail columnist Stuart Broad also weighed in to the argument, saying: 'Don't read the media Aggers... What have I told you!!

"A teacher whose phone was stolen then used to rack up £15,000 in bills by foreign thieves has been told by Vodafone that he must pay for the calls. Osian Rhys Edwards from Barmouth, Gwynedd, was on holiday in Barcelona in August when his phone was stolen after he asked for directions from locals. The 29-year-old phoned Vodafone to report the theft, but is now being held accountable for thousands of pounds as the company claims it has no record of his call. Scroll down for video . Osian Rhys Edwards was told to pay the £15,000 bill despite claiming to report his phone stolen on the night of the theft . The primary school teacher now faces financial ruin after being told to hand over £15,000, including £2,500 in VAT. 'It's clear that I have been the victim of fraudsters but Vodafone wants to hold me responsible. 'I can't believe that this is allowed to happen. If I'd lost my bank cards, the banks would soon stop them when they spot unusual activity but even though I reported my phone stolen, Vodafone not only says I'm liable, but it is probably making money out this,' he told the Guardian. Records show that phone calls to two Spanish numbers at premium rates were made on the night of the theft. Shortly after the incident Mr Rhys Edwards says phoned Vodafone  from a payphone in Barcelona to cancel his contract. But upon his return to the UK, he discovered the company had no record of the call. There is no hope of tracing the call now as logs are deleted after 60 days, the company said. While the provider has agreed to reduce the £15,031 bill by 30 per cent, it still holds him accountable for more than £10,000. 'Despite not reporting the theft of his phone for four days, we have offered to reduce Mr Edwards' outstanding charges by 25%. 'In the light of our failure to call him back when we should have done, we will increase this offer to 30%. The primary school teacher now faces financial ruin as despite the company reducing the bill by 30 per cent, he has been told to pay more than £10,000 . Pickpockets in the Catalan city target tourists and use their phones to place premium-rate calls before the handsets are blocked . 'We are also prepared to discuss a payment plan,' a spokesman said. Mr Rhys Edwards is the latest victim of pickpockets in the Catalan city who steal mobile phones and use them to place premium-rate calls in quick succession before the handset is blocked. Sarah Harvey, an NHS worker from Brighton, was told to settle a £5,800 bill run up after her phone was stolen in the same city. Georgia Harris, a recruitment worker, was initially told to pay £21,000 after her phone was stolen in 2013. Vodafone later withdrew its demand she pay for the foreign calls. In 2012, the telecoms regulator Ofcom ordered mobile phone companies produce plans to cap customers' bills. But the plans were never produced, and the issue was handed to the government with which companies are thought to be in continuing discussions.","Osian Rhys Edwards had his phone stolen in Barcelona in August .

"Two side-by-side meteor craters on Mars have revealed that the Red Planet has undergone serious climate change in its history. One crater in particular reveals dark traces of sediment thought to have been cemented together by water from an ancient groundwater reservoir, before being carved away by howling Martian wind. The find, by the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter, has lent weight to the idea that Mars was once very different to the dead orb we see now. One crater in particular reveals dark traces of sediment thought to have been cemented together by water from an ancient groundwater reservoir, before being carved away by howling Martian wind . The ancient 'climate change' that turned Mars from a wet planet - possibly capable of supporting life - to the dusty, wind-scoured orb that we see today was probably caused by changes in the axis of the planet's rotation. Similar forces are thought to have an impact on the cycle of ice ages on Earth. On 19 June 2011, Mars Express pointed its high-resolution stereo camera at the Arabia Terra region of Mars, imaging the Danielson and Kalocsa craters. Danielson crater is named after the late George E. Danielson, who was instrumental in the development of many spacecraft cameras flown to Mars, and is 40 miles across. Kalocsa crater lies in the center of the image and is smaller, about 20 miles in diameter. Danielson crater, like many in the Arabia Terra region, is filled with layered sediments, which in this instance have been heavily eroded over time. Within the crater are peculiarly layered buttes, known as yardangs. The asteroids litter the landscape - as they would on Earth except we have a geologically active world . Yardangs are streamlined hills carved from bedrock or any consolidated or semi-consolidated material by abrasive dust and sand particles carried in the wind. They are seen on Earth in desert regions, with notable examples in North Africa, Central Asia and Arizona in the United States. In the case of Danielson crater, it is believed that sediments were cemented by water, possibly from an ancient deep groundwater reservoir, before being eroded by the wind. The orientation of the yardangs leads scientists to theorize that strong north-northeasterly winds (from the lower right in the image) both deposited the original sediments and then caused their erosion.","Crater reveals layers thought to have been carved by groundwater reservoir .

"The new Palestinian unity government held a cabinet meeting in the war-battered Gaza Strip for the first time today, marking the end of more than seven years of absolute Hamas control of the coastal territory. In establishing a Gaza foothold, the cabinet also tried to assure the international community that foreign aid for Gaza's reconstruction will not reach the militant group Hamas, which is shunned by the West as a terror group. The meeting came three days before an international pledging conference in Cairo where Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is to seek $4 billion for Gaza reconstruction after the recent 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah (pictured centre) speaks during the Palestinian cabinet visit to the town of Beit Hanun in the Gaza Strip . Hundreds of local Palestinians gather to see the prime minister arrive in the severely damaged town of  Beit Hanun today . The prime minister and his cabinet's visit to the city marked the end of seven years of Hamas' absolute control of the Gaza Strip territory . Mr Hamdallah delivers a speech during his tour of some of the areas worst hit during the recent 50-day war between Hamas and Israel . A Palestinian boy waves the national flag as he stands on the rubble of his family home while waiting for the prime minister's arrival . Still, it remains unclear how much authority the cabinet will have on the ground. It is made up of independent experts, none of whom are declared members of the two main Palestinian movements, Hamas and Fatah. Hamas has said it would allow the ministers, who report to Abbas, to operate freely in Gaza. However, Hamas has refused to disband its security forces, creating a potentially volatile situation. Today Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah and 11 ministers arrived in Gaza from the West Bank, joining five colleagues who were already present in Gaza. After entering Gaza through an Israeli-controlled crossing, the ministers toured the town of Beit Hanoun and the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah, both badly damaged during the war. Hamas security forces formed cordons, linking arms, as curious and unruly crowds thronged the ministers. Later, as the visitors drove through Shijaiyah in a convoy, hundreds of people lined the street to watch, some waving and a few holding the yellow flags of Fatah. The cabinet convened in Abbas' former residence in Gaza City. Security officers, stationed to watch over the cabinet meeting, stand guard in positions among the rubble in the town of Beit Hanoun . Beit Hanoun (pictured) was badly damaged in the recent conflict with Israel. Pictured is a security officer employed to guard the Palestinian ministers . 'What we have seen today is horrible,' Hamdallah said. 'I cried in Beit Hanoun when I saw how the people live and sleep. The priority is reconstruction and political unification.' Hamas officials today said the organisation would be supportive of the cabinet. 'This unity government was the result of a reconciliation agreement that Hamas worked hard for,' said Izzat al-Rishq, a senior Hamas official in Doha, Qatar's capital. 'Therefore, we have a real and serious interest in enabling it (the new government) to work successfully in Gaza.' After the meeting, the ministers visited the top Hamas official, Ismail Haniyeh, in a show of good will. His house in the Shati refugee camp was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike during the war, and he met with the ministers in a reception area next to the debris of his home. Residents gather on a hill to see prime minister Rami Hamdallah, who visited the Gaza Strip with his cabinet today . Haniyeh had served as prime minister for both the West Bank and Gaza after Hamas won parliamentary elections in 2006. He was fired by Abbas a year later, after Hamas seized Gaza by force. The takeover triggered a border blockade of Gaza by neighboring Israel and Egypt, and over the years, repeated reconciliation attempts failed. Hamas became increasingly unable to govern after new Egyptian border restrictions last year drove its worst financial crisis since its founding in 1987. Earlier this year, a desperate Hamas agreed to hand over some authority in Gaza to an Abbas-led unity government. The new government was formed four months ago to replace rival administrations - one led by Hamas in Gaza and the other headed by Abbas in autonomous areas of the West Bank. However, it hadn't been operating in Gaza until now because of unresolved disputes between the long-time rivals and because of the war. Palestinian unity is a consensus issue, with polls consistently showing a majority in favor of ending the political split. In Gaza, many hope the new government will be able to ease border restrictions and revive the crippled economy. A Hamas security officer stands guard during the prime minister's visit. Hamas has said it will allow the ministers to operate freely in Gaza, however it has refused to disband its security forces, creating a potentially volatile situation . Israel initially refused to deal with the unity government because it is backed by Hamas. Since the Gaza war, Israel has signaled readiness to work with the Palestinian Cabinet, particularly on Gaza reconstruction. In a show of goodwill, Israel opened its Erez crossing into Gaza for the West Bank-based ministers on Thursday even though the crossing was meant to be closed for a Jewish holiday. As part of the restrictions on Gaza, Israel has prevented the import of construction materials, with the exception of shipments intended for projects supervised by international agencies, including the United Nations. Israel fears Hamas will divert cement and steel for military use, including attack tunnels. Israel spotted and destroyed more than 30 such tunnels during the recent Gaza war. Under a U.N.-brokered reconstruction deal, Israel is to ease the import of building materials, while U.N. inspectors and forces loyal to Abbas are to monitor the shipments until their final destination.

"Over the years, the French have often sought safety by fleeing over the Channel to Britain. But a book by a Frenchman who has lived in London for 13 years complains that those in the UK are unwelcoming and unfriendly towards them. Author Josselin de Roquemaurel says that not only is England expensive, the public services are inadequate and the natives look upon them mockingly. Scroll down for video . Author Josselin de Roquemaurel said the British love visiting France, but that French people moving to the UK find it expensive and to have inadequate public services . He said while the British love visiting France and revel in French culture, an age-old rivalry prevents them from being fond of its people or accepting them into their community. ‘The Englishman doesn’t really want to see us,’ de Roquemaurel writes in La Reine, la City et les Grenouilles (The Queen, the City and the Frogs). ‘He has no desire to include us in his social universe.’ De Roquemaurel, 35, from a wealthy Parisian family, has lived in London nearly half his life. He says it is fashionable for French residents to claim they have one or two English friends. But the so-called friend often turns out to be half French, married to a French person or someone fluent in the language. He claims a French bachelor in London is more likely to marry a Mexican or a Pole than a Briton, . Mr Roquemaurel, an executive in a private equity company, draws on his own experience having met his French wife in London. His book, which appears in French shops this week, warns those intending to move to the UK to expect mockery of their heavily accented English, which can prevent success in the business-world if you want to be taken seriously. ‘A banker cannot afford to make his interlocutors laugh or even smile,’ he writes. Mr Roquemaurel said he thought of London as more like a French 'border town' because of the number of French people living there . Mr de Roquemaurel, who has two young children, also criticised how English people cannot speak French properly. ‘They study French as though it were Latin, a dead language,’ he writes. He complains that his surname is commonly mispronounced and is told his first name, Josselin, sounds more like a girl’s. The former banker comments on the British obsession with property, struck by how newspapers, he claims, are full of gratuitous references to the value of people’s homes. He was surprised to be quizzed by a taxi driver about how much his property was worth. ‘I can’t imagine having a conversation like that with a taxi driver in Paris,’ he said. However, he does acknowledge that London has become the capital of global finance — his main reason for being there — and describes it as the heart of the art world. He admits the restaurants aren’t as bad as the French may think and that fashion industry is getting better. But just as you thought he was giving the UK the credit it may deserve, he claims much of Britain’s success is based on the efforts of talented foreigners - many of them French. A lot of Britain’s top chefs were taught by French masters and many of the football stars in the Premier League are French, he writes. He adds that living in London is more like a French ‘border town’, given the volume of French people living there. De Roquemaurel says it is common to hear French complain about how expensive London is and how the NHS doesn’t live up to their own healthcare system – despite many still using it. But the father of two has no intentions of returning to his homeland and even told the Sunday Times last week that he was thinking of putting his children into an English school. He has acceded to the property craze too, buying a home in ‘little France’, otherwise known as Kensington, west London.","French author Josselin de Roquemaurel says Britain is too expensive .

"Smiling for the camera, Robin Gibb and his wife Dwina chose to mark the first anniversary of their marriage with a gypsy themed party. Had the Bee Gees’ brilliant lyricist survived his battle with cancer they would today  be celebrating 31 years of wedded bliss. Instead, two years after his death, Mrs Gibb is announcing the release of her husband’s last album. Scroll down for recording . Dwina Gibb pictured alongside husband and Bee Gees' lyricist Robin on their first wedding anniversary. Mrs Gibb has released the picture on what would have been the couple's 31st wedding anniversary today . Titled 50 St Catherine’s Drive – the address of the house where Gibb was born in Douglas on the Isle of Man – the album is a collection of songs mainly recorded between 2006 and 2008 but never released and the final track on the album, ‘Sydney’ is also the last one recorded by Robin and is a demo version. Explaining its inclusion, Mrs Gibb, 61, who released the wedding anniversary picture from her personal family album, said: ‘Robin composed this late at night, in August 2011, at our home, The Prebendal. He used the bedroom keyboards and then Garageband on an I-Pad. The picture was issued by Mrs Gibb (pictured here with Robin in 2008) ahead of the launch of her husband's final album . 'He wished to finish this song in a studio with Barry, for a new album he hoped they would record together, but his health prevented this. 'He missed his twin brother Maurice who had passed away; but when he closed his eyes, the three young brothers were back in Sydney, Australia, happy together with their dreams and hopes for the future. Their future creations of course affected the world. 'This fragment of song is poignant, wistful, beautiful and unfinished. It belongs on this album as one of his last works. He cried when he wrote it, and I wept when I heard it.' Gibb passed away in May 2012 after contracting pneumonia while battling against cancer of the colon and subsequently of the liver. The multi-millionaire had valiantly fought the disease, even astonishing doctors as he came out of a coma weeks earlier. Gibb’s twin brother Maurice died from the same bowel condition that initially led doctors to operate on him. His musical career began when he formed the Bee Gees with his brothers Barry and Maurice in 1958. The group is among the biggest-selling bands of all time with hits spanning six decades including Stayin’ Alive, How Deep Is Your Love, Massachusetts and Night Fever. Born on the Isle of Man, the Gibbs moved around Britain as their father, a struggling musician, sought work to feed his five children. Maurice and Robin started singing harmonies at the age of six, practising in the bathroom. In 1958, the family emigrated to Australia, where the three elder brothers launched their recording career.","Bee Gees lyricist Robin Gibb died two years ago while battling cancer .

"Fears: Fiona Bruce, pictured this week, says that the BBC are worried about Ebola and she will not report from a high risk region . The BBC will ban guests from its buildings if they have Ebola symptoms as staff admitted they fear they will catch it. Star broadcaster Fiona Bruce, 50, has revealed that staff including make-up artists are fearful because they have physical contact with guests from high risk countries. The newsreader said their fears are 'not unreasonable' and admitted she would refuse to report from an Ebola-stricken region. Fears over the spread of the disease  means guests from virus-hit areas will be kept away from BBC buildings and interviewed on the phone or Skype. Speaking at the Wellbeing For Women charity event in London this week she said: 'At the BBC we are having conversations. 'We have got make up artists who are saying, ""Hang on these people are just turning up in our chair"". 'They said, ""They have just come in from Guinea? Do I want to be touching them?"" Which is not unreasonable.' 'There will be companies up and down the land who must be having conversations about this if they have any international aspect to their business.' The 50-year-old Antiques Roadshow presenter was asked if she would report from Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone. She said: 'No, I would not. They could not compel me. They are not monsters. They can't. We will get some cases here. It is inevitable.' The Government has warned that Britain should expect up to ten cases of Ebola by Christmas. Screening of airline passengers from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea has started at Heathrow and will be rolled out at Gatwick and Eurostar terminals. More than 4,000 people from 8,900 cases have died so far and the World Health Organisation predicts there will be up to 10,000 per week by December. As a result the BBC, which has a large presence in West Africa, will not allow anyone feeling unwell who has not been given the all-clear into its buildings.

"Most of us are guilty of tucking into the odd sandwich while hunched over our desks but while eating lunch at the office might seem harmless, experts say it is quite the opposite. According to researchers, people who regularly eat at their desks or in the office canteen are not only more likely to be obese, they also tend to have lower levels of vitamins and sky high cholesterol as well. The findings are the result of a new study that looked at the link between health and the number of meals eaten away from home. Scroll down for video . Bad move: Those who ate at their desks six or more times a week were more likely to be obese or overweight . 'We found participants who ate six or more meals a week away from home had a higher body mass index and lower concentrations of high-density lipoprotein - a molecule that removes excess cholesterol from the blood,' Ashima Kant, who led the study, told The Sunday Times. 'They also had lower concentrations of nutrients, including vitamins C and E, in their blood. This effect was found to be more pronounced in women and in adults over the age of 50.' The study looked at 8,314 people over five years and focused on the relationship between participants' health and the number of meals eaten outside the home. Although many did eat meals in fast food restaurants, the study was designed to look beyond traditionally unhealthy foods and at people who chose 'healthy' options from high street cafes such as Pret A Manger. Unhealthy: 64 per cent of British adults are overweight or obese (left) and office lunches (right) don't help . Interestingly, the results held true for all meals eaten outside the home, regardless of whether workers made a healthy choice or not. Obesity is becoming an increasingly weighty problem in the UK, with the most recent figures showing that 24.4 per cent of British men are obese and 25 per cent of women. In total, 64 per cent of all British adults can be classed as overweight or obese, according to NHS figures. As a result, public spending on obesity is set to rise to £50m a year, with sharp rises in heart-attacks, diabetes and strokes expected.","A new study has found people who eat at work are more likely to be fat .

"A jet on a military training exercise crashed into an agricultural field near a Southern California Navy base Wednesday, killing the pilot, authorities said. The plane disintegrated when it hit the ground at about 5:15 p.m. as it was preparing to land at Naval Station Ventura County. The crash sent a huge plume of billowing black smoke into the sky 65 miles northwest of Los Angeles. The pilot, the only person aboard, was pronounced dead at the scene, said Ventura County fire Capt. Mike Lindbery. Nobody on the ground was hurt. Crash site: Fire crews attend the scene of an aircraft crash near Port Hueneme in Ventura County.  A deployed parachute can be seen near the wreckage in a field. It is not known whether the pilot ejected . Plumes: A military jet crashed into a field near a naval base off the Southern California coast on Wednesday, killing the pilot, authorities said . Fire: The plane crashed and disintegrated at around 5:15 p.m. Wednesday near Naval Station Ventura County, sending up a huge plume of billowing black smoke . One fatality: The Ventura County Fire Department reported the pilot was killed. Nobody on the ground was hurt . Aerial: The site of the crash is seen here from a TV news helicopter . 'Fortunately nobody was in that portion of the field,' Lindbery said. The plane, a civilian fighter jet contracted by the Navy, had just finished playing the role of an enemy aircraft in an offshore training exercise and was preparing to land at the naval station when it went down across the street in a field near the Pacific Coast Highway, base spokeswoman Kimberly Gearhart said. She said it was unclear whether the pilot reported any problems before the crash . Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer said the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating. The British-built, single-seat Hawker Hunter MK.58 was owned by Airborne Tactical Advantage Co. of Newport News, Virginia. The company, known as ATAC, provides aerial training to the military, including the Navy's elite Fighter Weapons School. 'The company has ceased flight operations during preliminary investigations,' company spokesman Matt Bannon said. Bannon declined to release the pilot's name but said he was a retired military pilot who was 'extremely proficient and knowledgeable about fighter tactics and operating high-performance aircraft'. Debris: A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman  said the aircraft was a Hawker Hunter MK.58 . File photo: The Hawker Hunter jet, like the one seen here, was believed to be returning from a training exercise at the time of the crash . 'Our heart and prayers are with the family,' Bannon said. The Hawker Hunter is a single-seat, swept-wing fighter and ground attack plane that was originally designed in the 1950s. More than 2,000 were produced. ATAC describes it as 'one of the classic fighter designs of all time'. Wednesday's crash was the third near the Ventura County base in recent years. In May 2012, another Hawker Hunter owned by ATAC crashed into a farm field near the base, killing the 57-year-old pilot. That plane had also been contracted to play the enemy in training exercises. In May 2011, three members aboard a Boeing 707 tanker loaded with jet fuel escaped with only minor injuries when their aircraft skidded off the runway while taking off from the base and exploded into flames. That plane was carrying civilians and had a Navy contract to provide fuel transport.","Crash occurred about 5:15pm Wednesday near the Naval Station in Ventura County, California .

"A former marine has been sentenced to death for being his part in the murder of an Iraq veteran and his wife only two months after they got married. Kesaun Kedron Sykes, 27,  was convicted in August for killing Sergeant Jan Pietrzak, 24, and his wife Quiana Jenkins-Pietrzak, 26, in 2008. The Iraq vet forced to watch as his wife was raped by four men, one of them Skyes, before they were were both shot in the head by their attackers. Sentenced to death: Kesaun Kedron Sykes, 27, (left) was convicted in August for killing Sergeant Jan Pietrzak, 24, and his wife Quiana Jenkins-Pietrzak, 26, in 2008 at their Riverside County, California, home . Damning: Riverside County Deputy District Attorney Daniel DeLimon (pictured in court on Friday) said Skyes had 'earned his place on death row' When Skyes was found guilty, jurors recommended that he be sentenced to death for the violent crime. Emrys John, 23, and Tyrone Miller, 25, were both given the death penalty in 2013 for their roles in the 2008 killings in Riverside County, California. A third ex-Marine, Kevin Cox, 25, was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Sykes was the fourth person to be convicted. Sgt Pietrzak was an Iraq war veteran who was stationed at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in San Diego. His wife was a counsellor with an infant care programme in Riverside County. The couple had been married for just two months. Riverside County Deputy District Attorney Daniel DeLimon told the Fresno Bee that Sykes participated in the sexual assault and began trying to set fire to the home before the couple were killed. Newlyweds: The couple had only been married for two months when the four men broke into their home and brutally attacked them . He said: 'He earned his place on death row. If people are still alive, and you're trying to burn the house down on top of them, obviously, you are in, you are in all the way.' Sykes' lawyer, Doug Myers, said he recognizes the loss and pain suffered by the victims' loved ones, but Sykes did not deserve the death sentence. He claims that his client was outside the home when the killings occurred. 'A death sentence for Kesaun, who was not the actual killer, who did not direct the killings, and who was exposed to such awful abuse and neglect throughout most of his life, was not warranted,' Myers said.

"Motherwell have confirmed former Scunthorpe and Sligo manager Ian Baraclough as their new manager. Baraclough - who led Sligo to their first Irish title in 35 years - edged out former Fir Park defender Mitchell van der Gaag in the recruitment process. Although van der Gaag was installed as the bookmakers' clear favourite on Thursday evening, it's believed Baraclough had already been chosen as Stuart McCall's successor following discussions earlier in the day. Former Sligo manager Ian Baraclough has been installed as Motherwell's new manager . The 44-year-old will be at Fir Park on Saturday today to watch his new team play Scottish Premiership bottom club Ross County, with Kenny Black remaining in caretaker charge. Baraclough, a former Leicester, QPR and Scunthorpe defender, arrived in Motherwell on Friday night as the club announced they had agreed a deal in principle that would see Well Society backer Les Hutchison assume control in lieu of a planned fans' takeover. The announcement of that deal allowed the club to appoint Baraclough, who has been working as a scout for Huddersfield after parting company with Sligo in June. Baraclough took over as Scunthorpe boss after playing 134 times for the club and has since led Sligo though one of their most successful periods . The club want Black to stay on as assistant, a role he performed for almost four years under McCall, but no announcement has been made on the caretaker's future. Baraclough told the club's official website: 'I am delighted and find myself in a privileged position. I've done some research into the history of the club and I know how well the football club has done, certainly over recent years. 'It will be a hard task to take over from Stuart but one I'm very excited to take up. 'I'm a positive guy and I'm upbeat most of the time. The players will find that and I'll try and get that across to them. I want this club to feel energised and start climbing the table as soon as possible.' Baraclough's exit from Sligo came as a surprise after he led them to their most successful period, which saw them win the FAI Cup and cross-border Setanta Sports Cup as well as the title in his first season in 2012. Baraclough had previously had a six-month spell in charge at Scunthorpe, losing his job in the midst of a relegation battle in the Championship. He had twice helped the club win promotion to the second tier of English football as assistant to Nigel Adkins. It is understood Baraclough, who has also worked as a scout for Watford, impressed Motherwell with his focus on fitness and discipline and emphasis on playing a passing game, as well as his contacts in the English game and his track record of helping develop young players. Former Maritimo manager van der Gaag also hugely impressed the board with his analysis of Motherwell's recent displays and his vision for the club, but with the club facing a battle to get out of relegation danger, Baraclough was seen as the right man for the moment.","New Motherwell boss Ian Baraclough led Sligo to first Irish title in 35 years .

"People who are outgoing, hardworking, organised and relaxed don’t only shine at parties and job interviews. They’re also less likely to suffer diseases like stroke, arthritis, and heart conditions, according to a new study. And those who are anxious, moody, irritable, and prone to sadness are more likely to be diagnosed with such an illness. Scroll down for video . People who are conscientious, open, agreeable and extroverted are less likely to suffer diseases like stroke, arthritis and diabetes. Anxious and moody neurotic people are more likely to suffer ill health, the study found . U.S. researchers found a strong link between personality types and disease, in the first long-term study of its kind. They found that being highly conscientious, extroverted, open, agreeable and not very neurotic was associated with better health and lack of disease. This could be because these types of people are more likely to eat healthily, take exercise, suffer less stress and communicate better with physicians, they said. On the other hand, people who are highly neurotic – meaning they are anxious, worrisome, have mood swings and are often sad – are more likely to be diagnosed with a disease. This supports previous research found that neurotic people die earlier, although why this happens is not fully understood. One theory is that they deal less effectively with stress, so their bodies release more of the hormone cortisol, which in large amounts can damage the immune system and organs, including the brain. EXTROVERSION . This trait includes characteristics such as excitability, sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness. Extroverts tend to be outgoing and energetic. AGREEABLENESS . Agreeable people tend to be trusting, altruistic kind, affectionate, compromising and value getting along with others. CONSCIENTIOUSNESS . Those high in conscientiousness tend to be hardworking, organised and mindful of details. They are dependable, dutiful, show self-discipline and work towards goals. NEUROTICISM . Highty neurotic people tend to experience emotional instability, anxiety, moodiness, irritability, and sadness. OPENNESS . This trait features characteristics such as imagination, curiosity and insight. Those high in this trait look for new experiences and tend to have a broad range of interests. Through a questionnaire testing participants’ personality, researchers scored people on the ‘Big Five’ personality traits. These are extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness and neuroticism. Four years later, they were asked if they had been diagnosed with a disease by a doctor. The participants were scored on a scale of one to four on each of the personality traits. Four meant their personality strongly displayed that trait, so a person who was scored four on the extroversion scale would be very talkative and outgoing, whereas a person who was scored one would be introverted and less talkative. Below, they describe the differences in health for each trait: . CONSCIENTIOUSNESS . Conscientious people are hardworking, reliable, dutiful and able to control their impulses. They like things to be planned and like to achieve their goals. The researchers found that being a conscientious person can protect against the onset of disease. Researchers found a one unit increase on the 1 - 4 scale for conscientiousness decreases the odds of a stroke diagnosis by 37 per cent. It also decreases the odds of a high blood pressure diagnosis by 27 per cent, arthritis by 23 per cent and diabetes by 20 per cent. One of the researchers, Professor Joshua Jackson, told MailOnline they did not differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but added: 'Because it was a new diagnosis of diabetes, and everyone is an older adult, I would guess that most were type 2.' Type 1 diabetes is caused when the body’s immune system incorrectly targets and kill the cells in the pancreas that are responsible for producing insulin. Type 2 diabetes is when the body becomes less able to respond to insulin. It is usually diagnosed in over 30 year-olds and is often associated with excess body weight. The link between conscientiousness and health could be because people who are conscientious are likely to carry out healthy behaviours like healthy eating and exercise, which are important for preventing diseases like stroke, high blood pressure and diabetes, researchers said. OPENNESS . Open people are curious, imaginative, like playing with new ideas, and have a broad range of interests. A one unit increase on the 1 - 4 scale for openness decreased the odds of a stroke diagnosis by 31 per cent, heart conditions by 17 per cent, high blood pressure by 29 per cent, and arthritis by 21 per cent. Being more open might help a person be more creative in relieving stress and may improve their health through better communication with physicians. EXTROVERSION . Extroverted people are positive, assertive, talkative, social and like to be the life and soul of a party. Researchers found a one unit increase in extroversion decreased only the odds of a high blood pressure diagnosis by 26 per cent. An increase in neuroticism raised the odds of being diagnosed with high blood pressure by 37 per cent,  lung disease by 29 per cent, arthritis by 25 per cent and a heart condition by 24 per cent . AGREEABLENESS . Agreeable individuals value getting along with other people. They tend to be considerate, kind, generous, helpful, trusting and trustworthy, and willing to compromise. A one unit increase in agreeableness decreased the odds of an arthritis diagnosis by 21 per cent. Professor Joshua Jackson, told MailOnline previous studies have not linked the trait of agreeableness to health, so he would want to replicate these findings in future studies to be sure of the link. One theory, however, is that the social connections well-fostered by agreeable people protect them against disease. He said: 'Agreeable individuals are warm, caring. They make deeper connections. Social connections are associated with good health, there’s lots of research on that. That could be the reason why agreeableness is protective. NEUROTICISM . Neurotic people are sensitive and nervous, and often experience anger, anxiety, or depression. Neurotic people who are constantly worrying are more likely to develop a disease to worry about in later life, the study found. A one unit increase in neuroticism increased the odds of being diagnosed with a heart condition by 24 per cent, lung disease by 29 per cent, high blood pressure by 37 per cent, and arthritis by 25 per cent. THE STUDY . As part of the study, researchers used data on 6,904 Americans, whose median age was 68, who had visited a doctor or clinic within the previous two years. They had participated in the University of Michigan’s Health and Retirement Study. In order to score their personality traits, participants were given a list of adjectives with a range of words from ‘outgoing’, ‘dominant’, ‘friendly’ and ‘sophisticated’. They were asked to report how well each word described them, and based on their answers they were scored on a scale between one and four for each ‘Big Personality’ trait. Four years later, they were contacted asked whether they had been diagnosed by a doctor with any serious illness from a given list. Being more conscientious - hardworking, reliable and self- controlled - or more curious and open to experience could actually protect against diseases like stroke, arthritis (left), high blood pressure and diabetes (right) The study found women were more extroverted, agreeable, conscientious, and neurotic than men. Older people were less extroverted, less conscientious, less neurotic, and less open than younger adults. Married individuals were more conscientious, open and emotionally stable than people who were not married. Interestingly, personality traits did not predict the diagnosis of cancer, one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It was not possible to infer from the data the increased risk of being diagnosed with a disease a person rated highly with any individual trait (scoring four on the scale) is than someone rated as a person rated lowly on that trait (scored one on the scale), the researcher said. Professor Jackson, of Washington University in St Louis, U.S., told MailOnline: 'This study was important because it demonstrated that one’s personality predicts and is associated with important diseases. Researchers said being conscientious, open and extroverted meant people often ate healthily, took exercise, managed their stress and communicated well with physicians. One theory about why neurotic people suffer more disease is that their body releases more 'stress hormone' cortisol, which harms the immune system . 'The development of those diseases are really due to the way that you behave, and think and see the world. 'The way that you approach the world, see the world, interact with the world, affects your health.' When asked if it was possible for people to change their personality in order to protect themselves against disease, he said it would be better to study why certain characteristics of personality are protective. He said: 'Other research has shown that personality is not set in stone, we do change it subtly. 'It’s possible, over the course of 20 years, to see naturally occurring change. 'Right now we don’t know how to change someone’s personality to change their health. But we can look at the reasons why people with certain characteristics have better health, and people without those characteristics could replicate those mechanisms.' The study was published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science.","Researchers found a strong like between personality type and disease .

"Oxford created Varsity Match history at Twickenham as they crushed Cambridge 43-6. The Dark Blues' landslide success was Oxford's biggest winning margin since the fixture began in 1872. It was also Oxford's fifth successive Varsity Match victory - the first time for them to achieve such a feat. First-half tries by scrum-half Sam Egerton and centre Alexander Macdonald put Oxford in charge as they built a 17-6 interval advantage, before scoring 26 unanswered points after the break.

The captains lead their teams onto the pitch on Thursday afternoon at the home of English rugby . Egerton, who was sent off in last year's game following an incident in a ruck, set the tone by claiming a brilliant solo try after just 10 minutes, and Macdonald crashed over on the stroke of half-time. Fly-half George Cullen converted both tries and kicked a penalty, while Cambridge replied with two Don Stevens penalties, although Stevens was then carried off injured early in the second period. And it did not get any better for Cambridge as they saw a second player carried off - wing George Smith - after Oxford had made the game safe through further tries during a four-minute spell in the third quarter from lock Tom Reeson-Price and prop Ian Williams. Oxford were in no mood to let up, though, and with Cambridge out on their feet, Cullen and flanker Gus Jones claimed touchdowns to complete the rout. Cullen finished with a personal points tally of 18, and Cambridge did not even enjoy the satisfaction of a consolation try as Oxford retained a vice-like grip on proceedings before once again getting their hands on the trophy.

"Prestwick Airport should maintain its status as a gateway to Glasgow and become a launchpad to outer space to secure its long-term future, a new analysis has concluded. The Glasgow Prestwick Airport strategic vision said the Ayrshire terminal's association with Glasgow, some 35 miles away, is its 'best asset'. A local campaign to change its name to Robert Burns International Airport, in recognition of the Alloway-born bard, would 'damage the airport's business prospects, notably with inbound passengers', it said. Prestwtick Airport is in need of modernisation as it aims to compete on the world stage . Officials at Prestwick believes the airport satisfies criteria to be the site of the UK's first spaceport (illustration) The vision also confirms Prestwick's bid to be the site of the UK's first spaceport, which it said will be 'the catalyst for transformational change'. In the meantime, Prestwick faces some challenges including aged infrastructure, a maintenance backlog, a railway station in need of a £4.75 million refurbishment, the need for a new primary radar within the next five years and Ryanair's expansion into Glasgow Airport. Scottish airports are also 'disproportionally affected' by air passenger duty (APD) due to their geographic location and Prestwick is calling for changes to UK aviation policy leading to a reduction in or removal of APD. Glasgow Prestwick chief executive Iain Cochrane said: 'We are currently under consideration to become Britain's first spaceport. A report has said that Prestwick Airport is a vital link for the city of Glasgow . 'We satisfy - and in some cases exceed - all the essential criteria such as infrastructure, weather and airspace, and securing spaceport status would be the catalyst for transformational change at the airport - from boosting revenue from space-related flight testing, establishing an attractive modernised hi-tech image and bringing in visitors and tourists. 'It will also bring significant economic benefits to both Ayrshire and Scotland.' Plans to rename Prestwick Airport the Robert Burns International Airport have been criticised, despite the bard being Scotland's most famous poet . Prestwick spaceport would be a magnet for tourists, industrial tenants, payload operators and sub-technology businesses, the report said. It added: 'Glasgow Prestwick Airport is a well-recognised name and its best asset is the Glasgow mention. 'Removing it will weaken its link with its main origination and destination market, being Glasgow. 'The airport will explore opportunities which may include the incorporation of a Robert Burns theme to form part of the general re-positioning of the airport landside area.' The report notes that Prestwick Airport was built in the 1960s and 'the infrastructure is aged'. 'In recent years the capital expenditure has mainly been focused on areas that were viewed as essential to maintain a safe and secure asset and keep the airport operational,' it said. 'This approach has resulted in a maintenance backlog in certain areas and also highlighted that there are some critical items of equipment which are coming close to end of life and will need replacement. 'The airport has developed a structured capital plan that will address much of the infrastructure backlog issues over the next few years. 'This excluded the costs in relation to the rail station. 'It also excludes the replacement costs of the existing primary radar which will be required within the next five years, though alternative funding options are being considered in relation to this.' Spaceport America, based in New Mexico: Could Glasgow host the UK's equivalent? Prestwick is in need of improvement, and remains a key component of Scotland's aviation market . It added: 'There is a significant need to refurbish the rail station and skywalk connecting it to the airport, with initial estimates of this being up to £4.75 million.' It continued: 'Scottish airports have been disproportionally affected by APD due to geographic location and therefore a comprehensive route development solution will be crucial to support the proposed passenger growth. Stornoway Airport, Scotland . Kinloss Barracks, Scotland . RAF Lossiemouth. Scotland . RAF Leuchars, Scotland . Glasgow Prestwick Airport, Scotland . Campbeltown Airport, Scotland . Llanbedr Airport, Wales . Newquay Cornwall Airport, England . 'Major growth will only be achievable if a substantial APD mitigation plan and route development support are put in place.' The Scottish government bought the struggling airport for £1 last year and later announced £10m in loan funding. The cash was committed towards operating costs, a repairs backlog and to make improvements to the terminal building. In July 2014 Ryanair announced the establishment of a base at Glasgow Airport in addition to Prestwick and Edinburgh. The immediate impact was 'an overall reduction in passenger volumes from the airport which has an adverse impact on its immediate revenue generating capabilities', it said. Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: 'We have been clear from the start of this process that there is no quick fix for the airport but there are opportunities to improve in all areas of the business, from increasing passenger and freight traffic to putting forward a bid for the UK spaceport programme. 'We are confident there is a place for Glasgow Prestwick Airport in the evolving Scottish aviation market and look forward to seeing it grow and develop in the future.'","Airport is described as a 'gateway to Glasgow' in new report .

"Newcastle defender Paul Dummett believes a homegrown spine of English players is the reason behind the club's astonishing revival in the last two months. At the end of September, a 1-0 defeat at Stoke meant discontent from Newcastle supporters at their woeful start to the season was turning venomous towards manager Alan Pardew. But since that game they have only lost once more on a run of form that has seen them rise to seventh in the Premier League, handing Chelsea their first defeat of the season along the way. Paul Dumemtt (left) closes down Willian (right) of Chelsea in Newcastle's 2-1 victory last weekend .

"A 20-year-old student was told she had a common cold three times before a blood test revealed she was suffering cancer. Fiona Codd, of Sutton Coldfield near Birmingham, told doctors she was feeling extremely tired, suffering a raised temperature and had flu-like symptoms. She visited GPs three times in two weeks. But it wasn't until her mother demanded a blood test that she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. Scroll down for video . Fiona Codd, 20, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in December last year, after visiting doctors three times and being told she was suffering a common cold . It was only when the 20-year-old media student's mother insisted doctors perform a blood test on her fourth visit that the true diagnosis was made . She said: 'I had these flu-like symptoms over a two-week period and kept going back and forth to the doctors. In the end, on the fourth visit my mum came with me and asked them to carry out a blood test' The 20-year-old media student is today urging other young people to look out for the five common signs of the disease as part of a Teenage Cancer Trust campaign. She said: 'I had these flu-like symptoms over a two-week period and kept going back and forth to the doctors. 'I was given different tablets but nothing was really working. 'The doctor couldn't put his finger on what was actually wrong with me. 'In the end, on the fourth visit my mum came with me and asked them to carry out a blood test. 'The next day I received a call to go to hospital and was given the bad news. 'When I was told I had cancer I burst into tears and kept thinking ""Why me?"". 'My first thought was also about my hair and whether I would lose it. 'I always loved doing different things to my hair and knew I wouldn't be able to do that.' Miss Codd, who is now in remission following her diagnosis last December, started chemotherapy immediately. By April she was given the good news, she was clear of cancer. While being treated at the Teenage Cancer Trust unit at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, she met Stephen Sutton, the teenager who raised millions for the charity in the months before his death. Miss Codd has now finished her treatment, and is back at college. She still requires check-ups every month and bone marrow tests every three months.

Miss Codd, pictured with Peter Andre, is now encouraging other young people to be alert to the five signs of cancer . The five most common signs of cancer in young people aged 13 to 24 are persistent and unexplained pain, extreme tiredness, weight loss, an unexplained lump, bump or swelling or changes in a mole. Other symptoms of acute myeloid leukaemia include: pale skin, breathlessness, having repeated infections over a short space of time, unusual and frequent bleeding (such as bleeding gums or nose bleeds). Easily bruised skin, excessive sweating and bone and joint pain are others. The five most common signs of cancer in young people are persistent and unexplained pain, extreme tiredness, weight loss, an unexplained lump, bump or swelling or changes in a mole. Pictured is acute myeloid leukaemia under the microscope . Leukaemia is the most common form of blood cancer in children. Leukaemia is a blood cancer that affects the white blood cells, a really important part of our immune system that fights infection. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALA) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are forms of cancer which affect blood-producing cells in the bone marrow. When a child has leukaemia, control of blood cell production breaks down. The bone marrow - the soft tissue in the middle of our bones where all our blood cells are made - makes lots of abnormal white blood, or leukaemia cells. These never mature into proper white blood cells, vital to a healthy immune system, and so children with leukaemia are at more risk of infection. Now nine in ten children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are cured - a remarkable turnaround for a previously untreatable disease. The cure rates for children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are now around 65 per cent.","Fiona Codd, 20, went to the doctors complaining of flu-like symptoms .

"Moree farmer Ian Turnbull made verbal threats against Glen Turner two years before 'he deliberately executed him by shooting him in the back' a judge has said in court while refusing the wealthy grazier bail. 'I'm an old man. I don't care. I can do anything I want' police say Turnbull told Mr Turner on June 28, 2012. Turnbull is charged with the murder of the 51-year-old father of two, accused of shooting the environment officer during an alleged land clearing dispute, on a public road at Croppa Creek, near Moree in northern NSW. Justice Anthony Blackmore said the threat to Mr Turner was said in the context of 'if you have any respect for your life you will not interfere'. Scroll down for video . Moree farmer Ian Turnbull (pictured right), is charged with the murder of 51-year-old father of two compliance officer Glen Turner (pictured left). 'I didn't mean to kill him',' Turnbull's wife Robeena told the court her husband said her, adding 'he appeared as though he was somewhere else' Environment and Heritage compliance officer Glen Turner, 51,  was allegedly shot in the back by wealthy farmer Ian Turnbull after the father-of-two served an illegal land clearing notice. Turnbull's wife Robeena June Turnbull (pictured)  at King st Court . 'I simply cracked,' Mr Turnbull told his wife Robeena, heard the court on Thursday. He told her as he sat on the verandah of their property and waited five hours for the police to come and arrest him . Turnbull sat defiantly with his arms folded as Justice Blackmore went further to say that he believed the farmer had 'considerable means' to leave the country and to live well. He also said that he was still a threat to the community and to all officers working, as Mr Turner had been, for the Office of Environment and Heritage. 'He had threatened him [Turner] before and ultimately ends up shooting him.' 'He does have very significant financial means, much more than the ordinary person ... he is able to escape the jurisdiction and live out the rest of his life comfortably.' 'He is charged with the murder of a public official.' 'The facts of the case are virtually overwhelming,' said the judge. Justice Blackmore said Turnbull had shown no remorse, telling a prison psychologist ' it was the deceased that was at fault'. He said that 'moreover the dispute between [Turnbull and the environment department] is not over. 'He is a danger to all environment officers if released on bail. He is also a danger to the community.' Croppa Creek is in NSW's 'golden triangle,' a fertile area of land rich in farming history . Compliance officer Glen Turner, 51,  was allegedly shot in the back by wealthy farmer Ian Turnbull. His wife Robeena June Turnbull told the court her husband said, 'I simply cracked' Glen Turner, 51, was shot dead on a dirt road near Moree in northern NSW in the early evening of July 29 . Ian Turnbull has been refused bail at the NSW supreme court on Thursday . 'He deliberately threatened the deceased prior to the event.' 'What bail conditions could deter a mam who is prepared to execute a public official.' On the evening the elderly farmer allegedly murdered the NSW environment officer, he went home and told his wife he 'simply cracked'. He sat looking 'wretched ... just blank' after shooting Glen Turner on July 29, his wife Robeena told the Sydney court early on Thursday. 'I simply cracked,' he told her as he sat on the verandah of their property and waited five hours for the police to come and arrest him. 'I didn't mean to kill him',' Mrs Turnbull told the court her husband told her, adding 'he appeared as though he was somewhere else'. Turnbull has been in custody since July 29, the day of the killing in the state's north. Robeena Turnbull, who has been married for more than 50 years to the 79-year-old, told a NSW Supreme Court bail hearing her husband arrived back at the family's homestead about 6.30pm. He didn't shower or change his clothes, instead, he sat down in a chair and told her he was going to wait for the police, the court heard. Robeena June Turnbull (pictured) told the hearing that she had visited her husband, Moree farmer, Ian Turnbull, in jail every weekend since his arrest for accused murder . Glen Turner's family have been devastated by their loss . Mrs Turnbull told the hearing that she had visited her husband in jail every weekend since his arrest, a 12-hour round trip that involves driving to Brisbane, where her son lives, flying to Newcastle and renting a car for the final leg to Cessnock Correctional Centre. She said her husband had difficulty walking and that she could see he was in pain, adding he suffered from peripheral neuropathy, which meant he needed  a wheelchair in prison. 'He said he could only walk about 10 feet and then he would crumple to the floor,' Mrs Turnbull said. 'But (he only expresses discomfort) when I ask him. He doesn't come out complaining.' The court heard that Turnbull would stay with relatives on Sydney's north shore if released on bail. At a previous court hearing, police had alleged the farmer was armed with a loaded rifle and had told Mr Turner he would be leaving Croppa Creek that day in a body bag. Mr Turner was shot on a dirt road in the early evening as he and another environmental officer were carrying out unrelated duties on Talga Lane, near Moree. 'I simply cracked,' Mr Turnbull told his wife Robeena (pictured), heard the court on Thursday. He told her as he sat on the verandah of their property and waited five hours for the police to come and arrest him . Turnbull, who appeared via audio visual link from Cessnock prison on Thursday dressed in prison greens, looked haggard and had his arms crossed. He pressed his lips together and looked grim, occasionally glancing away from the camera as his wife gave evidence. Prominent Sydney barrister, Tony Bellanto, QC, appeared for Mr Turnbull. Mr Bellanto cited Mr Turnbull's medical conditions, including a pacemaker in his heart, chest pain, angina and difficulty in walking, as well as offering a $300,000 surety. Mr Turner and Ian Turnbull had been involved in a long-running dispute over land clearing in the area, where Turnbull and his family own several properties with large tracts of cropping land. Following the shooting, Mr Turner's family said they were devastated by his early passing and would remember him as a loving husband and father to his two young children, aged nine and 10. The incident generated widespread debate on native vegetation legislation, and came after years of mounting tension between farmers, environmentalists and governments about landowners' rights to clear vegetation for cropping. A year before the fatal shooting, Turnbull had pleaded guilty to illegally bulldozing nearly 500ha of trees and was facing a hefty fine and a ­potential legal bill of more than $300,000.","Moree farmer, Ian Turnbull has been refused bail in the NSW supreme court .

"Welsh rugby fans have been urged by campaigners to stop singing the popular Tom Jones hit 'Delilah' because of its controversial lyrics. Former Plaid Cymru president Dafydd Iwan has called on supporters at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium to find something else to sing, claiming the 1968 song 'trivialises the idea of murdering a woman'. The song includes the lyrics: 'At break of day when that man drove away, I was waiting. Scroll down for video . Delilah has become an unofficial anthem for Welsh rugby fans and Sir Tom Jones has even sung it to the crowds at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. However, a campaign to ban it has now been launched . The Welsh Men's Choir sing before the Autumn International between Wales and New Zealand last month . 'I cross the street to her house and she opened the door. 'She stood there laughing....I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more.' Iwan, who held his senior role with Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, from 2003 to 2010, is also a folk singer. A general view of the exterior of Cardiff's Millennium Stadium . I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window . I saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind . She was my woman . As she deceived me I watched and went out of my mind . My, my, my, Delilah . Why, why, why, Delilah . I could see that girl was no good for me . But I was lost like a slave that no man could free . At break of day when that man drove away, I was waiting . I cross the street to her house and she opened the door . She stood there laughing . I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more . My, my, my Delilah . Why, why, why Delilah . So before they come to break down the door . Forgive me Delilah I just couldn’t take any more . Quoted in several national newspapers, he said: 'It is a song about murder and it does tend to trivialise the idea of murdering a woman and it's a pity these words now have been elevated to the status of a secondary national anthem. I think we should rummage around for another song instead of Delilah.' The Welsh Rugby Union appears disinclined to ban the song, with a spokesman quoted by the South Wales Evening Post as saying: 'Within rugby, Delilah has gained prominence through its musicality rather than because of its lyrics. 'There is, however, plenty of precedent in art and literature, prominently in Shakespearean tragedies for instance, for negative aspects of life to be portrayed. 'The Welsh Rugby Union condemns violence against women and has taken a lead role in police campaigns to highlight and combat the issue. 'The WRU remains willing to listen to any strong public debate on the issue of censoring the use of Delilah but we have not been aware of any groundswell of opinion on this matter.' Delilah, written by Les Reed, Barry Mason and Sylvan Whittingham, tells of an opportunistic killing by a man, who waits until his former partner's lover leaves her home before making his move. The song is also commonly sung by supporters of Premier League football club Stoke.","Campaigners have urged Wales rugby fans to stop signing Delilah because of its controversial lyrics .

"Alan Pardew admits that Jak Alnwick’s wage demands could rocket should he prove himself as a Premier League goalkeeper over the next month. The 21-year-old is set for an extended run in the Newcastle team and will make his full professional debut at Arsenal. Alnwick, though, is out of contract in the summer and, with the Magpies having already signed Nottingham Forest stopper Karl Darlow, his future at his hometown club is uncertain. But with first-choice goalkeepers Tim Krul and Rob Elliot sidelined until January with ankle and thigh injuries respectively, Alnwick will keep goal through the entire festive period. Jak Alnwick impressed against Newcastle and is all set for his Premier League bow at Arsenal . Alnwick is congratulated by Jack Colback after the Toon inflicted a first defeat of the season on Chelsea . Should he impress – as he did during the second half of last weekend’s 2-1 win over Chelsea – then contract talks will open in the New Year. And Pardew says the young custodian could well be in a position of power. ‘I think Jak knows this is a real game changer for him,’ said the United boss, who yesterday collected the Manager of the Month award for November. ‘It can be seven games, roughly, he might have in goal and it’s a great opportunity for him. ‘Who knows? After five or six we might be kicking ourselves that we didn’t give him a contract. It might have been cheaper! ‘But the ball is very much in Jak’s court and that’s where it will stay until such time as the two goalies come back and we make a decision.’ Alnwick had been in the shadows for five years at St James’ Park before his half-time introduction against the Blues. But Pardew says nothing will faze the younger brother of former Sunderland and Spurs keeper, Ben. ‘Everyone who interviewed him after the game will say he’s a humble guy,’ he said. ‘He’s got no delusions of grandeur but he also believes he’s ready. Although he’s very young to be goalkeeper of Newcastle he’s confident he can do the job and let’s hope he can.’ Alan Pardew was voted November's manager of the month after turning Newcastle's fortunes around . Another player in a similar situation to Alnwick is Sammy Ameobi. His deal is also up at the end of the season but Pardew believes that has been the motivating factor behind his recent good form. ‘I think Sammy having his contract up at the end of the year is a good thing for him,’ he said. ‘It keeps him hungry. He’s turned the tables a bit for himself. That hunger is sometimes a good hunger - let’s hope he continues on that path. ‘But we take risks all the time with contracts. Sometimes you make those calls because of the personality of the player.’ Newcastle fielded five Geordies – Alnwick, Ameobi, Steven Taylor, Paul Dummett and Jack Colback - against Chelsea, and the club has made a deliberate effort to recruit players from within the North-East rather than from abroad. And Pardew added: ‘We’ve worked very, very hard to get that (local players) right and we’re getting the rewards now. ‘It’s something we decided to do and we felt that sometimes bringing players from all over the world can disrupt it a little bit. We’ll maybe wait until they’re a little bit older to go and get those guys and keep the other group local and keep the spirit and work ethic here that the area’s renowned for. ‘All those guys that have come through, I’d be surprised if you could find any of those that you didn’t think was a good person or good character. That’s a part of the academy as well, not just producing players but producing people who are of the right character and right manner.’","Alnwick is set for a spell in Newcastle's team after injuries to Tim Krul and Rob Elliott .

"Swansea City goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski will miss Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Tottenham Hotspur after having his one-match ban confirmed by the Football Association. The Poland international had his appeal claim of wrongful dismissal rejected following an independent regulatory commission hearing on Tuesday. Fabianski was sent off in Swansea's 3-1 Premier League defeat to West Ham at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday. Lukasz Fabianski was sent off on Sunday during Swansea City's Premier League defeat by West Ham United . Swansea appealed against the decision to send off the goalkeeper but his one-match ban has been upheld . The keeper was shown the red card by referee Chris Foy in the 68th minute for a professional foul on Diafra Sakho. Swansea manager Garry Monk claimed Sakho handled the ball before being fouled by Fabianski, leading to the club's appeal. The FA's independent regulatory commission has rejected Swansea's appeal however, ruling Fabianski out of Sunday's clash with Spurs at the Liberty Stadium. 'Swansea City's Lukasz Fabianski will serve a one-match suspension with immediate effect after his claim of wrongful dismissal was dismissed following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today,' the FA confirmed in a statement.

"Gus Poyet feels he now has a responsibility to help Connor Wickham mature into a full England international after he finally committed his future to Sunderland. The 21-year-old put an end to speculation that he could be set to quit the Stadium of Light in the summer after signing a new deal until 2019 earlier this week. Wickham was just 18 when he joined the Black Cats in an £8million move from Ipswich Town. But only this season has he won a regular starting place and spent much of last year on loan in the Championship before returning to score the goals which kept the club in the Premier League. Connor Wickham has signed a new contract to keep him at the Stadium of Light until 2019 . Black Cats boss Gus Poyet believes the striker can progress to the senior England side . The Sunderland striker has won 17 caps for England's Under 21 side without moving up to the seniors . Poyet regrets not spending more time with the forward upon his arrival on Wearside just over a year ago. But the Uruguayan believes that Wickham’s new contract gives them both a platform from which to move forward. ‘It's important for me that Connor's signed his contract. Too many things have been out in the open,’ he said ahead of Saturday's visit of West Ham. ‘In the summer it was the aim to get him tied down but things happen. Decisions are not easy and everything needed to come together - him being happy, wanting to be here and being part of the team. ‘To be honest, not having a chat with him when I arrived was something I didn't do that I regret. ‘I'm delighted (now) because it's not easy to find players like Connor - and you never know how much he can cost. We can talk different prices but for sure we're talking about millions.’ The 21-year-old opens the scoring against champions Manchester City earlier this season . Wickham fires in a shot during the goalless draw with Liverpool in December . Wickham has been capped 17 times by England Under-21s and Poyet believes progression to the senior ranks should now be his aim. ‘There are not too many young English players with that power,’ he said. ‘Maybe the people who worked with him at Under-21 would be surprised if they got the chance to see him again now. ‘They'd be surprised at how much he's improved and how mature he is. Now it depends on us making him better and him scoring goals.’ He added: ‘I forget sometimes he's 21. Because you've been with him for a while, you think he's 24. He's more mature, he knows his game better and what he can do for us. He keeps improving and there's more to come, I'm sure there's more.’ Wickham was named Football League Young Player of the Year before his move to Sunderland. Poyet, though, feels the big-money transfer came too soon in his development. ‘I'm not going to blame anyone, but sometimes when you pay a lot of money for a player, we all think that player's ready, it doesn't matter if he's 18 or 28,’ he said. ‘Unfortunately, or fortunately, there's always room for improvement, so maybe he didn't finish his football education in that natural way. Wickham's goals towards the end of last season kept the Wearside club in the Premier League . Wickham's big money move from Ipswich possibly came too early, suggests Poyet . ‘When you saw him at Ipswich at that age and you sign him for that money, naturally everyone thinks he has to play immediately. ‘He found himself in and out and coming back to the club with different managers and never in a position to play. ‘But it's been good for him so far (this season), he feels part of the team which is important and he's playing at the highest level, which is what he was looking for. You need to play against the very best to get better.’","Wickham has penned a new four-year deal to stay at Sunderland .

"Mauricio Pochettino’s Tottenham have seldom made life easy for themselves this season - and Thursday night was another case in point. They enjoyed plenty of first-half chances and dominated possession throughout against Besiktas in the Ataturk Stadium but couldn’t put their Turkish hosts away. Even a quarter-hour stoppage following a power cut, which plunged the stadium into darkness, couldn’t stem the flow of regular Tottenham attacks and Roberto Soldado, as so often, was the chief culprit, missing two very presentable chances. Nacer Chadli also had a goal chalked off for offside. Cenk Tosun scored the only goal of the game to ensure Besiktas topped their Europa League group . Tottenham goalkeeper Michel Vorm was unable to stop Tosun's strike from nestling into the back of his net . Roberto Soldado should have given Tottenham the lead in the first half but fluffed his chance . Then, the inevitable sucker punch. Michel Vorm hadn’t been tested too often but could do little as Cenk Tosun scored from close range to ensure Besiktas leapfrogged Spurs to finish top of Group C. As Pochettino said afterwards: ‘I’m disappointed because we dominated, but in football you need to score when you create chances and dominate. We had clear chances but we were unlucky in front of goal. ‘One minute in the second-half changed the game and it’s true, we dominated, but we needed to score. It’s disappointing because we deserved more.’ It’s hard to argue with Pochettino’s assessment but as thoughts drift towards Monday’s last 32 draw, he’ll be privately annoyed his team failed to get the job done.

Tottenham playmaker Nacer Chadli evades Kerim Frei Koyunlu during the encounter at Ataturk Stadium . Follow all the latest #UEL action on: . Facebook: UEFAEuropaLeague . Twitter: @EuropaLeague . And at uefa.com . The moral of so many European campaigns is that it’s a good idea to finish top of your group. The equation really is simple. Finish top and you’re one of the seeded clubs - one of the predators rather than the prey. You only have to look at Arsenal in the Champions League to see the benefits of leading the way. Last season, they finished second to Borussia Dortmund in their group and were subsequently eliminated by Bayern Munich. The year before, they trailed Schalke and the same fate befall them. Bayern went on to win the competition. In 2010-11, they were bested in the group by Shakhtar Donetsk - and promptly ousted by Barcelona. A little extra perspiration in the group stage can often lead to greater glories further along the line. Tottenham and Besiktas players talk to the referee after the floodlights failed again in Istanbul . Fans at the Ataturk  Stadium had to use their phones after the lights went out to suspend play . For Tottenham, it means they could be paired on Monday with the likes of Inter Milan, Napoli, Borussia Monchengladbach, Athletic Bilbao or Zenit St Petersburg, rather than Aalborg, Guingamp or Young Boys. That first quintet is, of course, a worst case scenario but Spurs won’t get a great deal of change out of any of the seeds. There’s a sense of inevitability that Spurs will be drawn alongside Zenit in Nyon on Monday and come face-to-face with their former manager Andre Villas-Boas. This is not the tortured soul seen at Spurs or Chelsea either. Villas-Boas’s Zenit may not have advanced in the Champions League but they currently enjoy a seven-point lead in the Russian table. Tottenham boss Pochettino will have been disappointed with his side's performance in Istanbul . Pochettino brought on Aaron Lennon to try and inject some life into Tottenham's side . And a late winter trek to St Petersburg is never an attractive proposition, for fans, players or managers. Other possible long-haul trips include Dinamo Moscow and Dynamo Kiev, though you would fancy Spurs to overcome them. Inter Milan have been familiar foes for Spurs in recent years and while being drawn against the Italian giants may conjure up happy memories of Gareth Bale’s San Siro hat-trick and that two-legged Europa League win, it’s not one they’ll relish. Nor Napoli, who put out Swansea last season, Fiorentina, Bilbao or Sporting Lisbon, who have dropped down from Chelsea’s Champions League group. Olympiacos gave Manchester United an almighty fright last year, while Legia Warsaw is about as hostile as it gets in Europe. Besiktas' players celebrate after their 1-0 win against Tottenham ensures they finish top of Group C . Go through Tottenham’s potential opponents one-by-one and you soon realise that danger lurks everywhere. The Europa League has certainly gained in strength. In many ways, the unseeded portion of the draw isn’t a lot better. But while Spurs could have landed Villarreal, Celtic, Roma, Sevilla or Ajax, they could just as easily pulled out a side with very little European experience like Guingamp or Aalborg. Their fate now rests in the hands of the drawmaster on Monday but Pochettino may live to regret his team not holding out for that draw to top the table in Istanbul.","Tottenham were beaten 1-0 by Besiktas in Turkey on Thursday evening .

"Authorities have identified the mother of two toddlers who were found wandering alone on Thursday morning on a street in Long Beach, California . A relative of the children got in touch with police and named Shenae Irene Dixon, 23, to be the mom of the boys, who were left unaccompanied. Police released a photo of Dixon and have asked for the public's help in locating her. She is described as African-American, 5 feet 5 inches, 150 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. Get in touch: Police are looking to speak with Shenae Irene Dixon, 23, who is believed to be the mother of the boys, who were left unaccompanied in Long Beach . Relatives also told police that they saw a social media post from someone claiming to be Dixon. It stated she was concerned because she knew police were looking for her.

So that's what we're actively investigating right now to see if we can confirm that,' Sgt. Robert Woods reports. Surveillance video from a liquor store near the location where the boys were discovered showed them walking with an unidentified woman on the sidewalk of Atlantic Avenue about 8:45 a.m. Minutes later, the African-American boys, aged about one and two years old, were found alone by Amber Revels, a passerby. Ms. Revels said the children were soiled with urine at the time, and that responding police officers purchased new diapers for them. Police said the African American boys appeared to be in good health but were unsure exactly how long they had been without supervision. Abandoned: The two unidentified children (pictured) found wandering the streets are thought to be one and two years old . The older child was found wearing a brightly colored Incredible Hulk themed t-shirt, shorts and sandals, while the younger boy was wearing a stripey t-shirt and diaper. Police said: 'Witnesses in the immediate area were interviewed but no one was seen with the children or dropping them off. 'The area was searched for any possible video but none was found. A two-block area was also canvassed, however, no one recognizing the children was located.' However, security camera footage from a nearby liquor did show the two toddlers wandering down the sidewalk, KTLA5 reported.

"In these dark days for Rangers, reminders of past success offer at least some consolation. And so it was for Ally McCoist that, following the latest controversy to engulf Ibrox earlier this week over Charlie Telfer, he took a stroll down memory lane. In the corridors of the club’s training base at Murray Park, pictures festoon the walls of the kids for fame from yesteryear who now serve as inspiration to the next generation. Staring back are the fresh faces of Alan Hutton, Charlie Adam, Allan McGregor and Barry Ferguson, who all developed at Rangers from youngsters into multi-million pound English Premier League stars and Scotland internationals. Rangers boss Ally McCoist has revealed he would love to play a side made up of youngsters . Premier League right back Alan Hutton made his name at Rangers before joining Tottenham in 2008 . McCoist deliberately walked down that corridor after Dundee United chairman Stephen Thompson took aim at Ibrox in the wake of being told to pay £204,000 to land out-of-contract Telfer, who quit Rangers frustrated at his lack of first-team chances. The teen midfielder’s case, said Thompson, ‘highlights the need for parents and young players to choose their clubs very, very carefully’. The Ibrox club’s youth policy has been a highly contentious issue as they have worked their way through the lower leagues reliant on well-paid, experienced former top-flight performers, while many Rangers kids have been sent out on loan. McCoist, however, is understandably defensive of his record. While the age of that talented quartet — at 29, Adam is the youngest — precludes them from being used as a recent example of success, they at least seem to have a worthy heir in the shape of Lewis Macleod. Under McCoist, the midfielder has gone from raw teenager in the old Third Division to full Scotland call-up at 20. He is cited by the Rangers boss as evidence that if you are good enough, you are old enough under his management. ‘That’s absolutely the case,’ stressed McCoist. ‘Lewis has come in and done great, while young Fraser Aird has also come in and done well. ‘I think a lot of people would agree with me that it’s easier for youngsters to break into teams outwith the Old Firm. I wouldn’t say the pressure to win is as great at other clubs as it is at the Old Firm. ‘But we’ve have had lots of younger boys break into our team in recent years. Charlie Telfer joined Dundee United at the beginning of June after failing to break into Rangers' first team . Allan McGregor and Charlie Adam also made their names at Rangers before moving to England . ‘In fact, I was just looking at some of the lads who have come through at this club in recent years: McGregor, Hutton, Adam, Ferguson — (and now) Macleod and Aird. There’s been a reasonable few. ‘Of course, in an ideal world, if I could field 11 players from Murray Park that would be the dream scenario. But we all know that’s not going to happen. ‘That doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be taking the responsibility of producing young talent seriously. We always have done that – and that will always be the case.’ McCoist claims he felt Telfer lacked a bit of physicality and was not quite ready to be a regular starter in the Rangers first team until this season, although he insists the 19-year-old left for Tannadice with his best wishes. ‘Charlie was perfectly entitled to turn down our offer,’ the Rangers boss continued. ‘But I feel he would have got a chance with us this season, absolutely. Charlie is an excellent talent, of that there can’t be any doubt. But one of the reasons Charlie didn’t come in at the same time as Lewis Macleod was we felt we had to look after Charlie a little bit more. ‘Lewis certainly handles the aggressive side of the game a lot better and we just felt, as talented as Charlie was and is, we had to look after him that little bit more. ‘With the greatest of respect, particularly in the last couple of years, the standard of the leagues is as such that the younger ones would have needed protected - particularly in the (old Third Division) ‘If we’d fielded a team of youngsters we wouldn’t have won the league. I don’t care what anyone says, I don’t think it would have happened. ‘That kind of statement is made by people that didn’t know the bottom tier or the standard of opposition, the quality of opposition or the physical prowess of the opposition. You have to get a balance. ‘But the fact (we felt Charlie needed looked after at that level) should not be to the detriment of how I felt about him or what hopes and aspirations we had for him at the football club. ‘And I have to tell you he leaves here with our blessing. I say to every youngster that leaves our club - and I genuinely mean it - that I hope they go on and do well in their careers. Lee Wallace is in contention to face Queen of the South after missing his side's last three games . ‘The ones I release I say to them to go out and prove me wrong at another club. That's when one door closes another one opens. I genuinely mean that.’ Defender Lee Wallace comes back into the squad for the match at Queen of the South as Rangers try to get the win to move within six points of Hearts, albeit with a game more played. But keeper Cammy Bell remains in the treatment room along with Macleod. Despite the importance of the game, McCoist is looking forward to meeting up beforehand with his old Kilmarnock team-mate James Fowler, who recently succeeded Jim McIntyre in the dugout at Palmerston. ‘I’m not sure I expected James to become a manager because he was very young when I was at Kilmarnock. But everyone was very young when I was at Kilmarnock,’ said McCoist who turned 36 just weeks after leaving Ibrox for Rugby Park in 1998. ‘He was a very good player and a brilliant lad. I hoped he would get the Queens job and so did Ian Durrant and Kris Boyd, who both know him well, too. ‘So far he’s taking to football management like a fish to water. Or a duck, or a shark; a hammerhead! I look forward to catching up with him on Friday.’","Ally McCoist has insisted the pressure to win games means he cannot field a side full of youngsters .

"Chris Brunt admits stopping Christian Benteke creating 'mayhem' again is key to West Brom's derby hopes. The Baggies skipper is wary of the Aston Villa striker ahead of Saturday's West Midlands clash at The Hawthorns. Benteke has helped Villa to back-to-back wins following a seven-month lay off from a ruptured achilles and scored his first goal of the season in their 1-0 victory at Crystal Palace last week. Christian Benteke celebrates after scoring his first goal of the season against Crystal Palace . The Belgium international has returned to fitness after seven months out with a ruptured achilles . His return was interrupted by a three-game ban after a red card against Tottenham in November but Brunt knows the Baggies must control the Belgium. 'Just kick him,' he joked, when asked how they will deal with Benteke. 'You just have to watch the stuff when we played against them last year, especially the one at Villa Park, where he caused us mayhem. 'He's a big miss for anyone, a striker of that quality. He brings so many different attributes, he's good in the air, a strong guy and he can score goals. He's a good all-round striker. 'For them to lose someone like that for so long was a big blow but to have him back is going to give you and others around you a lift. West Brom's Chris Brunt (centre) has warned that derby success could depend on stopping Benteke . Benteke comes close to scoring in his last game before being denied by Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel . 'He is someone we have to contain because he is a handful.' Brunt, who is a doubt with a hamstring injury, scored in Albion's 4-3 defeat at Villa Park last season where they lost a 2-0 lead for the second time in the campaign. The Baggies were 2-0 up only to draw 2-2 in the first game and the midfielder knows they blew it against Villa. 'At home we ran out of steam but the away game was ridiculously daft,' said the 29-year-old, with Albion one point above the Barclays Premier League drop zone. 'To go in 3-3 at half time in a Premier League game shouldn't be happening. Benteke caused 'mayhem' when the two teams met in the Premier League last season . Benteke celebrates scoring as his side come back from 2-0 down to win 4-3 at Villa Park . 'We were under the new coach (Pepe Mel) at the time and things weren't falling into place and it was pretty obvious on the pitch that night. 'We were all over the place and it could have been 10-10. 'On the night Benteke caused us all sorts of problems and he's a massive danger. We are going to have to be very wary of that, seeing the damage he caused last time.'","West Brom host Aston Villa in the West Midlands derby on Saturday .

"It doesn't happen often, but when four genuine striking superstars come together for 90 minutes you just have to sit back and enjoy. Lionel Messi, Neymar, Luis Suarez and one Zlatan Ibrahimovic all under the same roof doing battle as Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain faced off. Ibrahimovic, of course, sees himself as the main man in that quartet and rocked up at the Nou Camp ready to dazzle on Wednesday night. Typically, he didn't disappoint. Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates putting Paris Saint-Germain ahead at the Nou Camp . Lionel Messi (right) equalises from close range after good work from former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez . Neymar prepares to strike the ball from outside the box, with his superb hit flying in past Salvatore Sirigu . Luis Suarez added the third goal late on as Barcelona confirmed their place in the last 16 as group winners . There is forever an air of Ibrahimovic having something to prove when the Swede is back at his former club - something intensified with the presence of not just Messi but with his trusty attacking double-act as well. Four stars at the peak of their powers would ordinarily be quite enough, but to see each score on the same night is something that barely ever comes round. The four were utterly dominant, a cut above the rest as Barcelona won 3-1  and maintained their spot as group winners. Ibrahimovic put the visitors ahead, intelligently dropping off the front to wrong-foot Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Cue the brash leap in the air and pump of the arms; he brings drama and it had real effect on Barca's stars. Messi and Ibrahimovic embrace respectfully as David Luiz hugs the Argentinian magician . Messi and Neymar are a lethal pairing together - particularly when Suarez is added into the mix . Messi had quite enough of the attention centring on a visitor, gambling at the back post to equalise, while Neymar scored the pick of the bunch. The Brazilian drove on from midfield, forcing the PSG defence to furiously backpedal, and bent a wicked effort from 25 yards. This was blockbuster stuff. Even Suarez got in on the act, notching his second in Barcelona colours after Messi unselfishly allow the striker to tap in from six yards. But it is not just with their goals that set this quartet above the rest. Messi purred, getting himself on the ball consistently and trying to break the resistance de París with a series of mecurial runs, while Ibrahimovic's eyes lit up on more than one occasion as he peppered the home goal. These are the players you pay your money - around £100 for a ticket - to see. Whether there will be many more occasions when four genuine worldbeaters score in the same game seems a tall order. A night to be treasured.","Barcelona beat Paris St-Germain 3-1 at the Nou Camp on Wednesday .

"Rangers boss Ally McCoist has told Dundee United chairman Stephen Thompson to stop ‘moaning’ as the row over the Charlie Telfer transfer fee rumbles on. An SPFL tribunal this week ordered the Tannadice club to fork out £204,000 in compensation to the Ibrox club after signing the youngster in the summer. Rarely used by McCoist, Scotland Under-19 midfielder Telfer turned down a new contract after 10 years at Rangers to team up with Jackie McNamara’s side on a Bosman and was named SPFL Young Player of the Month for November. Dundee United have been told to pay Rangers £204,000 for youngster Charlie Telfer (second from left) After Tuesday’s verdict, United chief Thompson, who had initially offered £100,000 for the 19-year-old, described the figure as ‘ridiculously prohibitive’ and warned it could have a serious impact on young Scottish players’ ability to move clubs under freedom of contract. But McCoist hit back by claiming Thompson has no reason to complain because he knew the regulations before making his move to land the talented teenager. ‘Stephen knew the rules before he went and got Charlie,’ said McCoist. ‘I don’t think you can complain about the rules after you make your own decision. You have to abide by them. ‘Of course I can understand Dundee United’s disappointment and frustration. But they knew the rules before [they signed Telfer] and now they are having a moan about the rules. I’m not so sure I can understand people complaining about the rules after when they know the rules. ‘We got our just rewards for the education we gave Charlie over the last 10 years.’ The Rangers boss will be without star man Lewis Macleod tonight for the Championship clash against Queen of the South but revealed the hamstring injury sustained in the horror Petrofac Training Cup semi-final defeat at Alloa won’t lead to a lengthy spell on the sidelines for the recent Scotland call-up. Rangers boss Ally McCoist believes Dundee United chairman Stephen Thompson should stop complaining . Yet, while McCoist says there is nothing to report on interest in the creative midfielder, he doesn’t expect his injury to render his star player invisible to other clubs. ‘I don’t expect interest probably because I’m not wanting any interest,’ he said. ‘But I’m not daft enough to think that good players don’t attract interest and Lewis is obviously a very, very good player We will just have to react to whatever happens. ‘But it goes without saying that I understand the economics of the whole situation and I wouldn’t be too keen on losing one of our better younger players.’ Meanwhile, Ibrox midfielder Nicky Law has admitted he felt like hiding away after that Indodrill Stadium debacle against Alloa last midweek. But he vowed that effort is not a problem at Ibrox. Telfer (right) tussles with St Mirren's Adam Drury during a Scottish Premiership clash at Tannadice . ‘There’s nobody in our dressing room pointing fingers and accusing others of not trying,’ he said. ‘It’s nothing to do with a lack of effort. We’ve just been switching off at the wrong times. But we are proud professionals and the desire to win this league is huge. ‘But I feel for the fans because they are disappointed. I saw some of them were suggesting we should have gone over to them after losing matches (at Alloa and Hearts), like the Dortmund players did when they lost (at Arsenal in the Champions League). But that’s probably the last thing we should have done. ‘After losing, the last thing our fans would want to shake is our hands. ‘But I feel for the manager too. He’s taking the stick and he’s hurting. But we are the players who are making mistakes and not doing our jobs and we owe it to him to start winning. ‘But we are still in three great competitions we are confident we can still have a good season.’","An SPFL tribunal has ordered Dundee to pay £204,000 for Charlie Telfer .

"David Moyes conceded his first defeat as Real Sociedad coach was thoroughly deserved as Villarreal ran out 4-0 winners - and admitted the result could have been even worse. Former Manchester United boss Moyes had seen Sociedad pick up four points from his opening two Primera Division games in the hotseat while drawing with Real Oviedo in the Copa del Rey last 32 first leg. The Basque side had also not conceded a goal during that three-match unbeaten run, but both those records came to an emphatic end at El Madrigal on Sunday as Villarreal scored four times in the final 27 minutes through Bruno Soriano, Denis Cheryshev and a double from Moi Gomez. David Moyes had no complaints after seeing his Real Sociedad side fall to a heavy defeat at Villarreal . Sergio Canales (left) looks to hold off the challenge from Manu Trigueros (right) during the match on Sunday . Moyes had few complaints about the result, saying in his press conference: 'It could have been more, we could have lost more goals. We made some terrible mistakes, defensively bad mistakes, especially with the third and fourth goals. 'I don't think the first goal was a free-kick, I think it was the wrong decision to give the free-kick, but the best team won. 'In the first 20 minutes of the game we had some opportunities, but not enough tonight. 'We knew we were coming to a difficult ground and we wanted to be hard to beat, and for 50-60 minutes we were, but in the end (it was) not good enough.' Moyes, whose side have slipped to 14th in the Primera Division, had nothing to chastise his players about with regards their attitude, but says they need to do much better with the ball. When asked about the performances of his midfielders, Moyes said: 'I think the players have worked very hard, their effort has been fantastic. The biggest disappointment is that they haven't passed the ball better. Villarreal midfielder Bruno wheels away in celebration after giving the hosts' the lead against Moyes' side . Bruno is congratulated by his team-mates after putting his side ahead against Real Sociedad . 'We need to compete better than we're doing, but their effort has been fantastic, but we're giving the ball away too much.' With the winter transfer window opening soon, Moyes will have the chance to bring in some of his own players, but the Scot said he has not spoken with the club about any reinforcements yet. He said: 'Not yet, I'm still assessing the team. We need a little more time to assess it, but we have to quickly get to a better level than we showed tonight. 'Villarreal are a good Spanish team and we have to try and get to that level.'

"1 Nico Rosberg, Mercedes 1:40.480 . 2 Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes +0.386 . 3 Valtteri Bottas, Williams +0.545 . A warning sign flashed in front of Lewis Hamilton here in the desert night as Nico Rosberg took pole position for the race that will determine the destiny of the world title on Sunday. It is the German’s 11th pole of the season and the most important, coming ahead of an Abu Dhabi Grand Prix that will be fought as much in the head as on the baking track of Yas Marina circuit. They were jigging in the Mercedes garage – Rosberg’s wife Vivian and the Mercedes’ hierarchy – as he beat Hamilton. Rosberg put up his thumb and thrust his forearm out as he came back into the pit lane. It was a gesture of intent. Nico Rosberg will start Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix from pole position ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton . It marked the German’s 11th pole of the season and the most important, coming ahead of the Abu Dhabi race which will determine the title . Rosberg, 17 points adrift of Hamilton, celebrates in front of the camera after the qualifying session in Abu Dhabi on Saturday evening . Rosberg’s lap was faster by 0.386sec, with Hamilton’s final flying lap off the pace from the first sector. However, Hamilton need only finish second to win his second title on Sunday regardless of whether Rosberg wins the race. That is the cushion of the Briton’s 17-point lead going into the weekend. The random factors are the Williams cars. Valtteri Bottas was third and Felipe Massa fourth. ‘It is only one small step,’ said Rosberg, ‘because it is about the championship, not pole position. It would have been great if a Williams got between the two of us. Perhaps that can happen tomorrow.’ Hamilton’s voice was deeper. ‘I enjoyed qualifying but as Nico said tomorrow is the special day.’ There had been a few lively moments earlier in the session. Hamilton locked up in the first session and Rosberg, more dramatically, ran wide in the second. Then Hamilton was far on to the kerbs in his first fast lap in the third. Before the action started, came the phoney war. The German newspaper Bild reported that Hamilton fans were making noise in the yachts in Yas Marina to disturb Rosberg, whose rest room is nearby.Hamilton’s room is next door so I’m not sure it’s a fool-proof plan of disturbance. Despite being slower than Hamilton in the opening two sessions, Rosberg (pictured) made it count when it mattered in Abu Dhabi . Hamilton locks eyes with Valtteri Bottas, who starts third, as he shares a rather awkward congratulatory handshake with pole-sitter Rosberg . Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone shares a cuddle with the British driver in the build-up to Saturday's qualifying session . Jenson Button, in what might be the last Formula One qualifying session of his life, will start eighth, but only after he needed to go back to the pits because McLaren had forgotten to fuel him. ‘Are you joking,’ he said. He still beat his rival for a seat at the team next year, Kevin Magnussen, who will start 11th. Button stands 10-9 in qualifying performances this season. Will that register on the radar of Ron Dennis, who was watching here from the pit wall? Among the first to fall by the harbour side were the Caterhams of Kamui Kobayashi and British rookie Will Stevens. Just making it here was a triumph of sorts for Caterham, whose affairs are being overseen by a pint-sized Irishman called Finbarr O’Connell, the administrator and ballroom dance devotee. He finds himself on the pit wall. He will not get the call to lead Ferrari, of course. They are expected to dispense with team principal Marco Mattiacci to be replaced by Marlboro vice-president Maurizio Arrivabene. There is also a suggestion that Ross Brawn will emerge from his ‘retirement’ to rejoin the team with which he enjoyed so much success as an architect of the Michael Schumacher era. He denied it in a text to Martin Brundle of Sky. Jenson Button, who could be competing at his final grand prix weekend, will start from eighth position in Abu Dhabi . Rosberg must surely win on Sunday and he has given himself every hope after securing pole position with a blistering lap on Saturday .

"Busted: Stephen A. Coronel, 63, was arrested on five counts of 'sexual exploitation of  a minor' A South Carolina guitarist and former KISS songwriter was arrested and charged with child pornography on Friday. Stephen A. Coronel, 63, of Bluffton, former member of Wicked Lester -- the rock and roll band that preceded KISS -- was arrested for 'sexual exploitation of a minor,' according to a Beaufort County arrest report. Authorities say that Coronel was arrested with five counts of the sexual exploitation after a search of his Plantation Point apartment. Sgt. Robin McIntosh of the Beaufort County Sheriff's Office told the Charlotte Observer that deputies seized evidence and a number of electronic devices from Coronel's home. The investigation reportedly began when the U.S. Department of Justice's Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force determined that child pornography had been uploaded from a Bluffton home. The material was tracked to Coronel's computer. Tracked: Officials tracked pornographic images of children to Coronel's computer in Bluffton, South Carolina .

Nearly 15 years later, Coronel holds on to his KISS claim-to-fame by referring to himself on his Facebook profile as a 'KISS-Multi-Platinum Songwriter.'

"The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) is encouraging lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGB&T) couples to research and choose their overseas honeymoon destinations carefully. The introduction of the government's ' Know Before You Go' campaign comes after a survey conducted by OnePoll found that less than half (46 per cent) of LGB&T people investigate whether an area is LGB&T-friendly when planning a honeymoon abroad. Legislation to allow same-sex marriage was put into effect in England, Scotland, and Wales just six months ago. The Foreign Office has launched the 'Know Before You Go' campaign - encouraging LGB&T couples to research their honeymoon destination carefully . The FCO hopes that this campaign will inspire couples to research their trips thoroughly before booking - ensuring that their honeymoon is the trip of a lifetime. One-third of respondents revealed that while they have happy memories of their honeymoon, their experience had been affected by negative location attitudes. Survey findings also revealed that 52 per cent didn't feel confident in selecting a destination overseas guaranteed to be LGB&T-friendly, but that those aged 18-24 were most likely to do some research beforehand. When choosing a honeymoon destination, couples revealed that their primary sources of information are media, LGB&T organisations, family, and friends. John Heppenstall, Head of Consular Campaigns, said: 'All couples looking to book and travel abroad for their honeymoon have an abundance of great destinations to choose from.' In June 2013, UK same-sex marriage supporters marched for equality outside the House of Lords . 'But it's important for same-sex couples to be aware that attitudes toward lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender travellers vary considerably around the world and can be very different from those in the UK.' In some countries, same sex relationships may be punishable by a long imprisonment or the death penalty. 'Our most important piece of advice is to always fully research your destination before booking,' John continued. 'It could be the difference between the trip of a lifetime and one you'd both much rather forget.' A lesbian couple celebrates same-sex marriage in San Francisco, California . Martin Iverson Christensen, European Member of the Board of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), agrees: 'It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of booking a holiday abroad, especially for a special occasion like a honeymoon.' 'But finding out how suitable a destination is should be a priority, so we welcome the initiative by the FCO to publish travel advice for LBTI-people,' he said. 'The ILGA monitors the legislation concerning LGBTI-people closely and our website can give an indication if, for instance, same sex marriage is recognised, or if, on the contrary, being gay or lesbian is considered a crime.'

Wilson and Daniel Purvis had qualified for the blue riband event on the two per country rule, but after Wilson pulled out Whitlock was able to step into his place as he also finished in the top 24. Whitlock said: 'The whole trip has been a rollercoaster. I struggled in qualification and then only learnt that I was in the final as Nile withdrew. I really can't believe I'm now standing with the world silver. 'I think I went out and competed with no pressure, from starting on pommel I nailed my best routine of the week and that set me off. Whitlock of Great Britain competes on the floor during the men's all-around final . Whitlock of Great Britain celebrates during the medal ceremony at Guangxi Sports Center Stadium . 'To compete alongside my idol Uchimura is a huge honour and to be on the medal podium with him is very special. It's been a long year of competitions and this is just unbelievable.' The result capped a strong year for Whitlock, who won team, all-around and floor gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer. Starting on pommel, European champion Whitlock displayed the style and highly difficulty moves that have made him such a renowned pommel worker to achieve a world class score of 16.000 - the highest in the final. He scored 14.460 on his less-favoured rings and followed up on vault with a superb triple twisting routine which he landed dead centre for a terrific 15.366 to put him in silver medal position at the midway point. A very strong mark of 14.975 on the parallel bars preceded a steady 14.200 on the high bar, but Whitlock made sure of the medal with an impressive 15.466 on the floor - a score bettered only by Uchimura. Purvis finished in 11th place with a total of 87.699. The World Championships continue on Friday with the women's all-around final, where Ruby Harrold and Claudia Fragapane will compete for Britain.","Great Britain gymnast Max Whitlock finished behind  Kohei Uchimura .

"Police investigating former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne over his speeding points scandal  secretly obtained the phone records of a journalist . Police chiefs have been ordered by the Prime Minister's privacy watchdog to reveal when snooping powers were used to seize journalists’ phone records. Sir Paul Kennedy, the Interception of Communications Commissioner, launched an inquiry after it emerged forces discover reporters’ confidential sources. It comes after it emerged police investigating disgraced former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne over the speeding points scandal which ended his career secretly obtained the phone records of a journalist and one of his sources for the story - even though a judge had agreed that the source could remain confidential. It came after it was previously revealed that Scotland Yard used snooping powers – in Regulation of Investigatory Powers act – to obtain a Sun journalist's phone records to uncover a whistleblower in the Plebgate affair, in which the former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell was accused of calling police ‘plebs’. Sir Paul said he was concerned ‘about the protection of journalistic sources so as to enable a free press’. Downing Street said David Cameron believed the ‘right oversight mechanisms’ were in place for monitoring the use of Ripa, but stressed that his approach was to be ‘supportive of our tradition of investigative journalism’. It comes comes after the Press Gazette launched its ‘Save Our Sources’ campaign, urging the commissioner to take action. A petition as part of the campaign, which was directed at Sir Paul, has attracted more than 1,000 signatures. Ripa powers enable police forces and other public authorities to obtain telephone data without judicial approval. It recently emerged that a Kent police officer was granted authorisation to obtain the billing and call data of a Mail on Sunday journalist, alongside his source, who was later unmasked as a freelance journalist. The pair, whose data were obtained from their landline and mobile phone service providers, had been in discussions with Constance Briscoe, the judge who was investigated by police over a false claim that she had not spoken to the press about the affair. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) initially applied under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (Pace), which enshrines the principle of journalistic privilege and allows journalists and their employers to make representations to the court to protect their sources. But the judge ruled that while the Mail on Sunday did have to disclose material, it could do so with names of sources redacted. Unknown to the Mail on Sunday, Kent police secretly went to the journalist's mobile phone provider and ordered the release of records using powers under Ripa, which does not require judicial approval. Last month it emerged accidentally that Scotland Yard had obtained the Sun's newsdesk telephone records and those of its political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, to try to identify who had leaked the Plebgate story about Mr Mitchell's altercation with police at the gates of Downing Street. Sir Paul said his office would report all findings to the Prime Minister, and publicly, to develop ‘clarity in relation to the scope and compliance of this activity’. In addition, it was reported the Home Affairs Select Committee has asked every police force in the UK to reveal how many times they have obtained the telephone and email records of journalists without their consent. Scotland Yard used snooping powers – contained in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers act – to obtain a Sun journalist Tom Newton Dunn's phone records to uncover a whistleblower in the Plebgate affair . The 'RIPA' powers enable police forces and other public authorities to obtain telephone data without judicial approval and were used in the Plebgate affair involving former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell (above) Keith Vaz, chairman of the committee, said he wanted a detailed breakdown of police use of Ripa powers to force telecoms companies to hand over phone records without customers' knowledge. Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘The Government needs to urgently address the fact that the Interception of Communications Commissioner has warned that spying powers are being over-used by some police forces. ‘Quite simply, if the police can't get it right with the powers they already have then it is completely irresponsible for the Home Office to be planning on increasing those powers. ‘The inadequacy and inconsistency of the records being kept by public authorities about how they are using these powers is woefully inadequate. Correcting this would not require new laws so it should not wait until after the election. ‘If the Government fails to address these serious points, we can already know that there will be many more innocent members of the public who will be wrongly spied on and accused. This is simply unacceptable.’ Sir Paul is currently acting as interim Interception of Communications Commissioner while Sir Anthony May recovers from a serious accident at the beginning of July.","Interception of Communications chief Sir Paul Kennedy launches an inquiry .

"The European Tour has implemented a points system for the new season in the hope of simplifying the Race to Dubai. There was some confusion last term when the Tour converted euros earned into points ahead of the Final Series, with each of the final four events of the season having 10million points on offer in the Race as opposed to its prize money total. That system will remain in place for the Final Series but throughout the season one euro earned will equal one Race to Dubai point from the very first event - which takes place this week at the Nedbank Golf Challenge - until the Hong Kong Open in October. Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy leads the Race to Dubai standings for the 2014 season . The enhanced points system will then apply for the BMW Masters, WGC-HSBC Champions, Turkish Airlines Open and DP World Tour Championship, with the man with the most points being awarded the Harry Vardon Trophy. The points will not be reset before the Final Series like they are for the FedEx Cup on the PGA Tour. 'Following the success of The 2014 Race to Dubai, won by Rory McIlroy for the second time in three years after a superb season, The European Tour has decided to implement a points system for the duration of the 2015 campaign,' said Chief Operating Officer of the European Tour Keith Waters. The points system will change for next season, with one euro earned equalling one points from first event . 'We believe that changing to a points system will help simplify and indeed enhance the narrative structure of The Race to Dubai, and particularly the Final Series which will again carry a combined 40 million points, with 1,666,600 points on offer to the winner of each event. 'The conversion to a points system will complement an exciting and robust schedule in 2015, which will feature a minimum of 47 tournaments, including the addition of five new events.' McIlroy won this season's Race to Dubai despite only taking part in one of the Final Series following his four victories which included the Open Championship and the US PGA Championship.

"Chelsea have become the first club in the Barclays Premier League to adopt the national living wage and Luton Town have become the first in the Football League, too. The UK living wage is £7.85 an hour (but £9.15 in London) and will be the minimum level by which all staff at Chelsea and Luton will now be paid. Luton have insisted they will not pass on any of the extra cost to the fans in terms of increased ticket or retail prices, despite becoming the first of the Football League's 92 to adopt such a policy. Chelsea have become the first club in the Barclays Premier League to adopt the national living wage . Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck told their official website: 'As a responsible employer we are proud of this significant achievement for the club. ‘We believe the move to the Living Wage underlines our commitment to ensuring that all our employees receive a fair rate of pay for their hard work and dedication. Quite simply it is the right thing to do.’ David Lammy MP previously campaigned for Premier League sides in London to adopt the £9.15 level of the living wage. Following the announcement by Luton, Lammy tweeted his support. He said: 'League 2 club with 1 of the smallest budgets becomes 1 of Eng's 92 pro clubs to commit to Living Wage. Puts bigger club to shame.' Luton, in a message on their official website, revealed: 'This (the living wage) applies to all contracted members of staff in all departments including football, retail, catering, maintenance and administration. Luton Town, whose mascot Happy Harry is pictured, have adopted the national living wage for all staff . 'The change to staff pay will be absorbed by the club and there will be no increases in ticket or retail prices as a result.'

"Craig Cullen, 29, admitted arson at Swansea Crown Court and faces around seven-and-a-half years in jail . A blundering arsonist was caught while torching a packed nightclub after he managed to set fire to his own feet. Craig Cullen, 29, was filmed throwing petrol over the back door of the bar, which had 200 people inside, before igniting it into a huge fireball. But the blaze at Oxygen club in Swansea  got quickly out of control and set the arsonist's shoes alight as well. Cullen is then seen trying to run away with his feet on fire before he is caught by nightclub staff in April this year. Owner Kai Lui carried out a citizen's arrest on Cullen who appeared in court yesterday where he admitted arson. Mr Lui said: 'We put the safety of clubbers first and we ensure all our 31 cameras are monitored at all times. 'As soon as we saw what was happening we went to the fire exit and got hold of the culprit until the police came. 'It could have been my children who were in the club at the time. This was extremely dangerous. Scroll down for video .

Packed: The club, in Swansea city centre, had around 200 people inside on the night Cullen set the fire . 'This could have been terrible and we are glad we were able to prevent would could have been a very serious incident before it happened.' Cullen tried to start the fire after getting in an argument with his ex-girlfriend in the street outside the club. He told her that if she got into the club he would torch it and sent her a text saying: 'I'm going to burn it down you s***.' Blaze: He then ignites the fire and walks away, but the blaze is soon out of control and his shoes also set alight . Escape: Cullen quickly runs down the steps trying to put out the fire on his shoes out as the blaze gets bigger . Swansea Crown Court was played CCTV which showed him climbing the steel fire escape at the club. Cullen is then seen splashing petrol all over the steel door before taking a flame from his pocket and setting it alight.

"Roberto Martinez insist he has no concerns about Ross Barkley’s form as he predicted the Everton midfielder will play a crucial role in the second half of the campaign. Barkley has only scored one goal in his last 23 games for club and country and his play in recent weeks has lacked the vibrancy that became the norm during last season, when he cemented his place as a regular. It has been difficult campaign for Barkley, as he suffered a knee ligament problem in August that ruled him out for seven weeks and his manager says he is only just getting back to full fitness. VIDEO Scroll down for Roberto Martinez: Ross Barkley is growing and having an influence . Roberto Martinez is not concerned about Ross Barkley's (pictured) dip in form this season . The Everton boss believes the young English talent will play a big part in the second half of the season . Barkley (right) was part of the team who were held to a 1-1 draw with Hull City on Wednesday night . He said: 'He is a goalscorer. He has an instinct to score goals and be dangerous in the final third. He is now fully fit. In the last two games he has played a really big part. He is slowly getting to his best level. 'I am really looking forward to the second half of the season. He is in constant development and a constant learning process. He is a phenomenal talent but the most impressive aspect of him is his character and his willingness to learn.' Having had just one win in five games, the Toffees manager was puzzled by his teams form. 'Stats are confusing. I could say we have only lost one in 10. This season has been intense. It has been very good in that we have been tested and pushed. 'We probably haven’t got the points that we deserved but the first half of the season was about pushing ourselves. The margins have to be very small.' Martinez (right) hailed the attitude of Romelu Lukaku's (left) attitude after the World Cup . Martinez marveled at the form of Sergio Aguero this season and believes Man City are playing with swagger . Romelu Lukaku has lead the line for Martinez this season, and the Spaniard is impressed with what the his Belgian striker has brought to the team this season. 'When he got back from the World Cup, what impressed me most was that he wanted to get back and help the team. The way he committed himself was very impressive.' Martinez's side are the visitors to the Etihad in the late kick-off on Saturday and the Everton boss has been one of the many fans of City's prolific striker Sergio Aguero. 'He is phenomenal. He is one of those players who can win a game on his own. Every season you get a player who can do that and Aguero is in that moment. 'The win against Bayern Munich has changed the atmosphere. They are playing with a real swagger. It will be difficult but we didn’t get what we deserved at Tottenham and Hull and we will go there and try to get something.' The Toffee's boss believes English football is making steps forward after the FA's England DNA Programme was unveiled on Thursday. 'I think it is very positive. It starts a really good debate. Every country has a bit of a path, thinking along the same lines. You have seen it from Belgium, Holland, Spain, those long-term plans help countries develop a way of playing. 'You should not be afraid to look around. Football is an expression of your culture.

"England midfielder Fabian Delph returned to training on Friday as he fights to return for some of Aston Villa's Christmas fixtures. The 25-year-old dislocated his shoulder in October and was ruled out until the end of December. Delph, who has impressed since breaking into Roy Hodgson's side this season, missed England's recent Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and the friendly against Scotland as well as crucial Barclays Premier League games for Villa. Fabian Delph returned to Aston Villa training on Friday after dislocating his shoulder in October . The midfielder underwent surgery and manager Paul Lambert is pleased with his progress .

However, Paul Lambert revealed the Yorkshireman is making good progress since having surgery and was able to make a tentative return to training this week. The Villa boss, also without key defenders Ron Vlaar and Philippe Senderos at the moment, said: 'Fabian's coming on, he trained with the team today (Friday). 'It's non-contact at the minute but he's doing really well. 'Ron will maybe do a bit of training on Saturday with the team, he's more advanced than Philippe. He's coming on. I'd like to think we can get into the new year with both of them back. Delph battles for the ball with Xherdan Shaqiri duing England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Switzerland .

And if things go well with Philippe, maybe we can get him back by the end of the month. 'Slowly but surely we're starting to get guys back.' Lambert has taken stick from some supporters recently as Villa show signs of heading for another flirt with relegation but he insists things are not as bad as many suggest. Ahead of Sunday's clash with Leicester, he said: 'We're sitting 12th at the moment, two points behind Everton, who had a massive season last year, so it's not all doom and gloom. It's the media who portray that. 'We are where we are. We had a hard run of games but we're undefeated in the last four matches and they've been tough, tough games for us but we're slowly but surely getting there.'

"The recent miseries of Hereford United reached a new low on Wednesday after the club were suspended by the FA and ordered to stop ‘all football activity’. Their latest crisis strikes with depressing timing, coming just two days after the draw for the third round of the FA Cup — the competition in which Hereford achieved the most famous Cup upset of all against Newcastle in 1972. The game’s authorities acted after one of the financially stricken club’s shareholders, Alan McCarthy, was charged with acting as an officer for Hereford without written confirmation from the FA to do so. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hereford's famous FA Cup giantkilling of Newcastle . Hereford's class of '72, including Ronnie Radford (top left), celebrate victory against Newcastle . Newcastle keeper Wille McFaul is left grasping at thin air as Radford's shot whizzes past him . Hereford United, also known as the Bulls, have been hit by another punishment from the FA . It’s awful news. In my long experience and years in football I cannot recall such an occasion. It’s bad. Since I joined the club in 1971 and before then, Hereford were well run by local businessmen with the interests of the club at heart. It was always one of the best-run clubs in non-League football. They attracted bigger crowds and bigger names — the man who brought me in was the great John Charles. But for one reason or another it’s gone away from that in the last few years. It is really sad. I’m a member of the Supporters’ Trust and I try to keep on top of what is going on — it’s not been nice to follow. I was with Ronnie Radford just a couple of weeks ago filming something for the BBC about the FA Cup — it’s a shame to go from that to this. We are all scattered far and wide from that side but the club remains a big part of us. What has happened has shocked me but I can’t say it has surprised me. What I hope happens now is that the club is eventually passed into the hands of the Supporters’ Trust. It can work when you do it that way. I certainly can’t see a shining knight coming in. Ricky George scored the famous second goal in the 2-1 win when non-League Hereford knocked out First Division Newcastle in the FA Cup third round in 1972. Hereford’s new majority shareholder, Andy Lonsdale, is understood to be confident that the situation will be resolved today and the sanction removed immediately. But the saga represents a humiliating low for the club, which is believed to owe £1.5million and is due at the High Court in London on Monday to contest a winding-up petition. The local council also confirmed it is ‘thoroughly re-examining’ the terms of the lease of the Edgar Street ground as the club fights to save its future. Martin Watson, vice-chairman of the Hereford United Supporters’ Trust, told Sportsmail: ‘The winding-up petition is the real worry. ‘This suspension is not what anyone wanted but the FA should have done something here a long time ago. ‘It should not have come to the situation that the club are in.’ Cash-strapped Hereford were expelled from the Football Conference in June for failing to pay creditors . The club have been based at their Edgar Street home since 1924 but now face an uncertain future . The court date will come only six months after Hereford were expelled from the Conference over their failure to clear debt and deposit a £350,000 bond. They have since found themselves in the Southern League Premier Division — the seventh tier of English football — and a supporter protest against the running of the club has seen their average gate fall from 1,758 last season to little more than 400. Lonsdale, who took over the club on Wednesday having previously been chairman, has promised significant investment to keep them afloat. But supporters are hugely sceptical and critical of a man who had 21 appointments at 17 dissolved companies and was disqualified from being a company director from October 2006 for six years. Despite the growing uncertainty over the 90-year-old club’s future, Hereford assistant manager Neil Phelps insisted on Wednesday that Hereford are continuing to prepare for their fixture at Dunstable on Saturday. He said: ‘We’re still training full-time and still expecting a game Saturday.’ In revealing their decision to suspend Hereford, an FA statement read: ‘Having failed to comply with the orders of the independent regulatory commission, both Hereford United and Alan McCarthy are suspended from all football and football activity with immediate effect. ‘The FA understands the importance of football clubs to their local communities and will continue to work with all relevant parties to ensure senior football returns to Hereford at the earliest opportunity, although this will be contingent on the club complying with the regulations and subsequent orders of the independent regulatory commission.’ Hereford sit 15th in the Evo-Stick Southern Premier League and were due to play Dunstable on Saturday .","Hereford United's future is uncertain after latest FA punishment .

"Gus Poyet has echoed the sentiments of one his Sunderland predecessors by conceding his club have to work overtime to attract top-quality players to the north-east. Former Black Cats boss Roy Keane launched an infamous tirade in August 2007 in which he blasted 'weak and soft' stars who 'don't want to come [to Sunderland] because their wife wants to go shopping in London.' The mild-mannered Poyet did not go quite that far but he would did acknowledge that geographical issues will make the job of luring improvements to the Stadium of Light in January all the more difficult. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet has bemoaned potential new signings preferring moving to London . Poyet said: 'When you give certain types of players the option of going to London or the north-east in the same conditions, 99 from 100 will choose London and that's the reality. 'We have to be a step ahead - we have to do things better than those clubs in the south or in other countries in a nice place with different weather. 'We need to do something that will convince them to come to the north. On top of that it is even more difficult in January because clubs don't want to lose their best players, so everything needs to come together.' England Under 21 striker Connor Wickham has signed a new four-year deal with Sunderland . Poyet has seen his side's prospects improve after a gruelling week which saw combative draws against Chelsea and Liverpool which sandwiched a 4-1 home thrashing by a Sergio Aguero-inspired Manchester City. Victory over West Ham on Saturday would give the Black Cats a major boost ahead of their festive fixture programme and could convince Poyet to stay the course with his current squad for the remainder of the season. Poyet added: 'When a player of more than decent quality becomes available there are too many people who want him.

"A unique collection of pictures taken during the early days of photography have given a rare insight into Victorian Britain. The 350 images were taken by amateur photographer Emma Johnston, who is considered to be one of the 19th century's lost figures of the art form. Experts say very little is known about the middle class woman apart from the fact she lived in Hampstead.

Children from the Hawkes family sit for a portrait by Miss Johnston. Many of her subjects were pictured while visiting her manor house in Hampstead . A close up of Edward, Walter and Edith Hawkes. Many of Miss Johnston's images document the activities of her immediate circle of family and friends . Many of her photogrpahs show the long list of visitors she welcomed to the Manor House, where she lived with her unmarried father. The first photographic images were taken in Britain in 1834 with the common process for developing pictures beginning in 1841. Miss Johnston's pictures are believed to have been taken between 1858 and 1864. Miss Johnston's images, including this one of a dog called Charlie, are believed to have been taken between 1858 and 1864 . The collection of Miss Johnston's pictures are set to go under the hammer at Bonhams in London where they could fetch up to £15,000 . Next month, the pictures are set to go under the hammer  at Bonhams in London, where they could fetch up to £15,000. Mathew Haley, Bonhams Head of Books, said: 'Emma Johnston stands in a great tradition of Victorian women photographers. 'Unlike her famous contemporaries, Lady Hawarden, admired for her technical and artistic achievements and Julia Margaret Cameron, who gained recognition for her celebrity portraits, Emma was chiefly concerned with the daily round of her own social circle which may explain why this most talented of amateurs has been unjustly neglected.'

Mathew Haley, Bonhams Head of Books, said: 'Emma Johnston stands in a great tradition of Victorian women photographers . At the time, although Hampstead was not part of London, many big names visited the house. These included William Wardell, the architect of St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney and St Patrick's in Melbourne, Frederick Edwards the geologist-palaeontologist and George Waterhouse curator at London Zoo.

"Dr Shahid Ayyoun, 57, has been struck off by the General Medical Council after groping the breasts of a 22-year-old during a consultation . A doctor who massaged a patient’s breasts with oil when she went to be treated for whiplash has been struck off. Dr Shahid Ayyoub told the 22-year-old she had a muscular problem before lifting up her top and unclasping her bra. The 57-year-old repeatedly stroked her breasts during the prolonged attack in a locked consultation room at the West Point Practice in Leeds. He also grabbed the scared woman’s hair and pushed her head into his groin during the  50-minute appointment on 12 June 2012. The woman, referred to as Patient A, was left feeling ‘violated and upset’ by the assault, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard. The medic, who did not attend the hearing, instructed his solicitors to ask the MPTS panel to restrict his role - allowing him to conduct examinations in the presence of a chaperone or only seeing male patients. But the panel said his actions were a 'gross abuse of trust in his position as a doctor', and was told he is no longer allowed to practise. Ayyoub worked for St Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust in Merseyside before he was found guilty of sexual assault by a jury at Leeds Crown Court in January. Judge Geoffrey Marson QC jailed him for 12 months but on appeal the sentence was reduced to six months. The shamed medic, from Sutton Heath in St Helens, Merseyside, was also ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for seven years and pay £2,275 in costs. Disgraced Ayyoub has now been struck off the medical register following a two-day  hearing in Manchester. But panel chairman Dr Brian Crompton said: ‘The offences for which Dr Ayyoub was convicted were serious in nature; they were sexually motivated; they took place in a clinical setting; and they involved a female patient who was consulting with him in order to assist her claim for compensation following a road traffic accident. Announcing the decision to strike Ayyoub off, he added: ‘In all the circumstances, the panel has concluded that the nature of Dr Ayyoub’s convictions is so serious as to be fundamentally incompatible with his continuing to be a registered medical practitioner. ‘For these reasons, the panel has determined that erasure is the only means of protecting patients, maintaining public confidence in the profession and declaring and upholding proper standards of conduct and behaviour.’ Stephen McNally, for the General Medical Council, earlier told the panel the doctor’s crimes had ‘brought the profession into disrepute.’ Opening the case, he explained how Ayyoub’s victim had consulted the medic as part of an insurance claim after suffering a car accident. ‘Dr Ayyoub expressed the view her symptoms were as a result of a muscular problem and said he would give her a massage to ease the pain,’ he said. The shamed medic also grabbed the scared woman’s hair and pushed her head into his groin during the 50-minute appointment at West Point Practice, Leeds, in 2012 . After the attack, Ayyoub then left the room to speak to other waiting patients and the young woman realised the door had been locked, the panel heard. ‘When he returned he continued to massage Patient A and despite her saying she needed to leave he continued to massage her back and down her sides as previously,’ Mr McNally said. ‘He started to place his hands underneath her body and fully onto her chest and breast, rubbing his hands over her breasts down her body and onto her stomach. ‘He focused more and more on her breasts, stroking her breasts repeatedly, moving his hands down onto her stomach.’ By this time she was very uncomfortable, but the doctor continued despite her telling him she needed to go, the hearing was told. Mr McNally added: ‘Patient A described that Dr Ayyoub grabbed her roughly by the hair and pushed her head towards his groin area. ‘At that stage she pulled away from him, got to her feet and said she had to leave.’ She was able to unlock the door and leave the room, and complained to the practice and police later that day. In a statement produced in the crown court trial she said: ‘The incident initially left me feeling scared about what was going to happen. ‘I didn’t know what to do and didn’t feel like I could just get up and leave because he was a doctor and you put your trust in doctors. ‘It left me feeling violated and upset and I felt like I didn’t know what to do with myself.’ Ayyoub has 28 days to appeal the decision before he is struck off the medical register.","Dr Shahid Ayyoub told a 22-year-old she had a muscular problem .

"Salt is damaging crop-growing soil around the world and it could lead to a shortage of food by 2050. That's according to a UN study that says 7.7 square miles (19.9 square km) of irrigated land has been lost every day for 20 years due to salt degradation. And they say this could mean lower crop yields and even health problems in future. A study by Canadian-based researchers at the UN University says that salt degradation is ruining crop yields around the world. Salt degradation is caused by improper drainage in irrigation systems. In areas such as the Pakistan, this can reduce rice yields (stock image shown) by 69 per cent . The study was conducted by the UN University's Canadian-based Institute for Water, Environment and Health. They say today an area the size of France is affected by salt degradation - about 62 million hectares (20 per cent) of the world's irrigated lands - up from 45 million hectares in the early 1990s. Salt degradation occurs when the salt content (salinity) in soil becomes too high. While it can be caused by natural processes, it can also be caused by artificial processes like irrigation. Without a proper drainage system, salts will be left behind after plants use water and begin to accumulate. When the soil salinity becomes too high the yield potential of certain crops drops. This is because they are unable to absorb as much moisture from the soil. Severely degraded soils can have less than half of their full potential. To prevent salt degradation a proper drainage system should be installed to wash the excess salt away. It can be reversed in a process called salt restoration, though, by planting trees, plowing more deeply and other methods. Salt degradation occurs in arid and semi-arid regions where rainfall is too low to maintain regular movement of rainwater through the soil and where irrigation is practiced without a natural or artificial drainage system. If irrigation is not practiced with appropriate drainage management this can trigger the accumulation of salts, in turn reducing the productivity of soil. The cost of salt degradation is estimated at around £275 ($441), which means it is about £17 billion ($27.3 billion) for the past year. The effects of salt degradation are numerous. In India's Indo-Gangetic Basin, for example, salf-affected lands where cotton is grown could have a yield up to 63 per cent less than healthy land. In the Indus Basin in Pakistan, meanwhile, the crop yield for rice was found to be up to 69 per cent lower. And the issue is also a problem for Western countries with the economic impact of salt degradation in the Colorado River Basin in the US estimated at £470 million ($750 million). The researchers warn that, if left untended, the problem could lead to food shortage issues towards the middle of this century.

While it can be caused by natural processes, it can also be caused by artificial processes like irrigation. Without a proper drainage system, salts will be left behind after plants use water and begin to accumulate (stock image shown) 'To feed the world's anticipated nine billion people by 2050, and with little new productive land available, it's a case of all lands needed on deck,' says principal author Dr Manzoor Qadir, Assistant Director of Water and Human Development at the UN University's Canadian-based Institute for Water, Environment and Health. - Aral Sea Basin, Central Asia, . - Indo-Gangetic Basin, India . - Indus Basin, Pakistan . - Yellow River Basin, China . - Euphrates Basin, Syria and Iraq . - Murray-Darling Basin, Australia . - San Joaquin Valley, United States . 'We can't afford not to restore the productivity of salt-affected lands.' Dr Zafar Adeel, Director of UNU-INWEH, notes the UN Food and Agriculture Organization projects a need to produce 70 per cent more food by 2050, including a 50 per cent rise in annual cereal production to about three billion tonnes. 'Each week the world loses an area larger than Manhattan to salt-degradation,' he explains. 'A large portion of the affected areas in developing countries have seen investments made in irrigation and drainage but the infrastructure is not properly maintained or managed. 'Efforts to restore those lands to full productivity are essential as world population and food needs grow, especially in the developing world.' All hope is not lost, though. The researchers say there are a number of techniques that can be used to halt the issue of salt degradation, and even reverse the process. These include tree planting, deep plowing, cultivation of salt-tolerant varieties of crops, mixing harvested plant residues into topsoil and digging a drain or deep ditch around the salt-affected land. The study, Economics of Salt-induced Land Degradation and Restoration, was published in the UN Sustainable Development journal Natural Resources Forum.","A study by Canadian-based researchers at the UN University says that salt degradation is ruining crop yields around the world .

"Women who take paracetamol during pregnancy may increase the risk of their child developing ADHD . Women who take paracetamol during pregnancy may increase the risk of their child developing ADHD, new research has found. While it is the most common drug taken to relieve pain, a New Zealand researcher said the new findings were 'alarming'. The Auckland University backs a Danish study from earlier this year which linked the popular painkiller to behavioural disorders. The study analysed data from a study of 871 European infants. The researchers analysed the drug use of paracetamol, aspirin, antacids, and antibiotics during pregnancy. They then measured behavioural difficulties and ADHD symptoms in children at age seven and age 11. Almost half of the study mothers took paracetamol during pregnancy and their children were more at risk of behavioural difficulties and ADHD. The other drugs caused no significant differences in behaviour, the study found. ‘The finding that even low doses of paracetamol (indicated by the number of weeks of drug exposure) can affect behaviour seven years later is alarming because it is the most commonly used antenatal drug,’study leader Dr John Thompson said. VIDEO Scroll down for advice on paracetamol use when pregnant . But the study did not have data on whether the ADHD symptoms continued in puberty, if the parents had ADHD, or what kind of dosage and in which trimester the mothers had used paracetamol. ‘More research is needed to provide a more precise assessment of the risk and consequences of taking this pain killer during pregnancy,’ Dr Thompson said. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD affects five to 10 per cent of school-age children in New Zealand, making it the most common neurodevelopmental disorder for the age group.

"Sir David Attenborough has accused the BBC of making too many cookery programmes and quiz shows and not enough landmark documentaries. He said the corporation’s decision-making is so slow it is no longer able to produce classic series such as Civilisation or Life on Earth. Instead, our screens are dominated by quiz shows, drama series and cookery programmes such as the BBC’s The Great British Bake Off, all of which he refuses to watch. Instead, our screens are dominated by quiz shows, drama series and cookery programmes such as the BBC’s The Great British Bake Off, all of which he refuses to watch . The veteran wildlife presenter said he was able to make some of his greatest programmes because he had the freedom to pursue his ideas – and health and safety was treated as a ‘joke’. But he suggested he would no longer be able to make them under the current stifling management culture. ‘The trouble is, the BBC falls over backwards with all kinds of committees and surveys to make sure that [the commissioning process] is as fair as it can possibly be, but the consequence is it moves at an elephantine pace,’ he told the Radio Times. Sir David, 88, was controller of BBC Two in the 1960s and 1970s and commissioned some of the corporation’s best known series, such as Kenneth Clark’s Civilisation in 1969. The following decade, he made his own landmark documentary, Life on Earth, which also ran for 13 episodes. Sir David, 88, was controller of BBC Two in the 1960s and 1970s and commissioned some of the corporation’s best known series, such as Kenneth Clark’s Civilisation in 1969 (above) But he said there is now a shortage of long-running highbrow programmes about subjects such as science, natural history and music on the BBC. ‘There are a great number of subjects that aren’t covered,’ he added. Sir David accused station controllers of being obsessed by just a few genres that become ‘flavour of the month’. In 1979, Sir David made Life on Earth (abive) and now has a new BBC One natural history series called Life Story . The presenter, who has made a new BBC One natural history series called Life Story, added: ‘I don’t watch any cookery programmes, whether they are competitive, whether it’s the Great Bake Off, or… I don’t watch quizzes either. I mean, they’re perfectly OK – I’m not being snobbish about them – but I’ve quite a lot to do and I don’t put on the television as a sort of “filler”.’ His comments came after actor Charles Dance, 68, criticised British TV drama directors. ‘I don’t think enough risks are being taken in drama television in the UK and I think a lot of programme makers are underestimating the intelligence of the viewing public, basing it all on ratings,’ he told The Guardian. A BBC spokesman said: ‘With current shows like Wonders of the Monsoon, and the forthcoming series Life Story, the BBC’s reputation for producing world-class natural history programming is as strong today as it’s ever been.’","Sir David, 88, was controller of BBC Two in the 1960s and 1970s .

"Heavy drinking was the cause of ten million visits to English hospitals last year, figures have revealed. In the first all-encompassing analysis of the toll of alcohol on the health service, experts put the total cost of treatment at £2.8billion. Charities last night said that the country’s booze culture is putting an ‘intolerable strain’ on the NHS. Scroll down for video . High price of drink: Alcohol abuse costs the health service £2.8billion (picture posed by models) Previous attempts to quantify the impact of alcohol on hospitals have focused only on inpatient visits requiring an overnight stay, with most estimates at one million alcohol-related admissions a year. But the latest research – with outpatient admissions and A&E trips also taken into account – puts the true impact of drinking at ten times higher. The analysis also calculates the long-term impact of heavy drinking, such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. The charity Alcohol Concern, which examined official figures provided by the NHS, found that alcohol caused 9.96million visits to English hospitals in 2012/13. That included 6.3million visits to A&E, 992,000 overnight admissions to inpatient wards, and 2.67million day visits to outpatient wards. Hospital staff report that A&E units are turning into war zones, particularly at weekends. Health Minister Norman Lamb has called for a £50 fine for those who ‘gratuitously’ consume too much alcohol and then abuse health staff when they are taken to hospital. Mr Lamb said in August: ‘There’s an issue with youngsters drinking too much. It’s having a massive impact on people’s health and the consequences for them further down the line are enormous.’ But Alcohol Concern’s report shows that while A&E admissions are a huge source of problems, long-term drinking is also placing a burden on the NHS because it causes diseases which are expensive to treat. Its research reveals that 47 per cent of all admissions for head and neck cancer – including tumours of the mouth and throat – are linked to drinking. Just over 13 per cent cases of breast cancer are also attributed to alcohol. Toll: More than 6million of the visits were to A&E units and a million included overnight stays in hospital . Some 15 per cent of gastrointestinal cancers, 13.5 per cent of hypertensive disease such as heart disease and stroke, and 23.4 per cent of epilepsy admissions are rooted in heavy drinking. According to the charity’s Alcohol Harm Map, men aged 55 to 75 were the most likely to be admitted to hospital due to alcohol misuse. And some 9.6million people are now drinking in excess of Government guidelines, including 2.4million who are classed as high risk. Those rated high-risk drink more than eight units of alcohol a day – about three pints of beer or four large glasses of wine. While A&E admissions accounted for the vast majority of visits, inpatient admissions cost far more, making up two-thirds of the total cost burden of £2.8billion. Alcohol Concern chief executive Jackie Ballard said: ‘The NHS is now facing an intolerable strain from alcohol-related illnesses. ‘This is not just from readily identifiable causes such as A&E visits and admissions for liver disease, but from a significant number of other conditions in which alcohol plays a major, but often under-appreciated part. ‘We urgently need action to prevent alcohol misuse. The most effective of which is for the Government to implement a minimum unit price, which has the potential to save the economy millions, and most importantly save lives.’ Government agency Public Health England said alcohol harm was going in the wrong direction as it repeated calls for minimum pricing to be introduced. Rosanna O’Connor, director of the alcohol, drugs and tobacco division at PHE, said: ‘Alcohol harms are unacceptably high and much of this is preventable. ‘PHE will continue to promote the evidence for a minimum unit price on alcohol and other measures to reduce harm, raise awareness of the harms to those drinking at risk, as well as promoting good effective local treatment and specialist hospital services for all who need them.’","Figures revealed in fullest analysis yet of alcohol's burden on the NHS .

"Playing quick paced action video games such as  Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed can boost your ability to learn new motor skills, researchers have found. They say regular players seem to learn a new sensorimotor skills, such as riding a bike or typing, more quickly than non-gamers do. They say the skills are highly in demand, and useful for many careers - such as advanced surgery, for instance. Liverpool and England footballer Daniel Sturridge competing at the unveiling of the Call of Duty : Ghosts game: Now researchers say playing quick paced action video games such as Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed can boost your ability to learn new skills. A new sensorimotor skill, such as learning to ride a bike or typing, often requires a new pattern of coordination between vision and motor movement. With such skills, an individual generally moves from novice performance, characterized by a low degree of coordination, to expert performance, marked by a high degree of coordination. As a result of successful sensorimotor learning, one comes to perform these tasks efficiently and perhaps even without consciously thinking about them. The University of Toronto study discovered people who play action video games such as Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed seem to learn a new sensorimotor skill more quickly than non-gamers do. A new sensorimotor skill, such as learning to ride a bike or typing, often requires a new pattern of coordination between vision and motor movement. With such skills, an individual generally moves from novice performance, characterized by a low degree of coordination, to expert performance, marked by a high degree of coordination. As a result of successful sensorimotor learning, one comes to perform these tasks efficiently and perhaps even without consciously thinking about them, the researchers say. 'We wanted to understand if chronic video game playing has an effect on sensorimotor control, that is, the coordinated function of vision and hand movement,' said graduate student Davood Gozli, who led the study. In the early stages of doing the tasks, the gamers' performance was not significantly better than non-gamers. 'This suggests that while chronically playing action video games requires constant motor control, playing these games does not give gamers a reliable initial advantage in new and unfamiliar sensorimotor tasks,' said Gozli. Researchers set up two experiments. In the first, 18 gamers (those who played a first-person shooter game at least three times per week for at least two hours each time in the previous six months) and 18 non-gamers (who had little or no video game use in the past two years) performed a manual tracking task. Using a computer mouse, they were instructed to keep a small green square cursor at the centre of a white square moving target which moved in a very complicated pattern that repeated itself. The task probes sensorimotor control, because participants see the target movement and try to coordinate their hand movements with what they see. By the end of the experiment, all participants performed better as they learned the complex pattern of the target. The gamers, however, were significantly more accurate in following the repetitive motion than the non-gamers. 'This is likely due to the gamers' superior ability in learning a novel sensorimotor pattern, that is, their gaming experience enabled them to learn better than the non-gamers.' In the next experiment, the researchers wanted to test whether the superior performance of the gamers was indeed a result of learning rather than simply having better sensorimotor control. To eliminate the learning component of the experiment, they required participants to again track a moving dot, but in this case the patterns of motion changed throughout the experiment. Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare: Gaming experience enabled people to learn new motor skills better than the non-gamers in a test . The result this time: neither the gamers nor the non-gamers improved as time went by, confirming that learning was playing a key role and the gamers were learning better. One of the benefits of playing action games may be an enhanced ability to precisely learn the dynamics of new sensorimotor tasks. Assassins Creed Liberation, another game the team found helped give people the ability to develop new motor skills quickly . Such skills are key, for example, in laparoscopic surgery which involves high precision manual control of remote surgery tools through a computer interface. The research was done in collaboration with Daphne Bavelier who has appointments with both the University of Geneva and the University of Rochester. Their study is published in the journal Human Movement Science.","Regular players  learn a new sensorimotor skills, such as riding a bike or typing, more quickly than non-gamers .

"A nine-year-old boy nearly lost his ear after he was mauled by his teacher’s dog during a school trip. Primary school pupil Marshall Gearing was stroking the brown Labrador when it suddenly jumped up and sank its jaws into the side of his head. His right ear was torn so badly it was hanging by a thread of skin and the schoolboy needed two operations to re-attach it. In fear: Marshall Gearing, pictured at Northampton A&E shortly after he was bitten, was attacked by his teacher's Labrador on a school trip . Marshall’s mother Amy, 23, is now demanding the teacher’s dog be put down as she claims it is ‘the only way to keep the children safe’, although both the school and police rule the attack to be out of character for the dog. She said: ‘Marshall will be scarred for life and is now scared of dogs. He has nightmares and doesn’t want to leave my side when we go out. ‘Marshall was stroking the dog, which was off the lead, when it suddenly leapt up and bit him. ‘Marshall told me he felt his ear getting ripped and thought the dog had torn it off completely' Attacked: Marshall's ear after doctors reattached it, left, and right, in hospital recovering from the bite . Demanding action: Amy Gearing, 23, pictured with her son Marshall, wants the Labrador to be put down . Scared: Marshall has been suffering nightmares since the attack and stays close to his mother in the street . The mother-of-two added: ‘There was a lot of blood everywhere which covered the dog’s muzzle and the children were screaming. ‘The . teachers called an ambulance and Marshall was rushed to hospital. He . had one operation to reattach half his ear but it didn’t work so he . needed another one. ‘He’s been off school for three weeks and has missed loads of work. ‘When . the police came to see me in the hospital they told me the teacher . would not be arrested because it was apparently ‘out of character’ for . the dog to attack someone. ‘I hate to say it because I am an animal lover but that dog now has the taste of blood and it should be put down. Back on his feet: Marshall was forced to take three weeks off following the bite but has now returned to school again . Pupils at Kingsthorpe Grove primary School in Northampton, had been treated to a day out in the park with their teachers when the incident occurred . Marshall, a pupil at Kingsthorpe Grove Primary School in Northampton, was taken on a day in the park with his classmates last month. The 30 pupils were accompanied by six members of staff and one of the teachers brought the pet. She said: ‘The full attention of the staff should have been on the children rather than on a dog. Marshall is back at school now but it has really affected his confidence.’ Headteacher Jamie Nairn, said police had carried out an investigation and, after speaking to Amy, had decided to deal with it via a ‘community resolution’. The incident had also been referred to the health and safety department of Northamptonshire County Council and the local authority child protection officer. Teacher's pet: The dog that attacked Marshall was a brown Labrador (stock image) In a letter to Ms Gearing, Mr Nairn said: ‘After weighing up all of the evidence from the statements and interviews, and knowing what I do having met the dog on a number of previous occasions, I am of the opinion that this was an awful accident that could not have been foreseen. ‘Appropriate action was taken once the incident occurred following school procedures. ‘However, we are reviewing our risk assessments involving animals when they come into contact with children in our school. ‘We have also taken the decision not to allow this particular dog further access to the children in our school.’ The head teacher said the dog was ‘extremely placid and very well trained’ and had been with many of the children on a number of occasions before.","Marshall Gearing nearly lost his ear when his teacher's dog attacked .

"These are the horrific injuries inflicted on a former soldier after he was brutally attacked on his own doorstep - when he disturbed a gang burgling his home. Adrian Peter Percival, 59, was savagely punched, kicked and stamped on by masked men who approached him from behind as he placed his key in the front door. It is believed he disturbed the offenders as they were coming down from a ladder they had used to break into his house in Eccles, Greater Manchester. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Adrian Peter Percival, 59, was savagely punched, kicked and stamped on by masked men who approached him from behind as he placed his key in the front door. He is pictured after the attack . The ex-Royal Fusilier had his head stamped on and was struck across the face with some sort of weapon during the attack on Trafford Road in Eccles, Greater Manchester . The ex-Royal Fusilier had his head stamped on and was struck across the face with some sort of weapon before the burglars made off with his late wife's wedding ring. As a result of the attack, he sustained severe bruising and swelling and suspected broken bones to his face, as well as injuries to his torso and legs and substantial bruising to his right lung. He later discovered the thieves had stolen a green metal box containing the cash he had saved up to visit his son in Latvia and a gold Irish wedding band with Celtic knots which belonged to his late wife, as well as a Manchester United gold centenary medal with a gold chain. He was first attacked by a masked man before two other accomplices clad in balaclava joined in the assault, which happened around 10.30pm on September 13 outside his home. Although he was only able to get a fleeting glance, one of the offenders is described as being of a stocky build, 6ft tall and wearing dark clothing. Another was of a slimmer build and also wearing dark clothing. Detective Constable Horace Bell said: 'This poor man has suffered tremendously at the hands of these absolute cowards, who have cruelly deprived him of the things he holds most dear. 'They stole his late wife's wedding ring which is an appalling and wicked act. Mr Percival sustained severe bruising and swelling and suspected broken bones to his face, as well as injuries to his torso, arms and legs . 'But not content with that, they also stole cash he had saved up to pay to visit his son in Latvia. 'It would be hard to describe the anguish he is currently going through and I'm sure people's hearts will go out to him. 'This man served his country with distinction, fighting to protect others, only to be savagely beaten by three vindictive, violent and disrespectful low-lives who deserve to be locked up. 'I would appeal to anyone who has information about this burglary and assault to come forward. 'In particular, I would ask that if anyone is offered these pieces of jewellery that they call us immediately as you could be being offered this man's wedding ring. 'The very least he deserves is to be reunited with the possessions he treasures most and a physical memento of his late wife. 'I would also hope that if the thieves are reading or hearing this appeal, that they too show a shred of decency and at the very least hand this ring into a local police station and spare this man's heartbreak.' Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A Northern California man was arrested Saturday on charges of starting a wildfire that devastated the lumber town of Weed last month, authorities said. Ronald Beau Marshall, 24, was taken into custody on felony counts of arson to inhabited structures, property and forest land, Sgt. Justin Mayberry, a police spokesman, said. The Siskiyou County District Attorney's office filed a criminal complaint against Marshall on Friday. A judge issued a warrant for Marshall's arrest, which came after a three-week investigation by police, sheriff and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection investigators. Charged: Ronald Beau Marshall, 24, was arrested Saturday on charges of starting a wildfire that devastated the lumber town of Weed last month, authorities said . 'As fire danger remains extreme across California, arson puts life, property and natural resources at risk and we will continue to dedicate as many resources as needed to track down and prosecute those who purposely threaten our state,' CalFire Director Ken Pimlott said in a statement. Mayberry said he couldn't discuss what led to Marshall's arrest because the investigation into the cause of the fire is ongoing. Marshall was being held on $250,000 bail. A phone number listed for the young man's home in Weed was disconnected. Marshall had previous charges for speeding, petty theft, burglary and receiving or concealing stolen property, court records show. The wind-driven fire raced through a hillside neighborhood in this scenic town of 3,000 near the Oregon border on Sept. 15, forcing everyone to evacuate and destroying 157 structures - most of them houses.

"The Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 300 points or 1.62 percent on Tuesday, raising concerns about a global economic slowdown. Today's 272 point drop was the biggest single fall since July 31 and is the sixth drop in seven trading sessions on Wall Street . Industrial production in Germany, Europe's largest economy, dropped the most in five years and the International Monetary Fund trimmed its outlook for global growth this year and next. However, the IMF said Tuesday that the global economy will grow still 3.3 percent this year, which is slightly below what it forecast in July. The U.S. stock market fell 274 points on Tuesday, following poor manufacturing results in Germany . Drops since July 31: The Dow Jones closed today at 272.52 point down - and is the sixth trading day fall out of seven and comes off the back of poor economic data from Germany . U.S. growth may be strengthening, but the outlook elsewhere is far less encouraging. On Tuesday the International Monetary Fund trimmed its forecast for global economic growth. A surprisingly weak report on industrial production in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, added to the concerns. Industrial companies, whose fortunes are closely tied those of the global economy, led the sell-off. Government bonds rallied as investors snapped up safe assets, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note close to its lowest level of the year. After a weak September, the slump in stocks is showing no signs of abating in October. The Standard & Poor's index has now dropped almost 4 percent since closing at a record Sept. 18. 'Investors have become a bit more cautious about earnings and about the pace of global growth,' said Kate Warne, a principal at Edward Jones, an investment firm. 'That reassessment is leading to a bit more caution on stocks.' US. stocks ended sharply lower on Tuesday, with major indexes falling 1 percent in heavy trading, as weak data out of Germany raised concerns about the strength of global growth ahead of the start of earnings season. The International Monetary Fund cut its global economic growth forecasts for the third time this year, suggesting the environment remains difficult for companies, especially ones with multinational exposure. The day's losses were broad, with all ten primary S&P 500 sectors ending lower, although cyclical shares - tied to the pace of economic growth - led the decline. Industrial shares lost 2.4 percent, while financials shed 1.8 percent and material companies sank 1.8 percent. Joy Global Inc fell 4.2 percent to $51.69 while Caterpillar Inc lost 3.4 percent to $94.70 as the biggest decliner on the Dow. Boeing Co lost 2.3 percent to $123.32. Worries: The prospects of weakening global growth weighed on the stock market Tuesday . German industrial output in August slid 4 percent, the biggest fall in 5-1/2 years, a day after a report showed industrial orders had their biggest monthly drop since 2009. 'The number was very weak, which makes for a tough backdrop. I don't think this is a trend of something that will get horrible, but it is weak and current valuations demand that data be better than weak,' said Hayes Miller, who oversees about $57 billion as the Boston-based head of asset allocation in North America at Baring Asset Management. With the day's decline, the S&P 500 fell back below its 100-day moving average, a sign of weakening near-term momentum. The CBOE Volatility index rose 11 percent to 17.2, near a level that has recently been taken as an indication the market is oversold. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 272.52 points, or 1.6 percent, to 16,719.39, the S&P 500 lost 29.72 points, or 1.51 percent, to 1,935.1, ending at its lowest level since Aug. 12.

"Shocking claims: Cynthia Kaye Wood, 19, from Texas, has been charged with attempted capital murder for allegedly making two separate attempts to kill her 4-month-old son . A teenage mother from Texas has been arrested for allegedly trying to suffocate her baby son twice while the child was being treated at a local hospital. Cynthia Kaye Wood, 19, from Galena Park, has been charged with attempted capital murder. According to court documents, Wood called 911 September 30 to report that her 4-month-old son stopped breathing, . The infant was taken to LBJ Hospital and was later transferred to Children’s Memorial Hermann Hospital. On October 12, Ms Wood called a nurse saying that her son was struggling to draw a breath. Once the young mother was reassured that her son was fine, she retired to the couch in the room to watch Law & Order, according to ABC 13 Eyewitness News. The 19-year-old later told police that she was watching TV and eating M&Ms when she heard her son making gurgling and gasping noises. Wood said she pick up the boy and began hitting him on the back. A nurse said she came into Wood's room after the baby's vitals alarm went off and found the mother holding her son's limp body in her arms. The hospital staffer said Wood was the only person in the room at the time, and she did not raise the alarm about her son's medical emergency. The nurse went to work on the baby, performing CPR on him until he was resuscitated. Court records show that the 4-month-old experienced clinical death before being revived. According to  documents cited by Houston Chronicle, surveillance cameras inside the hospital room captured Wood on two separate occasions by placing her hand over her son's mouth and pinching his nose shut as the little boy tried to fight back, kicking his legs furiously. Brush with death: The incidents took place at Children's Memorial Hermann hospital, where nurses were able to revive the little boy . In one instance, prosecutors said the 19-year-old stuck a pacifier in her son's mouth and then covered his face with a blanket. A doctor who later examined the child said he had no underlying medical problem, suggesting that only Wood's alleged actions were to blame for his brush with death. During a court hearing Monday, a prosecutor revealed that Wood had another baby who died in Mississippi. The circumstances of the child’s death remain unknown at this time. A judge set Cynthia Wood’s bond at $250,000 and ordered her to stay away from her son. If convicted, she could face up to a life in prison.","Cynthia Kaye Woods, 19, accused of trying to kill her 4-month-old son .

"The mother of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager shot dead two weeks ago, has said that meeting Attorney General Eric Holder has given her hope that her son might one day get justice. The sequence of events that led to her son’s death remain unclear, but earlier this week Lesley McSpadden and her son’s father Michael Brown, Sr. paid for an autopsy which concluded that their son had been shot six times, twice in the head. The shooting has triggered days of rioting reflecting long-simmering racial tensions in a town of mostly black residents and a majority white police force and McSpadden has admitted that she didn't have faith in local authorities. Scroll down for video . Lesley McSpadden, right, has said that her private meeting with Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday has given her hope that her son Michael Brown, left, might one day get justice . ‘Up until yesterday, I didn't,’ she told CNN on Thursday. According to McSpadden, a private meeting with Attorney General Eric Holder, the top law enforcement official in the country, who visited Ferguson on Wednesday helped change her mind. ‘Just hearing the words come directly from (Holder's) mouth, face-to-face, he made me feel like, one day, I will,’ she said. ‘And I'm not saying today, or yesterday, but one day, they will regain my trust.’ Michael Brown’s shooting has prompted multiple investigations and Holder came to the Missouri town to check in on the federal civil rights investigation. According to McSpadden, Holder promised her ‘that it will be a fair and thorough investigation.’ ‘You can read a person. And when you're looking at them and they're looking at you in your eyes, it puts some trust back there,’ she said. Attorney General Eric Holder, left, visited Ferguson, Missouri, on Wednesday to check in on the federal civil rights investigation . Lesley McSpadden and her son’s father Michael Brown, Sr. , right, have called for the police officer who shot their son to be arrested . That civil rights investigation will require proof that Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson exhibited 'racial hostility' in the shooting of Brown. Holder said on Thursday that the incident had opened a national conversation about 'the appropriate use of force and the need to ensure fair and equal treatment for everyone who comes into contact with the police.' A grand jury is hearing evidence to determine whether Wilson, 28, who has policed the St. Louis suburbs for six years, should be charged in Brown's death. Those grand jury proceedings, lead by St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, could lead to an indictment against Wilson. He has said the case could continue into the fall. McSpadden has said that she did not believe that those those pressing her son's case will be able to achieve justice as she defines it - with Wilson being charged in her son's death. Those grand jury proceedings lead by St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, right, could lead to an indictment against Officer Darren Wilson, left . Many Brown family supporters have demanded that McCulloch be taken off the case, given his relationship with the African-American community and their claims that he is biased toward law enforcement. McCulloch has said he has no intentions of removing himself from the Michael Brown case, and on Thursday he urged Gov. Jay Nixon to once and for all decide if he will act on calls for McCulloch's ouster. Some question McCulloch's ability to be unbiased since his father, mother and other relatives worked for St. Louis police. His father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect. Nixon said this week he is not asking McCulloch to recuse himself. But McCulloch called for a more definitive decision, saying Nixon 'must settle this issue now.'","Lesley McSpadden has said that meeting Attorney General Eric Holder  has given her hope that her son might one day get justice .

"A puppy that went missing in New York more than two years ago has turned up alive and well some 1,000 miles away in Florida. Nika, a six-month-old toy fox terrier, vanished from the backyard of her home in Newburgh, New York, in May 2012, leaving owner Giuseppe DiBella heartbroken. 'It was one of the most horrible days of my life,' Mr DiBella said. He had been doing yard work in front of his home for only a few minutes when he believes someone snatched the three-pound dog from her leash. Nika, a six-month-old toy fox terrier, vanished from the backyard of her home in Newburgh, New York, in  2012 . A devastated Mr Di Bella immediately went to the police and spent a year searching animal shelters for his  pet and distributing missing-dog posters. But it wasn't until last week that he had any news regarding the whereabouts of his beloved pooch. He received a phone call from police in Ocala, Florida, informing him that Nika had been found on the doorstep of local home. 'I said, 'All right, I'm coming,""' Mr DiBella  told New York's CBS 2. '""Where are you?"" They said, ""We are in Marion County."" 'I said, ""Where in Marion County?"" They said, ""In Florida."" I said, ""I'm in New York!""'

'I was feeling, like, biblical - when the son comes back to the father, you know, those kind of things,' Mr DiBella said. A family friend in Florida is caring for the little dog until she can be reunited with her owner, who still lives in New York with his other dog Martha.

"Notorious serial killer Loren Herzog has committed suicide, it was revealed last night. The body of Herzog, 46, was found Monday night hanging inside his trailer located immediately outside the grounds of High Desert State Prison in Susanville, the Lassen County Sheriff's Department said. He was living so close to a prison because at the time of his death Herzog was in the middle of a fierce debate over where he was living and was the subject of a lawsuit seeking to banish him from the remote northeast California county. Normally, under Californian law, once someone is released from prison they return to the last place they lived. But relatives of victims can ask that they live at least 35 miles from their homes. Until this was resolved authorities allowed him to live in the grounds of the prison. Herzog was at the beginning of a 78-year prison sentence for three murder convictions when an appeals court in 2004 ruled investigators illegally coerced his confession. Suicide: Herzog, pictured here during a prior court appearance, was found dead Monday night near the High Desert State Prison in California . Without the confession, prosecutors . said they were left little evidence and had no choice but to offer . Herzog a deal to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter for the killing . of Cyndi Vanderheiden, 25, in November 1998. His sentence was reduced to 14 years and he was released on parole in September 2010 after serving 11 years. With credit for time served dating . back to his 1999 arrest and time off for good behavior, the prison . system was unable to hold him longer despite calls for his continued . incarceration. Herzog and childhood friend Wesley . Shermantine were dubbed the Speed Freak Killers when they were arrested . in 1999 for Vanderheiden's murder and several others. The two were accused of terrorizing San Joaquin County for 15 years by going on methamphetamine-fueled killing sprees. Shermantine is on California's Death Row after being convicted of four murders.

Lassen County set off a furor there that culminated with the city of . Susanville filing a lawsuit alleging prison officials were wrong to make . Herzog live there.

"QPR midfielder Alejandro Faurlin is set for a prolonged spell on the sidelines after it was confirmed by the club that he has suffered his third anterior cruciate ligament injury in as many years. Faurlin limped off during the second half of Rangers' Capital One cup defeat at Burton Albion on Wednesday, but initial observations were that the injury was not as serious as now revealed. The 28-year-old is set be missing from Harry Redknapp’s squad for a number of months, and the news will come as a devastating blow to the Argentinean midfielder, who has battled back from two previous ACL injuries. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Harry Redknapp: Ale Faurlin will bounce back once again . Blow: Alejandro Faurlin is set for another prolonged spell on the sidelines after suffering a third ACL injury . Support: QPR defender Danny Simpson expresses his sadness at the news of Faurlin's latest injury . Faurlin penned a new one-year deal at Loftus Road in July having spent a portion of last season on loan at Palermo in an attempt to improve his fitness. QPR boss Harry Redknapp, who may now look for another midfielder before the transfer window shuts on Monday, expressed his sympathy for Faurlin via the club's official Twitter feed: 'We're all desperately saddened and disappointed for Ale,' he said. 'We will, of course, do everything we can to support him and help him back on the road to recovery. 'He is a great man and player, and he's suffered terribly bad luck over the last few years with injuries.' Faurlin started QPR’s opening  Premier League defeat at home by Hull before coming off the bench in the 4-0 loss to London rivals Tottenham last weekend. QPR’s head of medical services, Peter Florida-James, said: ‘The knee itself stayed pretty stable, but the scans have since revealed his ACL graft has ruptured. If he has a repair it will be a six- to nine-month injury, which is absolutely devastating for all concerned. 'It looked so innocuous on Wednesday night, so this has come as a massive blow for us all.' Gutted: Joey Barton paid tribute to injured team-mate Alejandro Faurlin on Twitter . The club's players, including Joey Barton and Danny Simpson, offered their support to their injured team-mate. Barton said: 'Devastated for @alefaurlin. Know how hard he has worked to get back from injury. Words fail to capture my feelings for him right now. 'We are all with him and have the utmost confidence that a man with his strength of personality and character will get through this. 'As a team and club it's important we rally round him and support him at difficult times. Puts things into perspective.' Thinking of you: Joey Barton (left) was one of many Rangers players who expressed sympathy for Faurlin . In better news for the Loftus Road club, manager Redknapp is ready to sign a new contract to extend his stay beyond the end of his current deal despite a poor start to the season. ‘It’s there, Tony’s offered me an extension for two years and I’ll sign it,’ Redknapp said. ‘I haven’t read it, I probably won’t read it, I’ll just sign it.’ Meanwhile, Adel Taarabt's move to  AC Milan looks to be off after the Italian club moved closer to signing Chelsea's Fernando Torres.","Faurlin has sustained his third ACL injury in as many years .

"Celebrities and millionaires who were happy to drop $250,000 to travel into space on Richard Branson's highly ambitious SpaceShipTwo still plan on taking the trip even after Friday's horrific explosion. As Branson arrives at the site of the tragedy in California, some of his ticket buyers have come forward to let it be known they trust Virgin's head honcho, and are still excited and ready to travel to space, this although flights have yet to even be scheduled. Branson had previously said of his program, and those who wanted to get involved and travel to the final frontier, 'Everybody who signs up knows this is the birth of a new space program and understands the risks that go with that.'

On Friday, Branson announced on the Virgin Galactic site that  refunds would be available following the tragedy. That being said, no one has yet to back out, and many are still excited to get their astronaut wings. Ashton Kutcher was one of the first celebs to book his ticket, and the 500th person overall, something that got him a special blog post from Branson at the time. 'He is as thrilled as we are at the prospect of being among the first to cross the final frontier (and back!) with us and to experience the magic of space for himself,' wrote Branson on the Virgin site at the time.

Jim Clash, a journalist who is also one of the 700 ticket holders, seemed to echo Hynes' statement, telling Mashable, 'Stuff happens. I'm not going to change my perspective on selling my ticket back, or not sticking with 'em, I just think it's - You never know.'

"Australians have become more daring in the bedroom, with risque sexual acts practised more frequently and being embraced at younger ages, a new study reveals. Compared to a decade ago, people have become more open to premarital sex, abortion and homosexuality, liberating couples to engage in a varied sex life. Despite people being more adventurous in their sex life, researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), La Trobe University and the University of Sydney also found that couples are having sex less compared to 10 years ago. Australians have become more daring in the bedroom, with risque sexual acts practised more frequently and being embraced at younger ages . Compared to a decade ago, people have become more open to premarital sex, abortion and homosexuality, liberating couples to engage in a varied sex life . Around 20,000 people aged between 16 and 69 told researchers over the phone that on average they have sex approximately 1.4 times a week, less than 0.4 times than Australians a decade ago. The younger they were, the more sex they were having but even people in their 60s admitted to engaging in the practice at least once a week. Professor Juliet Richters, lead researcher from UNSW, said that the frequency of sex among those surveyed came as a shock. 'We thought it was a mistake, but a recent British national survey had the same finding,' Professor Richters told The Age. With technology taking over our daily routine, Professor Richters suggests the time spent online could be impacting our sex lives. 'I would have thought take a mobile phone to bed might have something to do with it', she said. With technology taking over our daily routine, Professor Juliet Richters from UNSW suggests the time spent  online could be impacting our sex lives . Even though people these days are having less sex, nearly 90 per cent of men and 75 per cent of women admit that they are very much enjoying their sexual encounters. The country's largest study of sexual activity and attitudes  found that over 92 per cent of heterosexual people are having vaginal sex, 86 per cent of men and 80 per cent of women are engaging in oral sex and 25 per cent of men and 19 per cent of women have had anal sex. Oral and anal sex was more common among 30 to 49 year-olds. 'We're entering a more exploratory, diverse time,' said Dr Chris Rissel, public health researcher from The University of Sydney. 'I think what we've probably got is a less dramatic change than the 1960s but across a wider range of the population. We've got more exploration, more diversity, across a wider age group.' Nearly half of the people under 60 also admitted to watching pornography compared to a decade ago. Despite this, around 95 per cent of people demand exclusivity in their relationship, The Australian Study of Health and Reproduction revealed. Monogimy has remained a number one priority in relationships, with around 95 per cent of people demanding exclusivity in their relationship .","Researchers from University of New South Wales, La Trobe University and The University of Sydney spoke to 20,000 people aged between 16 and 69 .

"Parents are increasingly dipping into their savings to fund their daughters freezing their eggs, one of Britain’s leading fertility experts have said. As a growing number of women are prioritising financial stability and a fulfilling career over starting a family, parents fear that they may never become grandparents. The overwhelming desire for a second round of pitter-patter of tiny feet has led to a ‘cultural shift’ in the attitude towards the full range of fertility treatments among the older generation. Happy families: The number of parents who fund fertility treatments such as freezing eggs and IVF for their daughters has increased in the past five years . ‘We are seeing a real social change,’ Dr Professor Dr Geeta Nargund, Medical Director of Create Fertility Clinics, and an NHS consultant told The Telegraph. ‘Five years ago it was almost unheard of for patients to have their parents funding their IVF treatment or grandparents funding fertility treatment but now we receive a lot of inquiries. ‘I run frequent open days, the room takes anywhere between 16 and 20 couples in London and you tend to have at least two of three where parents come with their daughters now – that never happened before.’ A 2011 study found that parents spend more than £43,000 on their adult children until they turn 30. The most common subsidies are university fees, rent, house deposits and weddings. Social change: Desire to become grandparents see many pay for their child's fertility treatment . One in five parents now help their children to buy their first home, handing them an average of £23,000 each, a survey published last month has found. One in four of those had to cut back on their own day-to-day spending to contribute to their child’s deposit, and 20 per cent dipped into funds saved up for their retirement and for elderly care fees. Longstanding traditions in many cultures see the bride’s family pay for a wedding ceremony, but with more and more women putting off getting married in order to first establish financial stability or choosing to have children before getting hitched, parents increasingly pay for fertility treatment instead. Doctors say that this is down to a desire to become grandparents that is so strong that they would rather pay for their daughter to freeze her eggs than risk it never happening. This comes after doctors warned that it is ten times harder for a woman to become pregnant at 43 than at 37. The rapid speeding up of a woman’s biological clock means that by the time she is 43, she will need to go through 44 eggs on average to produce just one normal embryo. At 37 she needs just 4.4, on average. A woman typically produces one egg a month, so this means it will take her almost four years to conceive – rather than only four months. Researcher Meredith Brower said that the number of eggs needed for a viable pregnancy rises ‘almost exponentially’ after 42, and urged women to freeze their eggs without delay. British experts said that while, ideally, women would have their babies in their twenties, the realities of modern life mean many have no choice but to wait. Education, careers, lack of money and the hunt for ‘Mr Right’ are all causing women to put motherhood on the back burner. Nearly half of all British babies are now born to women aged 30 and older, and the number born to women in their late thirties has almost trebled in recent years. Controversially, internet companies Facebook and Apple are offering to pay female employees to freeze their eggs. The ‘perk’ – at the moment for employees in the US only – is aimed at boosting the number of women staff by allowing them to focus on their careers without sacrificing the opportunity to have children later in life.","Parents increasingly spend savings on fertility treatment for daughters .

"Despite stagnant wages and a slow crawl out of the recession, sales of premium food and drink are soaring as customers increasingly indulge in high-end artisan breads, fine wines and expensive cheeses. New figures show the sales growth of many products once considered a rare treat is now outstripping that of the standard, and much more affordable, alternatives. Retailers and producers claim the boost in sales shows many people, particularly those with a limited disposable income, are happy to spend a little bit extra to indulge in a small guilty pleasure. New Waitrose sales figures show a soaring growth in sales of luxury bread, champagne and goats' cheese compared to last year . Waitrose's sales figures show remarkable growth compared to last year for handmade and high-end breads and wines. Sales of handmade artisan bread have risen by 31 per cent compared with 2013, while champagne is up 7 per cent. Waitrose white sourdough has also seen sales increase by 12 per cent. But the product to register the biggest growth in popularity is goats' milk Gouda - with sales of the Dutch cheese soaring by a staggering 34 per cent on last year. Sam Dickson, Head of Brand and Product Development at Waitrose said there was 'no doubt' premium ranges were proving popular and that they added an' indulgent treat' to customers' shopping.

"A soldier's neck was broken in three places by his comrade in a brutal murder that may have been a revenge attack after an earlier punch-up, a jury has been told. Lance Corporal Richard Farrell, 23, of the Royal Irish Regiment, is alleged to have 'violently and brutally attacked' Corporal Geoffrey McNeill, landing blows to his 'head, stomach, and genitals'. But Christopher Hotten QC, prosecuting, said it was 'significant force' applied to the neck that killed Cpl McNeill, breaking three of his vertebrae. Corporal Geoffrey McNeill was 'violently and brutally attacked' and killed in his barracks room in Shropshire . Mr Hotten said DNA evidence recovered from the Farrell's top - including a possible bloodstain - and shoes matched that of Cpl McNeill, while there were three-and-a-half hours where Farrell's movements could not be accounted for. The jury at Birmingham Crown Court was also told Farrell went alone to McNeill's room at about 9.15am later that morning, and apparently then finding him dead, raised the alarm. Setting out the prosecution case to the trial jury of four women and eight men today, Mr Hotten said: 'At some time between 4am and 6am on the morning of March 8 this year Geoffrey McNeill was violently and brutally attacked. 'His attacker inflicted heavy blows to his head, his stomach and his genitals but the ultimate cause of death was pressure to the neck in the form of blows and or some form of neck hold. 'The force applied to his neck was significant. There were fractures to three different bones in the neck of Geoffrey McNeill. 'We say he was murdered and by murdered I mean this, he was attacked and his attacker caused his injuries unlawfully. 'The attacker intended at the least to caused Geoffrey McNeill really serious injury and that he died as a result of those injuries. 'The murder took place in the room that Geoffrey McNeill occupied at the barracks. The prosecution contention is that the murderer was this defendant Richard Farrell. 'This murder is no different to a murder committed in a street or a pub or someone’s home or indeed anywhere else.' Cpl McNeill, 32, who was born in Ballymoney in Northern Ireland, was found dead in his room at Tern Hill's Clive Barracks on the morning of March 8, after a night out where he had a fight with his alleged murderer . Cpl McNeill, 32, who was born in Ballymoney in Northern Ireland, was found dead in his room at Tern Hill's Clive Barracks, which is where the Crown says the crime took place. Mr Hotten said there was 'no history of ill-feeling or animosity' between him and Farrell, who served in a different company in the regiment, which was based at the time at the Shropshire barracks. The jury heard how the previous evening, on Friday March 7, both men had separately been drinking before heading out to the nearby town of Market Drayton. Mr Hotten described an incident in the town's Clive and Coffyne pub, where an 'annoyed' Farrell complained some soldiers were 'acting ""like maggots"".' Later that night, as CCTV from inside the nearby Sandbank Vaults pub showed, Cpl McNeill floored Farrell with a right hook, cutting his own knuckle and the young lance corporal's lip in the process. Witnesses later told how Cpl McNeill had claimed the younger man was 'trapping off' before he landed the punch. Farrell would also later tell colleagues he had been 'gobbing off' to the corporal, said Mr Hotten. The prosecutor said that punch 'could provide an explanation for a later attack carried out by Mr Farrell, as revenge for what had happened'. After the fracas, both men left separately, returning to barracks within minutes of each other at about 3am. A general view of the Clive Barracks in Tern Hill, Shropshire, home to the 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment . Farrell's movements could not be accounted for between his arrival back at base, and 6.30am, when he was discovered asleep on the floor of the guard room. The last time McNeill was seen, he was sitting outside the accommodation block housing his third-floor room on the base just after returning to the barracks. Between 4am and 4.30am that morning, a soldier whose room was opposite Cpl McNeill's thought he heard 'bumping noises' and a male voice say '""Geoff - calm down"", two or three times,' said Mr Hotten. That soldier got out of bed but only to lock his door from the inside, and did not look out onto the adjoining corridor to see what was happening. Mr Hotten said Farrell awoke in the base's guardroom, then went back to his room to shower, washing his clothes at the barracks' laundry. He asked one soldier '""where's McNasty's room?"" - in reference to Cpl McNeill, saying he couldn't remember anything, and wanted to apologise,' added the prosecutor. Farrell got to Cpl McNeill's room at about 9.15am, and said he found the other man lying on the floor in just his underpants. 'According to Farrell he made vigorous attempts at resuscitation, and that would have led to a significant transfer of DNA,' said Mr Hotten. Farrell would later tell police he squeezed Cpl McNeill's testicles 'to see if he was conscious, as part of Army training he had received', he added. However the prosecutor told jurors they would hear Army medical experts were 'unaware of that practice'. Mr Hotten told jurors that over the course of the trial, they would hear testimony from fellow soldiers, and look at forensics, CCTV, and mobile phone evidence. Farrell, wearing a smart dark suit and tie and sporting close-cropped dark hair, listened intently from the court dock as the Crown Prosecution Service set out its case. Proceedings were adjourned for the day but the trial, expected to last four weeks, continues.

"A married couple who have dressed alike every day for 33 years say it is the clearest way of showing that 'we're together.' Donald Featherstone, who made a fortune from inventing the plastic pink flamingo lawn ornament in the late Fifties, and his wife Nancy, told The Sun that they even phone each other when they are not together to ensure that their style is in sync. Luckily the large Victorian home that they share in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, has enough closet space to house their unique fashion collection which includes 600 custom-made outfits and dozens of identical his and hers accessories. Synchronized style: Donald and Nancy Featherstone from Fitchburg, Massachusetts, started dressing alike in 1980, four years after they married - they say it is the clearest way of showing that 'we're together' Dressed to impress: The Featherstone's unique fashion collection includes 600 custom-made outfits . Mr Featherstone, 77, usually wears bold print shirts, while his wife of 36 years dons dresses cut from the same cloth. Recalling the first time they experimented with the look-alike concept, Mrs Featherstone, 60, said: 'I made Don the same shirt I was wearing. We’ve dressed alike ever since. We love it.' The former dressmaker, who started making her own clothes aged 12, has sewn hundreds of ensembles in an array of eye-catching fabrics over the years. She said she is often drawn to tropical . prints that remind her of her husband's famous molded bird, which was . manufactured by Union Products and first hit the market in 1958. Coordinated style: Mr Featherstone wears bold shirts while his wife dons dresses cut from the same fabric . Full-blown obsession: The couple even have matching sleepwear - as does their dog . Some standout twinsets include . Chesterfield coats topped with bowler hats, brown wool suits and loud . Christmas-colored Hawaiian shirts. Their dog Smokey also boasts a wardrobe of his own, and they like to dress him up for special occasions. The couple's love story started in August 1975 when they met at a hardware convention in Chicago.

Ready, set, go: With so many options to choose from the couple say that they base their outfits on whoever gets to the closet first - they own more than 600 pieces of custom-made clothing . Mrs Featherstone said that when she met . her husband he was 'very prim and proper' and would only wear . long-sleeved shirts, a tie and a suit. But following her mother's advice, she started jazzing up his style by making him more colorful outfits. 'I made Don the same shirt I was wearing. We've dressed alike ever since. We love it' She first had the idea to make duplicate garments after she remembered a tradition at Jennings Junior High School in Missouri, where couples wore matching shirts to the end-of-year dance. It was in 1977 that the Featherstones first slipped into the same looks - a pair of polyester ‘play shirts'. Then on Easter Sunday of the same year . Mr Featherstone stepped out in slacks, a sport coat and pink silky shirt . while his wife donned a pink, silky dress. Their dressing-up habit soon became a full-blown obsession and in 1980 they went full-time. Getting in on the act: The Featherstone's dog Smokey also dresses up for special occasions .

"Britain's state pension bill is set to quadruple by the mid-2060s, official figures show. The ballooning cost of paying the basic state pension will soon be larger than the entire economic output of countries such as Austria, Thailand or the UAE. Predictions by the Department for Work and Pensions say the bill will double from £98billion this year to £179billion in 20 years – and quadruple to £420billion by 2063-64. Expensive grey days: Britain's state pension bill is set to quadruple to £420billion by 2063-64 . The cost will equate to 7.7 per cent of Britain’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 50 years, compared with 5.8 per cent today. Experts said the escalating bill was a ‘ticking time-bomb’ and presented the government with ‘serious questions’ over how taxpayers would fund it. They claimed that successive governments had failed to plan for Britain’s ageing population, and that simply pushing back the State pension age would not be enough. The number of people receiving the State pension will increase from almost 13million today to nearly 17million in 2034 as Britain’s baby boomers reach retirement. Rising life expectancy also means the average time spent in retirement is now 26 years for a woman and 22 years for a man. Baby boomers: The number of people receiving the State pension will be nearly 17million in 2034 . The financial implications of this, combined with the cost of a more generous State pension, has seen the total bill sky-rocket. The ‘triple lock’ on State pensions – introduced two years ago – will cost an additional £45bn alone in the next 15 years, according to estimates. The lock guarantees price rises in line with earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent – whichever is the highest – to protect pensioners from paltry increases. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Britain’s pensions bill represents a ticking time-bomb, and the only way politicians can defuse it is by making some tough decisions regarding the retirement age, whether the ‘triple-lock’ is sustainable, and how much they can save in other areas. ‘These pension debts are hidden away off the Government’s balance sheet, but the consequences will be all too obvious for the next generation unless something is done.’ Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘Where is the money going to come from? Health? Defence? Policing? It will present some potentially tough choices. ‘The fact that as a nation we are living longer means we will need a retirement income for longer – and this is one of the factors behind the projected growth in the future cost of the State Pension.’ Official statistics show one in three babies born last year will live to celebrate their 100th birthday, as Briton’s life expectancy continues to rapidly improve with advances in healthcare. The average life expectancy in the UK is currently 79 years for men and 83 for women. Ros Altmann, the government’s business champion for older workers, said further rises in the State pension age would not be enough to solve Britain’s dilemma over how to fund such an enormous bill. She said: ‘None of this should come as a surprise to politicians because the demographics have been in place for decades. Depressing statistics: The cost of state pension will equate to 7.7 per cent of Britain’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 50 years, compared with 5.8 per cent today . ‘We should have been prepared for it and yet the State pension remains completely un-funded. It is case of ‘pay-as–you-go – or pray-as-you-go, more like. ‘For decades, we have made all these promises and just hoped that the next generation can afford to pay for it. ‘Part of the solution must be that people to work for longer, which raises more in tax revenue and make it more affordable. But employers need to offer more flexible, part-time work if this is going to happen.’ This week, the government announced a new target for the average retirement age to rise by six months every year. This is not a policy, but merely a change the government is hoping will occur. Even the Department for Work and Pensions itself seemed unsure this could be achieved, however, saying it would ‘not normally expect’ such a ‘meaningful’ change in such a short time. The government hopes that if people choose to work for longer, it will not only boost their pension pots but help to fund healthcare and care home costs for an increasingly elderly population, through increased tax revenue. Admitting it was an ‘ambitious’ target, Steve Webb, the Liberal Democrat pensions minister, said: ‘What we are doing is catching up with decades of longer living. ‘We are living longer but the labour market and people’s retirement age has not been keeping up.’ The government wants the average retirement age to keep up with State pension age, which will increase to 66 by 2020 for both men and women. It will then continue to rise in line with life expectancy. Dr Altmann criticised the government target last night, saying it was unrealistic for retirement age to rise by six months every year. She said: ‘If it continued at that rate, it would reach 80 in 30 years. It is not sustainable. ‘I do not think the government should be aiming for any ‘magic age’ at which people should retire. ‘They should recognise individual differences and choices which enable one person to work until their 80s while others may be genuinely ill and unable to continue beyond their 60s. ‘The general direction of travel is towards later retirement but it is dangerous to put a figure on it.’ A DWP spokesman said: ‘Older people have worked hard and paid into the system all their lives. That is why our reforms are securing the long-term future of the State Pension – so it remains strong and keeps pace with increasing life expectancy.’","Cost of state pensions will equate to 7.7% of Britain's GDP by 2064 .

"Manchester City striker Stevan Jovetic believes his side's thrilling UEFA Champions League win over Bayern Munich last month could have made all the difference in the bid to retain their domestic crown. Since Sergio Aguero's hat-trick sunk the Germans at the Etihad Stadium, City have put a tough series of top-flight results behind them and earned emphatic away victories at Southampton and Sunderland. Aguero was on target twice more in the 4-1 win at the Stadium of Light on Wednesday night and Jovetic says it is plain to see his side are playing with renewed confidence after pegging back leaders Chelsea to just six points. Stevan Jovetic unleashes his left-footed shot to put City in the lead at the Stadium of Light . Jovetic told City's official website: 'Honestly in the Champions League we have not played well this season but the game against Bayern helped us a lot. 'Now we are in a very good moment but we must continue like this because we are playing every three days and that can change, so we need to give 100 per cent in every game and be behind Chelsea and expect them to drop points. 'We have more confidence because we had some bad times two or three weeks ago when we didn't play so well.' City boss Manuel Pellegrini is hopeful captain Vincent Kompany will be fit to return for next week's crucial Champions League clash with Roma after missing out on the trip to the north east with a hamstring injury. Jovetic points out his provider Aguero after finishing off a slick build-up from City . Kompany is also definitely out of Saturday's clash with Everton and it was initially feared he could be sidelined for longer, but initial scans suggest the injury is not as bad as was first feared. Meanwhile, Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has injury problems to add to issues of fatigue as he prepares his side for their third big game in a week at Liverpool at the weekend. Poyet's men are clearly struggling after back-to-back clashes with Chelsea and Manchester City and Steven Fletcher's substitution with an apparent back injury 55 minutes into the Stadium of Light clash will give cause for concern. But there could be better news on midfielder Adam Johnson who missed Wednesday night's game against his former club with a minor injury which should clear up for the trip to Anfield. Jovetic believes his side's thrilling win over Bayern Munich last month could have made all the difference . Poyet said: 'Adam had a muscle problem at the end of the game (against Chelsea) and he was very close (to playing) but it was not enough.' Johnson was replaced by another former City man, Will Buckley, who admitted the Black Cats squad are feeling the strain of their hectic and high-profile fixture pile-up. Buckley told his club's official website: 'Obviously it was a massive effort on Saturday and a good point but it does take it out of you, and hopefully we can look ahead now and have a good performance against Liverpool. 'We don't like to dwell on bad performances and results so we will look to get it out of our system as soon as possible. We need to find a bit of the performance against Chelsea and take it to Anfield and do a bit better.' Â .","Manchester City beat Bayern Munich 3-2 at Etihad Stadium in NovemberÂ .

"Russell Slade claimed an inspired substitution after Romain Vincelot came off the bench to strike an 88th-minute winner as Leyton Orient dumped Aston Villa out of the Capital One Cup. The Frenchman with a name from Arthurian legend made his goal look a lot simpler than pulling sword out of stone by ghosting onto Bradley Pritchard’s cross five minutes after being introduced to inflict more cup misery on Paul Lambert. The Villa manager has now suffered shock defeats to lower-league opposition in each of his three campaigns at the helm. VIDEO Scroll down for Paul Lambert: Huge change from last season's doom and gloom . Hero: Romain Vincelot (right) celebrates after scoring a late winner for Leyton Orient against Aston Villa .

Referee: Carl Boyeson 6.5 . Attendance: 17,918 . In the build up to this match he spoke of the hurt still felt after League Two Bradford’s unlikely semi-final win in this competition two seasons ago, while Sheffield United triumphed here in last season’s FA Cup. Darren Bent, on his first Villa appearance since May 2013, had two excellent opportunities to ensure it would be third time lucky but missed both. The former England striker was thwarted by Orient goalkeeper Gary Woods after a pinpoint finish from Joe Cole’s pass in the first half and horribly miscued when clean through 10 minutes from time with the score 0-0. But Orient were decent value for their win and would have scored sooner but for the brilliance of Shay Given. The Irish goalkeeper was pulling on his first Villa shirt in 19 months and pulled off a stunning save from Mathieu Baudry’s header 20 minutes from time to keep the scores level. The 38-year-old lost his place to Brad Guzan two years ago and was drafted into Lambert’s coaching team amid turmoil at the end of last season, but showed he remains a fine shot-stopper with a full-stretch dive to palm Baudry’s header onto the post. Villa suffered a record 10 home league defeats last season and Lambert wants an immediate reaction when Hull are the visitors on Sunday. For Orient, it is a trip to Fleetwood Town next. They face Sheffield United in the next round of this competition. Jubilation: Leyton Orient's Dean Cox celebrates after the final whistle as his side claim a cup upset .

Put your hands up in the air: Bartley closes down on Aston Villa's Joe Cole (left) Slade, who has beaten Lambert twice before in his career, praised his team’s work ethic, desire and organisation. ‘Aston Villa weren’t at their very best. We’ve performed at a decent level for a League One team and enough to get us a result,’ he added. ‘It is another great night for this football club. To come to a place of great tradition and get a result is a wonderful feeling for everybody. ‘My message was quite simple: we carry the flag, we plant it in the ground and we fight for everything.’ Lambert believed his team should have scored but admitted Given’s save was ‘a warning sign we never took head of’’. ‘We had enough chances to win two games let alone one,’ he said. ‘I didn’t think we defended their goal well. ‘I’m really disappointed to get knocked out.

Counterparts: Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert (right) speaks with Leyton Orient boss Russell Slade . Lambert made seven changes to his team from Saturday’s 0-0 draw with Newcastle but it remained a selection that should have deposed Orient. There was a Villa debut for 32-year-old Cole, and at the other end of the spectrum a first start to Jack Grealish, the talented 18-year-old winger involved in a tug of war between the FAs of England and Ireland. With his socks rolled down, Grealish showed just why the fight has broken out with a performance of daring runs. A subdued Villa Park crowd responded, urging the teenager to shoot after a run on the hour mark. He let fly but his effort was deflected wide. From Ashley Westwood’s corner Nathan Baker rose highest but headed just over. Not long after Vincelot showed him how it should be done, his second goal of this year’s competition.","Vincelot came off the bench to score an 88th-minute winner at Villa Park .

"Ruby Walsh has received death threats after he played down the death of a horse during a race at the Cheltenham Festival. Walsh, with three winners under his belt after the first three days, created controversy when he said that animals are replaceable after Our Conor suffered a fatal fall on Tuesday. The Festival has since been marred by a debate about whether horseracing is unnecessarily cruel with two further runners put down. Star jockey Ruby Walsh (above) has received death threats after he played down the death of a horse during a race. Above, Walsh on Faugheen celebrates victory in the Neptune Investment Management Novices' Hurdle during Ladies Day at Cheltenham on Wednesday . Animal rights campaigners have accused the 34-year-old Irishman of being callous, while others have bombarded him with threats. One tweeted: ‘Ruby Walsh I hope you get your skull crushed by one of the horses you’re so heartlessly flippant about. Animals should not die for sport.’ Another added: ‘Shame more jockeys aren’t killed instead of beautiful horses!!!!!! All jockeys are complete c**ts!! No horse is replaceable!’ Ruby Walsh created controversy when he said that animals are replaceable after Our Conor suffered a fatal fall at Cheltenham on the first day of racing. Above, Our Conor (right) ridden by jockey Daniel Mullins . While another wrote: ‘@Ruby Walsh Don’t worry if you die in a race, there’ll be someone to replace you too.’ On Wednesday, the Mail reported how Walsh, who has twice won the Grand National, said that there is a difference between the death of a human and a horse. He said: ‘It’s sad, but horses are animals, outside your back door. Humans are humans. They are inside your back door. ‘You can replace a horse. You can’t replace a human being. That’s my feeling on it.’ Dene Stansall of campaign group Animal Aid told the Mail: ‘He has shown callousness for the animals that have earned him a good living. ‘It’s completely disrespectful. To treat the death of a horse in such a way shows that they are merely machines for people to make money. ‘Ruby Walsh is the leading jockey at Cheltenham and wants to support the event as much as he can, but you cannot disregard the lives of horses just because they are not humans. ‘We would expect more from him. This shows he has got little empathy for a horse that really suffered before it died.’ 'Lacking respect': Ruby Walsh, seen after taking a record sixth Mares' Hurdle title at the Cheltenham Festival on Tuesday, has been attacked by animal rights activists . Ingrid Newkirk, founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), said: ‘Walsh’s comments expose the true emotion behind horseracing: greed. They are deeply offensive to anyone who has ever loved and lost a horse or other beloved animal companion. ‘Unlike Walsh, horses are not unfeeling but experience joy, anxiety, fear and affection, just as human beings do.’ Mr Walsh last night declined to comment on the threats against him. He told the Mail: ‘I didn’t even know about it.’ Dozens of messages criticising Walsh have been sent directly to his Twitter account. One user, with the profile name Amy, wrote: ‘Do you hate horses because you are so short and this makes you angry?’ 'Lacking respect': Ruby Walsh, seen after taking a record sixth Mares' Hurdle title at the Cheltenham Festival on Tuesday, has been attacked by animal rights activists . Another posted: ‘YOUR (sic) AN IDIOT!! ‘A horse can be replaced’ really??? So can jockeys so I hope you fall off a horse & get trampled!’ Since the furore, Mr Walsh’s father, trainer Ted Walsh, has compared Britain’s attitude on the issue to that in Ireland. He said of the UK: ‘It’s a funny country. They can remember the names of horses that got blown up by the bombs in London but not the names of the people riding them.’ The British Horseracing Association has stressed that the welfare of horses is ‘paramount’ at races such as Cheltenham. A spokesman said: ‘Cheltenham Racecourse employs eight veterinary surgeons, whose sole responsibility it is to provide care to the horses throughout their time at the racecourse. ‘In the event of an incident on the racecourse, any horse affected will receive immediate attention and treatment from the racecourse’s veterinary team. ‘Qualified paramedics and doctors are also on hand in the case of any incident involving a jockey. ‘If necessary, horses and riders will be transported from the course to receive further treatment at the most appropriate equine hospital or Accident & Emergency hospital. ‘British Racing is open and transparent about the risks involved in the sport - the BHA Veterinary team monitors injury rates at every licensed racecourse. Over the last 15 years, the equine fatality rate has fallen by one third to 0.2 per cent of all runners. ‘Despite the best efforts of all involved, as with participation in any sport involving speed and athleticism, there remains an inherent risk of injury.’","Ruby Walsh said animals are replaceable after Our Conor suffered fatal fall .

"Jayden and Gemma Field were forced to return from their honeymoon after Lottie was run over by a car . A couple were forced to return from their honeymoon when their two-year-old daughter was injured in a hit and run. Gemma and Jayden Field had just arrived in the Portuguese Algarve when they learned Lottie, their toddler daughter, and her grandmother had been hit by a car. The child suffered injuries to the head and ear, while Mrs Fields's mother broke her shoulder in the accident in Sandwell, West Midlands. Police are appealing for information about the incident which took place two days after the couple's dream wedding. The driver, a woman driving a dark green BMW, fled the scene before officers arrived on September 22. 'Lottie and my mum could easily have been killed,'  said Mrs Field. 'When we found out it was horrendous. Me and Jayden were absolutely distraught - we didn't know what to do or where to go. 'I understand the driver becoming intimidated as people had gathered around saying ""what have you done"". 'What I can't get my head around is why she hasn't got in touch with the police.' Mrs Field's mother, Lorraine Clulow, acted as a human shield for her granddaughter when she noticed the car approaching them. 'I can't stop thinking if I hadn't held on to Lottie she'd have ended up under the car. 'I saw the car coming from the corner of my eye and just ripped her off my hip and held on to her hand for dear life. 'The driver got out of the car and said something like ""are you alright, love?"", but I couldn't look up - I was too distraught. 'I really don't know how anyone can drive away from a situation like that. 'I'm furious because of the distress she's caused the whole family. 'Not only did she hurt me, but worse she injured the granddaughter I had in my arms.' A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'A 51-year-old pedestrian and her two-year-old grandchild were struck by a car on the High Street at just after 10am. The toddler was left with head and neck injuries after the incident. Her injuries may have been worse if her grandmother had not acted as a human shield and protected her from the car . Mrs Field's mother, Lorraine Clulow (right), fractured her shoulder after turning her body towards the car to save her granddaughter . The 51-year-old was left with a fractured shoulder and bruising on her legs and feet. She said she could not believe the driver fled the scene without giving her details . The couple celebrated their wedding just two days before the horrifying incident in Sandwell, West Midlands . 'They both suffered fractures to their shoulders. 'The driver of the car stopped at the scene to check the pedestrians were OK before leaving without giving her details.

"For once, there was no hyperbole in the estate agents' blurb. 'A bit shabby' and 'no architectural merit' were among their unvarnished opinions of the bricks and mortar. But this run-down house in desperate need of repair has sold for nearly £3.5 million to set a record for the millionaires' resort of Sandbanks. Is the dream over? This run-down house in the millionaire's resort of Sandbanks sold for nearly £3.5 million. The owners hoped to bulldoze it and build their dream home . Desirable: Confused as to why the price of a shabby house is so high? This sea view is the reason . Views: The property boasts incredible views of the sea to the front and picturesque Poole Harbour (pictured here) to the rear . The price paid for the shabby home on . the sandy peninsular in Poole, Dorset, equates to £1,725 per square . foot, well above the existing record of £1,364. It has sold for £3.45 million, which is more than a 400 per cent rise on the last time it was sold in 1998 for £665,000. With four bedrooms, two bathrooms, three reception areas and two balconies, on paper the house looks to have a lot going for it. But the unnamed couple who have bought it aren't interested in the actual building, which they plan to demolish, it is the precious plot of land it sits on. It enjoys one of the best locations on Sandbanks, boasting two-way views of picturesque Poole Harbour from the front and the sea to the rear. Needs work: The house cuts a rather sad figure next to its more glamorous neighbours . A shortage of property, and views like this, have made Sandbanks the fifth most expensive location in the world to buy property . Location: An aerial view showing the house on the Sandbanks peninsular . Despite its sale price of £3.45 million and the potential cost to rebuild, estate agents have described the deal as a 'sensible price'. Adrian Dunford, of estate agents Tailor Made which sold the detached house, said: 'The property was built in the 1950s, is in need of complete repair and has no architectural merit. 'But its location is considered an extremely rare opportunity given it affords a two-way view of both Sandbanks Beach and Poole Harbour. ""The internal living area is about 2,000 square feet and the price for it is a new record high for Sandbanks of 1,725 per square foot. 'The previous record was for a penthouse apartment that achieved 1,364 per sq ft in 2008. It is one of the last two-way plots that you can do something with for a sensible price. The owners of the house (pictured centre) will be able to walk straight onto the beach from their new property . Inside the £3.45m house: Estate agents have described the deal as a 'sensible price' The run-down house is to be demolished and rebuilt, at the cost of another £1m to its new owners . 'The couple who have bought it plan to have it as their main home. There is an option to refurbish it but it is likely that they will try and remove it and start again. 'Judging by the properties either side of it, it shouldn't be a problem to go up one more storey and a new house there could easily be worth five to six million pounds.' Although the existing 1950s house has no back garden to speak of, it does have direct access to the sandy beach. The property is one of the last of its type on the exclusive spot that has yet to be bought up and developed. QPR manager Harry Redknapp (left) and former Newcastle manager Graeme Souness (right) both have homes on Sandbanks and will know the area after both having managed nearby Southampton . The property has the appearance of a home that hasn't been lived in for some time . Round two: The couple intend to submit a revised plan in the near future . It is thought the new owners could spend up to £1 million building a modern, three-storey family home in its place. Sandbanks is rated as the fifth most expensive location in the world to buy property, with only Manhattan, Tokyo, Hong Kong and London ahead of it. Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp has a mansion home there and former Oasis singer Liam Gallagher and wife Nicole Appleton have holidayed there before. Recently its wealthy residents were in the news over a story they were planning to boycott a Tesco store which is set to open in the neighbourhood. Aghast residents said the store would look 'like a filling in a set of teeth' and thought a Waitrose or Marks and Spencer would be more suited to the affluent area. The property is one of the last of its type on the exclusive spot that has yet to be bought up and developed .

"A lawyer who was by the side of Corporal Nathan Cirillo in his final moments after being fatally shot has described the outpouring of love, support and aide she and other strangers used to try and keep the young man alive. Barbara Winters was on her way to a meeting on Wednesday morning when she passed the National War Memorial, stopping to take a few photos of the guards on duty before heading off on her way. Seconds later, she heard four shots and, knowing exactly what had happened, ran not away from the noise but back towards the Memorial and Cirillo. Scroll down for video . Saint of a stranger: Barbara Winters (above in black) has described the final moments of Corporal Nathan Cirillo's life, and the five strangers who worked to save him . Helping hand: Winters (above), a lawyer, had just passed the National War Memorial when Cirillo was shot, and immediately ran back to help . Winters said she had an instinctive feeling that the guards had been targeted. With four people already laying over the solider, and doing everything they could to help him, Winters also got involved. A nurse on her way to work, Margaret Lerhe, and another solider who was on guard were busy applying pressure to his wounds so as to stop his bleeding. A fellow passerby was working to elevate the 24-year-old's feet while a fellow corporal was by his head talking to him. 'You’re doing good, you’re doing good, buddy,' he told Cirillo. 'You’re breathing - keep breathing.' Gone to soon: Cirillo (on left) photographed just minutes before he was fatally shot . Stand-up guy: The 24-year-old (above) would eventually die in the arms of the five strangers who worked to save him . Winters, who was recounting her story for The Globe and Mail, she got down, loosened the solider's tie, said a prayer, and also began speaking to the brave young corporal, telling him, 'You’re a good man, you’re a brave man.' He soon stopped breathing and lost his pulse, but the team of five strangers kept doing everything they could for Cirillo. They started compressions and lifted his legs higher and alternated giving the man CPR. And Winters kept on talking. 'You are loved. Your family loves you. You’re a good man,' she told him. 'Your family loves you. Your parents are so proud of you. Your military family loves you. All the people here, we’re working so hard for you. Everybody loves you.' Unfortunately her words, and the hard work of the five strangers, could not save Cirillo. He died in their arms as paramedics arrived and began to work on him. Lerhe, who actually watched the entire horrifying incident go down, says she did not even believe it was real at first. 'I thought, ""It stands to reason, they're having a drill,""' she told CBC. 'Then I thought, ""They're having a theater piece,"" because the shooter, with his long gun, it was so incongruous. It didn't look real at all.' Hero: Margaret Lerhe (above) was also on the scene helping Cirillo . Then, she saw the shooter fire, and rushed into action. Just don't call her a hero.

"It appears LG is hot on the heels of rival Samsung and is gearing up to launch its own curved smartphone, according to leaked photographs. Technology site Engadget claims to have obtained three rendered images of what is believed to be LG's rumoured G Flex phone set to launch as early as next month. The overall design of the phone is shown, cast in shadows, and the handset curves from top to bottom - unlike Samsung's Galaxy Round that curves from left to right. Technology site Engadget discovered the images, pictured, which appear to show LG's G Flex device with a 6-inch screen. It curves from top to bottom - unlike Samsung's Galaxy Round that curves from left to right . There's been a bit of a merry-go-round between the two Korean phone makers in recent months; as soon as one announces an advancement in flexible technology, the other follows suit shortly after. The two firms were the first in the world to sell curved OLED TV screens, for example. Samsung announced earlier this year it was working on flexible smartphone technology before LG claimed it had completed work on its own flexible 6-inch plastic screen at the start of last week. Just a day later, Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Round handset in Korea. Samsung claimed its Galaxy Round . handset was curved on the horizontal because this makes it easier to . hold in the palm of a hand. However, LG's G Flex appears to curve on the . vertical which goes against Samsung's claims - so what is the point of . the technology? Following the Galaxy Round announcement last week, Android expert Kellex from Droid Life said: 'This is a Galaxy Note 3 with a curved display and a couple of extra gimmicky . features. We still aren’t seeing a point.' Dave Evans, Chief Technology Officer at Somo said: 'Some might be calling this a gimmick, but we think this is an interim . step toward ‘truly’ flexible screens that would revolutionise the . current form factors of mobile. 'Some people thought touchscreen phones . were a gimmick and would never catch on. Seven years later I think it’s . fair to say those people have been proved wrong.' Stephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble, similarly disagrees and told MailOnline: 'While flexible screens haven't been lauded as an aesthetic marvel, they're no design gimmick. 'Almost . a third of mobile claims we process are for accidental damage - mainly . cracked screens from people dropping or sitting on them. If unbreakable, . bendable screens gain popularity, it would solve that problem . overnight.' Will Findlater, Global online editor for Stuff Magazine . added: 'Looking further on, the roll-up tablet would have obvious . benefits for portability - it could be like carrying a real newspaper . instead of a solid rectangle all over again - and there could be new, . intuitive user interfaces introduced, as we've already seen with Plastic . Logic's Papertab and its ability to swap between pages when its corners . are bent slightly upwards. 'There's even talk of gadgets that can adapt their physical dimensions based on what you're using them for.' David Quin, Head of Consumer Applications at CoPilot told MailOnline: 'There’s hint of ‘we’ve launched it because we can’ about some of the new curved smartphones announced recently, however it’s really just the beginning. In the near future screens will become thinner and won’t need to be flat like they are today, making them better suited for certain tasks. A curved screen could help reduce glare in direct sunlight for example. 'Designers will be able to embed technology in a more subtle, natural way: both more attractive and comfortable to use - think of a curved sat nav display embedded seamlessly within the sweep of your car’s dashboard or a status display on fridge fascia. 'There’s great possibilities for wearable technology too of course, for example curved smart watches or a tablet computer that can roll-up and even fold into your pocket. 'The challenge will be to introduce flexible technology in way that’s actually useful to people, not simply as a marketing gimmick.' Rob Hodges at e2save continued: 'Provided the Galaxy Round proves to be robust in South Korea, we could see round displays roll out on more smartphones and wearable tech over the next 2-3 years.' Paul Briden, Reviews Editor from Know Your Mobile told MailOnline: 'Phones with curved glass displays have been released before. That particular model sold well, but it wasn’t because it had a curved display it was because it was an all-round good phone with Google’s official stamp on it and one of the few at the time running stock Android. 'The difference this time is this new technology, the flexible OLED component, which is specifically the substrate underneath the glass and which actually produces the picture you see. 'The technology is significant because it is unbreakable, unlike the older glass substrate, and in the future the flexible nature potentially allows for more inventive phone designs with things like wrap-around displays. 'It’s worth pointing out though that there’s still a layer of glass on top, which is still breakable, so for users worried about cracking their screen the change isn’t quite as significant just yet, though this is likely to change in the future.' The Galaxy Round curves from left to right and is only currently available in the company's home region. LG . is set to launch its own curved phone next month - although some . experts claim it won't be ready until the start of next year. LG's 6-inch display is made of bendy plastic substrates, rather than . glass, and the panel can be attached to any curved device. Samsung's Galaxy Round handset, pictured, curves from left to right. The company claims this makes it more comfortable to hold than other phones . This image shows the alleged LG G Flex phone from a side angle. It appears to curve from top to bottom, unlike Samsung's Galaxy Round, but it is thinner than its rival's device . The design is 0.44mm thick and has a protective film attached to the back, making it 'bendable and unbreakable.' It is vertically concave from top to bottom, has a radius of 7cm and weighs 7.2g. LG . Chem, the South Koren firm's research arm, additionally said it was ready to unveil a curved battery prototype ahead of any new handset launch. LG Display's technology could also be fitted to smart watches, and other devices, that can be wrapped around items, pictured . Although the handset isn't expected . to be bendy, the use of a flexible screen could mean it has a more . curved display than current phones. Samsung's .

The pollen count will be high in the next few days as Britain enjoys warmer weather, the Met Office warned today. Britain has had a relatively low pollen count so far this year because of unsettled weather. Yolanda Clewlow, Health Manager at the Met Office said: 'We have seen some very high pollen counts during the recent fine weather. 'Further high counts are also expected during periods of warmer, drier weather across most parts of England and Wales.' The Met Office said the pollen season is split into three phases and we are currently in the 'grass pollen season' which lasts from mid-May through to August. Tuesday had been tipped to be the . warmest day of the year but the sunshine struggled to break through the . cloud, and the highest temperature recorded was 24C in Manchester - . slightly below 25C on June 6 in Lee-On-Solent, Hampshire. Further north today, temperatures are remaining lower, with the driest weather expected in Wales, Northern Ireland and northern England. North-west Scotland will be the coolest region. The warm weather comes as Met Office experts warned that Britain faces a decade of wet summers, as they got together to discuss recent unusual weather patterns. They blame natural warming in the . Atlantic for pushing a current of fast-flowing air in the upper . atmosphere, known as the jet stream, further south. Scientists say the likelihood of . successive heavy downpours is increased if Britain is stranded north of . the jet stream for long stretches of summer.

"Alexis Sanchez netted Arsenal's opener against Besiktas but the £30million star's overall performance on Wednesday night highlighted the Gunners' urgent need for an out-and-out striker. In the absence of Olivier Giroud, Sanchez was used as the Gunners go to man upfront but looked isolated and unable to create the magic Arsenal fans will have been hoping to see when the Chilean arrived at The Emirates this summer. A world-class attacker who gave everything on Wednesday, yes, but deploying £30million Sanchez as a lone frontman is a waste of his supreme talents. On target: Alexis Sanchez fires Arsenal ahead in the Gunners' Champions League play-off against Besiktas . Pointing the way: Sanchez is congratulated by  Jack Wilshere after scoring his first competitive Arsenal goal . Struggles: Sanchez gave an impressive performance but the Chilean isn't suited to playing the lone frontman . VIDEO Sanchez showed fighting spirit - Wenger . This Champions League qualifier reaffirmed Arsenal's need for a targetman - someone to goal-hang, to finish the many chances a five-man Arsenal midfield will create. The Gunners worked hard and fully-deserved their 1-0 victory but lacked that cutting edge in the final third - Sanchez performed well and won many of his duels against defenders but isn't entirely suited to playing upfront on his own. With the scores at 0-0, Sanchez continued to run deeper and deeper in a bid to get on the ball and influence the game leaving Arsenal bereft of anybody to assist upfront. As the touch map below shows, much of Sanchez's play came from outside of the area. Rolling in the deep: Sanchez's touch map shows how deep the Arsenal frontman came for possession . Wayne Rooney shares a similar trait - when his side is in desperate need of a goal, the Manchester United frontman will also drop deep in an attempt to change the match. Both players make things happen and have the skills to do so. Of course, Sanchez's strike came as the 25-year-old was sprinting into the box rather than standing and waiting inside it as Arsenal's tactics suggest. The men playing behind Sanchez - Jack Wilshere, Mesut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey - can thread forward passes  all night long but it has little effect with no frontline to run onto the ball or hold it up. Everywhere: Sanchez spent large parts of the match outside of the area in an attempt to make things happen . Pulling the strings: Mesut Ozil and Jack Wilshere needed to get beyond Sanchez in Giroud's absence . The midfield trio must run beyond Sanchez if Arsenal are to have any luck in front of goal but that isn't happening so far this season - the Gunners look restricted and almost come to a standstill in the final third with every player seemingly keen to assist rather than be set up themselves. As well as balls through the middle, much of the play from Arsenal's widemen is also wasted without a towering presence in the area. New right back Mathieu Debuchy - who was to be sent off late on - whipped in an inviting cross on twenty minutes but the ball was easily cleared by the Turkish visitors as Arsenal lacked anybody in the area who could adequately challenge in the air. Nobody to ruffle the feathers of the Besiktas backline. Looking forward: Sanchez plays a forward ball past Besiktas midfielder Atiba Hutchinson on Wednesday night . This was highlighted in the Gunners' 2-2 draw with Everton on Saturday. Sanchez was completely ineffective at Goodison Park, admittedly a tough place to play your first away game in the Premier League. The former Barcelona man was replaced having struggled up against the powerful defensive pairing of Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin. However, as soon as Sanchez was replaced by Giroud, Everton looked stretched and Jagielka and Distin looked anxious almost as the striker caused them problems in the air - something Sanchez was unable to do. As it was, Giroud was the man to latch on to Nacho Monreal's cross from the left to equalise in the dying stages and salvage a point for the Gunners. Rescue point: Substitute Olivier Giroud scores a last-gasp equaliser for Arsenal against Everton . Unfortunately, Arsenal will have to do without the French international for a considerable amount of time after Giroud suffered an ankle injury. Many fans of the north London club were adamant the club needed another striker even with a fit Giroud - now with the No 12 set for a spell on the sidelines,  Arsene Wenger will surely have to act in the final days of the transfer window. If Wenger fails to do so, the £30million talent of Alexis Sanchez will be completely reigned in if forced to play as Arsenal's lone frontman. Sanchez can score goals as well as create but would be far better playing behind the striker rather than the furthest man forward himself.","Alexis Sanchez scored the only goal in Arsenal's 1-0 win over Besiktas to fire his team into the Champions League .

"Mauricio Pochettino has no intention of letting Roberto Soldado and Andros Townsend leave before the end of the transfer window, insisting both men have important roles to play at Tottenham. Having swapped Southampton for north London in the summer, life at White Hart Lane could not have started much better for the former Argentina defender. Barclays Premier League victories over London rivals West Ham and QPR bookended a comeback win in Cyprus against AEL Limassol in the Europa League play-offs. VIDEO Scroll down for Mauricio Pochettino dismisses rumours of Soldado leaving . Staying put: Roberto Soldado will not be allowed to leave Tottenham after struggling last season . Soldado netted a wonderful, first-half leveller in a first leg Tottenham went onto win 2-1, although speculation continues to mount about the Spain international's future ahead of the second leg. AC Milan have been strongly linked with the forward, who Pochettino has no intention of letting go despite a struggling since his £26million move from Valencia last year. 'Soldado is here,' he said. 'I never talk about any player rumours. 'He is in my plans. For the future? Yes. Yes. We've only had two games in the Premier League and one in the Europa League. 'I believe in all the squad. It is important you know I can only pick 11.' A problem with his back and neck means Soldado will not be involved in Thursday's second leg against AEL as Spurs look to reach the Europa League group stages. Pochettino did, though, confirm that winger Townsend will be in the squad to face the Cypriots, having been dropped from the 18 that beat former club QPR 4-0 at the weekend. Like Soldado, the England international has been the subject of interest from elsewhere and, despite QPR and Southampton reportedly sniffing around, he too will be staying put. No thanks: Andros Townsend has been linked with a move to Southampton but is also set to stay at Spurs . 'He is in my plans,' Pochettino said of Townsend. 'It is impossible you play or have in the squad only 11 players - you need 24 or 25 players. 'I think we have to play a lot of games and it is possible you play tomorrow, then don't play in the next Premier League game, but the most important thing is understanding that we need to choose for the games. 'It is only 11 in each game after that another three impact players come in. 'We have an unbelievable squad and my job is not only to put my philosophy in the club or on the pitch on how we need to play, but I need choice and that is my job.' One player Spurs have let go is club captain Michael Dawson, who on Tuesday completed his move to Hull for a fee understood to be in the region of £6million. Villarreal's Mateo Musacchio had been expected to come in as his replacement, but now a deal for Sevilla centre-back Federico Fazio appears more likely. Training days: Younes Kaboul (centre) with Sandro (second right) and Paulinho (second left) I'll decide: Mauricio Pochettinowas insistent that he will not allow his best players to leave the club . Pochettino would not talk about either player but admitted he needed centre-backs with different characteristics. 'We need to have different options in this position,' he said. 'Okay, we have Younes Kaboul, we have Vertonghen, we have Vlad, we have Dier, we have Fryers, Veljkovic. 'All different players, all different characteristics and it's important to add some players and after you can choose in every game the best options.' As well leaving Spurs in need of another defensive option, Dawson's exit to Hull means they need a new captain. Kaboul skippered the side in both of their league matches and Hugo Lloris was captain against AEL, with Pochettino not planning to make a permanent choice until after the window. 'It is important that we have many leaders in the group, in the squad,' he said. 'Only you need to wait a few days to know the new captain. 'In the last game against Limassol, it was Lloris. In the two Premier League games it was Younes Kaboul. For tomorrow, maybe we repeat Hugo or another.' Gearing up: Towsend and Harry Kane prepare for Tottenham's Europa League clash on Thursday .

"Justin Bieber's monkey Mally could end up spending months in a German animal shelter after the singer was given an extension to sort out the paperwork needed to get the animal back. The animal was confiscated by customs officials in Munich as Bieber flew in from LA to perform a series of concerts. Now the pop star is trying to get his pet back. Mally, a capuchin monkey, was given to the singer for his 19th birthday last month from music producer Jamal 'Mally Mal' Rashid. He had been taken away from his mother when he was only nine weeks old. Scroll down for video . Stranger moments: Justin's monkey Mally was confiscated while on tour in Germany . Mally the monkey is now in quarantine at a German animal shelter . The capuchin monkey, taken from its mother at nine weeks, is treating a cuddly toy as its surrogate parent . Normally capuchin monkeys remain with their mothers for at least the first year of their life. He is now in quarantine in a Munich animal sanctuary where his only companion is a cuddly toy that he treats as a surrogate mother. Mally also spends his time repeatedly calling out in the hope of finding other members of his family group - something which animal shelter boss Karl Heinz Joachim, 64, described as 'heartbreaking'. He said: 'Justin Bieber has won an extension because the four week limit on confiscated animals only applies if the owner does not get in touch. 'However his management team had been in touch and indicated that they want the monkey back which means they now have as much time as they need to get the paperwork ready. 'If that takes months then it's months that they have. But that just isn't acceptable for the baby monkey needs company and to be with other monkeys at this crucial age in its life. 'We'll appeal to the star to do the decent thing and let the monkey be free for adoption. The boss of the Munich animal shelter asked Bieber to do 'the decent thing' and let the animal be adopted . Mally spends his time repeatedly calling in the hope of finding other members of his family group, animal shelter staff said . 'There are a great many suitable places that have offered to take Mally and integrate him with their own capuchin monkeys where he would be much more happy with his own kind. 'A baby monkey is not something suitable to be on a world tour even if he is travelling by private jet. 'He should be out in the wild climbing trees and learning from other monkeys if he isn't to have serious psychological problems later in life.' A source familiar with the situation . told MailOnline: 'There are ongoing discussions to ensure the best . conditions for the monkey.' A German customs spokesman said at the time of the confiscation that Bieber lacked documents certifying compliance with animal health and species-protection regulations. Joachim said if it took months to sort out the paperwork and all that time was spent in a cage it would do irreparable damage to the monkey's mental state. He said if Bieber were to refuse to allow the monkey to be adopted by a suitable organisation then the only hope lay with the Bavarian environment ministry. However the Ministry has so far declined to comment on the case.","Mally the capuchin monkey was held by customs officials in Munich .

"Sunderland's late show sent the Black Cats through in the Capital One Cup - and leave Birmingham fuming. Jordi Gomez, Adam Johnson and Connor Wickham struck in the final 13 minutes to stun the hosts and give the Premier League side a 3-0 win. But Blues were angered after Gomez's opener, claiming the ball had gone out in the build-up. The Black Cats made hard work of the win as David Cotterill hit the post and Clayton Donaldson missed for the hosts. VIDEO Scroll down for Jordi Gomez: I jumped at chance to get back to Premier League . Clincher: Connor Wickham celebrates Sunderland's third goal as they beat Birmingham City .

Subs: van Aanholt, Cattermole, Rodwell, Fletcher, Giaccherini, Mannone, Buckley . Booked: . Goals: Gomez, Johnson, Wickham . It was harsh on Birmingham, who had matched the Barclays Premier League side in Lee Clark's first meeting with Sunderland as a manager, after a two-year spell with the Black Cats which ended in controversy in 1999. The former midfielder was forced to leave after wearing an offensive T-shirt which mocked Sunderland fans. Clark called on Colin Doyle in goal while opposite number Gus Poyet made six changes from the side which held Manchester United to a 1-1 draw at the weekend. Costel Pantilimon, Billy Jones and Gomez made their first starts for the Black Cats. Sebastian Larsson also started, having spent five years at Blues before moving to the north-east. Paul Caddis tested Pantilimon from distance early but any early hope for a Birmingham onslaught was swiftly dashed. Take the lead: Sunderland's Jordi Gomez hits the shot that put the Black Cats ahead . Subdued: Gomez marks his opener with a laid-back celebration but it was the impetus his side needed . Blues' grit and determination gave them a foothold but they rarely breached the Sunderland backline with serious menace in the opening half an hour. The game's pedestrian nature did little to conjure a spectacle either. The visitors, disjointed and ragged, rarely looked like a top flight side with Jozy Altidore isolated up front. Doyle was well protected by the Birmingham defence and limited and limp Sunderland lacked the nous to penetrate. The hosts created the best chances late in the first half though and could have gone into the break ahead. More like it: Adam Johnson (right) accepts some low fives from team-mates after he made it a respectable 2-0 . Over and out: The third goal in the Black Cats' 13-minute blitz comes from Connor Wickham's right boot . First Wes Thomas turned Mark Duffy's cross wide on 43 minutes and 60 seconds later Cotterill hit the outside of the post from a tight angle. They were brief bright moments in a dour first half and things did not improve in the early stages of the second half. While Birmingham remained the aggressors, their final ball rendered any build-up useless with Sunderland easily holding firm. Gradually the top flight side began to take charge through. Tight tussle: Birmingham's Mark Duffy (left) battles for possession with Sunderland's Billy Jones (right) Close quarters: Black Cats' star Connor Wickham (left) is given no space by City's Jonathan Spector . Gomez could not force the ball in after a 65th minute scramble and Doyle saved Liam Bridcutt's low effort a minute later. However, the Black Cats broke the deadlock with 13 minutes remaining - when Gomez received the ball 25 yards out and rifled into the bottom corner. Birmingham were unhappy though as they felt the ball had gone out deep in the Sunderland half during the build-up. Donaldson wasted a fine chance to instantly level when he shot at Pantilimon and David Edgar shot over before Sunderland sealed the game. Johnson fired in after Altidore's shot was saved in the 87th minute, before Wickham stroked in from 15 yards a minute later. Danger man: City's Clayton Donaldson is tackle by Liam Bridcutt .

"A stately home sold by a cash-strapped council has increased in value by more than £2 million since the sale - sparking fears the local authority did not negotiate the best deal for the taxpayer. Controversy followed the sale of Windlestone Hall - the birthplace of former Conservative Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden - when it was sold by Durham County Council in 2012 for just £241,000. Now the historic building, near Rushyford, Durham, is being marketed by the new owner and could fetch up to £2.5 million. Windlestone Hall, (pictured) was sold by Durham County Council in 2012 for £241,000 - it could now sell for up to £2.5 million . The hall, which is advertised as a 'substantial country house with an abundance of architectural delight', is up for sale along with 25 acres of grounds, stables, courtyard, clock tower and cottages. It has been described by the English Heritage as one of the North-East's 'most historically significant buildings'. Durham County Council defended the sale, and said the £241,000 it raised represented 'good value' after the housing market crash, adding that £3 million worth of repairs were required to bring the hall up to scratch. Sir Anthony Eden (pictured) a former Conservative Prime Minister, was born at Windlestone Hall in 1897 . But County Councillor John Shuttleworth, who originally challenged the council over the sale, said: 'The idea that they got best value for it is a load of rot. Heads should roll over this.' A spokesman for the Taxpayers' Alliance added: 'This is an extraordinary hike in such a short time, so one can only assume the property was significantly undervalued when it was sold. 'The council isn't a property speculator so was right to offload the property, but it shouldn't have been sold off on the cheap. 'With the council trying to make savings, there's no excuse for negotiating such a bad deal for taxpayers.' Owner William Davenport, 58, said he had hoped developing the site would fund the restoration of the 30-bedroomed grade II* listed mansion to its original splendour. But after failing to secure additional land for a new equestrian centre and seeing a planned sale of seven and-a-half acres of land for executive housing come to nothing, he and his family are selling up. The site is being sold in lots by estate agents Urban Base, which has offices in Newcastle and Durham. The hall, along with the East and West Wing, is being advertised for £1.5 million, the stables, courtyard and clock tower for £395,000, 'The Old Stables' plot for £245,000, six two-storey terraced cottages for £270,000 and a cottage and field for £150,000. Urban Base director Jan Dale said her client felt 'vilified by baseless comments' they had been subjected to since they bought the hall and said it had been newly priced based on comparisons in the area. She said: 'My client bought a property that was in dire condition and there has been an extraordinary amount of work undertaken to stabilise, repair and improve the property. 'Unfortunately the plans for the property were not realised due to not being able to acquire additional land as originally anticipated. 'My client has gone to great lengths to understand the best viable and sustainable use for the property going forward and we are looking for a buyer who can do just that. 'It's a beautiful property of significant historical importance and [the owners] should be applauded for rescuing it at a very low point of the real estate market in 2011. 'A lot of time, money and effort has been invested even after it was known that the property would not be able to used for the original intended purpose.' Graeme Blenkinsopp, of Crook-based estate agent Wisemove, who earlier this year was instructed to sell seven acres of land adjacent to the hall, backed both the authority and the owners. Mr Blenkinsopp said Wisemove withdrew its involvement after being told the chances of planning permission for housing was slim. He said: 'The Davenports have done nothing wrong, they were granted an opportunity to buy the hall at a quarter of a million quid and it was worth the investment. The historical building, near Rushyford, Durham,  could fetch up to £2.5m after undergoing 'an extraordinary amount of work' Current owner William Davenport had hoped to secure additional land for a new equestrian centre, but is now selling up . Durham County Council (pictured) said given the condition of the building the offer they accepted was 'the only viable one we received' 'There has been no underhand dealing by the local authority or the owners. The council had something that they thought was a liability, they offered it on the open market and people offered what they thought. 'The mistake the council probably made was not offering it back to the open market and inviting an increased offer.' Ian Thompson, Durham County Council's corporate director of regeneration, said: 'An external auditor carried out a full investigation into the sale of Windlestone Hall and concluded that it was not possible to substantiate claims that the council could have made more money from the sale. 'The auditor also found that the sale was compliant with the council's policy requirements. 'The property was on the market for a number of years, during which time we worked extremely hard to secure an offer that would protect the building's historic importance and also provide the best value for money for the council. 'Given the condition of the building, the state of the market, the very significant maintenance costs that were being incurred by the council and the limitations on any possible development in the grounds, the offer we eventually accepted was the only viable one we received. 'As well as generating £240,000 for the council, the sale of the hall has delivered substantial savings to the council, including £300,000 since November 2011 on security, heating and repair costs. 'The council is also no longer responsible for carrying out the £3m of urgent repairs that the building required.'","Windlestone Hall, near Rushyford in Durham, was sold by Durham County Council for £241,000 in 2012 .

"The humble onion has a lot more to offer than flavouring your stew and is coming into its own as a beauty product and ALICE ROBINSON bravely applied a clothes peg to her nose and tried out some beauty recipes. SLATHER ON FOR SHINY HAIR . THE THEORY: ‘Onions are naturally acidic — if you use them in hair masques, the acidity will close the cuticle of the hair and make it look shiny,’ says consultant trichologist Iain Sallis. ‘Onions are naturally acidic — if you use them in hair masques, the acidity will close the cuticle of the hair and make it look shiny,’ says consultant trichologist Iain Sallis. THE TEST: Grind an onion with equal amounts of coconut or olive oil to make a hair rinse. Leave on for two hours. MY VERDICT: I reluctantly pick up my grater and shred an onion into a bowl. I mix the pulp with virgin organic coconut oil from a jar. The resulting oily mush is full of onion bits, and I flinch as I smear it into my hair, which feels unbelievably greasy. Bits of onion fall on the floor every time I move — it probably would have been a good idea to wrap my head in clingfilm or an old towel. I sit very carefully and sulkily at my laptop, trying not to shed onion on the keyboard. After two hours, I dash to the shower — almost retching at the acrid smell of warm, raw onion under hot water. I use my usual shampoo and vigorously brush my hair as I wash it off. After blow-drying, my hair does look and feel glossy — and thankfully doesn’t smell, not even of coconut. It would be less stressful to just pay up for a blow-dry or expensive conditioner. Nonetheless, it works. 3/5 . GROW YOUR HAIR FASTER . Make an onion hair masque for thinning hair . THE THEORY: Onions and honey have been used in recipes to counteract thinning hair for centuries. ‘In the Middle Ages, onions were prized and prescribed for the relief of headaches, coughs, snakebite and hair loss,’ says Iain Sallis. ‘There is no scientific evidence of this being effective at all.’ However, an article published in the Journal of Dermatology a decade ago showed promising results. THE TEST: Make an onion hair masque for thinning hair — mix the juice of one onion with 2tsp of honey and leave overnight. Use two or three times a week. MY VERDICT: My hair is thinning a little but I’m not sure I’d opt for this as a solution. I don’t even need to spell out how anti-social wearing eau d’onion juice is. Add in sticky honey, and it’s completely off-putting. I dutifully apply the foul mixture, wrap my head in a towel and try to go to sleep as best I can. In the morning, I gratefully wash my hair which is, of course, after just one night, no thicker. But even if it made me look like Rapunzel, I wouldn’t do it again.1/5 . TAKE THE STING OUT OF BITES . THE THEORY: ‘Many believe the effects of a bite or sting can be relieved by rubbing it with an onion,’ says Eric Block, professor of chemistry at the State University of New York. ‘This effect is believed to be due to compounds such as quercetin. This is said to inhibit the formation of prostaglandins. These are responsible for allergic response and pain. ‘Many believe the effects of a bite or sting can be relieved by rubbing it with an onion,’ says Eric Block, professor of chemistry at the State University of New York. ‘In laboratory studies, quercetin inhibits the enzymes that are involved in allergic response, though not specifically pain production.’ THE TEST: Using a slice of raw onion to help reduce the effects of insect bites and nettle stings. MY VERDICT: Clearly it is not possible to capture an insect to sting me, so I ask my husband to put on his gardening gloves and bring in a nettle from the bottom of the garden. I rub it on my hand. The moment I feel that burning and itching sensation I frantically rub on a slice of onion. To my astonishment, the pain instantly subsides. No white mark from the nettle comes up on my hand and although it starts to sting again after a couple of minutes, another firm rub of onion gets rid of it. Extraordinary, though be aware of Dr Patterson’s warnings on possible skin irritation.5/5 . REDUCE DARK SPOTS . Mix equal quantities of onion juice and fresh yoghurt and massage into your face for ten to 15 minutes . THE THEORY: ‘Onions are said to get rid of dark spots and pigmentation,’ says Dr Patterson. ‘Some peels contain an onion extract which will increase skin cell turnover. When combined with lactic acid in yoghurt, it will have a mild peeling effect. It’s pretty labour-intensive. Also, it would be hard to work out quantities and how often to do it.’ THE TEST: Mix equal quantities of onion juice and fresh yoghurt and massage into your face for ten to 15 minutes. MY VERDICT: I extract onion juice (see right) and stir it into yoghurt. Although onion yoghurt sounds like something you would be force fed in George Orwell’s Room 101, after I carefully rub it onto my face, my skin feels smooth and dewy, though I can’t yet see any change in my age spots. It’s suggested you do this daily, so if I can bear it, I might persevere.2/5 . HOLD YOUR NOSE FOR GREAT SKIN . THE THEORY: ‘Onions have been the subject of dermatological interest for many years, as it has been suggested they have both anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects,’ says Dr Mervyn Patterson at Woodford Medical Clinic in Essex. A recent study showed onion juice had some effect on reducing skin scarring following Caesareans and further studies have suggested it may help with scar healing in both adults and children. So could onions help with skincare? A recent study showed onion juice had some effect on reducing skin scarring following Caesareans and further studies have suggested it may help with scar healing in both adults and children . Possibly. But Dr Patterson warns: ‘When unrefined onion juice comes into contact with the skin, there’s a risk of it becoming irritated.’ THE TEST: Make a mask with 2tbsp of flour, 1 ½tbsp of fresh onion juice, a pinch of nutmeg and ½ tsp of milk. Mix together to make a thick paste and apply to the face for up to 20 minutes. Remove by dabbing on some milk and massaging it away. MY VERDICT: It’s all very well mentioning onion juice, but extracting the stuff is harder than it sounds, especially if you don’t have a juicer. Standing with tears pouring down my cheeks, I grate two onions and press the resulting mush through a sieve and into a bowl. It reeks and takes a good ten minutes. The resulting paste looks like bread dough and stinks to high heaven. I tentatively dab it all over my face, trying to breathe as little as possible. I avoid putting it anywhere near my eyes. But on my skin, thankfully, it doesn’t sting at all. It feels cool and soothing, but I’ve never been so pleased to remove a face mask, which comes off in great gooey chunks. Once I scrape off the last bits, my skin is left feeling lovely and smooth — and not smelling of onions. 4/5 . BANISH ROUGH PATCHES ON YOUR ELBOWS . ‘Onions have anti-microbial properties which help to kill some bacteria and yeasts,’ says Iain Sallis. THE THEORY: ‘Onions have anti-microbial properties which help to kill some bacteria and yeasts,’ says Iain Sallis. ‘Clinical tests would need to be done before recommending them for any skin conditions.’ THE TEST: Wash the affected body part with an infusion of onion skins. MY VERDICT: I am thankfully low on skin disorders, but I do have rough dry skin on my elbows. There are many complicated ways of making infusions, but I simply drop a load of onion skin into a mug of hot water (interestingly this doesn’t smell too bad — like a sort of soup, though my husband flinches when I offer him a ‘cup of tea’). I dip my left elbow carefully into the mug of onion ‘tea’ and slosh it around for a few minutes. It does feel slightly less rough-compared to the other. I suspect this would need doing daily to have any real effect, and reckon a good emollient cream might work just as well.3/5 .","The humble onion has a lot more to offer than flavouring your stew .

"For Iris Grace Halmshaw, the world was a lonely place. The autistic five-year-old struggles to speak, is unnerved by other children and is frequently thrown into panic by the world around her. She fills her days with painting, and is so talented that her works sell for as much as £1,500. But nothing could quite relieve her isolation. Until, that is, a cat called Thula came along. Scroll down for video . Purrfect companion: Iris Grace Halmshaw gets to work on a painting, while Thula - in the red harness she wears for walks - looks on . The pair are now inseparable – and Iris's parents credit the gentle Maine Coon with helping their little girl become more tactile and affectionate, as well as influencing her already much-acclaimed works of art. The home-educated youngster has been producing astonishing Monet-style landscapes since she was three, when mother Arabella Carter-Johnson devised art sessions to help her with her daughter's concentration and speech. But since Thula arrived, Miss Carter-Johnson and her husband Peter-Jon Halmshaw say they have noticed Iris adding brush strokes which resemble a cat's eyes or nose. Initially, they thought it was just a coincidence, but now believe Iris is expressing her love for Thula through her painting. Inseparable: Iris's parents credit the gentle Maine Coon with helping their little girl become more tactile and affectionate . All that painting is tiring! After their busy day the pair cuddle up in bed. Iris's mother said she noticed her daughter adding brush strokes which resemble a cat's eyes or nose . The home-educated youngster has been producing astonishing Monet-style landscapes since she was three . 'When Iris is painting, Thula is told by her to 'sit cat' if she jumps up on to the table,' said Miss Carter-Johnson. 'She stays there watching Iris with great interest, occasionally wanting to play with the brushes, but mostly just patiently watching.' And the pair's bond doesn't end there. Thula is at Iris's side for every part of her life, right down to her bathtimes, when she will even share a shampoo and soak. When the family go out in the car, Thula will sit on Iris's lap, and she is more than happy to don her red harness and go for a walk on her lead. Miss Carter-Johnson, 33, said: 'Ever since we came home with this precious, magical kitten, she has been casting a spell over Iris. It was as if they were old friends from the day they met' The pair's closeness is having an effect on Iris's relationships with others, too, and her parents find it easier to encourage her to speak when Thula is around. After researching the benefits of animal therapy for autistic children the couple had tried introducing Iris to horses, dogs and even other cats with no success – but everything fell into place when Thula came to live with the family in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, in February. Within weeks, the kitten was helping to soothe the little girl in times of stress. Miss Carter-Johnson, 33, said: 'Ever since we came home with this precious, magical kitten, she has been casting a spell over Iris. It was as if they were old friends from the day they met. 'Thanks to Thula, new doorways to communication and emotions are opening and Iris is happier than ever before.'

"Police are investigating a shooting in Brisbane in which a car and a house belonging to two separate Muslim families were hit. A firearm, believed to be a shotgun, was used to fire into the Kentish Street house, at Mount Gravatt East in the city's south east, while several hundred metres away shots were  fired into a car at Dunbar Street. Both attacks, which happened about midnight,  have sparked outrage among Brisbane's Islamic community with one leader suggesting they could have been motivated by 'hate.' A bullet hole found on the car at Dunbar Street at Mount Gravatt East . Detectives say it is too early to identify who is behind the shootings, but Brisbane Islamic community leader Ali Kadri said the events were culturally motivated. 'For all we know it could be a hate crime, but we would like to wait until the police complete their investigation,' he told The Courier Mail. The incidents were reported yesterday morning and officers remained on the scene last night. The owner of the shot vehicle did not return calls when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. A police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia no further details on the shootings were available  and an update would likely be released on Sunday. Police are investigating two incidents that happened about midnight on Saturday at Mount Gravatt East . Mr Kadri said a pattern of anti-Islamic messaging had been popping up around Brisbane suburbs. At Algester, in the city's south-west, vile content spreading anti-Islamic messages had been graffiti'd at a school, while other messages of hate were found at an Islamic centre at Rocklea. A man was arrested and charged with wilful damage and trespass for the Rocklea incident. Mr Kadri also spoke openly about the Muslim community's reaction to the recent terror raids on homes across Australia, where he said he was 'shocked.' 'Over the last week we have had message of hate, but we have also had messages of encouragement,' he said following at the time of the raids. He has also spoken openly on the rejection of a Currumbin Mosque, on the Gold Coast, a decision he said was a narrow minded. The controversial proposal for a mosque in Currumbin on the Gold Coast had been rejected by the city's council with a vote of 10-5 against its construction. Mr Kadri said: 'I am disappointed that without engaging and communicating [the community] have opposed the mosque,' Kafri said. 'People have a right to object to anything and everything they want, but it should be based on fact,' he said.","Police are investigating a shooting at a car and house about midnight .

"Newly declassified documents show the FBI kept close tabs on Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's only daughter after her high-profile defection to the United States in 1967. The documents show the agency was gathering details from informants on how Lana Peters' arrival was affecting international relations at that time. She was known as Svetlana Alliluyeva before her defection. Ms Peters died last year, aged 85, in a Wisconsin nursing home. Journey: Peters, pictured in 2010, moved to the U.S. in 1967. She moved back to the Soviet Union in 1984 - but returned to the U.S. a year later . The FBI's file mainly contains memos . and . news articles from the late 1960s. One 1967 memo details a conversation . with a confidential source who said Peters' defection would have a . 'profound effect' on anyone else considering such a move from the Soviet . bloc. The files were released today under a Freedom of Information Act request. Svetlana Peters, who famously denounced communism and . moved to the United States in the late 1960s, died from colon cancer. Her defection in 1967 - partly motivated by the poor treatment of her late husband, Brijesh Singh, . by Soviet authorities - caused an international furore. Within months, she published her a memoir about life in Russia, entitled Twenty Letters to a Friend, that became a best-seller. But Peters, who was known internationally by her previous name, Svetlana Alliluyeva, said her . identity involved more than just switching from one side to the other in the . Cold War. Upon her arrival in New York City in . 1967, the 41-year-old said: 'I have come here to seek the self-expression . that has been denied me for so long in Russia.' She said she had come to . doubt the communism she was taught growing up and believed there weren't . capitalists or communists, just good and bad human beings. Loving bond: Soviet dictator Josef Stalin is seen carrying his beloved daughter Svetlana as a youngster before their relationship deteriorated in later life . In the book, she recalled her father, who died in 1953 after ruling the . nation for 29 years, as a distant and paranoid man. Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin denounced her as a 'morally unstable' and 'sick person'. 'I switched camps from the Marxists . to the capitalists,' she recalled in a 2007 interview. But she said her identity was far . more . complex than that and never completely understood. 'Over me my father's . shadow hovers, no matter what I do or say.' Lana Peters in a 1983 interview . 'People say, ""Stalin's daughter, . Stalin's daughter,"" meaning I'm supposed to walk around with a rifle and shoot . the Americans. 'Or they say, ""No, she came here. She is an American citizen."" That means I'm with a bomb against the others. 'No, I'm neither one. I'm . somewhere in between. That ""somewhere in between"" they can't understand.' The defection came at a high personal cost. She left two children behind in . Russia - Josef and Yekaterina - from previous marriages. Both were upset by her . departure, and she was never close to either again. Peters was Stalin's only daughter. She had two brothers, Vasili and Jacob. When . Lana was six years old, her mother, Stalin’s second wife, Nadezhda, . shot herself after a row over his philandering. Thereafter, Lana was . raised by a beloved nanny. Family album: Nadiezhda Alliluyeva, Joseph Stalin's second wife, with Lana, 1926 . At 17, she fell in love for the first time, with a film-maker and writer 22 years her senior named Aleksei Kapler. But Stalin did not approve of Kapler, . whom he dismissed as a ‘Bohemian artist’ and a Jew, and banished him to . Siberia for ten years. Yakov Dzhugashvili, . born in 1907, was Stalin's eldest child and raised by his aunt in . Tbilisi, Georgia. During WWII, Yakov fought in Russia's Red Army and was . captured by the Nazis in 1941. He died in a concentration camp in 1943, . aged 35. It has been suggested that he ran into an electric fence to . kill himself. Konstantin Kuzakov, . born in 1911, was Stalin's illegitimate second child, whose mother was . Stalin's landlady while he was in exile. In 1932, the Soviet secret . police forced him to sign a statement promising he would not reveal . Stalin was his father. He was later a colonel in WWII. After he was accused of being a spy, he was dismissed from the Communist party. He died in 1996. Vasili Dzhugashvili, born in 1921, was . the son of Stalin and his second wife. After her death, Stalin rarely . visited Vasili and Lana, and they were raised by nannies. Vasili . served in the Red Air Force, but was dismissed after allowing planes to . fly in bad weather. He was imprisoned for giving away secret . information to foreign diplomats. He died in 1962, aged 40, from . alcoholism. Incensed that her boyfriend had influenced her to apply for a university fine arts course, he also insisted she study history and become ‘an educated Marxist’. In an interview with the Daily Mail last year, she said of her father: ‘He broke my life. I want to explain to you, he broke my life twice. ‘He put to jail and then to labour camp the man I loved. I saw for the first time that my father could do that.’ She added: ‘He was a very simple man. Very rude. Very cruel. There was nothing in him that was complicated. He loved me and he wanted me to be with him.’ Peters graduated from Moscow University . in 1949, worked as a teacher and translator and travelled in Moscow's literary . circles before leaving the Soviet Union. She was married four times - the last . time to William Wesley Peters, an apprentice to the great architect Frank Lloyd Wright. She took the name Lana Peters. The couple had a . daughter, Olga, before divorcing in 1973. Peters wrote three more books, including Only One Year, an . autobiography published in 1969. The book made more than $3 million. Her father's legacy appeared to haunt her throughout her life. She denounced . his policies, which included sending millions into labor camps. 'Over me my father's . shadow hovers, no matter what I do or say,' she lamented in a 1983 . interview with the Chicago Tribune. After living in Britain for two years, Peters returned to the Soviet Union . with Olga in 1984, saying she wanted to be reunited with her . children. Her Soviet citizenship was restored, and she denounced her time in . the U.S. and Britain, saying she never really had freedom. Influence: Peters sits with Lavrentiy Beria, the chief of Soviet security under Stalin . But more than a year . later, she asked for and was given permission to leave after feuding with . relatives. She returned to the U.S. and vowed never to go back to Russia. By her later life, she was fully . immersed in American culture, admitted that she enjoyed American food, . particularly hamburgers, and American films, and prefered to speak her . adopted language. In an . interview with the Daily Mail last year, she said: ‘I have had American . citizenship for 30 years - and my daughter was born here - but they (the . Russian authorities) still won’t recognise that. They still want to . think of me as Russian. ‘And I hate them! I hate the Russian language! We aren’t Russian, you see. We are Georgian.’ When asked if she had forgiven . Stalin, she snapped: ‘I don’t forgive anything or anybody! If he could . kill so many people, including my uncles and auntie, I will never . forgive him. Never!’ She later lived in Cornwall, England for a brief period in the mid 1990s. A documentary, Svetlana About Svetlana, aired at the Madison Film Festival, Wisconsin in 2010. But Peters, who did not attend the airing, later expressed regret at taking part, claiming the film-maker Lana Parshina had tricked her. 'This girl (Parshina) told me she was a college film student and she had to present something different,’ said Lana. ‘She was young, and I always like to help young people, so I let her in. But she only came to see me twice and she didn’t say she was making a film about my father. ‘She just said it was going to be about the way I live now. I wish I didn’t do it. I won’t even make any money out of it. She will make all the money.’ She went into seclusion in the last . decades of her life in Richland Centre, Wisconsin, and relied on a cane . after she developing scoliosis — a condition which twists the spine. Her survivors . include her daughter Olga, who now goes by Chrese Evans and lives in Portland, . Oregon, where she manages a clothes shop. Her second daughter, who was born in 1950, goes by Katya, and is a scientist who . studies an active volcano in eastern Siberia. A son, Josef, died in 2008 at age 63 in Moscow, according to media reports . in Russia.","Newly-released files on Lana Peters who died last year aged 85 at Wisconsin nursing home .

"Search: Victor Barnard, 52, is wanted for allegedly raping underage girls for nearly a decade . Officers have launched a massive search - stretching from Minnesota to Washington - for a minister who allegedly raped underage girls for nearly a decade after claiming it was God's word. Victor A. Barnard, 52, is on the run after authorities in Pine County, Minnesota announced he faces 59 . counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving two former members of his sect - . although he could face more if other alleged victims come forward. A . nationwide warrant was issued on April 11 but authorities believe . followers of his sect, the River Road Fellowship, may be hiding him or throwing cops off the scent. Now officers in Minnesota and Washington are investigating dozens of leads after the Pine County Sheriff’s Office has been inundated with tips following reports of the search. 'It is nonstop,' Sheriff Robin Cole told the Star Tribune on Thursday. Washington officers and the U.S. Marshals Service are searching near Spokane, which was Barnard's last known residence, and contacting his associates. But the people have been 'less than helpful' with the law enforcement search, Cole said. Officials added that they do not think Barnard has crossed the U.S. border, and that tips have placed him in convenience stores, churches, garbage dumpsters and restaurants - although officials know many of them will be mistaken. Scroll down for video . 'Brainwashed': Young women gather around Victor A. Barnard, the leader of an alleged cult who is wanted for allegedly repeatedly sexually assaulting the girls, whom he called his 'Maidens' Barnard fled from Minnesota in 2009 after he was confronted about sleeping with married women. And in 2012, after enduring years of . abuse, former sect member Lindsey Tornambe alerted authorities to the . girls' plight. Another former cult-member, Jess Schweiss, told . authorities her story. The women say they were just 12 and 13 when, with their parents permission, they went to live with Barnard as part of a group of 10 women known as the Maidens, Fox9 reported. The Maidens, aged between 12 and 24, were first-born daughters handed over to Bernard and forced to have sex with him anywhere between once and five times a month over a decade. He said that Jesus and King Solomon had many women followers, so 'God's word' meant that it was normal for him to have sex with them. 'I still had a conscience, I knew it was . wrong,' Schweiss, who marked every sexual encounter with Barnard with an 'x' on a calendar, told Fox. Brave: Lindsey Tornambe said her parents took her to Barnard's home when she was 13 and she was left there for nearly a decade. She contacted authorities in 2012 about the abuse . Lost childhood: Jess Schweiss said she was just 12 when she was picked by Barnard to be one of his Maidens . Former lives: The girls, pictured when they were part of the group, said there were 10 Maidens . Her father told authorities that he . 'felt pressured to not say anything' about the sexual activity, . according to the criminal complaint. Schweiss has now cut her parents out of her life. 'I don't look at them as my parents . anymore,' she said. 'They weren't the parents I wanted or needed. My . parents, the people I grew up with as a child, don't exist anymore.' Speaking with the Star Tribune, Tornambe said she still remembers sitting in the congregation with her parents in 2000 when she was called by Bernard to a 'position of honor'. After her parents dutifully left her at his ranch, she said Bernard began talking to her about sex and grew angry when she said she did not understand the terms he was using. He had sex with her anyway and urged her not to tell anyone, she said. She added that her parents rarely came to visit, even though they lived just five miles away. Claims: Barnard told the women they should have sex with him because it was consistent with God's word . On the run: Police have a nationwide warrant out for his arrest but believe cult members are hiding him . Shunned: Weiss said that her parents, pictured, dismissed her claims that she had been sexually assaulted . She left his cabin when she was 15 but after her parents berated her with their disappointment and Bernard spoke to her about damnation, she reluctantly returned. 'I was really scared, and I didn’t know what receiving damnation from God would be like,' she said. 'I ended up just staying.' But a few years later, she left permanently and went to live with her parents, who had moved to Pennsylvania. They still placed Bernard's photographs around their home. When she told her parents about the abuse, her mother 'did not want to hear it', the criminal complaint notes. Tornambe eventually became a nanny, but when she heard cousins happily talking about their lives at a New Year's party in 2012, she realized Bernard had robbed her of hers and she called police. Scene: The River Road Fellowship had land in Minnesota before the claims surfaced and they fled west . Likewise, Schweiss split from the group and moved to Wisconsin in September 2009, but she said she attempted suicide in 2011. When her brother confronted her, she told him about the abuse. 'I feel bad in one sense that I am taking Victor's life away from him by putting him behind bars, but then again, he took my life away from me, which I should have had,' she said. 'So, I feel that - for lack of better words - I think I'm even.' Tornambe adeed: 'I definitely don't want Victor hurting anyone else.' Pine County Chief Sheriff’s Deputy Steven Blackwell said that the 59 counts only relate to the claims by the two women and that authorities are hopeful more will come forward.

Mass Transit Authority police in the city say that based on the video, they believe the train was either arriving or leaving the Mondawmin station. The boys not only try to force the man out, but are also seen punching and hitting, and one point both boys are jumping on the man as others on the train just watch it all happen, offering no help.

"British soldiers have returned to Iraq to train Kurdish fighters in using heavy weapons as the fight against ISIS intensifies. The Ministry of Defence confirmed that the 'small specialist team' will be based near the Kurdish capital of Irbil in northern Iraq after their deployment was approved by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. While in the war-torn region, the troops will train the Kurdish peshmerga forces to use the heavy weapons supplied to them last month. Kurdish peshmerga forces, who are set to receive training in firing weapons by British forces being sent to Iraq . The peshmerga forces are said to be overrun in northern Iraq and have had weapons supplied to them in their fight against ISIS . It comes five years afer the last combat troops left Iraq after British forces invaded in 2003 to overthrow Saddam Hussein. According to the Sunday Times, the troops will come from the 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment, who are based in Cyprus. They also reported that Briain has sent 61 tons of machineguns and ammunition to the Kurds. It is thought they will teach the Kurds how to fire the powerful L1A1 12.7mm machine gun. The peshmerga forces are said to be overrun in northern Iraq and last month failed their first major test on the battlefield last month, when ISis militants overran their positions . The powerful L1A! 12.7mm heavy machine gun, which British troops will train peshmerga Kurds how to use . Defence Secretary Michael Fallon approved the deployment of the ground troops, who will be based near Irbil . A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: 'The Government has previously made clear its intention to provide training to the Peshmerga as part of the continued effort to assist in the fight against Isil (ISIS). The SAS used the world's most powerful sniper rifle to halt ISIS killers in Iraq, it has been reported. It is thought that the SAS team used the AW50 weapon to shoot at a lorry taking militants to a undefended Iraqi village. According to the Daily Star Sunday, the troops feared they were going to target vulnerable civilians so decided to deploy the gun. The first shot is said to have hit the truck's engine, which split in two. And when the jihadists tried to flee in a second vehicle, they destroyed that too. The AW50 is described as a high-calibre, long range weapon, capable of taking out enemies from extreme distances. 'The Defence Secretary has approved the deployment of a small specialist team of non-combat Army trainers which is now in the Irbil area providing instruction on operating, employing and maintaining the heavy machine guns that were gifted by the UK last month.' It is also believed that a number of special forces are also operating in the region as part of efforts to track down those responsible for the beheadings of four hostages including David Haines and Alan Henning. It comes as RAF Tornado fighter-bombers have been taking part in US-led bombing raids ISIS, for a fortnight. But there is strong resistance among politicians to any ground troop involvement in fighting against the Islamist group, which controls a vast swathe of Iraq and neighbouring Syria. The news of British troops being sent back to Iraq comes after other western countries including the United States also began training Kurdish peshmerga forces. It is thought that ISIS militants have overru around a thrid of the country. More than 100 instructors from Germany, Canada, Australia and United States are now on the ground in Iraqi Kurdistan, teaching the region's peshmerga forces how to use the new weapons. It has been reported that the United States, France, Italy, Germany, Canada, Australia and Czech Republic have also sent weapons to Kurds.","MoD confirms a 'small, specialist team' will be based near Kurdish capital Irbil .

"These are the stomach-churning images of a fearless daredevil who risks his life scaling Asia's tallest buildings without safety equipment.

The 20-year-old, who calls his hobby 'rooftopping', said that he actually finds climbing quite difficult, and strongly recommends others do not to pick up the pastime due to the risks involved. Unsurprisingly given the difficult climbs he has embarked on - including looking down on the 101-floor Shanghai World Finance Center - Mr Kuznetsov said he has never been scared of heights. Instead he simply trusts in his own ability and tendency not to panic, which helps him stay calm while scaling buildings in all weather conditions - even ice covered scaffolding in the dead of winter.

"The heatwave sweeping through Donetsk threatens to affect England's Euro 2012 opener against France tomorrow, but that hasn't dampened England fans' moods. Supporters revelled in the sunshine and enjoyed beers with the locals in the Ukrainian city despite fears that the footballers will be unable to adjust to the soaring temperatures. England will open their campaign in temperatures of up to 32C tomorrow, 13C higher than those they have acclimatised to in their Polish base of Krakow, while France have been training just down the road at local club Shakhtar Donetsk's centre. England fans Stan Stansfield and Dex Marshall enjoy a beer with locals in Donetsk, Ukraine, this afternoon . Fans set up flags around Donetsk and enjoyed the heatwave which threatens to affect tomorrow's opener against France . And it would seem that English football chiefs have little confidence in England's ability to achieve a result tomorrow, having already booked the England team's plane home - for after their final group stage game. England are due to face tournament co-hosts Ukraine in their last group game of the tournament on June 19, but FA bosses have already chartered a private jet home the day after. The plane is scheduled to fly from England's base in Krakow, Poland, and land at Manchester airport at 4pm on Wednesday 20 June before flying to London. The FA was unavailable for comment, but is believed to insist the measure is standard procedure. England are preparing for their opening game tomorrow, but FA bosses have already booked the plane home . The scheduling appears to display little confidence in the national team's ability to qualify from a group comprising France, Sweden and Ukraine. After France, they are due to face Sweden on Friday and Ukraine the following Tuesday before a potential quarter final on the weekend of June 23-24. Liverpool fan Jonny Bunt, 24, from Swindon, said: '[The heat] could make a difference. You would think the French would be more used to it and able to deal with it better.' Reflecting the national pessimism, the number of travelling England fans will be the lowest at a tournament for many years, with just 3,000 tickets sold through the official supporters' club for the France game. But those who did turn up enjoyed sizzling temperatures and friendly conversation with the locals. Two England fans in particular garnered attention, due to their full Crusaders costume including boots, silver trousers, the St George's Cross and leather arm guards. Dex Marshall, 52, and Stan Stanfield, 42, posed for pictures with amused Ukrainians near a giant statue of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin. Mr Marshall, a financial adviser from Uckfield, East Sussex, said: 'We went to a nightclub and the people were loving it. 'The only problem is the language. They all want to help us but we can't communicate.' When asked if the weather could be a factor, he replied: 'It will be a concern because we do have a colder environment than most countries. 'I think it will be a 1-1 draw if we're lucky.' Earlier this week Government officials chose to boycott England's group stage matches over Ukraine's treatment of jailed former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, although this stance may change if England do make it past the group stages. Preparation: England in training on Friday ahead of their opening fixture against France tomorrow evening . France, pictured training in Donetsk yesterday, have acclimatised to the sweltering temperatures . Manager Roy Hodgson remained defiant ahead of the kick-off, and insisted the team have 'no fear' of their opponents. 'There’s healthy respect for the France team, as they deserve to have. But I don’t get the feeling the players are cowed by the task. They’re more motivated in a way,' Hodgson said yesterday. The last time England failed to get through the group stage of a major tournament was at Euro 2000, when they were managed by Kevin Keegan. Belief: England manager Roy Hodgson, left, is confident of success. The FA, led by chairman David Bernstein, right, who is accompanying the team in Poland, has booked a flight home for after the group stage . France go into tomorrow's match as favourites and on a 21-game unbeaten run but Hodgson said this will provide additional motivation for England. 'It may be quite nice for them to go into a game where people are saying, ""It’ll be tough and France are a better team than you"". 'I would think they’ll probably quite enjoy the fact that the favourite’s position is now being taken from us and given to France. We know we can give them a good game. No question,' he said. But French supporters in Donetsk were confident their side would take all three points. Sebastian Peyres, 36, who works at the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, said: 'It will be very difficult for England to organise their team without Rooney and Lampard. It will be 2-0 to France, I hope.' Hodgson is due to reveal his starting lineup to the players tonight - in stark contrast to former manager Fabio Capello, who notoriously told his players if they were starting just half an hour before the match. The squad has been strengthened by the return of striker Jermain Defoe, who flew home on Thursday following the death of his father, but Manchester United forward Danny Welbeck is expected to be preferred to Defoe and Andy Carroll. Steven Gerrard leads his players in training on Friday. The players will find out who will start tomorrow's game today .

"Miriam Clegg today revealed the secret to being a politician's wife is a thick skin, plenty of coffee and not getting cross when the media attacks her husband Nick. In a new Lib Dem attempt to woo daytime TV viewers, the Cleggs appeared on ITV's Lorraine, chatting on the sofa and cooking jacket potatoes with ragu. Mrs Clegg admitted her husband is not a great cook, but she would like George Clooney to play him in a film of his life. Scroll down for video . As her husband Nick tried his hand at making jacket potato with ragu, Mrs Clegg revealed he was not a great cook . Miriam Clegg appeared on the daytime TV sofa to talk about life as a politcian's wife and juggling family life with her work as a top lawyer . Mr Clegg will hope that his efforts at grating cheese on live TV will impress voters more than his wife . TV chef James Tanner showed Mr Clegg how to make his own ragu from scratch ahead of Bonfire Night tonight . With the Lib Dems struggling on just 7 per cent in the polls, Mr Clegg took time out from being Deputy Prime Minister to show off his culinary skills to Lorraine Kelly and chef James Tanner. In the past Mrs Clegg has sought to focus on her career as an international lawyer, refusing to become involved in the day-to-day machinations of Westminster life. As the couple chatted in the show's kitchen, Kelly remarked that she did not seem like a 'typical' politician's wife. Mrs Clegg replied: 'I don't know what is a typical politician's wife really. I try to help as much as I can but I try not to change completely my life and certainly not our children's lives for it and you have to do whatever you feel comfortable with. 'For me, the limit, the red line is a political role. I feel very strongly that politics or partly politics at least is for those who are elected. 'I am not elected so that is the red line but everything else that I can do, it's a privilege obviously to be in that position and if you can use it for something positive then that is great.' The decision to appear with Lorraine Kelly on daytime TV will be seen as a sign that Mrs Clegg could broaden the appeal of the Lib Dems . After making her appearance on the show, Mrs Clegg was later seen leaving the ITV Studios on London's South Bank . However her decision to appear with her husband on daytime TV will be seen as a sign that she could broaden the appeal of the party. Surprisingly she appeared unaffected by media attacks on her husband. 'I have been through this now for a while, I know how not to take things personally and I know why there is a certain sector that do that for other reasons. 'I don't get cross when he is criticised and I don't get cross when I am criticised. There is a sector of the media that like criticism.' However, she was careful not to totally rule out going into politics herself one day: 'I think that you need to have a lot of emotional strength now to be in politics and I don't know whether I have it.'

'There are lots of mums who don't work outside the home and they work very hard,' she said . 'I do it with help at home and also help from my family, my mother, Nick's mum. 'I have help at work, I have a fantastic team… really, really supportive there and then with lots of coffee. If coffee is bad for health, I'm done.' Despite the support from family, Mr Clegg's own efforts in the kitchen got mixed reviews. 'Out of all of his strengths, I wouldn't put cooking at the top,' she said. But asked who would play her husband in a film, she set her sights high: 'Is George Clooney on offer?'

"Toddlers pushed around town in buggies are 'vulnerable' to car pollution, a Cabinet minister warned today. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said parents had raised fears with him that the pollution from busy roads was damaging their children's health. He said the level of harmful diesel soot pumped out of exhaust pipes near children was dangerous. Thick smog hit London last month - leading the Energy Secretary Ed Davey to accuse Boris Johnson of failing to tackle the problem . In an interview with The Evening Standard, the top Lib Dem called singled out London Mayor Boris Johnson for particular criticism. He urged the Tory Mayor to step up the battle against dirty air with a quicker switch to electric vehicles. Mr Davey called on the Mayor put 'smog alerts' on bus stops to alert families to the danger of venturing out. The Lib Dem accused Mr Johnson of 'flim-flamming about' on improving air quality. Mr Davey stressed children were particularly at risk from traffic pollution. He said: 'If you had electric vehicles, they would not be exposed. If you had low emission vehicles, they would not be exposed. 'But at the moment they are vulnerable if they are being pushed down congested high streets. In a buggy they are at near exhaust pipe level. 'It’s vital for the health of our children that we take this issue far more seriously.' Energy Secretary Ed Davey said car fumes were a danger to toddlers being pushed around in buggies . He accused the Mayor of 'not delivering' on a pledge to put London at the forefront of the electric car revolution. 'London needs to go electric and we need to start with the buses,' he added. 'Boris’ record on electric buses is hopeless.' But Mr Johnson’s allies blamed the Government - and even Mr Davey himself - for ignoring the Mayor's pleas for help. One ally said: 'This is the same Climate Change Secretary who has repeatedly ignored Boris’ entreaties to help us improve air quality.' The Mayor’s senior environmental adviser Matthew Pencharz insisted Mr Johnson was delivering the most ambitious set of measures in the world to tackle air pollution, including an ultra low emission zone. He said: 'He is pulling every lever that he can – it’s not unreasonable to ask the Government to do its bit too. 'Since being elected, he has driven down emissions across London, leading to a halving of the number of people living in areas with poor air quality.' But Mr Davey accused Mr Johnson of being 'lackadaisical'. He said: 'If there is a smog problem in London, he should be looking every single way possible to get that message over to people. 'If they have got asthma, they can take mitigating effects. If they want to help out, they can change their transport plans – so maybe they would say ""alright I’ll work at home"".'","Ed Davey says children are being put at risk by smog from cars .

"She's the celebrity lifestyle guru known to her fans as the 'Skinny Rich Coach' and caused outrage when her book, How To Be Selfish (And Other Uncomfortable Advice), championed the merits of putting yourself first - regardless of what others think. Now Olga Levancuka is back and this time she's turned her attention to parents, whom, she says, need to learn to say no to their children. But is she right? Her views might enrage you but here she explains why being a 'selfish parent' can be good for your children. Take control: Celebrity lifestyle guru Olga Levancuka says parents need to be much more selfish . 'It’s a well-known fact, the more attention, care and love we give to our children, the better parents we are and, in turn, the better human beings our children will grow up to be. But it just isn’t true. The more you give in, the less respect you’ll receive from your children and the more things and stuff they’ll expect to get away with. With all the pressure building up, the moments when you’d give anything to get out of the house become more and more frequent. By the time the children hit puberty, you are like a set of guitar strings at a rock concert - with your nervous system, aka the guitar, stretched to breaking point. So how do you deal with the pain of parenting, protect your children from your own tantrums and attempt to inject a little peace and mutual respect into your nest? Me time: Parents should schedule in time for themselves and not chase their children around constantly . Discovery: According to Olga, letting children do their own thing while you do yours is a good idea . Perhaps it’s time you learned how to be selfish to protect your sanity, your health and to ensure your long lasting support and presence in your child's life. And who would be best to learn from how to be selfish? From your very own progeny of course! They know how to be selfish best. Kids are excellent psychologists and are great at getting other people to do their tasks for them. Do the same. Get your kids to do stuff for you. You are not their servant, nor the doormat. The earlier you stop behaving like one, the earlier they’ll grow to respect you. It's even better if you can find some tasks to do together, although don't forget to throw in some fun and enjoyable activities too. But it's not just about your child. Just as they are your responsibility, so is your body so make some time to take care of it. Create a close network of parents-friends, and agree on a day when they look after your kids so that you get some ‘you’-time. Return the favour to keep the benefits coming. Then there's dealing with the inevitable tantrums and endless arguments about Junior's desire to do something other than homework or chores. The longer you take to explain yourself, the shorter time you have left for doing your chores and that much needed and important ‘you’ time. Say what you need to say (two sentences max) and get on with your and your child’s life. Your children will hear what you said (even adults only remember the first and the last statements) and you will be heard. Which at times is so important to overworked mothers. Kids learn from you too. Make sure you are an ever-lasting source of knowledge and inspiration, so sign up for adult courses. Be adventurous, choose things that are exciting and different to your daily routine. For example: sculpture making, life drawing classes, language courses, singing lessons. With other adults. But although you aren't the only one who benefits from learning, that doesn't mean you need to over-praise your children when they deign to pick up a pen. Big plans: Olga is known as the 'Skinny Rich Coach' to her fans and says she can help you achieve both . Best seller: Olga's book How To Be Selfish champions the concept of putting yourself first . There is a constant battle between teachers and kids that is directed at getting the results. The results that school first of all seek. The priority is clearly on success and some kids are getting all worked up trying to please adults without even understanding why something is good and why something is bad. Think for yourself. If a child, after a long struggle, finally solves her math tasks, does she really need to be told that she has done well? Doesn’t she know, without being told, that she has accomplished something? Don’t waste your time over-praising. Don’t call your kid ‘good girl’. Let children get on with their own discoveries, while you get on with your life. Don’t we have enough ‘failures’ from trying to please our parents? To make what you want crystal clear, say it once and then get on and do it. Believe me, it’s easier when kids know where they stand with you. If you say that you want to see the movie, but then go to the kitchen, and start cleaning the mess, you send mixed signals to your children. They don’t think that you have to clean . the kitchen. They think the words you say are worth ignoring. Next time . you say 'I want to go to a movie' and you still need to clean up, say 'I . want to go to the movie, but first I need to clean up the kitchen . because the mess makes me upset'. No-no: Spending your days indulging your child's every whim could result in big problems for both of you . If the child offers you help, take it. Children want you happy! Then go to the movie. The children will know . your words ‘are worth listening to.' Finally, stop sacrificing your happiness for your child’s satisfaction. Such ‘Samaritan’ acts are a double-edged sword in disguise. Today the child is happy, tomorrow they ask for more. You want to see your child smiling, you now need to bend yourself more. Who wins? In the long run, it won't be you or the child. You will pay with your mental and physical health, the child later will pay another significant price. Kids know when they make you suffer. They regret it and they start blaming themselves. Slowly they resent themselves, and then … surprise, surprise, you, for letting them make you suffer. Instead, stop accepting the pressure from your children - or indeed, the other parents who feel the need to impose their methods on you. Choose your own way in parenting, and in your personal life. The child will follow your example eventually and you’ll be rewarded twice over. You’ll get to keep your life (well, most if it!); and your child will grow up with a better understanding of an individual space, needs and responsibilities.

"Say goodbye to your old, boring, regular oven. The age of the smart oven could soon be upon us. And the latest attempt at bringing internet connectivity to this mainstay of the kitchen is Maid (Make All Incredible Dishes). This smart oven can provide you with recipes on what to cook, speaks aloud the instructions and also provides accurate timings each step of the way. Scroll down for video . California company SectorQube has designed a smart oven for kitchens. Called Maid (Make All Incredible Dishes), pictured, it displays recipes and reads them. Users can select a recipe using a touch screen on the oven. It will then select the time and temperature needed for the food . Maid is currently on Kickstarter, where it reached its goal of £31,000 ($50,000) in just five days. It’s only a prototype for now but it already has a number of potential features. For starters, it uses a recipe store to provide a wide range of dishes for you to select. Microwave output (watts): 900 . Top-heater output: 1,200 . Convection heater: 1,750 . Volume: 1.2 cubic feet (0.03 cubic metres) Screen: 6-inch capacitive . Connectivity: Wi-Fi . Dimensions: 16.1 x 19.7 x 20.7 inches (409 x 501 x 526 mm) The oven has a touch screen on which selections and navigation can be done which is called Maid Assist. Users can also upload their own dishes and step-by-step guides. When a user selects a recipe, which can be searched for from a list, the oven reads aloud each step. The time and temperature required is also shown on the screen, and the oven can adapt the numbers depending on the number of servings needed. If all this automatic control isn’t for you, there’s also the option to do everything manually. As for the oven itself it is a convention, microwave and top-heater oven in one. There are also plans to release a Maid App that syncs with the oven, letting you talk to it and make gestures to use its various features. Maid will retail for about £280 ($449), and the company expects to start shipping in November 2015. Maid will cost £280 ($449) and will be released in November 2015. The oven has a touch screen on which selections and navigation can be done which is called Maid Assist.

"Republican candidates appear poised to ride a wave of Obama-fatigued discontent to victory on Nov. 4. New poll numbers show voters preferring unnamed GOP candidates by seven percentage points over their Democratic opponents. That lead, from a CBS News poll released Wednesday night, grows to eight points when undecided voters tell pollsters which way they're 'leaning.' Most stunning is the split on terrorism issues, with Republicans outpolling Democrats by 20 percentage points on the question of who handles it better. U.S. 'likely voters' also prefer Republicans by a 10 per cent margin on foreign affairs, seven points on the economy and 2 on immigration. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE POLL NUMBERS . FIRED UP: Cory Gardner, the Republican challenger in a Colorado US Senate race, has led Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in 6 of the last 7 published polls and holds an edge of nearly 4 percentage points on average . TOO MUCH BUBBA? Kentucky's Democratic Secretary of State, Alison Lundergan Grimes (left), has trailed Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell in 27 of the last 32 published polls, despite help from Bill Clinton . HOLDING ON: Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (right) leads in most polls against former Sen. Scott Brown (left), but the GQ-model-looking Republican is gaining . The numbers are doubly sobering for Democrats in the light of history: In 1994, a year when Republicans picked up 54 House seats and took over for the first time since 1952, Democrats held on to a 5-point advantage in ABC News polling right up to Election Day. The Republican tea party wave of 2010, a more recent point of comparison, came on the heels of a four-point GOP polling advantage. The new CBS poll indicates an even more dramatic sweep could come Tuesday. Other polls, from news organizations like CNN, The Washington Post, Fox News and the Associated Press, paint an overall picture that looks much the same. In the last seven published generic-ballot polls, Democratic congressional candidates haven't led by more than a single point. Republicans average three points ahead. Election dynamics are about more than a broad national mood, however. Statewide contests can come down to local differences in campaign tactics and volunteer strength, and even in technology. Democratic strategist Dan Gerstein told Fox News this week that 'negative energy toward the president' will contribute significantly to the result, but 'intense hand-to-hand combat' will also make a difference. 'It could be that one side has a really kickass mobilization field director, which could have nothing to do with the fierce ideological struggle between the parties in Washington,' Gerstein said. The GOP needs to gain just six seats in the U.S. Senate in order to control both chambers of Congress, effectively neutering the president during his final two years in the White House. In the fall of 2013, Democrats held 10- to 12-point advantages in most so-called 'generic' ballot polls. But that lead has evaporated after a year of stunning setbacks for Obama and his party. JANUARY RUNOFF? Democrat Michelle Nunn (right) and Republican David Perdue (left) will have to face a do-over three days AFTER the new Senate convenes, unless one of them can win 50 per cent of the vote on Nov. 4 . Republican congressional candidates hold a sizable lead over Democrats, according to a range of polls averaged by Real Clear Politics; their positions were reversed a year ago . The flubbed rollout of the Obamacare website set the pace for a dismal year that included a Contempt of Congress finding against Attorney General Eric Holder – the first such vote in U.S. history – and renewed questions about the administration's handling of the 2012 Benghazi terror attack. The rise of ISIS, the self-declared Islamist State of Iraq and al-Sham, has brought Americans a new round of Middle Eastern angst, as Obama steadfastly refuses to enter another desert war with ground troops. Republicans have harped on him for pulling U.S. forces out of Iraq at the end of 2011, which they claim left a power vacuum that gave the terror army room to grow. The U.S. economy lies stagnant, with shrinking GDP-growth numbers announced Thursday at the White House. China's economic engine is now projected to overtake America's, and the proportion of U.S. working-age adults who have jobs – the so-called 'labor participation rate' – is just 62.7 per cent. That's the lowest since 1978, when Jimmy Carter-era economics began pushing Americans to the point of embracing a Republican solution in the person of Ronald Reagan. Ebola isn't helping matters. A variety of polls show the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's performance inspiring levels of confidence among Americans that rank somewhere between middling and nonexistent. WILD CARD: Greg Orman, a political independent running against Kansas Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, says that if he wins he will caucus with whichever party wins the majority . RAZOR(BACK) THIN: Joni Ernst (right), the Republican former pig farmer running for Senate in Iowa, holds just a 2-point margin in her race against Democrat Bruce Braley . And fears about coming changes to America's immigration system – policy shifts that Obama has pledged to execute by fiat – are creating a sense of urgency among conservatives. They hold a sizable 'enthusiasm gap' over Democrats, with between 7 and 13 per cent more of them saying they are fired up about voting, according to a range of polls. That puts Republicans in a position to not just win legislative seats on Tuesday, but to steamroll the field – growing their majority in the House of Representatives, winning gubernatorial fights and holding as many as 53 or 54 Senate seats when the dust settles. The GOP holds 45 seats now, and at least three Democratic incumbents – in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia – seem headed for sure defeat. Another seven races are considered in play and ripe for the picking, and Republican candidates have gained momentum in six of them during the past two weeks, polls show. Democratic incumbents in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, New Hampshire and North Carolina look vulnerable to varying degrees. Offsetting those risks, however, Republicans could lose seats they hold in Kansas and Georgia. If  a 50-50 split should result, Democrats would retain the majority since Vice President Joe Biden – as 'president' of the Senate – could cast tiebreaking votes. Adding to the drama, Georgia and Louisiana both have runoff provisions in their laws, forcing a second election between the top two Senate candidates if no one wins 50 per cent of the vote on Nov. 4. A Louisiana runoff between Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy would come on December 6. A Georgia do-over, pitting Democrat Michelle Nunn against Republican David Perdue for a rare open seat, wouldn't happen until January 6. That's three days after the next Senate is sworn in. Republicans hope the drama has long subsided by then, making runoffs a matter of icing, not cake.","CBS News poll shows likely US voters prefer Republicans by 10 per cent on foreign affairs, seven points on the economy and 2 on IMMIGRATION .

"A country barman who spent millions of dollars worth of cash he withdrew from ATMs via a 'loophole' in the system has been arrested. Dan Saunders, from Wangaratta in north-eastern Victoria, lived the high life for about four and a half months in February 2011, spending wildly on expensive escorts, private jets, exclusive restaurants and gambling. Last week A Current Affair aired details of the lavish lifestyle he lead, and Saunders revealed to the program the method he used to obtain the money. Scroll down for video . ATM scammer Dan Saunders was arrested in Melbourne on Wednesday afternoon . The country barman spent millions of dollars worth of cash he withdrew from ATMs via a 'loophole' On Thursday he was arrested by officers in Melbourne and charged with 111 offences relating to fraud and theft, a spokeswoman for Victoria Police confirmed to Daily Mail Australia. Saunders is expected to face additional charges and will front court next Wednesday. More than three years ago 29-year old-stumbled across a technical fault in the National Australia Bank's  ATM system which meant he had access to free money whenever, or wherever he pleased. 'I've never felt more alive than when I was charging on my credit card,' Mr Saunders told Australia's Current Affair. 'With the NAB card I could be anyone I wanted to be, go anywhere I wanted to go, do anything as long as I had the card in my back pocket. I felt like a king.' In 2011 Saunders (pictured) went on a wild spending spree paying for private jets, hookers and  gambling . He discovered the 'loophole' in his bank's ATM system one night when he went to get some money out while drinking with friends . 'I felt like a rock star, probably looked like a fat, white Kanye West, but you felt like you were Kanye West,' he said. In an exclusive interview with ACA, he divulged how it all unfolded one night out for beers with mates and how he quickly went on a wild spending spree, with money that was not his. - He would transfer money from credit to his savings account while ATM system was 'offline' -The ATM would read 'transaction cancelled' - but still dished out the money . - He took advantage of a loophole in the system which meant the ATM couldn't record transactions during late-night maintenance - but still dispensed cash . - The withdrawal would not  register on his account - effectively giving him free cash . - He continued withdrawing and the bank didn't catch up . - He also tricked the ATM by transferring money from his 'credit' option to his Mastercard... even though he only had one credit card . Mr Saunders had just moved to Wangaratta in country Victoria and one evening in February, 2011 he was out drinking with friends. Like most people he needed to withdraw cash from the ATM, but when he tried, he realised he just had $3 in his savings account, so what he did was transfer $200 from his credit card. 'It said transaction cancelled but it worked,' he said. $200 richer, Mr Saunders happily went back to the pub to continue drinking with his friends. But it wasn't until later that night that the barman, who earned a mere $700 a week, decided to try his luck again. He tried to check his account balance at another ATM but it was just registering 'balance unavailable' so he again transferred $200 and it worked before he pushed his withdrawals out to $2000, the limit of his credit card and went home. Because ATM are known to go offline at certain times, where people can transfer funds but not get a balance for their account, the money he was withdrawing was not registering. Dan Saunders (pictured) went on a wild spending spree telling people he was a poker player, a surgeon or an investment banker . From the humble life as a barman in Wangaratta, in country Victoria, Dan Saunders (pictured right) reached millionaire status and lived life to max from a technical fault in his banks ATM system . He didn't stop  there and within a couple of weeks, Saunders had  transferred $20,000. With his new found riches, rumours started to make their way around the small town and when he began punting heavily with a mate while at work one night at the pub, his luck turned. 'Turns out that we turned over more than the TAB would turn over in three weeks in one night so that alerted the TAB to the fact that we'd done that,' he told ACA. 'I told them it was friend taking the bets but they didn't want to take that on board and they got the publican to fire me as a result.' To make matters worse, rumours made their way to his girlfriend, that he was spending money all over town and she then dumped him via text message. The barman who made a mere $700 a week couldn't believed his luck when he stumbled apon the technical fault in the banking system . Dan Saunders (pictured) conned NAB bank out of thousands, then evevtually reaching $1.6 million through an ATM flaw . But instead of wallowing in his losses, he decided to go back to Melbourne, get some advice from friends and kept his bank balance, rather healthy. 'On one hand you've lost your girlfriend, lost your job, but on the other hand, hey, you've got unlimited funds. Let's smash it up for a bit let's sort things out,' he said. While he believed it was a luxury that would be short lived, Mr Saunders kept withdrawing more and more money every day and there his lifestyle as a country barman dramatically transformed into that of a millionaire. He created many different alias' to new friends, including being a poker player, a surgeon and even an investment banker, living the dream of a high roller. He then discovered another way to trick the ATM and double his money, transferring money from the ATM's 'credit' account option to his Mastercard, even though he only had one credit card. In May that year, Saunders was believed to have already stolen $1.6 million of the banks money on his credit card. But like anyone who is cheating the system, Saunders soon started felling guilty about his adventures and began to see a psychologist. After four and a half months of solid spending Dan Saunders (pictured) said guilt got the better of him and he rang the bank, but they said police were investigating and they wouldn't talk to him . Finally after three and a half years of not being caught for his wild spendings have police issued a warrant for his arrest . It was in June, four and a half months after making his costly discovery, that he stopped making continuous transfers. He told ACA he then called the bank, who told him it was under police investigation and they wouldn't talk to him. 'It was never about the actual money it was just about the journey.' Three and a half years later and Mr Saunders had still got off scot free for his dealing with ATM's, still blazay about funding his lavish lifestyle with money that wasn't his own. 'I've overdrawn my own accounts if that makes me a crook that makes me a crook,' he said. It wasn't until just last week that police issued a warrant for his arrest and continue to look for Mr Saunders, who is now suddenly missing in action.

"Tireless ‘name and shame’ campaigner Derryn Hinch has praised the Northern Territory as it becomes the first jurisdiction in Australia to introduce a public sex offender register, to be named after murdered Queensland teenager Daniel Morcombe. Daniel was murdered in 2003, at the age of 13, by a man with a long history of abusing children. Hinch has urged other states that they must now follow in introducing a website that would include an image, physical description and regional whereabouts of convicted ‘serious sex offenders’. 'This is a crack in the wall. I thought it would be Queensland that became the first state to crumble. But now one has the others will fall in line too. It won’t happen overnight but it will happen,' Mr Hinch told Daily Mail Australia.’ The move comes after a decade of Daniel's parent's, Bruce and Denise, calling for a national sex offender register, a proposal recently rejected by other states and territories at a Council of Australian Governments meeting. 'Every parent has the right to know if there is a dangerous sex offender living in their neighbourhood,' they said in a statement. Scroll down for video . A public sex offender register named after murdered teenager Daniel Morcombe will be introduced in the NT . 'We truly hope that the introduction of Daniel's Law will prevent another family going through the pain and grief we experienced following Daniel's death.' Mr Hinch added: ‘I can’t stress how important it is that it’s going to happen… You can’t listen to the rubbish saying it will drive them underground - they are already underground. Their biggest weapon is secrecy.' The veteran journalist, who was informed of the NT legislation by  Bruce Morcombe, said it is important for the website to be nationalised or sex offenders will simply move and cross state borders. ‘If you are a predator in the Northern Territory and a photo description of you is online, why wouldn’t you move elsewhere in Australia?’ he asked. Tireless ‘name and shame’ campaigner Derryn Hinch has praised the new legislation . Mr Hinch, who has served time in jail and five weeks under house arrest as a consequence of his belief that the public have ‘a right to know’ who sex offenders are, said that Australia is home to over 100,000 predators. In NSW there are 7,000 convicted sex offenders, for example, but he claims 'even police officers don’t have an automatic right to know who or where they are'. This year Mr Hinch completed a ten-day, 180-kilometre, walk from Langi Kal Kal Prison, where he had been serving 50 days in lieu of a $100,000 fine for contempt of court, to Victoria’s Parliament House. Upon reaching Parliament House, flanked by Daniel Morcombe’s parents, he presented a petition with nearly 130,000 names calling for a national public register of convicted paedophiles. Bruce Morcombe phoned him on Wednesday to share the NT news. Daniel's parents, Denise and Bruce Morcombe, were in Darwin for the announcement after campaigning for years for a national sex offenders register . Adam Giles, Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, announced that the NT Sex Offender Public Website legislation will be named Daniel's Law . 'He said hey “it’s going to happen in the NT” he knows how passionate I am.' It is finally a sign of progress for the ardent campaigner, who spent two weeks in solitary confinement in a locked prison cell just metres away from convicted sex offenders – the people he is fighting against - while in jail this year. Mr Hinch explained that there has been resistance to introduce a public sex offenders register in Australia because of fears of vigilante action. However, after visiting the United States, where they have had a public register named Megan’s Law since 1996, Mr Hinch is convinced it would work in Australia. ‘In Texas they have more guns than Tim Tams but the register works there,’ Mr Hinch said. Daniel was last seen waiting at a bus stop on the Sunshine Coast when he was abducted and later murdered by serial child sex offender Brett Peter Cowan. It was another eight years before his remains were found . Bruce and Denise Morcombe, seen here leaving the Supreme Court in Brisbane on March 13, 2014, when a jury found Brett Peter Cowan, 44, guilty of the abduction and murder of their son . ‘When I was in Florida the sheriff showed me street signs saying “warning predator lives here""… I got an app on my phone in Time Square [in New York] that showed me there were 25 predators in the area – it showed me their name, photos and address. ‘I drove around Texas with Sarah Monahan, Robert Hughes’ victim, the app showed us paedophiles' houses. It means people can warn their children “don’t knock on that door”… that’s the common sense attitude,’ Mr Hinch reasoned. In his eyes  ‘knowledge is power’. Mr Hinch said he is still waiting to find out the details of Daniel’s Law, for example “what constitutes a serious sex offender”, but hopes that within three years there is a national register. 'The federal government has the power to overturn the legislation but I don’t think they would be stupid enough to do this,' Mr Hinch added. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has indicated he's not in favour of a national sex offenders register . Federal coalition MP George Christensen has also urged the Abbott government to roll out the register nationally, saying sex offenders gave up their right to privacy by committing the 'most heinous of crimes'. 'Parents have a right to know where these serious sex offenders are and what they look like so they can protect their children,' the Liberal National MP said. 'We owe it to the Morcombes and to all parents to do whatever we can to avoid the same thing happening again.' However, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has indicated he's not in favour of a national sex offenders register, saying such lists don't exist for murderers, thieves or white collar criminals. Mr Abbott says he's 'disinclined' to single out particular crimes for public registers. 'We don't have a national murders register. We don't have a national thieves register. We don't have a national white collar criminals register,' he told reporters in Melbourne. 'The important thing is ... to have strong and effective law enforcement agencies, to have strong and effective laws.'","The NT will introduce a public sex offender register website .

"Astrophysicist Alex Chambers was destined for a life of science before an offer to good to refuse changed the 24-year-old's career path. The self-described 'nerd' and Australia's first female MMA fighter completed a degree in astrophysics after studying Maths and Physics - but will leave all that behind as she embarks on her dream of joining the Ultimate Fighting Championship in America. The lightweight Sydney fighter, who has spent 16 years honing her mixed martial arts technique, will star in the first all-female season of The Ultimate Fighter when it debuts on September 10 on Australian television. Scroll down for videos . MMA fighter and former astrophysicist Alex Chambers will compete in the UFC when it airs in September . The small, but powerful MMA fighter will be one of 16 competitors taking part in the UFC reality competition . The once-aspiring astrophysicist who now says MMA comes first and wants to become a full-time competitor . Sixteen female competitors will compete for the inaugural straw weight title. Chambers, 24, had conquered Australia's amateur ranks, before she signed an American contract which was eventually bought out by UFC. She told Vice in an interview about her rise through the martial arts grades back home and her quest to join the sport as a professional fighter. Describing herself as 'Australia's best female fighter' she took a gamble and flew to Japan after becoming 'desperate' to find a fight after conquering the MMA scene back in Australia. 'My coach Liam and I decided that I should look to fight in Japan where the WMMA scene is much stronger,' she said. 'I’ve been doing martial arts since I was eight...it’s what I dream about awake or asleep...all the training in the world isn't worth a damn if you don't get to step inside a ring or a cage and throw down once in a while.' Technique generates power, according to Chambers who relies on her 'smarts' to beat her opponents . The MMA fighter regards herself as Australia's best . The UFC reality television show will air on Fuel TV in Australia from September 10 . Classified as a 'straw weight' competitor at just 52 kilograms, Chambers had to earn her keep the hard way and pay for the flights herself because she 'didn’t have a name yet.' 'So we had a fundraiser at my gym, VT1, and we flew over to fight.' Forced to fight up two grades because of her size, she said she was unable to cope with the demand of the step-up in class and was subsequently beaten easily by her Japanese opponent. After her defeat she took time away from the sport - until she signed an American contract that launched her UFC career in July. At just 52 kilograms Alex Chambers is regarded as a 'straw weight' in the sport of MMA . The once-aspiring astrophysicist who now says MMA comes first, told Channel Nine's Today Show host Cameron Williams on Saturday that before MMA she 'had always been a bit of a nerd.' 'Science has been something that I love so I studied  physics, maths at university and astrophysics was one of those subjects I really enjoyed.' Adding that while she has a career to fall back on, that side of her life has taken a backseat while she pursues the Ultimate Fighting Championship. 'MMA is the fastest growing sport in the world so it's definitely my career at the moment.' Quashing speculation that the sport of MMA is a 'dangerous' one, she said fighters are well drilled in 'technique training' that generates the power and strength to compete. 'We train smart, it's not all about getting hit,' she said. 'We spend a lot of time practicing techniques and technique is what generates the power.' The first all-female season of The Ultimate Fighter debuts September 10, where 16 female competitors will compete for the inaugural straw weight title. The show, which features UFC lightweight champion Anthony Pettis and upcoming title challenger Gilbert Melendez as head coaches, features a tournament format as the long-running reality show crowns its first champion.","Alex Chambers left a certain career in Astrophysics for Mixed Martial Arts .

"Mr Carswell claimed he had been in touch with a Labour MP about the possibility of defecting . The Tories should expect further defections because the party is out of date ‘like HMV’ – according to Ukip’s first elected MP. Douglas Carswell, who quit the Conservatives to claim a stunning by-election success in Clacton last week, likened his old party to a ‘defunct retail model’ and said it needed to be modern ‘like Spotify’. As research showed four Tory MPs would do better next May if they jumped ship, one Conservative backbencher said he would ‘never say never’ to the prospect of joining Nigel Farage’s party. Mr Carswell said it was not just the Tories that were tempted to join Ukip, claiming he had been in touch with an unnamed Labour MP about the possibility of defecting. Meanwhile, Mr Farage has said that if Ukip held the balance of power in May, it would demand a referendum on the EU by August from both the Tories and Labour. He told the BBC’s Sunday Politics that he would demand ‘a full, free and fair referendum on our continued membership of the European Union’. Insiders from Ukip said Mr Carswell’s success in Clacton – and the fact it came so close in the Labour stronghold of Heywood and Middleton – meant that it would be targeting 25 seats in next May’s election. Previously just 12 seats had been targeted. A poll yesterday showed that Ukip was on 25 per cent of the vote – a level of support which would be enough to take 128 seats in the Commons, according to one analysis. The Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday put Labour and the Tories both on 31 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats on 8 per cent. And it found that 41 per cent believe the Tories should agree a pact with Ukip. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said: ‘Today’s poll suggests Ukip’s support has increased much more in the south of England outside London than it has elsewhere in the UK – by a staggering 34 points. ‘If that level was recorded throughout the South, Ukip could win as many as 128 seats, with no less than 102 of them coming from the Conservatives, whose vote in the region is down 14 points.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage (centre) and newly elected Ukip MP Douglas Carswell (right). A poll yesterday showed that Ukip was on 25 per cent of the vote - which would be enough to take 128 seats, according to one analysis . The Financial Times reported that four Tory MPs would be more likely to retain their seats if they defected to Ukip. Matthew Goodwin, a professor at Nottingham University, said jumping ship could help Nigel Mills in Amber Valley, Martin Vickers in Cleethorpes and David Nuttall in Bury North. Chris Kelly in Dudley South would also benefit, but he has said he is stepping down. All four have said they will not join Ukip. But one senior backbencher told the Mail on Sunday that the situation could change if the Tories lose the Rochester and Strood by-election next month. ‘If they [Ukip] take Rochester and Strood, a number of people will conclude they have a better chance of being re-elected as Ukip,’ he said. One of Ukip’s targets is likely to be John Baron, Tory MP for Basildon and Billericay, who replied ‘You should never say never in politics’ when he was asked on the BBC’s Newsnight whether he would defect. However he added: ‘My very strong preference is to stay within the Conservative Party.’ Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Carswell said the Tories needed to modernise. ‘The way the Tory party is retailing politics is like the way HMV retailed music: it’s a defunct retail model,’ he said. ‘I argued that we needed to Spotify politics, we ought to make the Conservative Party a bit more like Spotify, but the Conservative Party can’t change and won’t change.’ Mr Carswell also revealed that one Labour MP is considering switching. But the party’s Michael Dugher dismissed the claim as ‘typical bull****’.","New Ukip MP Douglas Carswell predicts more defections .

"Holidaymakers travelling to Cyprus faced 'nightmare' flight delays after they were stuck for 18 hours leaving the UK and then another 17 hours coming home. A Thomas Cook Airlines flight from Larnaca, was due to land at Cardiff airport at 12.30am on Monday, but didn't arrive until 5.45pm, after experiencing a technical fault. But customers who had spent a week in Cyprus had already lost a night of their break after a bird strike led to their 1.35pm flight from Wales on September 21 delayed until 7am the following day, according to the South Wales Aviation Group site. Finally home: Passengers pictured arriving at Cardiff airport, after facing frustrating double delays . Flight TCX7207 finally arrives at Cardiff Airport. The Thomas Cook Airlines flight from Larnaca, was due to land in South Wales at 12.30am on Monday, but didn't arrive until 5.45pm, after experiencing a technical fault . Some travellers said the delay had also meant the loss of a day's work. Mark Archer, 24, from Bridgend, and his partner Sarah Keast, were hit by both delays. Mr Archer said: 'We're going to Thomas Cook to complain. To have two overnight delays on a week's holiday is ridiculous. 'At least, we want a full refund for the flights and a bit of compensation for the day's earnings lost and our transfers.' Unhappy customers: Marilyn and Mark Evans, left, and Mark Archer and Sarah Keast, were hit by delays . Charmaine Lloyd, 53, and Leanne Lloyd, 42, were put up in a Premier Inn near Barry last week.

He added that the flight that was cancelled the week before was 'affected by a double bird strike on its way into Cardiff to take our customers on holiday and therefore required an inspection of the engines.' 'We know how frustrating these delays are, and we'd like to thank our customers for their patience and understanding,' he said.","Outbound Thomas Cook Airlines flight was delayed due to a bird strike .

"A schoolgirl will be able to wear earrings for the first time like her friends after doctors rebuilt her left ear from her ribs. Chloe Duffin was born with rare condition Goldenhar Syndrome, which left her with one fully formed right ear, half a jaw and four of the usual seven neck vertebrae. Now a seven-hour operation has helped the nine-year-old take a step closer to achieving her ambition of wearing earrings like her friends. Chloe was born without a left ear (pictured left). She has now had one rebuilt from her rib (right) and just needs one more operation to separate the back of the new ear from her head . In 2004 Chloe had already undergone more than 40 operations and had been told she would have to wait for life-changing facial surgery. Now she has had the first of two operations to replace her ear and give her a new jawbone. Doctors have promised they will pierce her ears after the second operation as a reward for her bravery. Mother Lynne, 35, from Glasgow, said: 'The best day of our life was after the operation when the doctors showed us her two ears at the same level on her face. 'Dealing with Chloe’s illness can be very trying, but we are so lucky to have a lot of support from our brilliant families - we could not do it without them. 'But the results of this operation are better than we were expecting and it is going to be fantastic to see Chloe at the end of her treatment.' Chloe was born 12 weeks premature in the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital and weighed just 3lbs.Her left ear and jaw were only partially formed and her airway was blocked. She was also deaf in her left ear. Chloe was given the diagnosis of Goldenhar Syndrome, which is believed to affect just 200 people in the UK. Chloe awaiting surgery (left) and after the operation (right). They had to wait until she was big enough to rebuild her face . Chloe shows off her brand new ear with her father Brian, 50, and mother Lynne, 39 . Doctors promised when Chloe was four to try to rebuild her face using tissue from her ribs.But she was too small for the operation and had to wait until her ribcage was at least 2ft (60cm). Two weeks ago Chloe was taken into the Royal Hospital For Sick Children where surgeons took cartilage from her rib and carved it into the shape of an ear. During the operation they took skin from her partially formed left ear lobe and used it to her create a formed left ear before painstakingly grafting it flat to Chloe’s head. Because the two sides of her face are unaligned, they also had to create a new ear canal up to the new position of the left ear. Her old ear was then planted in her abdomen to be saved for any future operations. In six months she will return for a second operation to separate the back of the ear from her head so it is the same as a normal ear. One of her ribs will be removed and used to make a new jaw bone to even out the left side of her face. Chloe Duffin was born with half a jaw and a partially formed left ear (left). She had to wait until she was nine to have her new ear created. She is pictured right, aged 5 . Chloe Duffin with her and pet dog Muffin. She will soon be able to wear earrings . Doctors will also take the scar from her rib operation and place it behind her ear so she will have no visible scarring on her abdomen. If the operation goes to plan Chloe will also get her ears pierced - and finally be able to wear the two pairs of earrings she has been saving for the special occasion. Lynne said: 'It’s amazing what they can do for Chloe. It is going to be wonderful to see her when all the operations are completed. 'We travel between Yorkhill, the Southern General, Glasgow Dental Hospital and Edinburgh Sick Children’s Hospital for all Chloe’s treatments, but it will be worth it.' Lynne and taxi driver Brian, 50, have also joined a support group for families of people with Goldenhar Syndrome. When the pair joined the charity four years ago it had just £850 in funds - but taxi driver Brian and Lynee they have since raised £30,000. Lynne said: 'Without this support group we would never have seen anybody else with this syndrome. 'For new people it can be great to meet up and see that there is light at the end of the tunnel. That is just how we feel with Chloe.'For more information, visit the Goldenhar Support Group’s website at www.goldenhar.org/uk .","Doctors have promised they will pierce Chloe's ears after a second operation on her ear in six months time .

"Amanda Todd,15, was found dead on last October after she killed herself to escape cyber bullies . An arrest has been made in the Netherlands in the case of a Canadian teenager who was blackmailed to expose herself in front of a webcam, Canadian police confirmed on Thursday. The 15-year-old girl, Amanda Todd, later committed suicide after detailing her harassment on a YouTube video watched by millions around the world. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Insp. Paulette Freill said a suspect has been arrested in the Netherlands and charged with extortion, luring and criminal harassment and possession of child pornography for the purpose of distribution. Police did not release the name of the 35-year-old man and declined to release specifics of the case but said there were other victims in Canada and internationally. Dutch prosecutors said the man is suspected of blackmailing girls in the U.S., Britain and the Netherlands. Canadian police said they would seek extradition. Amanda Todd brought the problem of cyber bullying to mainstream attention in Canada after she posted a video on YouTube in which she told her story with handwritten signs, describing how she was lured by a stranger to expose her breasts on a webcam. The picture ended up on a Facebook page made by the stranger, to which her friends were added. Haunting: Amanda posted a nine-minute video explaining her longstanding bullying on a series of notecards . Depressing: The story reveals that she previously tried to kill herself twice and is receiving help . She was repeatedly bullied, despite changing schools, before finally killing herself weeks after posting the video. It has now been viewed more than 17 million times. ‘This is truly a day we have been waiting for,’ said Carol Todd, Amanda's mother. She wiped away tears as she thanked police. Dutch prosecutors said they filed indecent assault and child pornography charges against the man. Lawyer Christian van Dijk earlier confirmed that one of the charges against his client involved a 15-year-old girl from British Columbia. Todd was repeatedly bullied, despite changing schools, before finally killing herself weeks after posting the video . The suspect, who has dual Dutch and Turkish nationality, has been in detention since he was arrested in January in a vacation house the town of Oisterwijk. He lived alone, and has no wife or children. Prosecutors first publicized his case after a preliminary hearing on Wednesday at which his detention was extended for three months. ‘The suspicions against the man are that he approached underage girls via the Internet and then seduced them into performing sexual acts in front of a webcam,’ prosecutors said in a statement. ‘He is suspected of subsequently pressurizing them to participate in making new material.’ Suicide: Todd was found hanged in her home on October 10 - just one month before her 16th birthday . They noted the suspect is also thought to have blackmailed adult men in a somewhat similar way, by convincing them that he was an underage boy, convincing them to perform sexual acts on camera, and then threatening to turn the images over to the police. Lawyer Van Dijk said he doesn't believe prosecutors have sufficient evidence to convict his client, and said that even if there is evidence of unlawful activity on his computer, it may have been hacked. ‘Prosecutors seem to think they have a big fish here, but if I see the evidence, it's not much,’ he said. ‘Lots of references to IP addresses and such.’ Dutch prosecutors said they were cooperating with other national authorities, including the British.Van Dijk said U.S. and Norwegian authorities are also involved in the case. He said no country has sought to have his client extradited, and so far he hasn't entered any plea.‘He's exercising his right to remain silent.’","Police have confirmed that a Dutch/Turkish national has been arrested in the case of a Canadian teenage who was blackmailed to expose herself .

"Apple’s Classic iPod (pictured) was silently removed from the tech firm's online store in September due to a lack of parts, said boss Tim Cook . Amidst the furore of the iPhone 6 launch in September, Apple silently killed off its Classic iPod. But it wasn't a drop in sales that brought about its demise, according to boss Tim Cook, instead it was blamed on a lack of mechanical parts. Speaking at the WSJD Live conference, Mr Cook said the tech giant no longer had access to the components needs to make the once iconic music player. And although sales for the product had fallen significantly in recent years, sourcing parts was the final nail in the coffin. Mr Cook added the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts, but it wouldn't have been cost-effective and would have involved a 'massive' task. 'We couldn't get the parts anymore, not anywhere on Earth,' explained Mr Cook. 'It wasn't a matter of me swinging the axe, saying ""What can I kill today?"" The Classic was the Apple’s first digital music player, and although the original debuted in 2001, there were six generations released up until 2007. When Apple’s online store came back online following its iPhone 6 event in September, this later model was missing from the iPod lineup. Apple did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line at the time. According to an earnings report earlier this year, Apple's iPod Classic sales in the final quarter of 2013 dropped 52 per cent year-on-year. Apple also lost 55 per cent in revenue on all models of the music player, compared to the previous year, and the iPod makes up less than 2 per cent of the company's overall income. The drop in sales is attributed to the increase in music apps, cloud storage and streaming services including Spotify. Scroll down for video . When Apple’s online store came back online following its iPhone 6 event, the sixth-generation iPod Classic model was missing from the iPod lineup (pictured). Apple did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line . According to an earnings report earlier this year, Apple sold 6 million iPods in the final quarter of 2013. Although that was almost double the sales of the previous three months, it equated to a 52% drop in sales year-on-year. The drop is being attributed to the increase in music apps, cloud storage and streaming services . Additionally, Apple iPhones come with iTunes built-in, making the iPod redundant for most iPhone owners. The trend wasn't helped by the fact Apple hadn't released a new version of the music player since the fifth-generation Touch, and seventh-generation Nano launched in 2012. Sales of iPods were at their highest during 2008 following the launch of the first iPod Touch at the end of 2007. The iPod Touch was designed to look like an iPhone, played music and ran apps, but could not make calls.

Since January this year, reports claim Apple has sold around 12 million units, which is less than half of 2013 sales figures. The highest capacity iPod now available is the 64GB version of the iPod touch, which costs £249 in the UK and $299 in the US.

"Marius Siurkus was deported from Britain after committing burglary but was found living back at his Peterborough home only 12 days later . One in five attempts to deport foreign criminals fail, while the number of crimes committed by immigrants has doubled in the past five years, new figures reveal. Last year foreign criminals were responsible for 14 per cent of serious crimes such as murders, rapes and robberies - a rate that has jumped 50 per cent since 2008. The high rate of offending coincides with news 20 per cent of last year's deportations were classed as 'failed removals' - meaning the Home Office failed to deport the offender. The figures were compiled by the Sun on Sunday, which also reported migrants commit about 220,000 crimes a year. A Lithuanian burglar recently made headlines after he was released from prison early and deported only to be found living back at his Peterborough home 12 days later. Police believe Marius Siurkus, 32, may have returned hoping to retrieve stolen jewellery he hid under floorboards. Incredibly, Siurkus’s accomplice in the burglary, countryman Mantas Pronckus, has twice been freed from prison early and deported – only to return to the UK and continue offending. MailOnline has requested comment from the Home Office. Just two months ago Britain's top police officer warned the criminal justice situation was not adapting quickly enough to cope with the impact of immigration. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said more than half of all foreign criminals caught in Britain have a right to stay that prevents them being deported. Earlier this year the Government pledged that arrested foreign nationals – including EU citizens – will face deportation even if they are not convicted of any crime. The crackdown will use a European law that states those wanting to remain here must be exercising their right to work or be self-sufficient. This could be used to tackle groups such as the capital’s notorious Park Lane beggars, a group largely from Eastern European countries such as Romania. The control of European criminals across EU borders has come under the spotlight in recent weeks after it emerged the prime suspect in the disappearance of 14-year-old Alice Gross had murdered his wife in his native country 17 years ago. New figures show the home office failed in 20 per cent of its attempted deportations last year. Pictured is the Home Office building in central London . Arnis Zalkalns, 41, convinced officers in Latvia that his wife Rudite had gone missing - when he had actually hit her with a metal bar, stabbed her in the heart and buried her in a forest. The jobbing builder served six-and-a-half years of an eight-year jail sentence before leaving for Britain in 2005. He remains at the centre of an international manhunt after being named as the prime suspect in the case of Alice, who vanished from a West London towpath more than three weeks ago.","Figures show number of crimes committed by foreigners doubled since 2008 .

Bungling: This would-be burglar made a failed attempt to break into a house in Rothwell, Northamptonshire, with a screwdriver - all while being captured on three full colour CCTV cameras. Police are now hunting him . He wandered up to a black van and tried to open the driver’s side door - which was locked - before attempting to break into a garage.

"The Mormon church has admitted that its founder was a polygamist who married a 14-year-old girl, breaking a lengthy silence about its history. Joseph Smith, who wrote the Book of Mormon and established the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is thought to have married as many as 50 women, but for years the senior church officials did not address the subject. But this week the organization acknowledged that the practice took place, and named Helen Mar Kimball, 'who was sealed to Joseph several months before her 15th birthday.' Polygamous: The Mormon church has admitted that its founder Joseph Smith (right) had many wives - including 14-year-old Helen Kimball (pictured left much later in life) Public admission: The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints had stayed silent on the issue of Joseph Smith;s polygamy for years. Pictured is a statue of Smith and his first wife, Emma, in front of the church's Salt Lake City headquarters . Estimates have placed the total number of Smith's wives between 27 and 50, though the church said it is impossible to say for sure. However, it suggested many of his marriages may not have involved sex, and that Smith was reluctant to adopt the practice, which was eventually banned in 1890. An essay published by the church, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, describes how Smith said he was visited three times by angels between 1834 and 1842 who commanded him to marry more women, despite him already having a wife, Emma. The third time, the essay says: 'The angel came with a drawn sword, threatening Joseph with destruction unless he went forward and obeyed the commandment fully.' It is part of a recent push by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to open up about sensitive issues within the faith, many of which are uncomfortable to discuss. Other writings posted in the past couple of years have addressed sacred undergarments worn by devout members; a past ban on black men in the lay clergy; and the misconception that Mormons are taught they'll get their own planet in the afterlife. Ban: Polygamy was outlawed by the Mormon church in 1890. Pictured are church leaders around that time, including Wilford Woodruff, the leader who ended the practice . The latest article also makes efforts to imply that the polygamous marriages may not have been sexual. It makes a distinction between some unions 'for time and eternity' - which can include sex - and some 'for eternity only', which are thought to have been celibate. The new article about Smith's wives during the 1830s and 1840s in Kirtland, Ohio, and Nauvoo, Illinois, comes about 10 months after the church acknowledged polygamy was widely practiced among its members in the late 19th century. 'As a collection, these are remarkably revealing articles, continuing the new open and transparent philosophy of historical writing,' said Armand Mauss, a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at Washington State University. The information will be surprising to many Latter-day Saints who either didn't know or were encouraged to dismiss speculation as anti-Mormon propaganda, Mauss said. Splinter groups who call themselves fundamentalist Mormons still practice plural marriage, including Warren Jeffs' sect on the Utah-Arizona border. Latter-day Saints began practicing polygamy after Smith received a revelation from God. He took his first plural wife in 1830 in Ohio, three years after he married his first wife, Emma, the article shows. He and his first plural wife separated, but he renewed the practice a decade later in Illinois, which is where he married the teenager. 'Difficult': An essay published by the church describes Smith's reluctance to engage in plural marriage - and says the process was 'excruciating' for his first wife, Emma, depicted above . The essay noted that while inappropriate by today's standards, marriage among teen girls was legal at the time. The article acknowledges that many details about polygamy in early Mormonism are hazy because members were taught to keep their actions confidential. But research has indicated that Smith's marriage to the young girl might not have involved sex. Some plural marriages were designed to seal the man to the woman for eternity only, and not life and eternity as Mormons believe, the article says. Those types of marriages didn't seem to involve sex. Little is known about Smith's marriages to the already-married women, the article says. They also might have been the type of unions that didn't involve sex. Plural marriage was an 'excruciating ordeal' for Emma Smith and confounding for some men, too, the article says. Some people left the faith, and others refused to take multiple wives while remaining Latter-day Saints. When Latter-day Saints trekked cross-country to Utah in 1847, nearly 200 men and more than 500 women were in plural marriage, it says. 'Difficult as it was, the introduction of plural marriage in Nauvoo did indeed 'raise up seed' unto God,' the article says. 'A substantial number of today's members descend through faithful Latter-day Saints who practiced plural marriage.' 'Remarkable, revealing': Experts have commented that the decision to address such issues is an unusually transparent move by the church's leaders.

"A multi-millionaire who pledged £1million to Ukip after defecting from the Tories was at the centre of a harassment row with a female employee. Insurance tycoon Arron Banks, 48, was arrested over given an official warning over his pursuit of 33-year-old Jo Featherby, who he first hired as an 18-year-old waitress. Mr Banks, who wants to stand as a Ukip candidate, was unveiled by Nigel Farage earlier this month as the party’s latest star recruit . Arron Banks was arrested and handed an official warning from the police after being accused of harassing a female employee . He allegedly offered her boyfriend Andy Giles £30,000 to end his relationship with her. A friend told the Sun on Sunday: ‘Banks made her life hell. He would stop at nothing to make her be his girlfriend. When Ms Featherby complained to police she was dismissed from insurance company GoSkippy — linked to Banks's firm Brightside. Mr Banks told the newspaper that he had agreed with police not to contract Ms Featherby following the harassment claims. The friend said: ‘Banks had been pursuing Jo ever since first hiring her when she was an 18-year-old barmaid at his local pub. ‘Even then he was trying underhand tactics like ensuring flowers were delivered to her while she was with her boyfriend. She left but later joined one of his firms and was eventually promoted to run a team of 60 sales staff.’ Mr Banks was accompanied by Mr Farage and party chairman Steve Crowther when he made the announcement at a press conference at a country hotel near Bristol . The insurance tycoon planned to give Nigel Farage's party £100,000 - but upped the donation after William Hague called him a 'nobody' Ms Featherby, from Bristol, launched employment tribunal proceedings alleging unfair dismissal and harassment. But she later agreed an out-of-court settlement gagging her from speaking out. The revelation are a blow to Ukip ahead of next month’s crunch Rochester by-election, triggered by the defection of rebel backbench MP Mark Reckless. Mr Banks was unveiled to the national press at a special event in Bristol on the final day of the Conservative Party conference earlier this month. He announced he was handing the party £1million to fight the next election - because he was angry at being called a 'nobody' by William Hague. Mr Banks, who has previously given tens of thousands of pounds to the Conservatives, said he was only going to give Nigel Farage's party £100,000 - but decided to increase it by £900,000 after Mr Hague's jibe. The revelations over Mr Banks come after Ukip's first elected MP Douglas Carswell took up his seat in the House of Commons last week . Nigel Farage has been campaigning hard in Rochester and Strood with former Tory MP Mark Reckless ahead of next month's by-election . The announcement, timed to disrupt David Cameron's set-piece party conference speech, came after the Tories were left stunned by the double defection of rebel backbenchers Douglas Carswell and Mr Reckless. Mr Banks — who has split from his Russian wife — told The Sun on Sunday: ‘After events all got very heated she made these allegations against me. It was agreed mutually with the police that I wouldn't contact her again. ‘Jo Featherby was a long-term employee of ours who had horrendous personal problems with her boyfriend.’ Police confirmed: ‘A 46-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of harassment on August 9, 2012. He was issued with a harassment notice and words of advice.’ A Ukip spokeswoman said: ‘He's done nothing illegal.’ Tory MP Tracey Crouch said: ‘Ukip should not take money from people who treat women this way.’","Arron Banks warned over pursuit of employee Jo Featherby two years ago .

"CLICK HERE to see the full stats package from the game at Turf Moor with our brilliant Match Zone . Ashley Barnes’ powerful second-half header gave Burnley their first Premier League win of the season at the 11th time of asking and sent their happy fans home with perhaps the flicker of belief they may not be doomed after all. Such is the gulf in resources and quality now in the top division that a small, promoted club like Burnley are always likely to falter. They did so last time they competed at this level in 2010. Quite possibly, they will fail this season, too, despite Saturday's success. Victory still leaves them at the bottom of the table. But if effort, team spirit and the pragmatic but positive philosophy of manager Sean Dyche are true markers, they won’t go down without a fight. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch .

Subs not used: Jakupovic, Rosenoir, Meyler, Robertson. Referee: M Clattenburg. (6.5) Attendance: 16998 . Man of the match: Danny Ings. Ratings from NICK HARRIS at Turf Moor . ‘In the first half I thought we were excellent, some of our play was very good,’ said Dyche, who saw fine performances from Danny Ings, Kieran Trippier and Barnes in particular. ‘We had enough chances to be one if not two goals to the good. It might sound off but I gave the lads a bit of stick at half time. ‘We know “alright” is not enough, we need to do even better. ‘Then we scored and it was a bit nervy after that, but that’s natural. A marker is laid down, you get your first win and everyone feels better.’ Trippier laid on the goal with what Dyche rightly described as a ‘fantastic cross that led to a great header’. But Dyche insisted he will not get carried away. ‘It is not about one win. It’s great and don’t get me wrong, I’ll enjoy it. ‘But there will be more than one win needed.’ He did agree, however, that these three points are ‘important psychologically’ and will help instil the belief that Burnley ‘can make the impossible possible’. In other words, avoid relegation. The next few games will give a clearer picture of whether that is possible — against Stoke, Aston Villa, Newcastle and QPR. ‘There are two or even three divisions within this division and we know where ours is,’ said Dyche, acknowledging that survival in itself would be a great achievement. ‘We know the challenges in front of us.’ Steve Bruce, Dyche’s opposing manager, was brutally frank about his team’s below-par display. ‘It’s very rare in the two-and-a-half years I’ve been at the club that I can say I feel embarrassed and say sorry to supporters who have travelled in their thousands to see that,’ he said. ‘That I made all three substitutions before 60 minutes shows you (how we needed inspiration).’ Hull City midfielder Tom Huddlestone signs autographs as the Tigers arrive at Turf Moor .

The Turf Moor faithful knew it was always likely to be a long, hard season at this level but even on a cold, damp November day, they were in fine voice — with ‘Ginger Mourinho’ shirts out in force in homage to Dyche. Ings might have put Burnley ahead in the first half but Hull goalkeeper Steve Harper made a brilliant save from his close-range volley. Hull’s defenders did well to limit Burnley’s chances before the break.

"Hells Angels boss Peter 'Skitzo' Hewat has appeared in court after being allegedly caught with Viagra pills. Victorian bikie Hewat was out on bail when he was arrested by anti-bikie police in Melbourne suburb Craigieburn on Wednesday. The outlaw motorcycle gang's East County sergeant-at-arms appeared in an out-of-sessions court charged with 44 counts of driving while suspended, breach of bail, possessing a dangerous article, resisting arrest and possessing a schedule-four poison. Hells Angels boss Peter 'Skitzo' Hewat has appeared in court charged with possession of Viagra . Hewat was stopped by police when he was being driven through Melbourne suburb Craigieburn on Wednesday . Police said when they stopped Hewat they found a baseball bat under the driver's seat of Hewat's car, as well as four tablets of Sildenafil, known as Viagra. Hewat was in the passenger seat when it was intercepted by detectives from the anti-bikie Echo taskforce following an investigation into his towing business and a number of raids on his home and that of his son, reports the Herald Sun. Earlier this year the 59-year-old, of Mountain View Lane, Mickelham, had his driver's licence suspended and was ordered not to leave his home from 9pm and 6am. Bikie boss Hewat appeared in court charged with 49 counts and remanded in custody . Police say a baseball bat was found under the driver's seat of Hewat's car, he was sitting in the passenger seat . The Hells Angels boss is seen in handcuffs after being arrested by the anti-bikie Echo taskforce in Melbourne .

Police claim on four occasions he was captured on video arriving at the premises outside curfew hours. A last charge of handling stolen goods relates to missing wheels from an allegedly stolen Mitsubishi Triton recovered at Beau Hewat's address. Mr Hewat told the bail justice he should be freed because he was a hard-working businessman and needed to care for his sick wife, reports the Herald Sun. He said: 'She's been in and out of hospital when I'm not there because she can't self-medicate properly,' reports The Age. Acting Sgt O'Brien said it was his understanding Mr Hewat's wife had been living at their son's house. Mr Hewat said his wife was often at their son's home because he had a problem with amphetamines. 'We're just trying to get him off them and keep people away from there.' Hewat's home and business were also searched on Wednesday as part of an ongoing Echo Task Force investigation. The court heard because Mr Hewat was already on bail, he should be remanded in custody until Thursday morning, where he was due reappear before court.","Hells Angels boss Peter 'Skitzo' Hewat arrested for alleged possession of erectile dysfunction pills .

"Whether spiralling up statues, connecting narrow passages, or scaling the side of a mountain, the world's most treacherous staircases all have one thing in common: they require nerves of steel. From the 70 per cent incline on the stairs of the Cambodia's Angkor Wat temple to the slippery rock path cascading down the side of Ecuador's Pailon de Diablo Waterfall, the scariest steps are often as stunning as they are terrifying. Even the world's most adventurous traveller will be challenged by the Half Dome in Yosemite National Park, in California, where a cable ladder is required to ascend the 400m incline. To worship at Machu Picchu's Moon Temple, intrepid hikers must scale another 600 feet of granite rocks, whereas 4, 444 steps are required to reach the top of the Florli Stairs in Lysefjord, Norway.

"Earl Emmitt Everett, a retired school teacher and Korean War Veteran, died Sunday at a Tulsa hospital, said Fort Gibson Police Department investigator Stephen Farmer . An 81-year-old Democrat in the race for a U.S. House seat in eastern Oklahoma died from injuries he sustained in a car accident, police said Monday. Earl Emmitt Everett, a retired school teacher and Korean War Veteran, died Sunday at a Tulsa hospital, said Fort Gibson Police Department investigator Stephen Farmer. Everett had been in a two-car accident Friday afternoon in Fort Gibson. Everett was a decided underdog in his race against first-term Republican U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin for the 2nd District seat that stretches across 26 eastern Oklahoma counties, from the foothills of the Ozark Mountains in the northeast to the Red River border with Texas in the south. An independent, Jon Douthitt, also is running for the seat. Everett was attempting to cross Highway 62 when he was hit broadside by a westbound vehicle, Farmer said. He was taken by helicopter to a hospital. Everett ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 2012. Everett had said he decided to run again because he believed Mullin hadn’t done enough for voters in his district. He defeated recent college graduate Joshua Harris-Till in the June primary. 'We honor the memory of Mr. Everett, a Korean War veteran, and his desire to represent the people of eastern Oklahoma,' Oklahoma Democratic Party Chairman Wallace Collins said in a statement. 'Anyone that is willing to put their name on a ballot in order to be voted on by their peers as a public servant deserves our admiration and respect.' Collins had recently said that the party hadn’t had any contact with Everett, even though he was a Democratic nominee. Everett had told The Associated Press that the distance from his home in Fort Gibson to the party’s headquarters in Oklahoma City was a problem. 'I don’t have anything against the party, but they’re a little bit out of pocket for me,' Everett said.","Earl Emmitt Everett, a retired school teacher and Korean War Veteran, died Sunday at a Tulsa hospital .

"A Montana teacher was sentenced Friday to 10 years in custody in a student rape case that led to the censure of a judge who partially blamed the victim. Stacey Dean Rambold, 55, was resentenced by Judge Randal Spaulding exactly a year after he completed an initial one-month prison term for the crime. Rambold appeared to grimace as the new sentence was read. He was then handcuffed and led away by deputies, pausing briefly to exchange words with family as he exited the courtroom. Back for good: Stacey Rambold, will now be going back to jail for 10 years. Last time he was sentenced he got away with an astoninshingly light months long jail term The former high school . teacher was convicted of raping a 14-year-old student . Rambold pleaded guilty to a single count of sexual intercourse without consent in the 2007 incident involving 14-year-old Cherice Moralez, a freshman in his Billings Senior High School business class. She committed suicide in 2010. The state Supreme Court overturned Rambold's initial sentence, citing in part comments from Judge G. Todd Baugh who suggested the victim shared responsibility. Baugh was censured and suspended for 31 days. He's stepping down when his terms ends in January. Yellowstone County Attorney Scott Twito said he was pleased with the sentence that included five additional years that were suspended. Outrageous: Rambold has previously said that his 14-year-old victim Cherice . Moralez (pictured here) was responsible for his actions because she . appeared older than her age . Tragedy: The victim Cherice Moralez killed herself while the case against Rambold was pending . 'The criminal justice system worked today,' he said. John Moralez, the father of the victim, had hoped for a longer sentence but said it was better than the one-month previously serviced by Rambold. During the hearing, Twito asked Judge Spaulding to reject defense attempts to make the victim's conduct in the case a factor in Rambold's sentencing. That included references by the defendant's attorney to video-taped interviews of the victim recorded by law enforcement prior to her death. Those recordings, which have never been made public, had been cited by Baugh during his sentencing. Under state law, children under 16 cannot consent to sexual intercourse. 'The last thing we want to do is sit here in the criminal justice system and say, 'What is the age?' It doesn't matter. Fourteen is way too young,' Twito said. 'There has to be punishment. ... Punishment means prison.' Rambold's attorney, Jay Lansing, responded that there was no statute preventing the court from considering Moralez's conduct. He pointed out that similar objections were never raised by prosecutors during Rambold's first sentence, and said they were seeking a 'do-over,' which Lansing asserted was not allowed under state and federal law. District Judge G. Todd Baugh: Baugh . sentenced Rambold to one-month in jail in 2013. He has since admitted his huge mistake and even tried . to re-sentence Rambold in August of that year but failed . In a letter to the court, Rambold sought forgiveness and lamented the international publicity his case has generated. 'No one can really appreciate and understand what it feels like to have so many people actually hate you and be disgusted by you,' Rambold wrote. 'I do not mention this for the sake of sympathy, but it has been hard.' Twito asked the court to impose a 10-year prison sentence with another 10 years suspended. That is the same sentence prosecutors sought last year when the case was before Baugh, who instead adopted the much more lenient term suggested by Rambold's defense attorney. Without Moralez, their primary witness, prosecutors struck a deal with Rambold that initially allowed him to avoid prison altogether. Rambold, however, violated that agreement by having unauthorized visits with relatives' children and entering into a relationship with an adult woman without telling his counselor. As a result, the case was revived and Rambold pleaded guilty last year to the count of sexual intercourse without consent. Distraught mother: Auliea Hanlon listens during a . protest in August 2013 against the 30-day sentence a judge imposed on the . teacher who raped her daughter Cherice Morales when the girl was 14 . years old . During the first sentencing, Baugh suggested the victim had as much control over her rape as the defendant and said she 'appeared older than her chronological age.' He gave Rambold a 15-year term with all but one month suspended. That triggered an appeal from prosecutors and ultimately resulted in the case being reassigned to Spaulding. Baugh's comments and the lenient sentence he handed down landed him before the state Supreme Court for disciplinary proceedings, which resulted in a 30-day suspension from the bench and a public censure for his misconduct in the case. In a sentencing memorandum filed this week, Twito wrote that a tough sentence for Rambold was warranted given his position of authority over Moralez. 'His position of trust as a high school teacher, abuse of that position, and violations against the victim overshadows all mitigating circumstances,' Twito wrote.","Stacey Dean Rambold, 55, was sentenced to 30-days in jail in August 2013 for the rape of 14-year-old Cherice Moralez .

"A Seattle woman who lied to police and falsely accused Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch of assault could spend up to a year in jail for the stunt. The Bellevue Police Department on Thursday recommended criminal charges against Jammie Ficarelli, 31, who told authorities that Lynch, 28, had punched her in the face on Aug. 10. She also claimed her Louis Vuitton purse had been damaged in the alleged attack. But cops say that Ficarelli was wasted the night she claims she was assaulted and mistook a 5-foot-11 black man with dreadlocks for the NFL player, according the Bellevue Reporter. Instead of being punched by Lynch, she drunkenly fell on her face outside the posh Bravern building — at least a mile from where Lynch had checked into the Hilton Bellevue Hotel with the rest of his team, court records show. Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch was falsely accused of assaulting 31-year-old Jammie Ficarelli, who may now be charged with a crime for lying to cops . Bellevue Police say Ficarelli downed several drinks at the Blue Martini, inside the luxury apartment complex Bravern (pictured), and mistook another man for the Seahawks running back . Ficarelli had plowed through drinks at the Blue Martini, a bar inside the posh Bravern apartment complex, and was invited upstairs by one of the building's residents. Security footage shows Ficarelli with this man, who wasn't identified. He told police that he repeatedly told Ficarelli he didn't play for the Seahawks, court records show. The man says she had a 'major mood swing' when she arrived at his apartment and he asked her to leave several times. Once outside, Ficarelli was 'swaying back and forth, had slurred speech and smelled like alcohol,' one security guard told cops. 'The female then tipped over and fell onto her right side onto the paved walkway in front of one of the Bravern businesses,' court documents show. The security guard 'observed the right side of the female's head hit the paved sidewalk.' Detectives later confirmed that Lynch was in his hotel room about a mile away while Ficarelli was stumbling around the Bravern apartments. The Bellevue Police Department has been under fire for releasing Lynch's name before their investigation was complete. Seahawks fans have taken to Lynch's defense — and Ficarelli's boyfriend claims she had to move because of all the death threats she began receiving at her home. 'Did you take pictures of his head? Did you see the cameras at his house? No. They probably didn’t do that. I think this investigation is biased,' the man told KIRO-TV. Bellevue prosecutors are yet to decide if Ficarelli will be charged. She faces up to a year in jail and a $5,000 fine if convicted of making a false or misleading statement to a public servant, which is a misdemeanor. Ficarelli mistook another man,  also 5-foot-11 with dreadlocks, for the Seahawks running back (pictured)","Police in Bellevue, Washington, say 31-year-old Jammie Ficarelli was drunk and mistook a 5-foot-11 black man with dreadlocks for Marshawn Lynch .

"Parts of the giant statue of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin have gone on sale online after it was toppled by anti-Russian demonstrators in Ukraine last week. The monument was pulled down on Sunday and still lies in Kharkiv's Freedom Square - but parts have started to go missing. The ear and other parts from the Communist's 30ft effigy have cropped up on VK, the Russian version of Facebook, and are being sold to raise funds for anti-Russian forces. Scroll down for video . The nose from Lenin's toppled statue in Kharkiv, Ukraine, is up for sale on the black market, as are the former Soviet Leader's ear and other body parts . The monument was pulled down by protesters on Sunday night and still lies in Kharkiv's Freedom Square . The ear and other parts from the Communist's 30ft effigy have cropped up on VK, the Russian version of Facebook, and are being sold to raise money for anti-Russian forces . Vitaly Kalinin claimed to have one of Lenin's large bronze ears, which he cut from the statue overnight. He posted online: 'Come and listen to the sound of change - through Lenin's ear.' One protester was seen taking the nose, which is 14in long, 14in wide and about 10in high, the night the statue was pulled down. A seller, only identifying himself as Oleksiy, claims to have the nose and said: 'If there is anyone who says, ""I am ready, let’s say, to provide a battalion of soldiers with winter underwear and uniforms,"" then we will give him [the nose]. 'That is, if no one says, better yet, that he’s ready to provide two battalions with the things I have mentioned.' Local police - heavily criticised in Russia for doing nothing to stop the statue's destruction - have yet to open an inquiry. Protestors scaled the monument, carved 'Glory to Ukraine' into it and sawed off its legs, causing it fall over, before cutting off chunks. Local police spokesman Tikhon Belousov said: 'There were 25,000 people in Freedom Square the night the statue came down. 'What did people expect us do do, round them all up for questioning?' More than 160 monuments of Lenin have been toppled in the Ukraine since December 8. The main terminal of Donetsk airport was under siege by pro-Russian rebels today, where Ukrainian armed forces are holed up . Pro-Russian rebels watch as smoke rises from the airport following fierce artillery fire and shelling . Three tanks were seen firing on the airport today, just a day after a Red Cross worker was killed in the city . Residential areas in Donetsk have also been caught in the crossfire, with both sides refusing to take the blame for the shelling of the Red Cross' offices . Elsewhere in Ukraine today, pro-Russian rebels faced fierce resistance from Ukrainian government forces as they tried to seize Donetsk airport. Three rebel tanks were seen firing on the main terminal as sniper shots rang around the area. The pro-Russians have taken some buildings on the fringes of the airport but do not have overall control. Colonel Andriy Lysenko, Ukraine's national security and defense council spokesman said two Ukrainian servicemen had been killed and other nine wounded in the last 24 hours. Fighting for the airport has intensified this week, threatening to derail the truce declared on September 5. Residential areas in Donetsk have also been caught in the crossfire, with a member of the Red Cross killed on Thursday when the group's officer was shelled. The rebels said the shelling came from the Ukrainian side, while Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin blamed the blast on 'terrorists.' A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last night that the aid worker's death, along with the shelling of a school that killed three people earlier this week, 'underscore the fragility of the current cease-fire and the importance of ensuring a secure environment in south-eastern Ukraine that will allow humanitarian actors to carry out their work and deliver critical assistance to those most in need.'","The ear, nose and other body parts from Lenin's toppled statue are for sale .

Like the smaller version of the new iPhone 6, the 'Vertu for Bentley' has a 4.7-inch screen. The £10,700 phone also has 13-megapixel camera, for those selfies in the back of your Continental,  a 64gb hard-drive and a battery with a talktime life of up to 15 hours 30 minutes. The £224,000 Bentley Mulsanne Speed, which will be officially unveiled at the Paris Motor Show next month . But in case customers feel that's a slightly inflated price for a mobile handset, it also comes with its own concierge service. So if you're sitting in the back of your Bentley (chauffeur driven of course) and suddenly realise you need a holiday to the Bahamas - no need to squint at the screen. A quick call to your personal butler and all will be arranged for you. The new Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus cost a relative snip at £539 and £619 . The luxury phone, launched at the global headquarters of Bentley in Crewe today, is the perfect Christmas gift for the man who has it all (other than, perhaps, a grip on reality). Kevin Rose, from the luxury car firm, said: 'The partnership between Bentley and Vertu allows customers to experience the Bentley brand while out of the driving seat. 'The look and feel of the handset is a consequence of a strong collaboration between the Bentley and Vertu creative teams. 'The handset's design and materials, when coupled with its exclusive services, integrated Bentley content and high-performance technology, embody what both Bentley and Vertu stand for, and deliver what our customers are looking for.' Massimiliano Pogliani, boss of Vertu, added: 'The new Vertu for Bentley handset combines English handcraftsmanship, contemporary elegance, outstanding performance and cutting-edge technology.'

Abraham and Smith exchange punches in their absorbing clash in Kiel three months ago . That led to calls for an immediate rematch which has now been agreed and which will be held at the O2 Arena.

He told me at the press conference that he's going to knock me out, as he did last time. 'I know I can improve and hit another level, but I don't think he can. I know I'll get a fair crack of the whip this time.' Abraham said: 'I'm a man of my word. I promised Paul that I would give him a rematch after our first fight in Kiel. I will honour that promise.

"In a week that has seen Manchester City talk loudly about progress off the field at their new Etihad Campus, it is time for Manuel Pellegrini’s side to make sure they don’t exit the Champions League with a whisper. City are the Barclays Premier League champions and now boast a training centre — the City Football Academy — that they hope will bring them a steady stream of young talent for years to come. Understandably, they are rather proud of this. In Europe, though, they continue to play like novices. VIDEO Scroll down for Manuel Pellegrini: No pressure on my job even if we don't qualify . Manuel Pellegrini says he will not fear for his job even if Manchester City fail to qualify from their group . Pellegrini will be without Sergio Aguero who suffered knee ligament damage on Saturday . Vincent Kompany leads the Manchester City squad off the team bus as they arrive in Rome . This has been a wretched campaign — worse perhaps than anything that has gone before — but one that still has some air in its lungs thanks to two catastrophic Bayern Munich mistakes that led to two superbly taken Sergio Aguero goals late in the game when the teams met in Manchester last month. On Wednesday evening, at the Olympic Stadium in Rome, City face a task best explained thus: if they avoid defeat, score a goal and better CSKA Moscow’s result in Munich then they will squeeze through to the knockout stages. Anything else and the question marks will begin. One man who will be missing is Aguero. Pellegrini revealed the Argentine could be out for up to six weeks on Tuesday, while rejecting suggestions another Champions League exit would put his position at the Etihad under threat. ‘Aguero’s recovery will depend on the first weeks,’ explained the Chilean. ‘It’s an important stage right at the beginning. But, as I said, our team doesn’t depend on a single player and I hope my players can prove it. ‘I think we will qualify but it has nothing to do with my future here,’ he added. ‘I never received any pressure from the club. ‘We started with a target of trying to qualify for the last 16. 'We have a good squad but made a lot of mistakes in other games, especially against CSKA. 'Against Bayern we showed we are fighting to qualify and I am sure we will do it if we play a good game. It’s very important for the club to play in the next round.’ Edin Dzeko and Samir Nasri head to Rome with their team-mates ready to face Roma on Wednesday . Eliaquim Mangala and Pablo Zabaleta head with the squad into Manchester Airport to travel to face Roma . Wednesday evening is important for City for all kinds of reasons. Qualification for the next stage is important financially, for example. It also matters in terms of their seeding for next year’s competition but, perhaps most significantly, it is important for the English champions’ self-respect and the manner in which they are viewed around Europe. If things go right for a team that — to their credit — have used Aguero’s goals against Bayern as a catalyst for improvement, who knows where they may go in this competition? Manchester City's squad get ready to head for departures at the city's airport ahead of their clash in Rome . Pellegrini will rely upon Edin Dzeko (left) and Stevan Jovetic (right) with star striker Sergio Aguero injured . Samir Nasri (left) and Fernandinho (right) train ahead of Manchester City's trip to Italy . City travel to Roma for a game they need to get a result from in order to progress in the Champions League . If things go very wrong, however, they could find themselves without even the consolation of the Europa League place handed to those that finish third in the groups. That scenario would be rather embarrassing. Despite the absence of Aguero and the suspended Yaya Toure, City are boosted by the possible return from injury of Vincent Kompany and David Silva. ‘It will be a big game for Roma, too,’ said Edin Dzeko. ‘I think the atmosphere will be amazing and that’s what football’s about, and the kind of games we want to play.’ Vincent Kompany strides ahead of Milner and Frank Lampard during some warm-up drills in training . Dzeko is expected to stand in for Aguero and he is in no doubt about the importance of the task. ‘It was a big blow for us to lose Sergio but we have to deal with it and we have won five in a row. There is better confidence, a better atmosphere in the team when you’re winning. Hopefully we can be even better in the next week. There are some big, crucial games. ‘I’m there when the team needs me and I’m happy to be back,’ the Bosnian added. ‘I’ll do my best to try and score goals and bring something good to the team. Manuel Pellegrini wanders across the City Football Academy pitch as the squad trains before the Roma clash . ‘It’s a special situation for us in the league and the Champions League because we’ve had to catch up in both. We were eight points behind Chelsea and we knew, OK, now we have to start playing. In the Champions League it has been the same. Maybe we need that pressure.’ Suggesting City’s momentum has been driven by a ‘needs must’ attitude is interesting, though Dzeko’s manager might disagree. The fact is Pellegrini’s side have improved recently and they have a chance against a Roma team second in Serie A but one that boasts a Champions League record as peculiar as City’s is mundane. City have been consistently disappointing, while Roma — who won 5-1 at home to CSKA but lost 7-1 in the same venue against Bayern — have oscillated wildly. Another Manchester team once beat Roma 7-1 in this competition. City would surely take something rather less dramatic.

"Legendary commentator John Hunt, 57, has seen it all from what he calls his 'view in the clouds' and on Thursday he set his sights on the critics of horse-racing, labelling them 'unrealistic and completely uneducated', after the tragic events of Melbourne Cup Day. 'These are just things that happen, that's just life, I mean people have heart attacks and so do horses,' he said in reference to the sad demise of Admire Rakti and Araldo after the big race. 'You can always shut the gate after the horse has bolted but it's pretty hard to predict every single thing that could happen in the world but to compare waving a flag in the crowd and a horse having a heart attack with being cruel to horses is unreasonable, unrealistic and completely uneducated.' Scroll down for video . That's it for me. John Hunt calls time on a 30 year race-calling career . The sad demise of Melbourne Cup runners Araldo (left) and Admire Rakti (right) post the race that stops a nation has nothing to do with issues of animal cruelty according to retired race-caller and author John Hunt . The early days. John Hunt takes to the microphone at a country race meeting 'I travelled all over the place but loved every minute' December 12, 2008 and good mate and legendary driver Chris Lewis waves goodbye to John Hunt (high up in the commentary box) as he calls his final race as he takes his horse to the line at Gloucester Park in a fitting finale . His tales from the track are as many as they are varied. He remembers watching on from his vantage point high up in the stands as 'a scallywag bookmaker' ran for his life from a phalanx of irate punters demanding their cash, to a trainer who conspired to fix a race with his two horses, only for the wrong one to win costing him thousands of dollars. 'I've also seen a bloke jump off a horse to make sure it gets beaten but then racing is no different to other forms,' he said. 'There is that side to the industry but there is that (seedy) side to many industries, I always say to people that racing is no different to real estate or the law profession or anything else for that matter. 'It has some good people in it and it has some scallywags in it, that's just life. 'I don't think racing necessarily has more than plenty of other industries but, yes, it does have some notable ones because where money is involved and there's gambling, you are sure to attract that kind of element. 'Rather than dwell on the negative side of the sport, most of what I have seen is just simply uplifting, I have seen things that would make grown men cry. That's the beauty and the romance of racing.' A champion junior tennis player, John Hunt celebrates with Australian legend Evonne Cawley (Goolagong). His career in the spot and hopes of winning at Wimbledon one day was cut short by a serious back injury . However, he might have been the watched rather than the watcher, if fate hadn't intervened and cut short a promising tennis career. He'd been the top junior in WA and even had the privilege of sharing a celebratory drink with Wimbledon champion and Australian legend Evonne Cawley (Goolagong) but at age 19 he was carried off the tennis court in agony as his back gave out. So the avid fan of racing and race commentators, decided that he would train himself as a caller. Armed with tape recorder he practised and then went out and cut his teeth in the bush, including places like Marble Bar and Port Hedland and he said that 'some of the places I started at are ghost towns now but when you're 19 just starting out, you'll go anywhere to get experience'. Employed within six months, he went on to become a leading broadcaster of thoroughbred racing, harness racing and greyhounds. A stellar career which would stretch some three decades, all because of his love of the animals. John Junt's favourite pacer, Village Kid, with Chris Lewis in the sulky . 'It can make you cry because horses strive to be a winner and they do with no ulterior motive because they choose to,' he said. 'It's a wonderful thing, it's an innocence - there's no guile attached to what they want to do, if they want to try to win from an unlikely position, if they look beaten and somehow find a way to win then it's because they want to. 'That's what brings a tear to the corner of you eye , the bravery like that born of innocence, it's an amazing thing and that's the type of thing that crosses demographics.' The Gloucester Park faithful make their feelings known as John Hunt calls it quits on his broadcasting career . They say never work with children and animals. John Hunt breaks at least one of those rules as he undertakes a television interview with a furry friend as company . One of his favourite of all time was champion pacer Village Kid 'he came out at the age of 13 to do a time trial in aid of the Make A Wish Foundation, to make money for the kids and ran the fastest time of his entire career after almost 200 race starts on the final night he set foot on a racetrack, breaking all sorts of world records, the tears were just flowing'. On December 12, 2008, his last night in the broadcast box, there wasn't a dry eye in the house either, as his good mate and superstar driver Chris Lewis took his horse to the line first, saluting his mate high up in the Gloucester Park stands as he won.

"Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp delivers his verdict on the weekend's Premier League action. Jack Wilshere was back to his best in Arsenal's 2-2 draw against Manchester City and made a few critics eat their words. Elsewhere, Manchester United earned their first win of the season, Chelsea stormed to their fourth straight win as a Diego Costa hat-trick saw them beat Swansea 4-2 at Stamford Bridge and Liverpool were beaten by Aston Villa at Anfield. Jack's back . It was great to see Jack Wilshere back to his best against City. He did well against Besiktas, played OK for England, but on Saturday he reminded us all what he can do. He played with a smile on his face, took the game by the scruff of the neck and was so composed for his goal. Roy Hodgson wants to use him in a holding role but why waste his attacking talents? He was at his best in the opposition half, as his heat map shows (right). He can play that deep role but it would be better for England if he played there every week. I was more than happy, too, for Jack to have a pop back at me after I criticised him recently. I did it as a player so know what it’s like. But I’m paid to give my opinions and he’s paid to ram them down my throat. That’s just what he did against City. Long may it continue. Jack Wilshere celebrates his goal for Arsenal in a 2-2 draw with Manchester City at the Emirates . Jack Wilshere chipped Joe Hart to bring Arsenal level against Manchester City on Saturday . Could Diego be the new Drogba? Diego Costa has hit seven goals in four games, quicker than any Chelsea striker in recent times. Chelsea spent an awful lot of time and money trying to replace Didier Drogba. It looks like they have finally found their man. What more can you say about Diego Costa? He has arrived in the Premier League and is probably thinking: ‘Everyone is scared of me and I’ve got Cesc Fabregas to supply the bullets.’ He must be absolutely loving it. He has seven goals in four games — it took Drogba 18 games to match that — and Costa is the complete package, scoring with both feet and his head. He is the real deal. ........................................................................... Villa's tactical masterclass . Paul Lambert must love going to Anfield. The Villa boss has never lost a Premier League game there as a manager, drawing once with Norwich and now winning twice and drawing once with Aston Villa. The latest win was thoroughly deserved. They let the two centre backs have the ball, but as soon as Steven Gerrard, Philippe Coutinho or Jordan Henderson got it, Villa stopped them playing. It was the first time since December 2012 that Liverpool didn’t have Luis Suarez or Daniel Sturridge and it showed — they lacked a cutting edge up front. Villa were aggressive, Philippe Senderos bullied Mario Balotelli and the result showed what an astute tactician Lambert is. Diego Costa scored a hat-trick against Swansea to help Chelsea to their fourth straight victory . Diego Costa has hit the ground running since moving to Chelsea, scoring seven goals in four games . Gabriel Agbonlahor scored the only goal as Aston Villa stunned Liverpool at Anfield . Next up for LVG: Are diamonds forever? It was an impressive attacking show from United at Old Trafford. That’s only to be expected now with the embarrassment of riches they have in their squad. United went back to four in defence with a midfield diamond and looked much better for it. But will Louis van Gaal stick with it? Angel di Maria celebrates after scoring his first goal for Manchester United against QPR . Louis van Gaal finally earned his first win as Manchester United manager as they smashed QPR 4-0 . VIDEO Van Gaal happy to get goals on the board . 1992 - QPR have not kept a clean sheet against Manchester United since 1992 — their first ever Premier League meeting. I was in the Sky studio on Sunday with Patrick Kluivert, who knows Van Gaal better than anybody, and he is convinced United will end up with a back three. Even with a four, QPR still created chances, and United will have tougher tests to come when they face the likes of Man City and Chelsea. The system they did use looked good and Angel di Maria was exceptional, but I enjoyed watching Ander Herrera. He was always involved, looked sharp and comfortable on the ball and used it well. He proved he’s got an eye for goal, too, and provided plenty of sparkle in United’s midfield diamond. Stones can be a rock at the back . Injury might have ruled out Sylvain Distin for Everton’s 2-0 win at West Brom, but he could find it hard to get himself back in the team. He and Phil Jagileka have been stalwarts for Everton, but the team had conceded 10 goals in three games. With John Stones coming in at centre back, they kept a clean sheet. The young man can play right back at a pinch but his long-term future is in the middle. He is comfortable in possession, has great recovery speed and now has a big season ahead of him. It could be time for a changing of the guard. Young defender John Stones gave another impressive performance for Everton at West Brom . Pelle has Saints marching on . When the likes of Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert left Southampton for Anfield, fans were worried about battling relegation. But it’s been business as usual on the south coast and, though there’s a long way to go, I’m sure the Saints fans will be enjoying seeing their side above Liverpool in the table. Lambert left but Graziano Pelle has come in and already looks settled. He’s played all over the place but he has good technique for a tall man and is linking up well with Dusan Tadic. You couldn’t really call it a deliberate one-two for Pelle’s second, but they are forming a good partnership. Southampton looked ready to implode at the start of the season but results have helped calm things down. I’m sure there’s a few more gems in the academy too — that place is a production line. Graziano Pelle scored twice as Southampton thrashed Newcastle 4-0 at St Mary's . 34 - Leicester have scored in 34 of their last 35 league games. The only fixture where they failed to find the net was Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last month. Ulloa looking lively for Leicester . What a result for Leicester and what a good start to his Premier League career by Leonardo Ulloa. He cost big money from Brighton, even at the age of 28, but he has already impressed me. He looked a composed player against Arsenal and he was in such good form he probably didn’t want the international break to come round. But he picked up where he left off against Stoke with the winner. He took it well, too, because the cross was slightly behind him so he had to adjust his feet quickly and finish from an awkward spot. There is good pace in Nigel Pearson’s team, and Esteban Cambiasso will add some much-needed top-level experience. But so far this season, Ulloa has been their star performer. Leonardo Ulloa scored the winner for Leicester as they beat Stoke 1-0 at the Britannia Stadium . Jamie's Premier League number crunching . 7 - It was not his best game in an Arsenal shirt, but Aaron Ramsey still produced the goods against City. His pass set up Jack Wilshere and Ramsey has been directly involved in seven Arsenal goals in his last eight league games, scoring four and assisting three. And, since the start of last season, no Arsenal player has provided more assists than the all-action midfielder — he has nine. 2 - Aston Villa did a fine job of making sure Liverpool were kept quiet. There were just two shots on target in the whole match at Anfield, and the second of those came in the 11th minute. 4 - Dusan Tadic has kept up his creative form from last season. He has four assists in his last six league games for Twente and Southampton. 5/36 - Things do not look good for Alan Pardew and Newcastle. Of the last 36 league points on offer, his side have won just five. They have won one, drawn two and lost nine of their last 12 matches. Alan Pardew saw his Newcastle side thrashed 4-0 by Southampton at St Mary's on Saturday . Newcastle fans hold 'Pardew Out' banners as they make their feelings clear on the current manager . 3 - Despite angling for a move away, Morgan Schneiderlin is enjoying himself at Southampton. He already has three goals this season, one more than in the whole of last campaign. 100th - It's not one Harry Kane will be proud of, but his own goal against Sunderland was the 100th Premier League goal of the season. 1 - West Brom must sort out their home form if they want to stay in the Premier League. Another home defeat, this time by Everton, means Alan Irvine’s men have won just one of their last 11 home league games, drawing seven and losing three.","Diego Costa has scored seven goals in just for games for Chelsea .

"I know it makes a lot of you see Red. The idea that so many of our football shows’ pundit chairs are seemingly warmed frequently by the backsides of so many ex-Liverpool players. And if that is you, then Saturday evening’s coverage of the jewel in club football’s crown may have just been too much to bear. No sooner had Harry Redknapp got his second soaking of the afternoon - the first, from a hailstorm. the second, victory champagne following QPR’s play-off final victory at Wembley - than Sky Sports were off to The Champions League Final.  And there, his boy Jamie was waiting for us in Lisbon. While alongside him, two more ex-Liverpool men, Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the Real players interrupt Ancelotti's press conference . Yellow cards: Suspended Xabi Alonso appeared on TV as a pundit during the 2014 Champions League final . But just in case that wasn’t enough Anfield for you, over on ITV, they were preparing to unveil none other than Steven Gerrard as their guest pundit for the evening. Like the song says, they never do walk alone, do they? Having said all that, the real point is that each man is there in his own right. And certainly for those men on Sky, that worked well during their extensive build up. Graeme Souness was his chippy self from the get go. Modric, he told us ‘borders on being a 5-a-side player’. While Ramos is ‘an accident waiting to happen’. Jamie Redknapp delivered the one liner of the night when discussing the virtues of Diego Simeone as a leader. ‘Some managers do their preparations in the mirror’, he said. But alas, he couldn’t be convinced to then go on and name names. Jamie Carragher was then in his pomp, breaking down and analysing tactics and formations at the big screen. Although I have to be honest, it did seem to go on for absolutely ages without anyone else chipping in. Perhaps they’d all taken the chance to sneak a cheeky latte? Good to see you: Alonso (left) comes into the ITV studio to greet former team-mate Steven Gerrard . This was their first hour of coverage, and lead just about perfectly to when ITV came on air. Which they did, by the way, with an absolutely dynamite flamenco opening sequence. Adrian Chiles picked up where the guitarists left off, nearly bursting with the joy of not only introducing the Liverpool captain to the game, but also the fact that he was about to ‘get to work with Roy Keane’. To which Stevie G responded that is it was ‘very exciting’. Only he said it with the tone of voice and body language of a man who had just been delivered blindfolded in the back of a transit van. However, he did quickly warm to the occasion. Unfortunately, just at the moment when all the Lads In Red were suddenly upstaged by a surprise package - and yet another former member of the fold. Glory: Alonso celebrates after winning the trophy despite being suspended for accumulation of yellow cards . This particular one, making his entrance for the evening down on the pitch, in a slick three piece suit, sunglasses and sipping on a Cappuccino. No doubt about it, the star of both channels was the suspended Galactico Xabi Alonso. Real Madrid’s loss was telly’s gain. First, he was great in the studio with the Sky boys. He talked about how well Gareth Bale had ‘integrated into the club, into the city’. He took Souness to task about Modric’s contribution this season, explaining he had been ‘outstanding’. And then went on to illustrate how the Madrid personnel would deal tactically with Atletico. It had Souness purring like a kitten and telling Xabi how much he would be missed out there. All smiles: Alonso and Zinedine Zidane celebrate the victory . Well, luckily, there didn’t seem to be a camera inside the Estadio da Luz that missed him from then on in. ITV quickly got themselves in on the Alonso lovefest - showing us the impromptu moment when he nipped in to say hello to his old team mate Gerrard. Then it was all down to the match director to use him as punctuation throughout the game. ITV were first out of the blocks in taking advantage of these candid shots. At half time, they stealthily attached his reaction to the replays of Gareth Bale’s chance. And it seemed that whatever Xabi was kicking, he was doing it much more effectively than Gareth had just done. Celebrating long into the night: Alonso in Cibeles celebrating the Tenth European Cup with fans . Into the second half, and we got even more Xabi for our money. First, there he was hugging a team mate within an inch of his life as another chance went begging. Then when Ramos equalised  - something happened, Graeme, but it wasn’t an accident! - we saw a face filled with relief as it puffed out, puckered it’s lips and kissed the top of a team mate’s head. Finally, he was back on the pitch trying to rally his pals for one last surge. And while he was there, Xabi took time to also turn to the Real fans and urge them to do the same. The glasses and coffee were gone by now. It was nitty-gritty time. So Sky Sports saw their season off with a bang. While ITV neatly dovetailed their switch to Rio in a couple of weeks time by bringing the England captain on board. But at the end of the evening, in telly terms, it was the X Man who was first class.","Former Liverpool players dominate Champions League punditry .

"Steve Bruce has already fielded phone calls from clubs interested in Andrew Robertson – and admits it is perhaps inevitable he will one day be lured from Hull City. The 20-year-old left back – signed from Dundee United for just £2.85million in the summer – has already made a big impression at the KC Stadium and scored Scotland’s goal during their 3-1 defeat to England in midweek. That rampaging raid on the opposition penalty area won him comparison to Gareth Bale, and it is the Real Madrid star’s former club, Spurs, who Robertson faces on Sunday. Andrew Robertson (right) has impressed since moving to Hull from Dundee United . Robertson scores for Scotland against England at Celtic Park on November 18 . Robertson celebrates his goal which made it 2-1 but it proved in vain as England won 3-1 . But Tigers boss Bruce concedes that, like Bale and former Southampton teenager Luke Shaw, it might not be too long before bigger clubs come calling with serious offers. ‘There has already been one or two with phone calls asking “to keep me informed”,’ says Bruce, whose side are without a win in four in the Premier League. ‘That’s always the first stage. I had it with (Wilson) Palacios when I was at Wigan and then (Antonio) Valencia when he went off to Man United. And if this kid keeps performing the way he is then it might become inevitable. ‘Look at Luke Shaw – he only played one year, didn’t he? That’s how crazy it is: £32million, you could buy the Humber Bridge for that!’ Robertson, an attacking defender, is very much in the mould of Bale and Shaw. And that is a likeness Bruce welcomes. Tigers' boss Steve Bruce believes the 20-year-old can only get better after impressing for his country . Bruce believes Robertson is similar in style to Real Madrid's Gareth Bale . Robertson has also drawn comparisons to Luke Shaw, who picked up an injury in United's win over Arsenal . ‘These days, the higher up you go, the full-backs play as wing-backs,’ he said. ‘The modern game is such that they really do give you the width. If you look at all the top teams the two full-backs are high up the pitch constantly and that will always suit Andy. ‘He wants to get forward, he’s no mean defender himself but he’s blessed with this ability to run quickly and it seems effortless for him.’ Bruce, though, also sounded caution, as he added: ‘We will have to protect him over the next couple of years I would have thought, but certainly if he keeps improving the way he is then he’s got a wonderful future ahead of him. ‘But he’s the type who wants to do well, he wants to improve, he wants to be a top player. He has got all that drive in him so we will make sure he doesn’t get carried away with himself because we have got arguably one of the best young players in the country.’ Hull’s scouting team had tracked Robertson for the bulk of last season and strongly advised Bruce to follow through with their recommendation. Robertson returned to his old school this week as part of a Tesco event . It was something the manager had no hesitation in doing. ‘There is a lot of hard work that goes on beneath (the signing),’ he revealed. 'My scouts followed him and it’s all their hard work. I made the decision to say yes because the people I employ said “yes”. ‘But you just had to look at him at Dundee last year – the natural aspects and think “wow”. ‘As soon as you see him whoosh up that line you go “bloomin’ heck”. There are not many people that move like that very often. It’s reward for everybody at the club, but more rewarding for him than anybody.’","Andrew Robertson has impressed since joining Hull from Dundee United .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has said it would be 'very good' for Champions League rival Pep Guardiola to manage one day in the Premier League. Pellegrini faces Guardiola on Tuesday night with the Bayern Munich manager tipped in some quarters to be his eventual successor at The Etihad due to his previous working relationship at Barcelona with City executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain. Far from baulking at the mention of Guardiola's name, Pellegrini has heaped praise on his counterpart and said he could see the benefits for the Bayern boss of working in England at some point.

'I cannot read what will happen in the future but I am sure if sometime he arrives here, he will be a very important manager as he was in Barcelona and now at Bayern Munich. But it is impossible for me to know,' said Pellegrini. Asked if he though Guardiola would come to the Premier League, the City boss replied: 'Maybe, yes. I think it will be very good for him and very good for the Premier League also. But I cannot talk for Pep Guardiola. 'I think Pep always gives a style of play to all his teams. Maybe the players are not the same so Barcelona and Bayern Munich do not play exactly the same. But they are always very attractive teams and very offensive teams that likes to have high possession of the ball. 'I think that Pep is a very good manager, he demonstrated what he did in Barcelona and now at Bayern Munich but I think the most important thing for us is to try to make a very good game against a great team.' Guardiola's contract in Germany has another 18 months to run and he is likely to be coveted by every major team in Europe afterwards, including Arsenal and Manchester United if they have vacancies.

Joe Hart was left helpless as Boateng (not pictured) scored the only goal in Bayern's 1-0 win over City . Tuesday night represents a huge match for Pellegrini who was hired to replace Roberto Mancini in 2013 partly due to his success in taking unfashionable Malaga to the last eight of the Champions League. Ironically the Chilean's greatest success at City so far has come in domestic competitions, winning the Premier League and Capital One Cup last season. City crashed out in the last-16 of the competition last season and have collected only two points from four games in their group games in this campaign. Defeat against Bayern will end their Champions League hopes and Pellegrini says he is putting more pressure on himself than the owners are applying to avoid that happening. 'My own pressure to continue to the next round is an important pressure – more maybe than the owners,' he said. 'Of course I think we must be in the next stage. A lot of times you don’t reach the target you are supposed to do but that is the way to sit down and think about what happened. I repeat, I will do that after we know if we are not in the next stage. Polish striker Robert Lewandowski rises to double Bayern Munich's lead just before the half-time break . Arjen Robben (centre) made it 3-0 to Bayern late in the second half against Hoffenheim . 'If we don’t continue to the round of 16 then of course it is a step back but we have to play two more games and we will see what happens in those games. After that I can answer, not at this moment.' Pellegrini's hopes aren't helped by missing Yaya Toure and Fernandinho on Tuesday due to their red cards against CSKA Moscow in their previous European games. David Silva, Aleksandr Kolarov and Edin Dzeko are also currently injured. In addition, the City boss has been hamstrung by Uefa restrictions on squad size and spending power due to the club breaching financial fair play regulations. It led to Pellegrini allowing striker Alvaro Negredo out on loan. 'We had a lot of restrictions, we cannot have more than 21 players in the Champions League squad. It is a lot of things but it is not my way to use all these things to excuse bad results. We have a squad, we have the reality of what happened this year and have to work that way.' Bayern have already qualified for the knockout stages and are favourites with Barcelona and Real Madrid to the win the Champions League, boasting star names like Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Robert Lewandowski and World Cup winners Mario Goetze, Manuel Neuer and Thomas Muller. Captain Philippe Lahm is out though with a long-term injury.","Manuel Pellegrini and Pep Guardiola will clash again on Tuesday .

"Tottenham's imminent hiring of Southampton’s head of recruitment Paul Mitchell could hasten the demise of Spurs’s technical director Franco Baldini. But Spurs have been warned that instead of operating a revolving door policy for staff and attempting a ‘short-cut route’ to success by poaching people from better-run clubs, they need a coherent plan, boardroom consistency and to back a single manager long term to achieve the progress their fans crave. Mitchell, 33, a former defender and midfielder at Wigan and MK Dons, has been at St Mary’s since 2012 and is credited with a key role in the scouting and hiring set up that helped Saints emerge from a troubled summer with an upgraded squad and a £37million profit to boot. Tottenham sold Gareth Bale to La Liga giants Real Madrid for £86million in 2013 . Paul Mitchell's task is to overhaul Tottenham's scouting system and have the success he did at Southampton . Tottenham technical director Franco Baldini could be heading for the White Hart Lane exit door . Roberto Soldado Spanish, 29, F, £26.4m . Verdict: Underwhelming. Six goals and six assists in 33 Premier League games is a costly return. Erik Lamela Argentinian, 22, AM, £25.7m . Verdict: Nearly-man. Lavish talent but no goals in 20 PL games. Paulinho Brazilian, 26, M, £17.4m . Verdict: Miss. Far from the best midfielder in north London, let alone Brazil. Etienne Capoue French, 26, M, £9.7m . Verdict: Jury out. Patchy form and injuries have disrupted his season. Christian Eriksen Danish, 22, M, £11.5m . Verdict: Mercurial. Brilliant last season, less so this. 10 PL goals, eight assists. Ben Davies Welsh, 21, D, £10m . Verdict: Miss. One PL game is a poor return. Vlad Chiriches Romanian, 25, D, £8.5m . Verdict: Middling at best. Solid early but unreliable. Federico Fazio Argentinian, 27, D £8m . Verdict: Miss. Error-prone, two red cards already. Nacer Chadli Belgian, 25, AM, £7.2m . Verdict: Hit. Best value of all, PL goals (seven) and assists (four). Eric Dier English, 20, D, £4m . Verdict: Promising. Early goals (two in PL) and shows potential. Ben Stambouli, French, 24, M, £4.7m . Verdict: Miss. Just one sub PL appearance. DeAndre Yedlin (US, 21, £2.5m) & Michel Vorm (Dutch, 31, £5m) Yedlin on loan. Vorm yet to play in PL. Tottenham lured manager Mauricio Pochettino from Southampton in the summer, will add Mitchell when his notice period expires in the new year and have coveted Saints players included Jay Rodriguez and Morgan Schneiderlin. Baldini, 54, has been in his job since summer last year and oversaw player departures including Spurs’ best player and talisman Gareth Bale for a world record £86m. But the jury has been out on many of the 13 faces brought in partly with the cash raised, from Paulinho to Roberto Soldado to Erik Lamela and, more recently, Federico Fazio and Ben Stambouli. ‘Franco is pretty relaxed about the situation but he knows in football that people come and go and that he’ll be moving on at some point, whenever that is,’ said a source. Another insider familiar with the workings at both White Hart Lane and St Mary’s said of Spurs: ‘It doesn’t appear that they have a strategy of any ilk, it seems to be a case of seeing Southampton do things well so let’s take a short cut and hire their people. ‘It will work sometimes and others won’t go near them but ultimately it’s a naive approach. Sustainable success is not about individuals, it’s about a culture.’ Many fans believe Spurs’ managerial merry-go-round has hurt the club, with Pochettino the fifth permanent boss in seven years since Juande Ramos joined in 2007. The turnover of players has exacerbated the situation and Pochettino has been left with a squad that cannot or will not function in the high-tempo pressing system he used to such effect at Southampton. Results have suffered, with Spurs losing three of their last four league games before Sunday's trip to Hull. The home capitulation to Stoke last time out has been described as the worst performance many have seen in a long time. Tottenham fan Martin Cloake,  an author, whose latest book Taking Our Ball Back looks at discontent within the wider game. ‘It’s clear that there has been too much change in personnel recently,’ he says of Spurs’ dilemma. ‘There’s not much sense of team spirit evident when we play and no real leaders stand out. Paulinho and Roberto Soldado are among the players who have failed to impress since joining the club . Tottenham's Harry Kane has said his team-mates need time to adapt to Mauricio Pochettino's style . ‘There are lots of players with potential flair, perhaps fewer of the type who will dig in and help to hold a team together — therefore letting the flair players express themselves. ‘Off the pitch, the phrase ‘I’ve never felt so disconnected from the club I support’ keeps coming up. That’s partly because of the discontent with the top level of football in this country but it’s also because those running the club too often come across as aloof and as treating the fans as cash cows. 'Fixing things on the pitch will take time and the vast majority of fans want Pochettino to be given time. There has been too much chopping, changing and blaming. Off the pitch the club just needs to show goodwill, talk to the fans more, resolve some of the uncertainties around the stadium and generally demonstrate that we’re seen as supporters and not just customers.’ Striker Harry Kane acknowledges a lengthy transition period could lie ahead. ‘We haven’t won as much as we’d have liked.’ he said. ‘But there is a long way to go. We are adapting to the [manager’s] style each game and we are learning. Hopefully we can pick up some momentum and then who knows? ‘[The manager] has come in with his style and it has only been four months. That’s not long when you are changing the way you want to play. We are getting used to it and we will only get better.’ Tottenham go into their fixture against Hull in 12th spot - having started slowly under Pochettino .","Spurs technical director Franco Baldini could be heading for the exit door .

"'I'm coming back in, and it's the saddest moment of my life,' said astronaut Ed White during the Gemini 4 mission on 3 June 1965 as he performed the first American spacewalk. What he was experiencing was a profound sensation shared by all later astronauts of seeing Earth from space - a sense of wonder. But research suggests it might also elicit something known as 'the break-off phenomenon' - a feeling of separation from Earth - and it could be a problem for future astronauts going to Mars. Scroll down for video . Washington-based Nasa and other agencies will have to cope with mental health issues on missions to Mars. Previously high-altitude pilots have reported a sense of isolation from Earth (stock image shown). This same feeling was once thought to be a problem for Martian explorers . The break-off phenomenon is a sensation commonly associated with pilots flying at extremely high altitude. Here, far above the surface of our planet, pilots have reported feeling a sense of detachment from Earth. While for most they say this was a feeling of euphoria or peacefulness, according to the Fast Company more than a third of pilots who reported the break-off phenomenon 'freaked out'. This feeling of isolation and detachment is apparently something that can cause not only a sense of wonder, but also more frightening thoughts. The Unlimited Theatre in West Yorkshire, as part of a Nasa contest, designed a spacesuit that can simulate the feeling of being hugged earlier this year. Their final design, the team says, was to create a suit that was both uniquely useful for astronauts on the ISS but also with applications on Earth. The most interesting innovation was the ‘wearable hug’ feature. A family member on Earth could activate inflatable material in the shoulders of the suit to give the astronaut a simulated hug and let them know they’re being thought of. Although probably no more than a gimmick, the technology highlights an innovative way that a sense of loneliness could be dealt with. And it is these stresses that future astronauts will have to deal with. It is why Nasa has placed such huge importance on keeping the ISS manned since 2000 to test the psychological aspects of space travel. 'There had been a lot of concern early in the manned space program about the break-off phenomenon, the notion that you would feel disconnected from the Earth when you were above it, particularly when you were in orbit,' Dr. Larry Young, Apollo program professor of astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told FastCoExist. In the modern era astronauts spend six months on the station, although they will soon begin year-long missions, and their work loads are carefully managed to stop them getting over-stressed. But this feeling of detachment can be dangerous, and it has let to problems in the past. Nasa had learned the necessity to keep astronauts appeased the hard way during the Skylab 4 mission in late 1973. After feeling overworked and stressed from constant requests by Nasa, the three astronauts on board the Skylab space station reached breaking point and, for a day, turned off all communication with Earth. Instead they spent a relaxing day just watching Earth from orbit. The mutiny was a lesson, and forced space agencies around the world to begin studies into the effects of prolonged isolation. To cope with the problem many psychological experiments have been carried out over the last few decades. These include placing people in isolation to cope with being in isolation for so long during a long mission to Mars (stock image shown) One famous experiment to see how astronauts would cope with a potential 520-day round trip to Mars was conducted by the Mars 500 experiment. This saw six people spend 520 days enclosed in a mock-up spacecraft on Earth, with their conditions and communications simulating what real astronauts might experience on the way to Mars. The experiment was a complete success; few conflicts, if any, were reported by the astronauts, proving that a life in isolation need not be so troublesome. The solution was to provide astronauts with plenty of entertainment, free time and a manageable work load. And one solution for future missions to Mars may be to use a virtual reality. Researchers in the US are hoping to bring Star Trek-style technology to future long-duration space missions in an effort help astronaut's keep their sanity. The 'Virtual Space Station' will act as a source of refuge for astronauts, as well as a computerised therapist that will check on their mental health through a series of programs. Dartmouth College's Digital Arts Leadership and Innovation lab, or Dali, is currently creating the technology for the system with funding from Nasa. The system will use Oculus Rift, the virtual reality headset that Oculus VR is developing, with the addition of sounds and smells that could help change an astronaut's mood. It will 'trick the brain and make people feel as if they are in a variety of beautiful and calm settings, such as with their family at home or strolling on the beach,' Darmouth Professor Lorie Loeb said. This might be imperative for keeping astronauts mentally fit and healthy on a mission to Mars. The ISS has been continuously occupied since 2000 (first crew shown) and since then many of the psychological problems of prolonged space travel have been ironed out . Private company Mars One, who ambitiously plan to land people on Mars next decade, have also noted the need for psychological issues to be addresses in selecting a crew to go to Mars. 'They will be people who have dreamt their whole life of going to Mars, and in many case will have pursued careers that increase the odds of being selected for this kind of mission,' they write on their website. 'The selected team will be very smart, skilled, mentally stable and very healthy. They will go to Mars to live their dream.' Ultimately, further research and experiments will be needed to ensure that the first Martian explorers to not succumb to some of the problems that have plagued earlier pioneers.","Washington-based Nasa and other agencies will have to cope with mental health issues on missions to Mars .

"A nine-year-old boy is in critical condition after he suffered a massive electric shock as he posed for photographs by the swimming pool at his birthday party. Elijah Belden was in his family's backyard in Temecula, California for an early 10th birthday party on Saturday when he touched a metal post near the pool and fell to the ground. His mother Aly rushed to help him but, not realizing that he had been shocked, she was also hit by the current, the Press-Enterprise reported. The boy's baseball coach, who is also a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Department, then rushed over to help and, even though he was shocked, he managed to pull the boy to safety. Scroll down for video . Injured: Elijah Belden, pictured, suffered an electric shock after touching an electrified metal pole outside his family's home on Saturday. He remains in critical condition in hospital . Elijah apparently touched a pole supporting the patio cover that had somehow become electrified. His family believes a string of frayed electric lights on the patio cover could have been responsible. Belden's father Tony, 41, said he was in the house when he heard his wife screaming. 'She thought he was dead,' Belden told the Press-Enterprise. 'I heard, ""Elijah's down."" Hearing that, I was so disconcerted... I couldn't even figure out how to dial 911.' But his son was eventually rushed to a local hospital, where his body temperature was cooled, and the next morning, he was transported to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. Support: His family shared an image on Facebook showing him in the hospital, where he remains in a medically-induced coma. Doctors found he has not suffered any damage to his brain of heart . Support: His mother Aly tried to help him but also suffered a shock while her husband heard their screams . A Facebook page updating friends on his health noted that he was in a medically-induced coma and remained in critical condition. The page, 'Pray for Elijah Belden', said that tests on Monday found that he had not suffered any damage to his brain of heart, while his lungs are also showing signs of improvement. 'All signs are leading in the right direction,' the family wrote on Facebook. 'The doctor said he is hopeful that within the next 5-6 days we will be able to have conversation with him.' While also updating friends on his condition, the relatives running the page asked for people to share photos of Elijah and to wear pink in support of the boy. Scene: The youngster was playing near the family's pool (pictured center) when he posed with a friend for a photograph and suffered the electric shock. He fell to the ground but was eventually pulled to safety . They hope that when he wakes up, he will see just how many people he has touched. The boy turns 10 on October 13 but his family held the party last weekend so that the weather was still warm enough for his friends to use the swimming pool. His mother and the baseball coach were not seriously injured.

"The reason why water feels wet to humans is more complicated than you might think. Although we come into contact with it on an almost daily basis, our skin does not actually have receptors that sense wetness. This puzzled scientists as to why we can ‘feel’ water but now they say it is due to us measuring temperature and texture changes when we come into contact with it. Scientists from Loughborough University studied why we feel wetness (stock image shown). They found that while we don't have 'wet receptors' our brains know what water should feel like based on its temperature and texture, and we can more easily perceive wetness if water is colder . The research was carried out by Loughborough University and Oxylane Research in France. In the experiment 13 male volunteers were exposed to cold (25°C/77°F), medium (30°C/86°F) and warm (35°C/95°F) water. They were then asked to report the level of wetness they felt, while a blood pressure pump was also used as a nerve block in some experiments. Water filling the Earth's oceans is older than the formation of the sun, increasing the chances of life emerging among the stars, scientists have revealed. The discovery suggests that water may be a common ingredient in the clouds of dust and gas from which solar systems are born, and not 'special' to our own. This has major implications for the likelihood of life being found on exoplanets orbiting stars beyond the sun, according to researchers. Lead author Ilsedore Cleeves, from the University of Michigen, said: ''If our solar system's formation was typical, this implies that water is a common ingredient during the formation of all planetary systems.' Each participant was tested on the hairy skin on their forearms and the bare skin on their fingertips. The researchers found they could more easily perceive wetness the colder the temperature was. And they also found the volunteers were less sensitive when their nerves were blocked by the blood pressure bump. In addition hairier skin was more sensitive than bare skin. The researchers suggest that our concept of wetness is actually a ‘perceptual illusion’, and that our brain evokes a response based on prior knowledge. What we feel when we are wet is partially just what we think we should feel, based on the temperature difference of the water and its texture. ‘This model supports the hypothesis that the brain infers about the perception of wetness in a rational fashion,’ the researchers conclude.

"Nik Wallenda may have completed an incomprehensible feat by calmly staying on a tightrope between Chicago skyscrapers last night - but it appears that his ratings took a tumble. The daredevil's successful walks on Sunday were watched by an average of 5.8 million Discovery Channel viewers  - compared to 8.5 million people who watched him cross the Grand Canyon in 2013. On Sunday night, the average peaked at 6.7 million people who tuned in to watch him walk the tightrope while wearing a blindfold - but that fell far short of the peak of 13 million viewers last year. Last year's stunt shattered records across social media platforms as Wallenda's walk generated 1.3 million tweets - making it the top social show in the U.S., Deadline reported. Crowd pleaser: Nik Wallenda is pictured as he crosses a tightrope between two Chicago skyscrapers on Sunday evening. Around 6.7 million people tuned in to watch this part of his stunt . Astonishing: Wallenda is pictured making his tightrope walk uphill at a 19-degree angle from the Marina City west tower across the Chicago River to the top of the Leo Burnett Building on Sunday evening . Sunday's feat was broadcast on a ten-second delay on the Discovery Channel in case Wallenda, who was not wearing a safety harness, fell from the rope - giving the network a chance to cut away. Entertainment Weekly pointed out that November is a more competitive time of the year for ratings compared to June, when he walked across the Grand Canyon. The city said that about 65,000 people watched Sunday night's event in person - as Wallenda broke Guinness World Records for the highest inclined tightrope walk and the highest blindfolded walk. The first wire was suspended more than 500ft above the Chicago River at a 19-degree incline; it was supposed to be suspended at 15 degrees, but a last-minute change made for a steeper challenge. The 35-year-old completed it in six minutes and 52 seconds. He had planned to take a selfie halfway along the rope but decided the winds were too high to attempt it. Second, he donned a blindfold for a shorter walk between two skyscrapers and completed it in one minute, 17 seconds. Before the walk, he said it was going to be the toughest challenge of his career. Popular: Wallenda had an average peak of 13 million viewers as he crossed the Grand Canyon last year . Crowds: The city of Chicago said that about 65,000 people watched Sunday night's event in person . If he slipped, Wallenda intended to grab the wire as he fell, at which point rescuers would be able to slide down the wire to catch him. He said that he would be able to cling on to the wire for as long as 30 minutes waiting for rescue - but luckily, there was no need. His next televised stunt will come next July when he is aiming to retrace the steps of his great-grandfather, Karl Wallenda, and cross Georgia's Tallulah Gorge. He hopes to walk the rope at the same time footage of his great-grandfather plays - but he has yet to master the two headstands the older man completed on the rope in July 1970.","The daredevil, 35, walked a steep tightrope between two Chicago skyscrapers on Sunday and then crossed to another wearing a blindfold .

"A beloved Aspen socialite who was murdered in her chalet last week was previously engaged to actor Michael Douglas, it has emerged. Nancy Pfister, 57, was found dead in a cupboard in her home on February 26, . just four days after she was forced to return from an extended trip to Australia . following trouble with her tenants. On Monday, William Francis Styler II, 65, and his wife Nancy, 62, who had rented Pfister's property while she was abroad, were arrested on suspicion of her murder and appeared in court on Tuesday. The murder - the first in Pitkin County, Colorado in more than a decade - has rocked the small ski resort town, where residents said Pfister had been a popular, well-connected resident. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Socialite Nancy Pfister, left, was found killed in her Aspen chalet last week. It has emerged that she was previously engaged to actor Michael Douglas, pictured right in Aspen in 1990 . 'She'd been one of the golden girls of Aspen, seriously into the party scene [in her youth],' a source told Page Six. 'She hung out with the Kennedys, Jack Nicholson, Cher, Michael Douglas.' The source added that Pfister was even once briefly engaged to Douglas. The revelations come as Pfister's daughter said she refuses to accept her mother could have been killed over a tenant dispute - and apparently further evidence that the couple had money troubles. Ahead of her return from Aspen, Pfister had written on Facebook: 'I'd like to stay in Australia but the . people that were supposedly taking care of my house are not doing what . they said they would do and they're not paying rent and they haven't . paid utilities.' Her daughter Juliana asked: 'How could someone just be so angry that they got kicked out of a house? There’s got to be something more. It's hard to understand that', ABC News reported. Arrest: Former tenants William Styler III, left, and his wife Nancy Styler, right, are accused of killing her . In court: Nancy Styler is escorted by two deputies to Pitkin County Courthouse during her first appearance earlier this month . Locked up: Styler - who had been suffering various illnesses before his arrest -and his wife are being held without bond . Styler, a former physician, was taken by wheelchair to a bond hearing before a Pitkin County District Court judge on Tuesday. His wife, who displayed manicured nails, was also present. Juliana Pfister sat behind the suspects during the hearing, where the judge ordered the couple to be held without bond for the time being, ABC reported. 'Former flame': Douglas was reportedly engaged to Pfister, who was well-connected in Aspen . As the couple apparently fell behind on rent payments last year, court documents show Styler was battling to collect a debt of $800,00 from a lawyer he accused of overcharging him. In 2003, Styler had taken his previous company, Colorado Anesthesia Consultants, to court in a dispute over software Styler had co-created, but he lost the case. He accused his lawyer John Powell for overcharging him for legal services for the case - and in 2010, Styler sued Powell for the debt, the Aspen Times reported. But Powell - who was put on probation for overcharging Styler and another client - filed for bankruptcy, protecting him from having to pay the debt. The report in the Aspen Times says that the scandal led Styler to express suicidal thoughts, including telling an attorney that he wanted to commit 'suicide by cop'. As recently as November last year, William Styler had written to the court’s Attorney Regulation Counsel about his frustrations in collecting money from the lawyer - the same time he was renting the property from Pfister. Their couple, who both face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, will next appear in court on March 17. At a news conference following the couple's arrests on Monday, Sheriff Joe DiSalvo declined to identify how Pfister was killed and would not say what evidence had led them to arrest the couple. He added that the investigation is ongoing and that authorities have not yet ruled out the possibility of more arrests, the Aspen Times reported. Missed: Pfister, pictured with her daughter, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent or bills . Heartbroken: Pfister's daughter Juliana said that had to be something more to her mother's death . The autopsy report is not complete and all records in the . case have been sealed. Nancy Pfister's death is the first known homicide in Pitkin County since October 2001. 'This case has been hard from the . beginning on all of us, because of the nature of it,' the sheriff said. 'First-degree murders don’t happen here too often. That’s good. When . they do, we take it very seriously, and we storm it. We throw everything . we've got at it.' Her daughter Juliana added that her mother had been a beloved member of the community. 'I have no idea how someone could do something like that and especially to her and I think that, you know, my mom could never hurt anything or hurt anyone and that is one thing that everyone that knew her knew,' Pfister said. 'She cared about a lot of people and helped the wrong people this time.' Sheriff DiSalvo: 'I loved Nancy - she was a good person.' 'Friendly': Styler is seen left (with a friend) at a party Pfister threw in Nover before she went abroad . Arrest: Styler, a physician, was still in his bathrobe when he was arrested at his Colorado motel room . Caught: The couple were arrested five days after their alleged victim's body was found . Scene: Pfister was found dead in her home, pictured, which she had rented to the Stylers while she traveled . The Aspen Times reported that Pfister was the daughter of Art and Betty Pfister, a prominent local couple who played a major role in the development of the ski resorts. Both preceded their daughter in death. The Stylers, who are believed to have one adult son, were first questioned by investigators the day after Pfister's body was found and on Monday they were taken to the Pitkin County Jail. Public records show that Mr Styler is a physician who graduated from the Oklahoma State University College Of Osteopathic Medicine in 1979, but his credentials expired in 2005. See below for video .

"Married father-of-three Jeffrey Burnham, 42, was sentenced on Wednesday to 18 months in prison at court in Portland, Maine . A former TD Bank executive who used a company credit card to buy $240,000 in Champagne and lap dances at strip clubs to ease his stress from work has been sentenced to 18 months in prison. Jeffrey Burnham, 42, of Arundle, Maine, had pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Portland to a felony charge of theft by a bank officer. He used the credit card to buy $1,000 bottles of Champagne and $750 lap dances. Married father-of-three Burnham was also sentenced on Wednesday to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay back $240,514.54. According to court documents, Burnham used the card 72 times at strip clubs in Maine, Massachusetts, New York and Florida from February 2011 until February 2012, when he left the company. Burnham was a vice president and regional mortgage sales manager in the bank's Falmouth office at the time, reports The Portland Press Herald. Burnham claimed the spending was a way to cope with the stress of his job, which included having to fire subordinates who did not meet sales goals. His attorney had asked that he be sentenced to house arrest so he could continue being the primary care provider for his three young children while his wife works. Judge George Singal questioned Burnham’s remorse, noting that even after TD Bank had confronted Burnham about personal use of the credit card and after he had been notified he was the target of an FBI probe and likely prosecution, Burnham still spent thousands on the credit card from his new employer at strip clubs. Jeffrey Burnham pictured leaving Federal Court in May along with his lawyers and family . Burnham said he kept the impending investigation secret from his family and did not confide in anyone. He said that final month of his life prior to his initial scheduled appearance in federal court was a 'blur' and he remembers little about it. He said that on the day he was first supposed to report to court a year ago, he tried to take his own life but that he has been undergoing therapy consistently since then. Burnham left TD in February 2012 after 14 years with the bank and went to work for Kennebunk Savings Bank, where he was promoted to senior vice president of retail banking last year. Gentleman's club: An FBI affidavit states that Burnham spent $35,000 at Centerfolds club in Boston and another venue in Portland in less than one month . A press release announcing Burham’s career move described him as a graduate of the University of Maine at Farmington who served on the Arundel Recreation and Economic Development committees. According to an affidavit written by FBI agent Paul Pritchard, the former banker used his TD-issued credit card to charge nearly $11,000 on December 2, 2011, at a company that operates Centerfolds strip club in Boston. His other adult entertainment venue of choice was PT's Show club in Portland, stated the affidavit. He allegedly spent $35,000 at Centerfolds and PT's club in less than a month. Burnham's alleged financial malfeasance was uncovered in February 2012 – shortly after his departure from TD - when another bank employee opened his corporate credit card statement and noticed several suspicious charges. When confronted about the expenses by TD investigators, he admitted to misappropriating corporate funds. In March 2013, Burnham was questioned by FBI about his use of the corporate credit card, at which time he once again confessed to wrongdoing. Hotspot: PT's Show club in Portland was one of the many venues where Burnham had allegedly spent company funds .","Married father-of-three Jeffrey Burnham, 42, was sentenced on Wednesday to 18 months in prison in Portland, Maine .

"The son of an Ohio police officer who vanished nine years ago has been found dead in a car pulled from a pond this week. The coroner's office in Franklin County confirmed the body found in the submerged car was that of Anthony 'Tony' Luzio Jr., Delaware County sheriff's spokeswoman Tracy Whited said. The 25-year-old Luzio disappeared on July 4, 2005, after leaving an Independence Day party. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Found: The dead body of Anthony Luzio Jr. was discovered in a car pulled from a pond nine years after he went missing from a Fourth of July party . The pond: Investigators used geographic-information-systems technology to search for bodies of water that back in 2005 would have had no obstacles like trees or fences around them like this Ohio pond . The discovery: Search Crews discover Anthony Luzio Jr.'s body nine years after he disappeared . Closure: Anthony Luzio Jr.'s family has some closure now that their son's remains and his car were found submerged beneath the waters of an Ohio pond . Luzio was the son of retired Columbus Police Sgt Anthony Luzio Sr. His family's years of hoping, waiting and wondering ended Tuesday, when the car he'd driven was pulled from the central Ohio pond. Luzio's father told The Columbus Dispatch the discovery was bittersweet. He said the family always had a bit of hope of finding Luzio but now can put him to rest. 'After 9 1/2 years to prepare for this, we thought we would be ready for the inevitable. But it hurts as bad as if it happened yesterday,' said Anthony Luzio Sr., a retired Columbus police sergeant. The pond was searched after police officers identified bodies of water big enough for a car to go into around where Luzio Jr. was last seen. A search company that relies largely on donations found the car using a small boat equipped with sonar. It located the car within minutes of launching the boat . A fire department diver then went into the water to confirm it was Luzio's car. The Clothing matched what Luzio was seen last wearing and his driver's license was inside the car. Members of the dive team sent their condolences to the Luzio family and told WCMH-TV in Columbus they hoped the discovery of the car and Luzio's body would bring some closure. The car was towed to the sheriff's office to be examined. Long search: Investigators searched twelve ponds using the sonar-equipped boat before they found the car at around 4:30 p.m. in the thirteenth body of water . Team effort: Several agencies  used geographic-information-systems technology to search for bodies of water that back in 2005 would have had no obstacles like trees or fences around them . Desperately searched: Anthony J. Luzio Jr.'s family's years of hoping, waiting and wondering ended Tuesday, when the car he'd driven was pulled from the central Ohio pond . Mystery: How Anthony J. Luzio Jr. ended up in the pond remains a mystery and police say they aren't jumping to speculate nine years after his tragic disappearance . The Columbus Dispatch reports that investigators from numerous agencies searched long and hard for the missing Luzio and enlisted the help of both the sheriff's office and the Powell Police Department to search through the county's 1,000 bodies of water. Dennis and Tammy Watters who own Team Watters Sonar Search and Recovery in Moro, Illinois travelled to Delaware County eight times over the past year to help search for Luzio and in that time became close to Luzio's parents Carla and Anthony Sr. The heartbroken parents along with the Watterses looked for ponds that could hide a car and be driven into from a road. They used geographic-information-systems technology to search for bodies of water that back in 2005 would have had no obstacles like trees or fences around them. 'We believe he drove off the roadway for whatever reason,' Capt. Kevin Savage of the sheriff's office said. Close family: Anthony J. Luzio Jr.  was the son of retired Columbus Police Sgt Anthony Luzio Sr. with whom he had a strong family bond . 'When you never have a person or a vehicle show up, in our mind, that vehicle has to be hidden somewhere.' In the spring of this year, investigators searched 300 bodies of water all within a 3-mile radius of the home where Luzio was last spotted. 'We were prepared to search every pond in Delaware County,' Savage said. They looked at water near Old State Road because a friend of Luzio's lived nearby. They searched twelve ponds using the Watterses' sonar-eqipped boat before they found the car at around 4:30 p.m. 'We always knew it was a solvable case,' Mr. Watters told the Dispatch. Even though they found Luzio body and his car, Investigators said they aren't trying to speculate about what happened on the night that he went missing. The investigation spanned for 9 1/2 years and Martin Watters says there's no rush to figure out what happened. 'It would be premature and presumptuous on my part to speculate what happened that night,' the sheriff said. Devastated: Anthony J. Luzio Jr.'s parents are happy their son was found but they said that discovering him dead only gives so much closure as though it 'feels as though it happened yesterday'","The coroner's office in Franklin County confirmed the body found in the submerged car was that of Anthony 'Tony' Luzio Jr.

"Mary Kidson, who was cleared by a court but is still separated from her daughter . When British mother Mary Kidson took her seriously ill daughter to a world-renowned doctor in Belgium in the hope of finding a cure, she could never have imagined the extraordinary events that were to follow. When she returned to the UK, Ms Kidson, an expert in the field of special educational needs, was astounded to find herself imprisoned and prosecuted – accused of trying to poison her daughter. Then, to her horror, the child was taken from her and was subsequently placed in psychiatric care. Now Ms Kidson is free again, following the collapse of the case against her at Worcester Crown Court last week, and is relieved to have her name cleared. But, speaking for the first time about her ordeal, the 55-year-old says she is furious that charges were brought in the first place, and devastated she has yet to be reunited with her 16-year-old daughter. In particular she blames the NHS for operating rigid rules about treatment that allowed the prosecution to take place – but also her former husband, Michael Guilding, who she believes needlessly reported her to the police. ‘It’s unbelievable what I’ve been through,’ she says of a case that has echoes of Ashya King, whose parents fled abroad to seek proton treatment for his cancer and ended up in prison in Spain. ‘I am very angry and fed up as I was completely misrepresented prior to my acquittal. ‘I am just so relieved. This case came about because I am a caring mother and was only acting in my daughter’s interest. I’m now looking forward to being reunited with her. ‘All of the allegations against me were wrong. I know my ex-husband was behind it all. I’m in no doubt. He was very upset about our divorce, which he didn’t want, and unhappy that the children went with me. The prosecuting team were very careful to keep him out of it during the court hearing. ‘I have been through a huge ordeal. As things become clear I will make decisions about whether I am going to sue anyone. ‘I tried to make the best of it in prison, and I was treated well, but my life will never be the same again. ‘I hope I will become a stronger person as a result of what I’ve been put through. ‘When I was told I was free this week, well, it’s indescribable what I felt. I was elated, relieved, and very, very thankful that justice has at last been done.’ The Brussels hospital where Dr Hertoghe diagnosed the girl with hormone deficiency, and prescribed medication . Ms Kidson’s barrister, Ken Hind, says that her complaints against her husband were part of her evidence, but were never heard in court as the case against her collapsed. During the court case Ms Kidson, from Ledbury in Herefordshire, was accused of dosing her daughter with unnecessary medicines and of ‘doctor shopping’. This, it was alleged, involved touring hospitals and clinics in Britain and then abroad, until she received a diagnosis for her daughter – hormone deficiency – that she found acceptable, but which the NHS did not recognise. In 2012, desperate for help, she travelled with her daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, to the Brussels clinic of Dr Thierry Hertoghe, a Belgian physician and expert in hormone therapy. She believes that, as a result of the deficiency, the girl was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome that had left her virtually bed-ridden. The prosecution claimed that once under Dr Hertoghe’s supervision, Ms Kidson administered toxic levels of three hormones in a five-month period. Belgian doctor Thierry Hertoghe, left, who says that the NHS system needs to reform. The prosecution claimed the girl was given 'toxic' levels of medicines including hydrocortisone, right . But according to the Belgian doctor, the girl’s ailments improved. Taking up the story, Ms Kidson’s sister, Ruth Stobbs, says: ‘Mary thought that Dr Hertoghe was absolutely fantastic. ‘He measured my niece’s thyroid, oestrogen, growth hormone and cortisol and found her to be deficient in all of these, so he prescribed medication to correct the deficiencies.’ But, it seems, when Ms Kidson’s ex-husband found out about the treatment, he contacted police, two months later. In March 2013, police arrived at Ms Kidson’s home with social services and arrested her. Ms Stobbs continues: ‘I took a phone call at work from Mary who said simply, “I’ve been arrested.” ‘At first I thought it was some sort of joke. There was silence down the line. “Seriously. I’ve been arrested. For child cruelty”, Mary said.’ After 24 hours in custody, Ms Kidson was released on bail. The prosecution claimed that once under Dr Hertoghe’s supervision, Ms Kidson administered toxic levels of three hormones in a five-month period . Ms Stobbs adds: ‘The judge also ordered that my niece go back to school. She had been home-educated from age ten. Suddenly facing a return to school, without her mother around to support her, was too much for her. She hated it.’ The judge also ordered her to live with her father, and she ran away twice. One afternoon early this year, she locked herself in her father’s bathroom and in a highly emotional state she sent a text to her mother. Mary, who was worried her daughter was going to harm herself, texted back, which breached her bail. Michael phoned the police and Mary was arrested again and taken into custody, and then to Eastwood Park prison near Bristol. ‘Her ex-husband told police and social services that Mary would try to take their daughter out of the country, and we think this is why they have acted as they have,’ says Ms Stobbs. ‘Mary is a responsible person and she would never, ever have done that.’ Ms Kidson has been apart from her daughter since March 2013. In January this year she was charged under the 1861 Offences Against The Person Act with poisoning her daughter with thyroid extract, oestrogen and hydrocortisone. She was then allowed only two hours supervised contact each fortnight. Her daughter became so distressed that she suffered a breakdown after the pair were separated, and was detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act. ‘My daughter is on other medicine now but she does appear to be fit and well, which is great,’ Ms Kidson says. ‘She is on the verge of discharge but I still don’t know when I can see her. ‘I’m very angry with the way the Crown Prosecution Service, social services and the police all dealt with this. They formed an opinion of me without even meeting me. ‘The whole case raises the question of a parent’s right to find treatment outside the NHS for their child. Adults have total freedom to go wherever we want in the world for our health care but if you’re a child it seems only the NHS can treat you.’ Supporting Ms Kidson, Dr Hertoghe says that her trial ‘should never have taken place’ and called for widespread NHS reform to allow parents greater choice over their child’s care. ‘Two lives have been broken,’ he says. ‘The whole system needs reform. We have to give people the right to choose their doctor without fear of prosecution.’","Mary Kidson took seriously ill daughter to a world-renowned Belgian doctor .

"A rifle used in the 1966 sniper rampage at the University of Texas that left 16 people dead and dozens more wounded is being sold in an online auction. Bids are starting at $25,000 for a rifle Charles Whitman used to shoot from the top of a clock tower on the campus in Austin. Donald Weiss of Dallas said in a telephone interview Thursday with the Associated Press that he's helping the owner of the Remington 700 sell the weapon, which has changed ownership several times over the decades. Bids are being accepted on the website of Texas Gun Trader. Weapon: Bids are starting at $25,000 for a rifle Charles Whitman used to shoot from the top of a clock tower in the 1966 University of Texas shooting . Auction: Donald Weiss, who is helping the gun's owner with the auction, says it 'is strictly for collectors, for its historic value' The listing for the weapon says it is a 'Once in a lifetime opportunity to purchase the UT Austin Sniper Rifle once owned and used by Charles Whitman during the UT sniper shootings in 1966.' The rifle was listed in a probate court inventory in Travis County, according to a copy of the 1967 document shared with AP. The executor of Whitman's estate sold the weapon and six others recovered from Whitman's arsenal at the tower to a Wichita Falls gun dealer, according to Weiss. 'The deal in Texas is, no matter what's happened or how many people were shot, this is private property,' Weiss said. He declined to reveal the owner's identity. Weiss told The Houston Chronicle 'There is a pending offer on the rifle of over $25,000 right now.' Whitman, 25, was a Texas student and former Marine when he opened fire just before noon on Aug. 1, 1966. Police who made their way to the tower's observation deck shot and killed Whitman after the sharp shooter spent more than an hour firing on people with terrifying accuracy — hitting people as far as 500 yards away. More than three decades later, a 17th death would be attributed to Whitman in 2001 when a Fort Worth man died of injuries from the shooting. Authorities later determined Whitman also killed his wife and mother in the hours before he went to the tower. 'The value of the weapons is enhanced because of its past, but I wonder why a weapon like this is not in a museum,' Andy Kahan, who works as Houston's Victim's Advocate, told The Houston Chronicle. Shooter: Charles Whitman's rampage 16 people dead and dozens more wounded (file photo) Mary Jane Flowers' brother and aunt were killed in the tower shooting, and her mother was left a paraplegic. Flowers, who lives in West Memphis, Arkansas, was 'shocked' to learn of the sale. 'I can't imagine who would want that or who would do that,' she said in an AP telephone interview. It was the deadliest U.S. campus shooting by a single gunman until 2007, when a student at Virginia Tech shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17 more. 'We're not capitalizing on the horrific part,' Weiss said. 'This is strictly for collectors, for its historic value.'

"A girl of 13 who frequently went missing from her care home with men was considered by police to be making a ‘lifestyle choice’, a damning report has found. The case is one of a string of ‘unacceptable’ failures by West Midlands Police in protecting children at risk of sexual exploitation. The seriousness of the girl’s case was dismissed even though it was clear from police systems that she was being, or was at high-risk of being, sexually exploited, according to the report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary. HM Inspector of Constabulary Dru Sharpling (pictured left) and West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable Carl Foulkes (right) It said: ‘Staff need to understand that children do not make a “lifestyle choice” to be abused, particularly those who are more vulnerable because of the neglect they have already suffered in their life.’ The report said the police force needed to take ‘immediate action’ after finding the attitudes of some officers towards victims of exploitation were unacceptable. HMIC assessed 115 cases involving children during an inspection in June and found the responses by the force to 42 per cent were ‘inadequate’. In one case, information was sent to the force’s intelligence unit about groups or gangs of men who may have been raping younger girls but no follow-up action took place, HMIC reported. It found sexual abuse cases faced ‘unnecessary and long delays’ and officers blamed ‘high workloads’ for failing to carry out necessary checks. For instance, one 11-year-old girl who received texts of a sexual nature from a man was ignored by police for two months. One 15-year-old girl left a care home in her pyjamas and got into a car with a man but no checks were made when she returned the next morning at 6am. Nine out of 11 cases involving children missing from home were not handled properly, while some officers were 'frustrated' by care homes reporting youngsters as missing because they were passing responsibility to police, the watchdog said. In one child sex exploitation case, information was sent to the force's intelligence unit about men who may have been raping younger girls but no follow-up action took place, HMIC said. Inspectors found cases where 'vital information' had not been recorded including one of children found 'living in chaos' because of their parents' criminality and another involving the sexual exploitation of a 13-year-old girl. They also raised concerns about delays in the arrests of offenders, and found officers had closed cases without sufficient consideration of the risk posed to other potential victims, the report found. West Midlands Police (pictured) have been criticised for the way they deal with cases of vulnerable children . In 13 of 18 assessed cases involving child sexual exploitation, inspectors found 'poor risk management of known suspects, significant delays in arrest and a failure to identify suspects', according to the report. Inspectors also found 'indications of a wider network of men offending in groups and gangs' that had not been identified and were therefore not followed up, HMIC said. The watchdog said only six out of 15 cases of children held in police custody were handled adequately, and some custody staff 'lacked awareness and knowledge about child protection'. In one case, a 13-year-old girl in custody told a nurse that she had a history of mental health issues, but this did not trigger a review of her risk assessment, the report found. The report concluded: 'Overall, the force's response to tackling child sexual exploitation has been slow, with inconsistent practice across the force area. There was a general lack of understanding of the extent of exploitation. 'Some of the attitudes officers held towards potential victims of child sexual exploitation or children who ran away were unacceptable and resulted in poor decision making. 'Staff need to understand that children do not make a 'lifestyle choice' to be abused, particularly those who are more vulnerable because of the neglect they have already suffered in their life. 'We recommend that West Midlands Police takes immediate action to review its plans for identifying, disrupting and prosecuting perpetrators involved in child sexual exploitation.' HM Inspector of Constabulary Dru Sharpling added: 'The force needs to improve both its approach to the more complex child protection cases and a better understanding of the extent of child sexual exploitation in the West Midlands. 'I would like to encourage West Midlands Police to address our concerns immediately, and have asked that within six weeks it provides us with an action plan to demonstrate how it will act upon these recommendations.' West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said: 'I want West Midlands Police to be the best in country - dealing with vulnerable children with professionalism and compassion. Norman Baker, minister for crime prevention, and shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper have both expressed their concern following the publication of the damning HMIC report into West Midlands Police . 'Our Public Protection Unit has been doubled in strength to some 800 officers and staff. That means around 10 per cent of the entire force are engaged in the fight. That displays our level of commitment. 'It's unfortunate that the HMIC inspection came just two days into new arrangements so do not reflect our exciting changes as there was so little time for them to be place. 'We cannot do it alone. We must work hand in hand with our partners, especially the local authorities. Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: 'I am very concerned by the contents of this HMIC report. The safety of our children, and the elimination of child abuse, are top priorities for this department and the coalition as a whole. 'That is why the Home Secretary has announced an independent inquiry into child sexual abuse within public bodies and non-state institutions. 'She is also leading cross-government work to learn the lessons of past failures and has written to all chief constables stressing the highest standards must be met in tackling child sexual exploitation. 'West Midlands Police must take urgent action to consider all the recommendations in this report and ensure that improvements are made.' Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper MP said: 'Everywhere across the country, not enough is being done to protect children from abuse. 'This HMIC report shows the West Midlands police leadership have made this a priority, but there are still serious problems over the extent of abuse, understanding of the problem and lack of other specialist support. 'And it shows there is a growing problem in the West Midlands and everywhere else about online child abuse which the police are struggling to investigate.'","West Midlands Police need to take 'immediate action' after some officers' attitudes towards child sex victims were found to be 'unacceptable'

"A writer in San Francisco is blasting the 'sexism' of the tech industry after one jaw-dropping moment when a start-up founder gifted her a highly-inappropriate basket of gifts hoping to 'get her attention.' Tech writer Kristen V. Brown, of the San Francisco Chronicle, says she recently received a pitch by Blake Francis, of the questions-and-answers app Need, that came with a basket of swag. Inside: a Magic Wand vibrator, a tube of K-Y Jelly, raw oysters and Espolón Tequila. Tech reporter Kristen V. Brown, of the San Francisco Chronicle, says Need app founder Blake Francis recently gave her a bizarre basket of swag during a pitch for coverage . Francis says he's sent similar baskets to both male and female journalists and that his company was simply trying to 'stand out,' according to Brown . Francis told Brown he 'wanted to get [her] attention' after she didn't reply to his emails. His plan worked — but not in a good way. 'I wondered whether the point of the gift had more to do with my gender than his company,' she wrote on a Friday column for the Chronicle. 'It seemed as though Blake Francis, the founder, was addressing me as a woman, but not a journalist. 'What’s more, the vibrator seemed to say that my sexuality was for some reason on display.' Brown says she emailed Francis for an explanation, but he didn't seem to quite get it. 'At first he was defensive,' she wrote. 'He said he was sorry I felt uncomfortable with his choice of swag, but also appeared genuinely surprised at my discomfort. 'He didn’t want to offend me, but also didn’t understand why I would be offended in the first place. Francis didn’t seem to grasp that sex — or a woman’s sexuality — isn’t a topic appropriate for a professional setting.' The tech writer says Francis explained all the products had been recommended on his app, Need, and that each of the gifts came with a screenshot showing in what context the product had been mentioned. Brown says Francis' basket included a Magic Wand vibrator (stock image) The tech founder also included K-Y brand lubricant and a bottle of tequila (neither pictured), Brown says . Francis said he'd sent the same items to both male and female journalists, according to Brown. But, the writer, pointed out, 'people in the Need community have also recommended solar phone chargers and stores for buying high-quality letter paper, as well as doled out advice for first date spots in Berkeley.' Francis said his company picked the items that would 'stand out,' Brown says. 'In retrospect we did not use good judgment,' he told her, according to the Chronicle . Brown says what happened to her is an example of a rampant misogyny that permeates the tech industry . Brown says that the incident is an example of how 'misogyny is a tech industry institution that has yet to be disrupted.' 'I rarely meet a woman in tech who does not have a similar story to share, be it of the venture capitalist who hit on her, the co-worker who makes too many sexual jokes or the boss who doesn’t invite the women on the team to big meetings,' she wrote. 'Sometimes the sexism is overt, but more often it seems unintentional — the byproduct of an industry where subtle sexism is so entrenched in the culture that it is unrecognized as sexism in the first place.' MailOnline could not reach Francis for comment on Sunday.","Tech reporter Kristen V.

"The man behind a grotesque animal slaughter porn site that was shut down by police earlier this year is a Miami fishing captain from a prominent South Florida family. Authorities say Adam Redford, 57, ran several fetish porn websites and paid women as little as $200 to strip naked and kill and torture rabbits, chickens, rats, pigs, goats and fish. However, before Redford became 'Captain Codpiece' and descended into the dark world of animal 'crush porn,' he grew up in a prominent family, the Miami Herald reports. Redford acknowledged to the Herald that he had founded the porn websites, but said he worked to ensure all animals were killed humanely and claimed that they were used for food after they were slaughtered. Redford's mother Polly Redford is the daughter of Laurens Hammond - the wealthy inventor of the Hammond electric organ. She was a well-known conservationist and author who fought to protect the beaches and waters in South Florida. She loved animals so much that she adopted a raccoon and wrote a book about the creatures. Son of a prominent family: Jim Redford, 57, is the son of a former Dade County Commissioner and the wealthy heir to the Hammond electric organs fortune . Redford was a fishing guide and a commercial diver before his descent into brutal animal crush porn . Before Redford began filming hardcore pornography and horrific animal snuff porn, he produced PG-rated calendars of bikini babes holding trophy fish . His father, Jim Redford, owned a Burger King franchise and served as a Dade County Commissioner for 14 years. He was also an avid fisherman and known for his work to preserve South Florida waterways. In April, police arrested fetish models Sara Zamora, 28, and Stephanie Hird, 29, and charged Redford with animal cruelty in connection with the sites. However, prosecutors were later forced to drop all charges because the videos were filmed more than ten years ago and the statue of limitations had expired. After growing up in a wealthy family, Redford became a commercial diver. He then became a fishing guide in the waters off the Everglades. 'He wasn’t making a lot of money doing that, so he went to the porn stuff,' fellow guide Captain Mark 'The Shark' Quartiano told the Herald. Redford started out tame - shooting pictures of bikini models holding big fish. In 2002, he produced a calendar that he sold for $15 on sexyoutdoorsports.com. He also offered coffee mugs, t-shirts and mouse pads with the pictures. Redford's videos featured horrific scene of animal slaughter and abuse. This scene, one of his least horrifying, features two women in heels kicking around a lobster and stepping on it . Angler's fantasy: Redford will not face charges for the videos, though he says he has stopped filming after the police investigation. Redford was never accused of wrongdoing over his trophy fish calendars . In April, police arrested fetish models Sara Zamora, 28, (right) and Stephanie Hird, 29, (left) for their performances on Redford's sites. All charges were later dropped . Later, he filmed a video called 'Have Rod, Will Travel' in which he played 'Captain Codpiece.' The VHS featured footage of topless women fishing. By 2007, he branched out into hardcore porn and then into darker, 'crush porn.' For $19.99 users could subscribe to SOS Barn, Great Outdoor Sex and Girls Gone Fishing. The videos of amateurish, clearly shot with a handheld camcorder. Zamora, who cooperated with authorities after her arrest, says she was paid as little as $200 to slaughter chickens and perform sex acts when she was just 18 and 19 years old. She said Redford directed each model and told them how to hold the animals and how and when to slaughter them. One of the least violent scenes from Redford's videos shows a bikini model shooting a dead a goat in a field before stripping off over the animal's dead remains . 'It’s humiliation, that’s the name of the game. These guys pretend to be helpless, they pretend to be a helpless animal,' she said in a police deposition. Redford even collected cash from viewers to make custom videos where the models would recite lines and perform specific torture on animals, the Herald reports. Videos show women stapling a rat to a board, hacking at chickens to had been tied up, slicing the heads off baby goats with dull knives, repeatedly stabbing fish. Zamora said Redford asked her to run over rabbits with a car. 'There is one instance where a female holding two rabbits upside down by their hind legs violently chops at the back of their necks as the animals thrash about,' Stephanie Bell, an investigator for PETA told the Herald. 'These are sadistic acts.'","Adam Redford's mother was the daughter of the inventor of the Hammond electric organ .

"Italians have attacked their government for failing to protect the Medieval port city of Genoa after floods there killed one man and left the streets caked in mud. The city's archbishop and Italy's biggest daily newspaper blasted the 'shameful' failures over the torrent - which comes less than three years after a similar disaster in Genoa killed seven people. Some parts of the northern city have seen two thirds of a year's rainfall in 72 hours, hurling cars into each other and reducing public services to chaos as the cleanup cost is estimated at £157million. Destruction: Floods in Genoa, Italy, have killed one man and left the city's streets full of filthy water and mud . Anger: Italy's biggest daily newspaper attacked the government's 'shameful' failure to prevent the disaster . Disaster: The cleanup costs have been put at £157million - not including private individuals and insurance firms . Corriere della Sera, Italy's biggest daily newspaper, attacked the government by announcing in its front page headline yesterday: 'The mud of Genoa, shame of a country'. And Archbishop of Genoa Angelo Bagnasco called for a 'timely . and massive' action by the government to resolve the crisis and . prevent similar disasters in future. 'Everyone knows what their responsibilities are,' he said, . his clothes spattered with mud after a tour of the city. 'It's absurd and shameful that bureaucracy of any kind . should be blocking funds which are absolutely necessary for . resolving these problems,' he said. Last night authorities warned the disaster could get worse with heavy rain predicted until Monday. Mess: The Bisagno river burst its banks on Thursday night, leaving the streets strewn with debris and mud . Power of nature: The floods wrecked cars and smashed through shop windows in the Medieval port city . Parked: Genoa is vulnerable because it sits between the sea and a ring of steep mountains with heavy rain . 'What is really alarming is how little has been done in three years to make Genoa secure from another flooding disaster,' said Francesco Vincenzi, president of ANBI, anational association for water safety organisations . Governor Claudio Burlando said the estimated damage to public . infrastructure was 200million euros (£157million) - not including all the costs to be borne by private landowners and insurance firms. Franco Gabrielli, the head of the civil protection authority, added: 'We are still in full emergency. 'The forecasts for the next few hours offer no relief at all for . tomorrow and Monday.' He admitted that authorities had failed to predict the huge . volume of rain. Parts of . the city, where the average rainfall is just over 1,000mm a year, saw 700mm in 72 hours. But Mr Gabrieli criticised delays in reinforcing the banks of the . Bisagno river, the biggest in Genoa, which burst its swollen . banks late on Thursday night. Civil protection chief Franco Gabrielli said: 'We are still in full emergency. The forecasts offer no relief at all' Archbishop of Genoa Angelo Bagnasco said: 'It's absurd and shameful that bureaucracy should block funds' Streets of mud: Parts of the city, where average rainfall is just over 1,000mm a year, saw 700mm in 72 hours . Critics say Italy has failed to protect Genoa from the elements. One major flood defence project was pulled . Volunteers: Residents of the northern city have pulled together to begin clearing the streets despite more rain . He added it was a 'scandal' that 35million euros set aside for the work after the 2011 floods had . not been spent because of a legal dispute. Genoa's position between the . sea and a ring of steep mountains has made it particularly vulnerable to . storms and floods. But critics say successive governments have been mired in bureaucracy and failed to approve proper flood defences or building regulations.

"Thousands of illegal immigrants could be escaping deportation from the UK because officials are failing to act on tips-offs from the public, an inspector has warned. Four in 10 illegal immigrant tip offs are not acted on by the Home Office quickly enough, Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration John Vine found. In one case sampled by the inspector, the Home Office was told an illegal immigrant was moving house in three days' time but staff failed to assess the claim for two weeks. Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration John Vine thousands of illegal immigrants could be escaping deportation . In another example, an allegation was made concerning the credibility of an appellant in an immigration appeal set to take place in three days - but the case was not looked at for five days and the individual was granted a five-year residence permit. Mr Vine was inspecting the Intelligence Management System, a Home Office database used for recording and processing allegations concerning immigration or customs offences received from the public, police or Crimestoppers. In 2013, more than 75,000 allegations were added to this system, which by the end of February 2014 had resulted in over 4,000 arrests and almost 1,000 removals. Nearly three-quarters of all allegations received by the system in the period were made directly by members of the public. Mr Vine said: 'In some cases the information contained in the allegation received will be time-critical and a failure to act in a timely manner may render it ineffective. It is therefore important that the Home Office takes steps to ensure that the initial harm assessment is carried out in all cases within the timescales set out in the ministerial target.' Immigration staff should assess all information received in the IMS within two working days, according to the target set by ministers. Acting promptly had seen Home Office staff take action to prevent offences including disrupting a sham marriage ceremony and checking a flight manifest for incoming passengers suspected of visa abuse, Mr Vine said. French riot policemen force out migrants who were hidden in a lorry making its way to the ferry terminal in Calais today . Home Secretary Theresa May is under pressure to improve the Government's reaction to public tip-offs about illegal immigrants . Of the 100 allegations sampled by Mr Vine that had been added to the database in September 2013, more than a third - 39 per cent - had not been assessed within the two-day target while one allegation was not assessed for 73 days. Of the 25 allegations added in January this year, performance was worse, with more than half - 52% - taking three working days or longer before being assessed. The longest delay before assessment was 15 days.","Borders inspector John Vine reveals 40% of allegations  not acted on .

"Reindeer carpaccio is to feature among the luxury delicacies being offered by budget supermarket Lidl this Christmas. Packs of the thinly sliced raw meat will feature in the ‘Deluxe’ range that the thriving German chain hopes will draw in shoppers who would normally go to the other major retailers. Although the meat is mainly considered a Scandinavian delicacy, Lidl has had some success selling reindeer steaks in Britain, and believes consumers are now ready to eat the meat in its raw form. Budget supermarket Lidl are to offer reindeer carpaccio as part of their luxury 'Deluxe' range this Christmas . Carpaccio is an Italian delicacy which traditionally consists of raw meat or fish that has been sliced very thinly. Lidl’s reindeer version is smoked and costs £4.99 a pack. Lidl has already had some success in selling reindeer meat in its stores . It is one of 59 products being added to the budget chain’s upmarket range, taking the total number of luxury goods to 224. The list also includes whole serrano hams at £39.99, gingerbread houses at £4.49, a whole lobster for £5.99, scallops at £3.99, champagne at £11.99 and Rioja Riserva at £5.99. Lidl has faced criticism for selling reindeer meat in the past. Animal welfare campaigning group Viva claims that the wild predators of reindeer, such as wolves and bears, are shot to protect meat supplies for retailers. Lidl insists that its reindeer meat is sourced only from producers who abide by EU animal welfare standards. Ronny Gottschlich, Lidl UK’s managing director, said: ‘We’ve sourced some of the finest foods from across Europe to complement our fresh, local produce, so everyone can make the most of this special time of year, regardless of budget.’ The company’s most recent TV advertising has featured a street market apparently offering artisan foods to shoppers who are surprised to be told the products actually come from Lidl. The Christmas commercial follows this theme and features people being treated to a festive feast on reindeer carpaccio, lobster, turkey and stollen in a Hertfordshire mansion. It captures their stunned reaction to learn it all came from Lidl. The guests’ genuine reactions of surprise are then captured when it is revealed that the feast was a Christmas gift from Lidl.","Packs of the thinly sliced raw reindeer meat are to go on sale at Lidl .

"It seems that no showbiz party is complete without an appearance from former WAG turned TV presenter Lizzie Cundy. Yet the ex-wife of former Chelsea defender Jason may be forced to end her champagne lifestyle – because she has been diagnosed with the pre-cancerous throat condition Barrett’s oesophagus. The cause of the disease is thought to be long-term acid reflux, or heartburn – and alcohol consumption is thought to exacerbate the problem. Lizzie Cundy, the ex-wife of former Chelsea defender Jason, has been diagnosed with the pre-cancerous throat condition Barrett’s oesophagus . Lizzie first sought medical advice after she ‘woke up in agony in the night with terrible chest pains, after months of not feeling well’, she recalls. The condition, in which the cells lining the oesophagus become abnormal due to constant reflux, is thought to affect about two in every 100 Britons. The divorced 46-year-old mother of two, who is currently filming her new Sky TV show London Style, continues: ‘It’s very scary because I understand it can develop into throat cancer.’ Lizzie says she is on a cocktail of drugs to control the problem. Aspirin could be an effective treatment for schizophrenia – helping the thousands of sufferers who do not respond to the usual first-line treatment of anti-psychotic medication. The condition affects about one person in 100, causing severe delusions and hallucinations. Anti-psychotics – which correct levels of the brain chemical dopamine, thought to be involved in driving the condition – don’t work for everyone, with up to 30 per cent of patients not responding at all. Now researchers at the Department of Psychiatry at Utrecht University’s medical centre have found that combining anti-psychotics with the common painkiller improves recovery. Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug as well as a painkiller and blood-thinner. Although the exact reason that it boosts the effectiveness of anti-psychotics is unknown, one theory is that it has an effect on the immune system, which may be a factor in the disease. 'Hospitals need sound of music' The sister of philosopher Alain de Botton is urging the NHS to provide ‘healing music’ to patients. Singer Miel de Botton, a former clinical psychologist who recently performed a special concert at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, said: ‘The hospital has a fantastic healing arts programme.’ Daisy Fancourt, the hospitals arts and enterprising health manager, agreed, saying: ‘Research projects we are running are providing evidence of the profound psychological and physiological benefits that music can bring.’ Singer Miel de Botton, a former clinical psychologist who recently performed a special concert at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, said: ‘The hospital has a fantastic healing arts programme’ Dogs aid a good night's sleep . Sharing a bed with your dog may improve your sleep. More than seven out of ten people share a bed or room with their dogs, and many say it helps them to nod off, and sleep more soundly. A study at the Medical University of Vienna carried out an internet-based survey where they quizzed pet owners about their sleeping arrangements. The online survey included 22 questions about various aspects related to sleep habits and sleep quality, and pets. About 90 per cent of the 630 people who took part were women, with an average age of 38, and 43 per cent owned more than one dog. Seventy-eight per cent said they regularly slept with the dogs in the same bed or room. ‘The overwhelming majority believed their sleep quality to be positively influenced by the dog,’ say the researchers. ‘They also rated their sleep as sounder and deeper and fell asleep more easily.’ Some research has shown that the companionship of owning a dog in the UK can lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and improve mood. However, the research suggests that getting too close to man’s best friend can also have ill effects. The study concluded that bed-sharing with domestic pets could lead to the spread of infections. ‘Although uncommon with healthy pets, the risk for transmission through bed-sharing, kissing and licking, is real,’ the report says. In need of a pick-me-up to improve your performance at the gym? A new beetroot-based sports bar could be the answer. Each 60g Beet It Sport bar contains 400mg of dietary nitrate (the equivalent of 400ml of beetroot juice). This is believed to boost nitric-oxide levels in the blood, which increases blood flow and oxygen supply to the muscles. Despite its intense pinky-purple colour, the bar tastes like an oaty flapjack.","Lizzie Cundy has been diagnosed with a pre-cancerous throat condition .

"An experienced angler got the shock of his life when he was out on a fishing trip and reeled in what he thought was a large barramundi and instead pulled in a 4.5 metre saltwater crocodile. Sean Parr was on a barramundi charter on the Corrobaree Billabong in the Northern Territory when the group he was with decided to stop for lunch and throw out a few fishing lines on the bank while they rested. After reeling in a few catfish, Sean threw out his line and felt it catch. Scroll down for video . Experienced angler Sean Parr almost reeled in this four and a half metre crocodile while on recent fishing trip . 'I looked and saw lots of bubbles coming out of the water,' Sean told Daily Mail Australia. 'I turned to one of the other guys and said, 'I think that's a croc! He said, 'Nah, it couldn't be.' 'The next minute a four and a half meter crocodile came to the surface! It was insane.' Sean said he had never heard or seen a thing like it, and neither had any of the others on the trip. 'It's behaviour was really weird,' Sean said. 'It was really timid, considering it had a hook in it's mouth. It hissed a bit but it didn't go anywhere near us,' The fisherman said he nor anyone on the charter with him that day had ever seen anything like it . 'I thought it would have thrashed, but it almost seemed sedated. Eventually we got the tension off the line because we didn't want to hurt it.' Sean said that the boat came up close to the crocodile so that Sean could release the massive saltwater creature. 'I went with Darwin Barra Base Safari Adventures, and they were such good guys. The host Paul was amazing about it all, and even he had said he'd never seen anything like it.' 'It was certainly something I've never seen before and probably never will again. I've seen a few small sharks but never a four and a half meter saltwater crocodile.' Sean was surprised by how calm the giant reptile was while he was releasing him . Another family on the charter boat from New Zealand were fascinated by the crocodile (not pictured) 'There was a family from New Zealand with us, and they were buzzing.' Sean said that he was astounded by the size of the animal, and was excited to go home and tell his family what he'd seen. 'I went home and told my son, 'Dad went fishing today. Guess what he caught?,' Sean said. 'He guessed a shark, and then I said, no, a crocodile.' Sean said he posted it online because he was so amazed and wanted other people to be able to see it. 'How many people get to say they've caught a saltwater crocodile? Although I didn't really catch it, we did let it go after all.' Sean said he was astounded by the size of the animal, and was excited to go home and tell his family .","Sean Parr was on a barramundi charter in the Northern Territory .

'From here it's non-stop on the sensational photo opps: misty Loch Lomond cradled by mountains; the wildly beautiful expanse of wind-blown Rannoch Moor. 1. The Danube Express, Budapest to Istanbul . 2. TranzAlpine Express, New Zealand . 3. Sunset Ltd, USA . 4. Tren Crucero, Ecuador . 5. The Shanghai Maglev, China . 6. The Caledonian Sleeper, Scotland . 'At old Victorian station platforms, lonely tearooms survey the tracks. Beyond, velvety green hills are washed with weak sun. 'Go in spring, when the light and flowers lend the surroundings extra special beauty - and be prepared for a tight squeeze, as the cabins aren't very spacious.' The guide recommends that passengers watch out for Rannoch Station - gateway to the wild moor, which is 'so remote that rail is pretty much the only way to get there.' 'Your nose will be superglued to the window as you take in the faded purple heathland and the chiffon-like silhouettes of foggy hills beyond,' it says . And the guide adds: 'If you opt for a bargain first class ticket, you'll get your own cabin and wake to breakfast delivered by your own on-board steward, so there's no need to fear stale teacakes and over-brewed tea.' The journey from Fort William to Mallaig is also widely considered one of Britain's most scenic areas . Other top train journey options include The Magnetic Levitation Train in Shanghai, China . The Tren Crucero, which runs through the heart of Ecuador, also topped Travel's list of the best railways . The  Caledonian Sleeper connects London Euston nightly - except Saturday - to Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Fort William, Glasgow and Inverness, as well as intermediate stations. But it was the route to Fort William that won over Travel's train lovers. As of May 2014, Serco have taken over the franchise from the Aberdeen-based First Group. The company already offers luxury sleeper services in Australia. The new 15-year franchise will start in April 2015. Serco will be responsible for operating all aspects of the Caledonian Sleeper including marketing, sales, passenger services, station facilities and fleet maintenance. More than £100m will be invested into building 72 state of the art carriages, which will make up four new trains, at a cost of £100m by the summer of 2018. It will be part-funded by a £60m grant from the Scottish government. The TranzAlpine Express is likewise not to be missed. This train runs along New Zealand's South Island . In America, climb aboard the Sunset Limited between Los Angeles and New Orleans, says the travel guide . Travel between Budapest and Istanbul on the iconic Danube Express - the last of the world's top six train trips . Serco is promising improvements including en-suite berths, 'pod flatbeds' and a brasserie-style club car. And a partnership with luxury hospitality firm Inverlochy Castle Management International and Michelin-starred chef Albert Roux will introduce what is described as 'hotel-style service and an improved all-round travelling experience.' Announcing the new contract earlier this year, Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said the aim was to 'transform this iconic rail service.' He added: 'The contract secures the future of the Caledonian Sleeper, ensuring it delivers a service fit for the 21st century and that it provides - as it has done for over 100 years - a unique, valued and high profile overnight service between Scotland and London.' Around 270,000 journeys were made on the sleeper service in the last year alone. Just sold to Serco, the Caledonian Sleeper is set to undergo improvements to the tune of a £100m investment . But Rail workers union the RMT has said it is 'deeply concerned' that the contract had been given to Serco. Acting General Secretary Mike Cash said: 'This is a company with a truly shocking track record in the delivery of public services. 'Quite frankly, with their appalling list of failures in the UK and globally, they should never have even been considered as contenders for the Scottish sleeper service. 'The logical option of public ownership was not even looked at. 'Serco is a company that has a reputation for promising the earth and delivering quite the opposite as they seek to maximise profits and sweat their assets for every single penny piece.'","The route between Fort William and London is known as The Deerstalker .

"One of Labour’s rising stars has claimed she is shunned by colleagues because she speaks with a middle-class, southern accent. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh revealed she is the victim of inverse snobbery because she does not have a ‘broad regional accent’. Miss Creagh said she had been the victim of ‘throwaway comments’ and ‘assumptions’ about her upbringing from her own side. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh claims she had been the victim of ¿throwaway comments¿ and ¿assumptions¿ about her upbringing from her own side . ‘People have sort of made assumptions on the basis that I don’t have a broad regional accent, and I’ve been quite quick to put them right about my background,’ the shadow minister told Total Politics magazine. ‘People assume that I’m from a more comfortable background than I actually am, and that’s actually been on my own side when that’s happened. People have made throwaway comments. ‘And I’m always very keen for people to understand that actually, it wasn’t all that easy when I was growing up in Coventry as the car factory shut down and unemployment went through the roof. Mary Creagh is a married mother-of-two who has been MP for Wakefield since 2005. She was born and brought up in Coventry. Her father, Thomas, was a car factory worker and her mother, Elizabeth, a primary school teacher. The 46-year-old went to  Bishop Ullathorne Comprehensive School in Coventry and landed a  was a scholarship at Pembroke College, Oxford to read modern languages. She worked for the London Enterprise Agency, before becoming a Labour councillor in Islington in 1998, standing down when she became an MP. She joined Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet in 2010, making a name for attacking the government over the forests sell-off, the badger cull and horsemeat burgers. ‘The fact that I went to Oxford and . acquired a kind of… lost my Coventry accent – although it does come back . in moments of high stress – it should not be, you know, I think people . make a lot of assumptions about people and they’re not necessarily . useful or helpful.' Miss Creagh, 46, a married mother-of-two who has been MP for Wakefield since 2005, was born and brought up in Coventry. Her father was a car factory worker and her mother a primary school teacher. Her remarks may surprise colleagues, since many senior Labour figures, including Ed Miliband, Ed Balls, Chuka Umunna and Tristram Hunt, also speak with southern accents. In the shadow Cabinet, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has been accused of adopting a mysterious northern accent though she was raised in Hampshire and educated at Oxford. Miss Cooper represents the Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford constituency, a collection of former coalmining towns in Yorkshire. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham speaks with a light northern accent, while shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves has a strong south London twang. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher, tipped as a potential future leader, was born and raised in Doncaster, south Yorkshire, and has a noticeable northern accent. Former TV presenter Gloria de Piero, the shadow womens’ minister, has a strong Bradford accent. In the interview, Miss Creagh defended Mr . Miliband, who has been under increasing pressure over Labour’s . narrowing poll lead and faltering response to last week’s Budget. ‘Look, Tony Blair’s not around . anymore,’ Miss Creagh said. ‘I think Ed Miliband is right to forge his . own path. I think he’s bold, creative and a very deep thinker. 'We have to show that we are different, and we are different, from those days.’ Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham has a northern accent, shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves has a strong south London twang and Labour's vice-chairman Michael Dugher was born and raised in Doncaster . She said the likes former Business Secretary Lord Mandelson could make a 'contribution' to Labour, but the party had to move on. 'Mandelson was quoted on the radio this morning, so yes, there is definitely a place for people who served under both previous prime ministers, I think, to make a contribution. 'You know, when people offer me help, wherever it comes from, I’m always grateful for it.

"A Pennsylvania priest has pleaded not guilty to charges he possessed child pornography and traveled to Honduras for sex with poor street children during missionary trips. The Rev. Joseph Maurizio entered the plea on Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Keith Pesto in Johnstown. The 69-year-old remains jailed, though Pesto gave lawyers 10 days to return with information about the priest's finances, at which point Pesto says he may reconsider releasing the priest pending trial. Defense attorney Steven Passarello tells the judge the priest will agree to freeze two investment accounts worth $900,000 and surrender his passport to address concerns he may flee prosecution. Alleged child abuse: Fr Joseph Maurizio, 69, pleaded no guilty Tuesday to charges he possessed child pornography and traveled to Honduras for sex with poor street children during missionary trips . Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephanie Haines says investigators found another account from which Maurizio withdrew $127,000. Passarello says that money will pay for the priest's defense. Fr Maurizio was charged following an investigation by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Secuirty Investigations unit into his activities during trips to Honduras. He was parish priest at Our Lady Queen of Angels Church in Central City, Pennsylvania until his arrest last month when he was forced to stand aside. According to Federal prosecutors, between 1999 and 2009 Maurizo travelled from Pennsylvania to Honduras as part of a non-profit organisation he established providing help to small children in Central America. Each trip lasted between two and three weeks. According to a statement released by the United States Attorney's office: 'The HSI Pittsburgh investigation that began in February revealed that during the timeframe in which he travelled to Honduras, Maurizio engaged in various and numerous unlawful sexual activities with minors. 'However, after the charged illicit sexual conduct occurred in March of 2009, Maurizio did not engage in any foreign travel again until July of 2011. 'From July 2011 through the present, foreign travel records indicate that Maurizio has made approximately 10 separate trips to various Central American countries. 'On September 12, search warrants were executed by HSI special agents at the rectory at Our Lady Queen of Angels Church in Central City, Pennsylvania, and a farm owned by Maurizio in Windber. Fr Maurizio (centre) is accused by federal authorities of travelling to Honduras to abuse vulnerable children . 'Dozens of pieces of evidence were seized from the rectory including four computers, a laptop, hundreds of CDs, a loose hard drive, camera, floppy disks, thumb drives, VHS tapes and media cards. Maurizio also faces a child porn charge based on images of a prepubescent boy posing on a bed with his genitals exposed. Maurizio has said abuse allegations against him were a bogus plot by the Honduran government to thwart his charity work. The priest's attorney, Steven Passarello, said the criminal complaint regurgitates allegations made five years ago after the priest's charity had a falling out with a local charity. He said children were bribed or coerced into making abuse allegations. According to the complaint, ICE's Pittsburgh office of Homeland Security Investigations began investigating in February after a board member of a nonprofit that assists Honduran street children reported abuse allegations against Maurizio on a watchdog website that tracks such claims against Catholic priests. 'The board member reported the allegations of abuse to the website after growing dissatisfied with what he believed to be an apparent lack of progress in the four-year criminal investigation of Maurizio,' the complaint said. Homeland Security agents learned that the FBI began investigating allegations that the priest abused Honduran children in 2009, it said. The FBI said it couldn't comment on the delay in the investigation but said it was working with ICE. Federal agents have travelled to Honduras where they have interviewed several alleged victims who claim Mauizio abused them, took naked photographs and offered them chocolates in return for performing sex acts. Maurizio would face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign place. The pornography charge carries a 10-year maximum sentence upon conviction.","Federal agents raided Fr Joseph Maurizio's home on September 12 after receiving complaints .

The storm is moving toward the north at 9 mph toward Bermuda, where a hurricane warning is in effect as the territory rushes to batten down. The hurricane center says the eye of Gonzalo is expected to pass near Bermuda sometime Friday, and a dangerous storm surge is expected along with heavy rainfall. Florida looks set to avoid the severe weather, reports the Sun Sentinel, although it could generate large swells and an increased risk of rip currents later in the week. After smashing into Bermuda, Gonzalo is expected to head northeast and hit Newfoundland in far eastern Canada by late Saturday. Gonzalo is the Atlantic's first Category 4 hurricane since October 2011 when Hurricane Ophelia's winds reached 140 mph, according to Jeff Masters, a hurricane expert with private forecaster Weather Underground.

Devastating: This graphic shows how the storm will weaken as it pushes northeast and brushes eastern Canada on Sunday . Hurricane Gonzalo briefly reached Category 4 status on Wednesday but dropped back to a Category 3 by the evening as it continued to move away from the northern Caribbean, forecasters said. It is expected to see slow weakening on Thursday night, with steadier weakening starting by late Friday. Gonzalo is the sixth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic season, which runs through to the end of November. Forecasters in August predicted lower-than-usual activity for the season, with seven to 12 named storms and no more than two reaching major hurricane status. A major hurricane is considered to be Category 3 or above with winds hitting at least 111 mph. Gonzalo has already swept by the eastern Caribbean earlier this week. It has uprooted trees, downed power lines and damaged scores of boats in the Caribbean islands of Antigua, St Maarten, and Martinique, according to local authorities and media reports. An 87-year-old sailor in St Maarten died after his boat sank in a marina where 37 vessels were damaged, the Daily Herald reported. Two people are missing, one in St. Martin and the other in St. Barts.

The government called out 200 soldiers of the Bermuda Regiment to help with cleanup efforts on the island of roughly 70,000 people. On Wednesday, people stripped the island's hardware stores of generators, batteries, candles and other items and picked up free tarpaulins distributed by the government. Supermarkets and gas stations are braced for more crowds on Thursday. 'We sold out of generators [Tuesday], and items like batteries, tarp and ropes have been flying off the shelf,' Mark Stearns, a hardware store general manager, said. 'Everything that is on the hurricane list has been going fast and furious. People are definitely nervous about this storm.' Flights out of Bermuda are fully booked for the rest of the week and hardware stores were inundated with shoppers, the Royal Gazette reported. Bermuda, which is 850 miles east of the U.S. state of South Carolina, has one of the highest per-capita incomes in the world and its strict building codes make structures particularly capable of withstanding storms.

"Sierra Nevada Corp said there were 'serious questions and inconsistencies in the source selection process' Work on a pair of U.S. commercial spaceships to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station will be delayed after a losing contender protested the Nasa awards. Sierra Nevada Corp, which lost out with its plans, said there were 'serious questions and inconsistencies in the source selection process'. It has now launched a legal complaint - which Nasa admits will delay the entire project. Scroll down for video . Space race: Elon Musk unveils his Dragon V2 shuttle which is capable of launching up to seven astronauts into orbit. Nasa revealed today it is one of two craft selected to begin shuttling astronauts to the International space Station in 2017. The CST-100 spacecraft will at first be used to take astronauts to the ISS, pictured. However, Boeing also envisages a future where it is used to transport astronauts to private spacecraft such as Bigelow Aerospace's inflatable habitats, which will be launched in the future . Sierra Nevada Corporation is constructing what some regard as the true successor to the Space Shuttle. Known . as the Dream Chaser (test vehicle pictured below), this ‘mini-shuttle’ of sorts will launch upright . on top of a rocket, taking a crew of seven into orbit before gliding . back to Earth at the end of its mission. The U.S. space agency awarded contracts worth up to $6.8 billion to Boeing and privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, to finish designs, build, test and ultimately fly crews to the station, a $100 billion research laboratory that orbits about 260 miles (418 km) above Earth. The awards, announced on Sept. 16, culminate a four-year program to restore U.S.-based human spaceflight services following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011.Since then, NASA has been dependent on Russia to fly station crewmembers, a service that currently costs the United States about $70 million per seat. In addition to Boeing and SpaceX, privately owned Sierra Nevada Corp bid to continue development of its Dream Chaser spaceplane under NASA’s so-called “Commercial Crew” program. The contracts include up to six operational missions. Boeing’s award is for $4.2 billion. SpaceX offered to do the work for $2.6 billion. On Friday, Colorado-based Sierra Nevada formally protested the awards, saying its proposal would cost $900 million less than Boeing’s. 'NASA’s own Source Selection Statement and debrief indicate that there are serious questions and inconsistencies in the source selection process. SNC, therefore, feels that there is no alternative but to institute a legal challenge,' the company said in a statement. Dream Chaser . The protest, filed with the Government Accountability Office, will temporarily keep NASA from moving forward with the next phase of its Commercial Crew program, NASA's Bolden told Reuters. NASA has 30 days to respond to Sierra Nevada’s challenge. GAO is expected to issue its ruling by Jan. 5, 2015. Bolden was in Toronto for the opening of the week-long International Astronautical Congress. The long awaited $6.8bn deal to replace the Space Shuttle and end reliance on Russia's Soyuz craft was revealed at the Kennedy Space Center, where launches will take place from 2017. Boeing's design would be launched into space using the Atlas 5 rocket built by the United Launch Alliance, a venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. It will take crews of seven people to the ISS and other destinations . That rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine, which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with Russia. 'From day one, the Obama Administration made clear that the greatest nation on Earth should not be dependent on other nations to get into space,' Nasa Administrator Charlie Bolden said at the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. 'Thanks to the leadership of President Obama, the hard work of our NASA and industry teams, and support from Congress, today we are one step closer to launching our astronauts from U.S. soil on American spacecraft and ending the nation’s sole reliance on Russia by 2017. 'Turning over low-Earth orbit transportation to private industry will also allow NASA to focus on an even more ambitious mission – sending humans to Mars.' The two Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contracts are designed to complete the NASA certification for human space transportation systems capable of carrying people into orbit. Once certification is complete, NASA plans to use these systems to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station and return them safely to Earth. 'Today we don't know who will be the first commander - but we know is will be a major achievement for our nation,' said Golden. Under the deal, Boeing will be given $4.2bn and SpaceX $2.6bn. Nasa hopes it will spur private development in space. 'Ideally several years from now there will be other laboraties where people will be going - that's the vision of a commercial space industry,' said Golden. The contracts include at least one crewed flight test per company with at least one NASA astronaut aboard to verify the fully integrated rocket and spacecraft system can launch, maneuver in orbit, and dock to the space station, as well as validate all its systems perform as expected. Once each company’s test program has been completed successfully and its system achieves NASA certification, each contractor will conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station. These spacecraft also will serve as a lifeboat for astronauts aboard the station. ""We are excited to see our industry partners close in on operational flights to the International Space Station, an extraordinary feat industry and the NASA family began just four years ago,"" said Kathy Lueders, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. ""This space agency has long been a technology innovator, and now we also can say we are an American business innovator, spurring job creation and opening up new markets to the private sector. 'The agency and our partners have many important steps to finish, but we have shown we can do the tough work required and excel in ways few would dare to hope.' The companies will own and operate the crew transportation systems and be able to sell human space transportation services to other customers in addition to NASA, thereby reducing the costs for all customers. the craft will replace the Space Shuttle following its retirement. The final shuttle mission was completed with the landing of Atlantis on July 21, 2011, bringing about the end of the 30-year Space Shuttle program. Earlier this year Boeing took a major step forward in its bid to replace the space shuttle. The aerospace giant completed a key review of its design for a new commercial venture to fly astronauts to the International Space Station. The multibillion-dollar program has taken on new urgency in recent months, given escalating tensions with Russia over its annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine. John Mulholland, vice president and program manager for Boeing's commercial space exploration programs, said the company faced some difficult challenges as it developed its design, but got 'excellent' feedback from Nasa during the review last month. Boeing's CST will take crews of seven people to the ISS and other destinations from 2017, it was revealed today. 'From a technical standpoint, the review went very well,' he said. 'To the best of my knowledge we’re the only CCiCAP competitor that actually was able to complete all of the milestones in the period of performance,' he said. Mulholland said, measured in mass, the Boeing design for the cargo module was 96-percent complete at the time of the review, while its design for the crew module was 85-percent complete, two metrics that underscored the maturity of the design. He said the critical design review marked a major step for the Boeing program. 'You've got to be able to stand up at that review and show the analysis and tests that demonstrate that you're going to be able to meet those requirements,' he said. Boeing remains confident it could complete work on the new spacecraft in time to begin flight tests in 2017, Mulholland said. Boeing's design would be launched into space using the Atlas 5 rocket built by the United Launch Alliance, a venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. That rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine, which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with Russia. He said the module was designed from the beginning to be compatible with other launch vehicles, if necessary, although that would still entail some modification of the interface between the spacecraft and the launcher. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in July 2011, the US has relied on Russia to get its astronauts into orbit. But through their Commercial Crew Program, Nasa has been busy funding the development of a new breed of spacecraft. Next generation: SpaceX says the shuttle will provide a less expensive way to connect to the Space Station . Boeing has unveiled a mockup of the interior of their new Crew Space Transportation (CST-100) vehicle that will be used to astronauts into space in the coming years. The capsule is funded by Nasa as part of their programme to develop private spacecraft . Boeing’s vision for the future of human spaceflight is the Crew Space Transportation (CST-100). They unveiled the new commercial interior . of its CST-100 next-generation manned space . capsule, showing how people other than Nasa astronauts may one day . travel to space. This is the first time they have made the design of the interior public. Boeing and partner Bigelow Aerospace highlighted the future commercial interior of the capsule it is developing for Nasa, while Bigelow showcased a full-scale model of its BA 330 inflatable space habitat that astronauts could one day live in. 'We are moving into a truly commercial space market and we have to consider our potential  customers - beyond Nasa - and what they need in a future commercial spacecraft interior,' said Chris Ferguson, former Space Shuttle Atlantis commander and current Boeing director of Crew and Mission Operations for the Commercial Crew Program. Engineers from across Boeing leveraged the company's decades of experience in commercial and government aerospace to design the capsule's interior. The capsule, interior view of a prototype pictured, will be able to seat a crew of seven and it will also be able to take cargo into orbit. It is in direct competition with SpaceX's manned Dragon capsule and Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser space plane, all of which are vying to be the first private company to take humans into space . 'Boeing's teams have been designing award-winning and innovative interiors for our airplanes since the dawn of commercial aviation,' said Rachelle Ornan, regional director of Sales and Marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. 'Designing the next-generation interior for commercial space is a natural progression. A familiar daytime blue sky scene helps passengers maintain their connection with Earth.'","Sierra Nevada Corp said there were 'serious questions and inconsistencies in the source selection process'
