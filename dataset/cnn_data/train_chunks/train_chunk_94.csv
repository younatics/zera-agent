"Shanghai, China (CNN) -- The Shanghai Auto Show -- the biggest automobile exhibition in the most lucrative car market in the world -- opens Tuesday amidst a flurry of China-focused global car premieres. Meanwhile, shortages in the supply chain continue to worry car manufacturers, just one month after Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami. Major brands including GM, Chevy, BMW, and Citroen are racing to win over Chinese customers this week, slating highly anticipated global releases for Shanghai, which this year coincides with the New York Auto Show. European car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen hosted a flashy global unveiling of its new hatchback DS-5 in Shanghai because the company is convinced China's car market will continue growing dramatically in the coming years. ""Ten percent growth will last for several years,"" Peugeot's CEO Philippe Varin told reporters Monday. The DS-5 will be produced in China by Changan Automobile, which ranks fourth in the mainland. Also this week, Chevy will unveil its new Malibu 2013. BMW will premiere its new 6-Series luxury coupe in Shanghai, along with a concept M5 luxury sport sedan. Audi, a popular brand with a major market share in China, announced it will unveil a new Q3 crossover. Mercedes-Benz will reveal its entry-level A-Class concept car, among others. On Monday, General Motors unveiled Baojun, its first dedicated car brand aimed specifically at Chinese consumers. The American car brand announced that it aims to more than double the number of cars it sells in China to 5 million by 2015. ""We have set some aggressive goals,"" GM China head Kevin Wale told reporters on Monday. ""We are confident we will achieve every one of our goals."" The first model for Baojun, which means ""treasured horse"" in Chinese, is a mid-size 1.5-litre engine sedan that is priced between US $10,000 and $15,000, according to Wale. It is a price point that Ford hopes will be attractive to young buyers in China's second- and third-tier cities. China's rapidly expanding car market is expected to grow even if the economy slows. According to the Carnegie Energy and Climate Program, even if China's annual gross domestic product growth rate declines from 10 to 7 percent, as projected by the International Monetary Fund and laid out in China's 12th Five-Year Plan, some 600 million vehicles could fill China's roads by 2030. However, the announcements across Shanghai were muted by the auto industry's continued struggle to rebound from a components shortage caused by the Japan's March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which caused forced factory closures. Short supply of crucial car parts has caused some brands, including Toyota, to temporarily half production due to shortages. ""Obviously it's a terrible tragedy for the people of Japan,"" Ford's China CEO Joe Hinrichs told CNN on Monday. ""It's not just the supply base that directly supply the auto companies, but their suppliers and their supplies so it's a complex situation that is evolving everyday."" Ford has moved up previously planned stoppages in their manufacturing facilities to project their supply of cars in certain locations. Volvo, which is owned by China's Geely Holding Group, has been forced to look elsewhere for some parts. ""So far we have managed it very well, we had no loss of any production and no change in our model mix,"" Volvo CEO Stefan Jacoby told CNN. ""We have some specific components where we are relying on Japan but we managed together with suppliers from Japan to find alternatives within Japan but also out of other countries and other production locations abroad."" Jacoby predicted a new wave of semiconductor shortages will emerge this summer, affecting their ability to produce gear box control units and powertrains. As for the long term impact, auto manufacturers are cautiously optimistic. ""I think Japan quake results are going to play out over the next several months,"" Ford's Hinrichs said. ""It's a critical time when suppliers are ramping back up and inventory levels have been coming down throughout the system, so over the next couple of months we'll know the real proof of impact of what's happening."" ""I don't think there will be a major long term impact,"" Hinrichs told CNN. The 14th Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition opens to the media on Tuesday and to the public on Thursday.","One estimate says China will have 600 million vehicles by 2030 .

"(CNN) -- ""There's no more skeletons in my closet,"" Russell Brand told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""I live in a haunted house."" On Wednesday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" Morgan introduced Brand as ""the man who put the sex, drugs and rock and roll into comedy,"" calling the comedian ""a lawbreaker, a line-crosser, a madman and a genius."" Brand, who makes no secret of his shaky past, told Morgan, ""They know I'm a junkie. They know I carried on with women. They know I've been in trouble with the police."" The actor also talked to the CNN host about his new movie, ""Arthur,"" a remake of the 1980s classic, his marriage to pop superstar Katy Perry and his thoughts on the royal family. Brand described his pre-sobriety self in detail, saying he was ""a scrawny, retched, ne'er do well -- a twig crow man, scorching across the north London streets, fingerless gloves, outstretched palm, bags of smack in pocket, pipe on the lips."" ""I used to hang out with pimps and hookers and junkies and crooks,"" continued Brand. ""But the reality of that life, you know, you can snatch glistening pearls of amusement from it. But when that's your daily life, it's miserable."" Morgan asked Brand if his newfound immense success made him happier. ""Given that I had an early life that was about like sort of stealing to survive,"" said Brand, ""and having to get on the public transport without paying, and sort of petty incidents, and low-life crime sort of stuff, then yes. It's obviously easier to have money than to be dirt poor. But I think that to say that money brings happiness is reductive."" Morgan argued that Brand getting a California driver's license was a step toward the straight and narrow because ""wild rockers can't drive."" Brand, who drives a Range Rover, said he takes driving very seriously and tries ""to accept that driving is not a medium in which to express your true nature."" The actor, who married singer/songwriter Perry in October, told Morgan, ""I really love married life. I love the companionship and the friendship and the consistency of someone being there."" Morgan asked if there was any truth to the rumors that Brand is teaming up with Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin to make a film version of the stage musical ""Rock of Ages."" Brand said, ""As a man who is married to a person that can often be on another continent, I need to put my marriage first. See if we can work out the schedule in there, and then I'll do it."" ""Arthur,"" hits theatres Friday. ""Obviously, you're replacing a legend,"" said Morgan. ""I mean, Dudley Moore made 'Arthur' this immortal character. Did you have any qualms about taking over such a part from one of your comedy heroes?"" ""I hold Dudley Moore in such reverence,"" Brand said. ""I have such strong feelings and affection for the original film. It just felt like a privilege and an honor."" He called the film ""a beautiful way of updating a very traditional and archetypal story."" Brand, a recovering alcoholic who played a womanizing drunk, had an interesting way of preparing for his scenes. ""I was smelling the bottles of booze to get me into character, 'cause I don't drink anymore as you know. ""I would take the bottles of rum, bottles of tequila, just to evoke the memory."" He called the experience ""a distilled, but positive aspect of alcoholism,"" saying it was like being drunk with the exception of ""having to wake up with a terrible headache and a stranger."" Brand said the overall message of the film is that ""Arthur is a billionaire, but he's unhappy and he is lonely until he finds love."" When the subject of the upcoming nuptials of Prince William and Kate Middleton came up, the two Englishmen discussed the monarchy. Brand noted he has been ""overwhelmed by patriotism"" since moving to the United States. ""I have become sort of seduced by it,"" continued Brand. ""I think those things have contributed to a renewed appreciation for the monarchy; while I still believe absolutely in equality at my core."" Morgan asked Brand what the difference between British and American humor is, and whether the comedian tailors his act for American audiences. ""I think there's a very direct corollary that's based around our language,"" Brand said. ""And I, I certainly don't think it holds true that the American sense of humor is in any way unsophisticated when you think of the geniuses like (Jerry) Seinfeld and (Richard) Pryor."" As for upcoming plans, Brand told Morgan he wishes ""to continue being a stand-up comedian, continue to be happy in my marriage and to make sure that when I interact with people, I make them happier.""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A special court set up by Afghan President Hamid Karzai that had been prosecuting alleged electoral fraud by 62 parliament members has been dissolved, a presidential spokesman announced Wednesday. Karzai said in a written statement that the country's electoral commission has final say over election outcomes, noting that Afghan courts cannot change electoral results. The decree appears to put an end to months of legal wrangling over the legitimacy of roughly one quarter of the lawmakers in the country's lower house of parliament. But presidential spokesman Siamak Herawi said the commission will now review the court's findings to determine if any lawmakers need to be removed. Critics of the Afghan president have long suggested that the creation of the now-dissolved special court had been part of an effort to stack the lower house with Karzai supporters. Herawi declined to comment on those claims. Meanwhile, four police officers were killed in southern Afghanistan during an inadvertent clash between NATO forces and Afghan police, according to an Interior Ministry statement on Wednesday. The incident occurred in southern Kandahar province late Tuesday evening when NATO ""mistakenly attacked a police checkpoint in Arghandab district,"" the statement said. Two other police officers were also injured in the clash. NATO says it is aware of the incident and an investigation is underway, according to International Security Assistance Force spokesman Capt. Pietro D'Angelo. CNN's Matiullah Mati contributed to this report .","A special court set-up to prosecute alleged electoral violations is dissolved .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greece is set to impose further austerity measures and a number of privatization plans in return for more international aid to avoid defaulting on its debt. The move comes after a 110 billion euro European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund bailout last year has failed to cover the country's needs. The Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, was scheduled to present his government's plans to the Eurogroup chairman, Jean-Claude Juncker, in Luxembourg Friday. Papandreou was expected to give Juncker details on a medium-term fiscal plan that will aim to raise an extra 28 billion euros by 2015. Part of that money is expected to come from the sale of state assets. The plan also includes extra taxes for employees and pensioners. The additional measures come at a time when daily strikes and demonstrations are being held across Greece against existing plans. Thousands of people were in their tenth day of protest Friday at Athens' main square and there have been several outpourings of anger in recent days against ruling politicians by angry crowds. Friday morning a group of protesters from the communist-affiliated union PAME was holding a sit-in at the finance ministry, blocking entrance. Protesters also hung a banner at the ministry building calling for a general strike against additional measures. In a statement, protesters referred to the measures as ""barbaric."" Greece's main labor unions have called a general strike on June 15. The government has failed to achieve political consensus on its policy and there is opposition to additional measures within the ruling party, with a group in parliament asking for a full-party debate on the issue. A cabinet meeting was to be held before additional measures were announced. Greece was hoping to return to the markets to help fund its deficit but with borrowing costs being prohibitively high this has left Greece with very little negotiating power. Earlier this week, ratings agency Moody's cut its rating of Greece to one of the worst levels possible, only slightly above recently-defaulted Ecuador. Last week, the IMF threatened to veto the release of the latest 12 billion euro portion of Greece's existing rescue package because the country could not guarantee its solvency. Greece's creditors are were expected Friday to announce a decision on the release of that money.","The new measures call for extra taxes for employees and pensioners .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- The widow of an al Qaeda in Iraq leader has been sentenced to 20 years in prison, after being convicted of involvement in terrorism. Hasna Ali was the wife of Abu Ayyub al-Masri, one of the two top leaders of al Qaeda in Iraq who were killed in a joint Iraqi-U.S. operation in April 2010. Al-Masri was military leader of al Qaeda in Iraq. Iraqi Supreme Judicial Council spokesman Abdul Sattar al-Berqdar told CNN Sunday that Hasna Ali, who is from Yemen, was sentenced in an Iraqi court. Abu Ayyub al-Masri was the military leader of al Qaeda in Iraq. He was killed along with Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, who was . leader of the Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq. When they were killed more than a year ago, then-commander of U.S. Forces-Iraq Gen. Raymond Odierno called it ""potentially the most significant blow to al Qaeda in Iraq since the beginning of the insurgency.""

"(CNN Student News) -- May 16, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Louisiana  • Atlanta, Georgia . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Carl Azuz, and today on CNN Student News, we're gonna be talking about something that won't happen until November 6th... of 2012! But we start things off down in Louisiana. First Up: Severe Flooding . AZUZ: Officials facing the threat of massive flooding there have opened several gates on the Morganza Spillway. A spillway is something that goes over or around a dam. It's a safety feature. When too much water builds up around the dam, the spillway's gates can be opened to let some of that water through. This is what the Morganza Spillway looks like normally: gates closed, nothing coming through. But with floodwaters from the Mississippi River rushing in, engineers opened up some of the spillway's gates for the first time in nearly 40 years. That's what you see here: water barreling through the gate. The Morganza Spillway has 125 total gates. Officials plan to open up to one-fourth of those. Opening the gates should divert floodwaters away from major cities, like Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana. But it will send water toward homes and farmland in other parts of the state. People who live there -- many of whom have had to evacuate their homes -- are preparing for devastation. KELLI TRIMM, BUTTE LAROSE, LOUISIANA RESIDENT: It's worse than we thought. It's really worse than we thought. We thought maybe we might have water in our yard. Instead, this is going to come into our home. It's going to take everything we have got. Presidential Politics . AZUZ: The next U.S. presidential election is more than 500 days away. Might sound like the distant future, but there's a lot that happens between now and then. And since that process is already underway, we're going to break some of it down for you today. Ultimately, one candidate from each party will face off in the general election. That's on November 6th, 2012. Before that, candidates have to win their party's nomination. That's what the primary elections help decide. There are lots of political parties out there. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party. We're going to look at the two biggest parties: the Democrats and Republicans. On the Democratic side, President Obama is an incumbent candidate. He's running for re-election to the office he already holds. He announced his campaign last month. The Republican side has a field of candidates. Some of them, like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, U.S. Representative Ron Paul, and former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, have announced their plans to run for president. Others have formed what are called exploratory committees. They haven't officially announced their candidacy, but they're looking pretty seriously at the possibilities. Lot of steps to go through between now and election day. We'll take you through it as campaign season rolls along. Shoutout . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's first Shoutout goes out to Mr. Essex's geography students at Washington Middle School in Miles City, Montana! Whose slogan is ""the toughest job you'll ever love""? Here we go! Is it the: A) Boy Scouts, B) Air Force, C) Peace Corps or D) Supreme Court? You've got three seconds -- GO! A promotional campaign described the Peace Corps as ""the toughest job you'll ever love."" That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Peace Corps at 50 . AZUZ: The organization promotes peace and friendship by having Americans live and work in developing countries. A simple idea, but one that's lasted. The Peace Corps celebrated its 50th anniversary this year. Brooke Baldwin caught up with a new member of the corps as she began her journey. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOHN F. KENNEDY, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I have today signed an executive order providing for the establishment of a Peace Corps. BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: That was March 1961. In the 50 years since President John F. Kennedy launched the Peace Corps initiative, more than 200,000 volunteers have served in some 139 countries. Twenty-two-year-old Katie Pollak is now one of them. KATIE POLLAK, PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEER: It's an exciting thing to be a part of. So many amazing people have been Peace Corps volunteers, and just the network of people who have done it. They use the word ""family"" a lot. It's exciting to sort of be going into that. BALDWIN: Katie recently earned her college degree in human biology and African studies. She plans to put it to good use for the next 27 months in Senegal, where she'll work in the Peace Corps malaria program. POLLAK: Professionally, this is going to be sort of the best thing that I can do, in terms of on-the-ground experience and whether I want to work broadly in life or doing policy work. And personally, I think it's going to be the biggest challenge of my life, being in an entirely new culture. BALDWIN: Peace Corps volunteers serve in several areas: education, HIV/AIDS awareness, agriculture, and business development, just to name a few. They are provided with health insurance, a housing allowance, and they receive about $7,500 at the end of their 27-month assignment. And the desire to serve is still very strong. KRISTINA EDMUNSON, DEP. COMMUNICATIONS DIR., PEACE CORPS: Today, we have more Peace Corps volunteers in the field than at any time in the last 40 years. And, you know, I think it's representative that Americans are ready to serve. They're standing up. They're answering President Obama's call to service. BALDWIN: Forty-seven people in this latest group of Peace Corps volunteers are heeding that call. COSTA KOKKINOS, PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEER: I just hope to do stuff, to complete projects that people will appreciate. Maybe something that's sustainable, so when I leave they will have it. SARAH KUECH, PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS: Two years seems a lot like now, but in the grand scheme of things, it's really not that big. So, if I can donate a little of my time to try to do some good, I think it's worth a shot. BALDWIN: And for Katie Pollak, she says she is ready for the learning experience of a lifetime. POLLAK: One of the goals of the Peace Corps is to bring a better understanding of Americans to other people around the world. And I hope I can, like, be an ambassador for America. And show sort of the good side. BALDWIN: Brooke Baldwin, CNN. (END VIDEO) Shoutout Extra Credit . BARBARA HALL, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for a Shoutout Extra Credit!

That changed with the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. Saturday, young people got to play and talk with former all-stars as Major League Baseball honored those who fought for social justice in the game and in the country. The celebration continued yesterday when the Atlanta Braves hosted the Civil Rights Game. The teams wore uniforms from 1974. That's the year that Hank Aaron hit home run number 715 to break Babe Ruth's career record. T.J. Holmes talked to ""Hammerin' Hank"" about the influence of the civil rights era. (BEGIN VIDEO) T.J. HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Some of them were out there before you. But when you kind of got into the mix, is that something you wanted? Did you ever consider yourself kind of a leader being out front, a leader in the civil rights era? Or did you just want to play baseball? HANK AARON, BASEBALL HALL OF FAMER: I wanted to play baseball and I never felt like I was a leader. But I felt like Jackie Robinson had paved the way for, and I wanted to be a baseball player. Let me put it that way. And Jackie Robinson had paved the way for all of us. When I say all of them, myself, Willie and some of the other black who's came before him and was a little bit younger than he was, had paved the way. And I felt like it was my responsibility, not only as a baseball player, but to carry myself in such a way that other blacks would be able to look at me and say, ""oh, I not only want to be the same kind of ballplayer that Hank Aaron was, but I want to carry myself off the field the way that he did."" HOLMES: Do you ever look back and think, ""You know what? I could have done without it, without the record""? AARON: No, I never did. No. I felt like it was my responsibility. God had given me the ability to play baseball. I had the world on my shoulders. I knew that I could do most anything I wanted to do out on the baseball field. And I always felt like I was, it may sound kind of silly, but I always felt like I was surrounded by angels on the baseball field.

"(CNN) -- Italy international midfielder Alberto Aquilani has left English Premier League side Liverpool to join AC Milan on loan for the rest of the season. Aquilani, 27, joined Liverpool from Roma in 2009, but the playmaker has struggled with form and fitness during his two years on Merseyside, spending last term on loan at Juventus. ""Alberto Aquilani has completed his loan transfer from Liverpool to AC Milan,"" read a statement on five-time European champions Liverpool's web site. ""The deal, which includes the option of a permanent move, will end on June 30, 2012."" Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish revealed the reasons behind the transfer and said he could not find room for Aquilani in his team. ""It's a great move for Alberto,"" said the Scot. ""He's got his wife and kid over there. It was difficult for him here. ""When he came back his pre-season training was excellent. We gave him a few games, he did well in those games. But the problem for us was trying to get him in the team. ""Obviously everybody wants to play and Alberto is moving over to a fantastic football club. He goes there with the best wishes of everyone and we hope it works out for him, because he was never a problem in any way, shape or form."" Aquilani has won 17 caps for Italy and was part of the Azzurri squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Elsewhere, English midfielder Joey Barton has left Newcastle to join newly-promoted Queens Park Rangers on a four-year deal. Barton, 28, fell out with the Newcastle hierarchy after criticizing the way the club was run on the social-networking site Twitter. The former Manchester City player signed for Newcastle in 2007 and was part of their squad which was relegated from the Premier League in 2009, and then gained promotion back to England's top division in 2010. QPR were recently taken over by AirAsia chief Tony Fernandes and Barton said the ambition of the London outfit is what convinced him to make the move. ""The ambition of the club really impressed me,"" Barton told their official web site. ""There's a great set of lads here already and that's why they had such a great season in the Championship. ""The manager is talking about adding two or three more bodies and that, combined with the potential of the club and the new owners' ambitions, bodes really well for the future."" Another player on the move on Friday was Dedryck Boyata, with the central defender joining Bolton Wanderers from Manchester City on a season-long loan deal. The 20-year-old Belgium international will spend the rest of the campaign with Owen Coyle's side. Meanwhile, in Italy, Macedonian international striker Goran Pandev has left Inter Milan to join Champions League rivals Napoli on loan. Pandev joined Inter in January 2010 after five seasons at Lazio but scored only two goals in 27 matches last season.","Alberto Aquilani has joined AC Milan from Liverpool on a season-long loan .

"Palo Alto, California (CNN) -- President Obama began his ""town hall"" event at Facebook's offices on Wednesday with an anecdote. ""I hate to tell stories about Mark,"" Obama said, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who was moderating the session. As if the two former Harvard students were old friends, Obama then launched into a brief retelling of a dinner party he atttended in February with the 26-year-old computer whiz and about a dozen other tech-industry elites. There, Zuckerberg sat to the president's immediate right. ""I'm the guy who got Mark to wear a jacket and tie,"" Obama said, referring to Zuckerberg, who abandoned his usual T-shirt and hoodie ensemble that day. ""Halfway through dinner, he's starting to sweat a bit. It's really uncomfortable for him. I helped him out of his jacket. ""In fact, if you want Mark, we can take our jackets off."" And so, like Obama has often done during less-formal speeches, the president on Wednesday removed his coat. Zuckerberg followed, revealing a dress shirt and black tie. (Though, he did wear sneakers.) ""Yeah, you're a lot better at this than me,"" Zuckerberg joked. That kicked off a very cordial hour-long conversation and seemed to loosen up the sometimes chilly technology prodigy. Zuckerberg stumbled during his opening remarks. ""Sorry, I'm kind of nervous,"" he said after a flub in his introduction. For Obama, Wednesday was a chance to connect with both Silicon Valley influencers and young people in one poke. Throughout his answers, Obama related his typical talking points -- federal deficit, education, healthcare and immigration -- to those two groups. To the technorati, Obama promoted education in math and sciences, highlighted the especially acute real-estate market in the affluent area here, and talked up immigration reform. ""We don't want them starting Intel in China, or starting Intel in France. We want them here,"" he said. To the youthful audience of Facebook employees, he provided advice and stirred his familiar call for change. ""Historically, part of what makes for a healthy democracy, what is a good politics, is when you have citizens who are informed, who are engaged. And what Facebook allows us to do is make sure this isn't just a one-way conversation,"" Obama said. For Facebook, the meeting was an opportunity to validate itself in the eyes of Washington, where it's ramped up lobbying efforts recently. That's important for most companies growing at the rate and size Facebook is. Zuckerberg has already proven himself to 500 million people who use the service and to wealthy investors. The Facebook founder is worth $13.5 billion, according to data from Forbes. That fact provided an opening for another ribbing from Obama, when discussing the president's proposal for ending tax cuts for the wealthy. ""People like me and you, Mark, (should be) paying a little more in taxes,"" Obama said. ""I know you're OK with that."" Despite the president's plan to take more of Zuckerberg's money, the young billionaire praised Obama's efforts in education reform. ""I think that the Race to the Top stuff that you guys have done is one of the most under-appreciated and most important things that your administration has done,"" Zuckerberg told the president. For his part, Zuckerberg announced in September that he would donate $100 million to Newark, New Jersey, public schools. Obama has commended Facebook in past speeches, including in his State of the Union address in January. He placed Zuckerberg's creation in a pantheon of great American ingenuity success stories, beside the inventors of the light bulb and the airplane. ""We're the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of Google and Facebook,"" Obama said in that speech. ""In America, innovation doesn't just change our lives. It is how we make our living."" Facebook indicated in statements leading up to Wednesday's event that this was not an endorsement for the president. Likewise, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters on the flight over here that the event was not meant to be a promotion for Facebook. ""This is not about endorsing a specific company,"" Carney said. ""It's about accepting an invitation for a forum to speak to the American people."" People traveling on Air Force One watched ""The Social Network,"" the controversial movie about the founding of Facebook, Carney said. Facebook did, however, offer a gift to Obama at the end of the event. It was a sweatshirt with the website's logo stamped on the front -- ""in case, for some reason, you want to dress like me,"" Zuckerberg said.","At a Facebook event, President Obama repeatedly poked fun at Facebook's founder .

"(CNN) -- A Nigerian militant group has claimed responsibility after a car loaded with explosives rammed into the United Nations' building in the capital, killing 23, a government spokesman said Monday. The suicide attack Friday shattered windows, set the building ablaze and left gaping holes on the walls. Radical Muslim sect Boko Haram, which aims to enforce a strict version of Sharia law, has claimed responsibility, said Reuben Abati, the government spokesman. Eighty-one people were injured, he said. The attack targeted a building that housed 26 U.N. humanitarian and development agencies, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last week. The Liberian and U.S. embassies are also nearby. ""This was an assault on those who devote their lives to helping others,"" Ban said. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan described the suicide bombing as ""barbaric, senseless and cowardly"" and intensified security around the capital. The capital of Abuja has experienced a series of bombings in recent months. In June, a car blast killed at least five people at the police headquarters in the city. A month later, at least three people died in an explosion near a church outside the capital. The number of casualties could have been higher if services had still been going on, according to a police spokesman. The attacks on the church and police station may have been the work of Boko Haram, the nation's officials said this year. Africa's most populous nation is divided between a largely Christian south and a Muslim north. ""Boko Haram"" translates loosely as ""Western education is forbidden/sinful."" The group holds all government authority in contempt and wants to establish a Sharia state in northern Nigeria. Boko Haram has been running religious schools for years, but did not rise to national prominence until it attacked police stations and prisons two years ago. In retaliation, security forces launched a fierce crackdown that destroyed the group's camp and led to the arrest of its leader, Mohammed Yusuf. He died in police custody.","Boko Haram claims responsibility for the blast .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Five gang members have confessed to involvement in last week's torching of a casino in Monterrey in which 52 people were killed, Nuevo Leon Gov. Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz told reporters Monday. The five are members of Los Zetas and carried out the attack because the owners of the casino had not complied with their extortion demands, Medina de la Cruz said, according to the state-run Notimex News Agency. The State Agency of Investigations identified the suspects as Luis Carlos Carrazco Espinosa, 25; Javier Alonso Martinez Morales, alias ""el Javo,"" 37, from Monterrey; Jonathan Jahir Reyna Gutierrez, 18; Juan Angel Leal Flores, 20; and Julio Tadeo Berrones, 28, alias ""El Julio Rayas."" The five have been arrested and ""have confessed, and we have scientific proof that these people participated,"" Medina de la Cruz said. The attorney general's office said evidence points to involvement by all five men, ""some as intellectual authors, others as accomplices and lookouts, others as material authors, others as drivers."" ""Presumably, there was a disagreement and this crime was perpetrated as a reprisal,"" Medina de la Cruz said. At least two other people were being sought for alleged participation in the killings, he said, adding that he would not reveal details that might jeopardize the investigation. The attack appears to have been directed at the casino and not at city residents, ""and the situation got out of the criminals' control."" ""They may not have counted on killing 52 human beings,"" he said. Medina de la Cruz, who was accompanied at the news conference by Nuevo Leon Attorney General Leon Adrian de la Garza, and the state's security spokesman, Jorge Domene, underscored that the investigation into the casino properties is continuing. The governor presented a video that he said showed two vehicles that participated in the attack, with people putting gasoline in tanks later used at the casino. He added that a fingerprint taken from one of the cars led investigators to one of the suspects and, from him, to the others, who have criminal records that include homicide and kidnapping, among other offences. He called for any witnesses who may recognize the suspects to contact authorities. Mexico's Attorney General's Office had offered a 30-million peso ($2.4 million) reward for information leading to the capture of the men they suspect were behind Thursday afternoon's attack in the affluent city. The ambush left a charred shell of a building where the high-end casino had stood. Photos of the scene at the Casino Royale showed singed slot machines. A video released by Mexican authorities showed armed men bursting into the casino carrying what appeared to be gallons of gasoline. Seconds later, dozens of people fled as smoke and fire engulfed the building. On Saturday, 300 soldiers from the Mexican Army and Air Force boarded planes in the nation's capital, bound for Monterrey as part of President Felipe Calderon's plan to help local authorities fight drug trafficking and organized crime, Mexico's defense department said. The number of victims in the casino attack drew national attention in a country where headlines routinely describe brutal drug-related violence. ""It is evident that we are not facing common criminals,"" Calderon said Friday. ""We are facing true terrorists who have crossed all the limits, not only of the law, but also of common sense and respect for life."" Over the past three years, the state of Nuevo Leon in northeastern Mexico has seen an increase in violence due to clashes between rival gangs -- the Gulf Cartel and The Zetas -- over control of drug-trafficking routes to the United States. Two mayors were assassinated in 2010. Last month, four civilians were wounded when two grenades were thrown at a prison in Apodaca. Monterrey, the state's capital, is a key industrial hub and Mexico's wealthiest city. Since 2008, the government has stepped up the military's presence in Nuevo Leon as it tries to crack down on crime. It sent more troops to the state last November. More than 34,600 people have died since Calderon announced a crackdown on cartels in December 2006, according to government statistics. Other reports have listed higher tolls. The latest Mexican government tally was released in January.

"Minot, North Dakota (CNN) -- With record water levels poised to inundate the North Dakota town of Minot, the mayor and the state's governor congratulated citizens on an organized and efficient evacuation . ""It's been a very orderly process,"" Mayor Curt Zimbelman said Wednesday of the evacuation process. Gov. Jack Dalrymple said it had ""gone extremely well."" Earlier Wednesday, sirens sounded in Minot, urging residents to abandon their homes in the face of major flooding.  Water is already overtopping the city's dikes, which are leaking in some places. There are roughly 12,000 people in the evacuation zone in and around Minot. Zimbelman and Dalrymple warned that more water than expected is headed toward the town, and it will likely arrive sooner than expected. The Souris River is expected to crest on Monday, two to three days earlier than had been forecast. Zimbelman said the river is expected to rise to a level five feet higher than any previously recorded. Residents were given until Wednesday evening to evacuate because of what state emergency services spokeswoman Cecily Fong called ""historic proportions of water."" There are also concerns the Souris River may be rising more rapidly than expected, Fong said. The National Weather Service predicted record flooding as heavy rains and dam releases cause the river to swell at Minot. Minot got some support from a hometown hero who was halfway around the world. Actor Josh Duhamel, in Moscow for the ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" premiere, asked for donations to the local Red Cross. ""My heart goes out to all the incredible people of Minot & surrounding areas,"" Duhamel said on his Twitter account. The Souris River, which locals call ""The Mouse"" after the French translation of its name, flows through the center of town, and there are several homes and businesses along its low-lying banks. Fearing the main levees would not hold back the water, emergency workers have been constructing local levees around a school and the Broadway Street Bridge, a main thoroughfare. Residents appear to be heeding evacuation warnings. In a sign they're taking the flooding seriously, some residents were pulling up carpets because they are easier to remove now than after their homes have been inundated with water. Not everyone, however, was planning to evacuate. Troy Erickson, 44, lives across the street from the perimeter of the evacuation zone and said he plans to ride out the flood. His neighbor has a bucket loader and they have distributed several loads of sand and gravel around four houses, which are home to 13 people, he said. They have ""lowered a couple hundred sandbags"" on top of the mixture, he said. ""We've got more sandbags coming to have just in case we need to build it higher,"" said Erickson, a lifelong North Dakotan. ""It if happens, it happens."" He said he is ""a little bit"" frightened because he's never been in this situation, though he was a toddler during the flood of 1969. Minot, in the north central part of the state, is the fourth-largest city in North Dakota. The evacuation order covers a third of its population, Fong said. Residents have until 6 p.m. Wednesday to leave. The river at Minot, which currently stands at close to 1,555 feet above sea level, is forecast to rise to 1,559 feet on Friday or Saturday -- which would be a record. The river hit 1,558 feet above sea level in 1881. The Souris River looks like a ""U."" It swoops in and out of North Dakota from Canada. CNN's Richard Benson contributed to this report.","NEW:Actor Josh Duhamel, who is from Minot, appeals for public's help .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Former NBA guard Javaris Crittenton is wanted in connection with the murder of an Atlanta woman, authorities said Monday. Crittenton, 23, of Fayetteville, Georgia, faces murder charges from the August 19 shooting of 22-year-old Julian Jones in Atlanta. Jones suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at a hospital, the FBI said. Authorities believe Jones was killed in a drive-by shooting involving a dark-colored SUV and an assault rifle. The FBI said Crittenton probably is in Los Angeles with family and friends. He purchased a one-way plane ticket to Los Angeles five days after the shooting. He is also named in a federal arrest warrant for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Crittenton, who played for Georgia Tech before going pro, was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2007 and then traded to the Memphis Grizzlies. He was picked up by the Washington Wizards in December 2008 but was suspended and later released by the NBA in 2010 after a gun-related incident involving teammate Gilbert Arenas. Crittenton's representatives could not be immediately reached for comment Monday.","Crittenton is accused of murdering a 22-year-old woman .

"Rome (CNN) -- Two inmates testified Saturday that Amanda Knox, the American student convicted of murder in Italy, was not actually involved in the killing of her roommate. But they offered two different accounts on who the actual killers were. Three other inmates testified as well. Knox was sentenced last year to 26 years in prison for the death of Meredith Kercher at a house the two shared in Perugia, the central Italian town where both were students. Knox has vehemently proclaimed her innocence and her family has continued to fight the conviction. Two hours of legal wrangling between attorneys passed before the judge decided to allow inmates Mario Alessi and Luciano Aviello to testify. Alessi is serving a life sentence for kidnapping and killing an 18-month-old boy. Alessi testified that Rudy Guede, who has also been convicted in Kercher's murder and is serving a 16-year sentence, told him that neither Knox nor her Italian boyfriend at the time, Raffaele Sollecito, were involved in the killing. Later in the day, Aviello, who has ties to the Naples Mafia, testified that it was his brother who was the killer, together with an Albanian man. According to Alessi, Guede said that he and an unnamed friend visited Kercher to try to get her to participate in sexual acts. When Kercher denied them, Guede's friend forced himself on her, and Guede also participated, Alessi said. At one point, the friend pulled out a knife, and then Guede, who was holding Kercher at the time, noticed she had started bleeding, Alessi testified. Alessi told the court that Guede tried to stop the bleeding, but that his friend urged him to leave. ""We need to finish her otherwise she will tell on us,"" Alessi quoted the friend as telling Guede. The friend then proceeded to inflict another wound on her, Alessi testified. Alessi said Guede remained by himself with Kercher for a while, but eventually left her injured. Prosecutors and the lawyer for Kercher's family questioned the validity of Alessi's testimony. Through his lawyers, Guede denied Alessi's version of events. During his testimony, Aviello gave a different account. Aviello said that on the night of the killing, his brother came home with scratches and other wounds. As Aviello tended to the wounds, his brother confessed to him that he had killed Kercher, he said. According to Aviello, his brother said that he and an Albanian man entered the residence to steal a painting, and in the act ended up killing the girl. Aviello said he hasn't seen his brother in three years. ""Inside me I know that a miscarriage of justice has taken place,"" Aviello said of Knox and Sollecito's conviction. Prosecutors questioned his credibility and Aviello admitted that he has been convicted of defamation seven times. The appeals process will continue June 27, when Guede is expected to testify. In an additional twist Saturday, another inmate who the defense put on the stand to verify Alessi's version of events, testified that he, in fact, did not know anything about who carried out the killings. Even though his cell was adjacent to Alessi's and Guede's, the inmate was Romanian and didn't know what they discussed, he said. Another witness Saturday was Marco Castelluccio, a Mafia member who testified from behind a screen because he is a protected witness. Castelluccio said that he also heard from Guede that Knox had nothing to do with the crime. Kercher, 21, was found dead on November 2, 2007, seminaked with her throat slashed. Knox and Sollecito were both found guilty of the murder. Knox was sentenced in December 2009. Guede, a drifter originally from Ivory Coast, was tried separately. As part of her appeal, forensic experts are retesting evidence that was used to convict Knox. That evidence includes a knife found in Sollecito's apartment with Knox's DNA on the handle and what Perugia prosecutors say is Kercher's DNA in a tiny groove on the blade. The prosecution contends that the knife was used to stab Kercher in the neck and that it had been cleaned. The DNA matter attributed to Kercher consists of flesh, not blood, they say. The sample, however, was so small that forensic scientists investigating Kercher's murder were not able to double-test it in accordance with international forensic science norms, which Knox's legal team says raises doubts about its validity. The second piece of evidence the forensic experts are testing is the tiny metal clasp from Kercher's bra, which was cut from her body after her slaying. Forensic scientists in the investigatory phase determined that Sollecito's DNA is present on the metal clasp. The clasp was identified on an investigatory video the same day Kercher's body was found. But it was not collected until nearly six weeks later, giving the defense cause to question whether the sample may have been contaminated.","Inmates tell different versions of who was behind killing .

"(CNN Student News) -- April 5, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Japan • Atlanta, Georgia . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: You're locked in for 10 minutes of commercial-free news headlines! My name is Carl Azuz, it is Tuesday, April 5th and CNN Student News is up and running. First Up: Change in Plan . AZUZ: The Obama Administration announced yesterday afternoon, that five suspected 9/11 terrorists will get military trials at the U.S. detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Here's why that's significant: before he won the 2008 election, candidate Obama promised he'd close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. And his Justice Department said the terrorism suspects would be tried in civilian courts -- not by military tribunals. Most Americans didn't want those suspects tried in civilian courts. When Attorney General Eric Holder announced the trials at Guantanamo, he criticized Congress for restricting the Justice Department's ability to prosecute the five suspects. Plane Investigation . AZUZ: Hundreds of flights aboard Southwest Airlines have been canceled over the past few days. It's because one of its Boeing-737 passenger jets had a problem on Friday: this. A hole measuring five feet long and one foot wide. It opened up over passengers' heads on a flight from Phoenix, Arizona to Sacramento, California. The pilots made an emergency landing in Yuma, Arizona, and no one was seriously injured. Southwest grounded 79 of its planes to check them out afterward. The model with the problem is an older one. One that's not made anymore. Southwest found indications of cracks in three other aircraft while dozens of others have been inspected and returned to the flight line. Air France Mystery . AZUZ: It's not known exactly what caused the crash of an Air France jet two years ago, though. Flight 447 was traveling from Paris to Rio de Janiero, Brazil, when it went down in the southern Atlantic ocean. That was on June first, 2009. And until recently, large parts of the plane had not been found. On Monday, though, a French government minister said search teams located this: what's believed to be the wreckage of the Airbus 330 plane. The 228 people aboard were killed in the crash. And even if the flight data recorder is located, it's possible it won't be working anymore because of corrosion and water pressure. This area of the Atlantic typically has rough and quickly changing weather. Japan Radiation Fears . AZUZ: This is a shot of radioactive water leaking from one of Japan's damaged nuclear reactors. It's spilling into the Pacific Ocean. Japanese workers have tried a couple different methods to stop this leak; nothing has worked yet. But because so much water has been used to prevent a nuclear meltdown, Japanese officials say they have no choice but to intentionally dump millions of gallons, into the sea. They're hoping a planned silt fence will keep radioactive material from spreading into the ocean. This is just one of the major problems caused by Japan's March 11th earthquake and tsunami -- it killed more than 12,000 people; more than 15,000 are still missing. And Kyung Lah explains how concerns about nuclear contamination are reaching far beyond Japan. (BEGIN VIDEO) KYUNG LAH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: What does this toy monkey have to do with the crisis of the Fukushima nuclear plant? Nothing. But Sven Kilian is still scanning with a Geiger counter. SVEN KILIAN, JAPANTRENDSHOP.COM: It's 0.13 microsievert. LAH: All of his toys and gadgets at Japan trend shop.com. There's a notice on his company's home page to his international customers stating the nuclear crisis has no connection to his exports. KILIAN: People just scared. I understand this. So we just want to prove to everybody and show you don't need to be scared. LAH: But many are afraid. As news reports show countries like Thailand testing Japanese food exports. Hong Kong, screening passengers from Japan for radiation. In the United States, inspectors have picked up traces of radiation from the Fukushima plant on both coasts, including milk in Washington state. None have found dangerous levels of radiation but the headlines add up to a fear of products dubbed made in Japan. Public sentiment does have a real impact on the economy. Japan watchers say in this case, it's an impact that will be felt for some time to come. WILLIAM SAITO, ADVISOR TO JAPANESE GOVERNMENT: This is going to be a measurable impact. And some industries and some companies will not survive. LAH: William Saito is an advisor to Japan's government on the economic fallout of the Fukushima and tsunami crises. Saito believes high-tech, nameless parts to go into vehicles and popular electronics, won't be impacted due to radiation fears. But given a choice between a brand dubbed made in Japan versus another country, consumers will not choose Japan. SAITO: I think that consumer sentiment and going forward, things like this, once they make the decision. It's hard to change, at least for a generation. And this will affect buying habits. LAH: Sven Kilian has this plea to global consumers. KILIAN: Continue buying stuff. This is what helps us in Japan. It doesn't help us if everyone stops buying and panicking now, for no reason. Just makes the economy worse and doesn't help anything. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Which word best describes someone who currently holds an elected office?

That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! 2012 Bid . AZUZ: The incumbent president is officially running for re-election. He made that announcement yesterday when filing papers with the Federal Election Commission -- something every presidential candidate, even an incumbent, must do. No Republican candidates have done that yet, though several are doing research and visiting voters nationwide. Nicole Collins explains why the president's announcement came in April, 2011 for an election that isn't 'til November, 2012. (BEGIN VIDEO) NICOLE COLLINS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The 2012 presidential election begins with this. UNKNOWN: Here it is 2012 the election. COLLINS: A video posted on barackobama.com in which President Obama does not appear and an email from him to his supporters that reads. ""...as my administration and folks across the country fight to protect the progress we've made and make more we also need to begin mobilizing for 2012, long before the time comes for me to begin campaigning in earnest. The president wrote that his campaign would file paperwork with the Federal Election Commission a crucial step that allows him to begin fundraising. The president's early start on his bid for re-election is a move democrats hope will allow him to reach the unprecedented fundraising goal of one billion dollars. The Republican National Committee issued its own web ad in response to the president's announcement. UNKNOWN: We need jobs. We need leadership. Yet, you do nothing as we pile up debts we can't afford. COLLINS: A sentiment echoed by republicans on Capitol Hill amid an ongoing, contentious budget battle. SENATOR JOHN CORNYN, (R) TEXAS: You see the president really, you know, M-I-A., and you see him planning his announcement for his re-election bid. It's kind of like, where are your priorities? This has to be the nation's number one priority at this point, because debt is a national security problem. COLLINS: No republicans have officially announced a bid for the white house but several have made a steady stream of appearances in key early voting states. In Washington, Nicole Collins for CNN Student News. (END VIDEO) Is This Legit? CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is This Legit? Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia. Totally true. Martin Luther King was named ""Michael Luther King Jr."" when he was born in Atlanta in 1929. Remembering Dr. King . AZUZ: And Americans gathered at several locations in Atlanta yesterday to remember the civil rights leader. It was the 43rd anniversary of the day that Dr. King was assassinated. Members of his family were scheduled to lay a wreath at his tomb in Atlanta. Other events included a ceremony hosted by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which Dr. King and his followers organized in the late 1950s. He was at a Memphis hotel when he was killed on April 4th, 1968 -- almost five years after he delivered his famous ""I have a dream speech"" and four years after Dr. King won the Nobel Peace Prize.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama took to the Spanish-language network airwaves Monday  to discuss challenges in educating Hispanics students. In a Univision-sponsored town hall  meeting with Hispanic students and educators at Bell Multicultural High School  in Washington, the president said to out-educate and out-innovate the  global competition, the Latino community must play a key role in the  future. ""Our workforce is going to be more  diverse; it is going to be, to a large percentage, Latino.  And if our young  people are not getting the kind of education they need, we won't succeed as a  nation,"" Obama said. With several students and parents  asking questions about immigration and deportations, Obama said the  answer wouldn't be overnight. He hoped the DREAM Act, which would give kids who have  grown up in the United States an opportunity to earn citizenship despite their family's immigration  status, would be passed in the future. ""We didn't get it passed this time,  but I don't want young people to be giving up because if people in the past had  given up, we probably wouldn't have women's rights, we wouldn't have civil  rights.  So many changes that we've made had to do with young people being  willing to struggle and fight to make sure that their voices are heard,"" said Obama. Carrie Cofer, an English teacher at Lincoln-West High School in  Cleveland, says one challenge she faces with her Hispanic students is that  they haven't been in the United States long  enough to become proficient in English. Although they only read at the  ""first-grade, or second-grade level,"" Cofer and other  teachers are supposed to teach them the material they will need to pass  state-mandated tests in order to graduate from high school and possibly attend  college. It doesn't help that many of the  students don't speak English at home.  ""They don't have the skills because they  don't practice except in the classroom,"" she said. Obama said that strong  programs, including both bilingual education and immersion programs, are key to making sure  bilingual students keep up with their studies while becoming fluent in English.  He said that it's up to both schools and parents. ""We have schools that do it very well;  there are some schools that don't do it as well.  We want to lift up those  models that do it well,"" the president said. ""And parents should be demanding  and insisting that even if your child is not a native English speaker, there is  no reason why they can't succeed in school, and schools have an obligation to  make sure that those children are provided for.  They have rights just like  everybody else."" Latino students make up over 20% of  the pre-kindergarten-through-high-school students in the United States, Secretary of the  Education Arne Duncan said in a conference call with reporters last week. ""These  students face real and growing challenges that we have to  address."" Duncan said that only about half of  all Latino students earn their high school diploma on time, and only one in  eight end up with a bachelor's  degree. The problems faced by Latinos in  high school are unique, said Juan Sepulveda of the White House Initiative on  Educational Excellence for Hispanics. ""We have a small percentage of the  population that has a college degree,"" said Sepulveda. ""Even if you throw in  community college degrees, we only get up to 19%."" Sepulveda said these students are  often the first in their family to go to college, suggesting school officials  need to target parents to make sure they understand what courses their children  need to take to get into college and how student loans work. CNN's Sally Holland contributed to this report.","Education secretary: Only about half of all Latino students earn high school diploma on time .

"(CNN) -- On December 15, 2001, Pakistani border troops came across some 30 al Qaeda fighters in a mountain pass. They had fled the U.S. bombardment of Tora Bora, Osama bin Laden's last stronghold in Afghanistan. The group turned out to be members of the al Qaeda leader's security detail, and U.S. intelligence swiftly dubbed them the ""Dirty Thirty."" They were transferred to U.S. custody in Kandahar and then moved to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba early in 2002. It soon transpired most of the ""Dirty Thirty"" were from Yemen, a country where al Qaeda has an even greater presence today than it did before 9/11. Analysis of many profiles of Guantanamo detainees suggest that becoming a member of al Qaeda in Yemen in the late 1990s was relatively easy, which may explain why (after Afghans and Saudis) Yemenis comprised the third largest group held there. The documents, compiled by the U.S. Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay, show that: . -- A network of al Qaeda recruiters was able to operate in Yemen with virtual impunity. -- Salafist religious institutes in Yemen influenced many to take up jihad and join bin Laden. -- Many of the recruits had little education and few opportunities. The documents were obtained by WikiLeaks and published this week. Several religious institutes in Yemen were fertile al Qaeda recruiting grounds, according to the documents. They included Al Khair Mosque in Sanaa, the Dammaj Institute in Sadah and the al Furqan Institute. The founder of the Dammaj Institute, Sheikh Muqbil bin Hadi al-Wadi, is described in the documents as ""one of the most influential Yemeni Islamic leaders who preached and financed jihad."" (He was also an influence on bin Laden's thinking, but consistently opposed violence against other Muslims.) From the Dammaj Institute, recruits were taken to a training camp in Yemen where they would learn assassination techniques and bomb-making. Rarely did the Yemeni authorities interfere. In fact, the documents suggest Yemeni officials could be bribed to provide medical releases and alter travel documents. Recruiters also had money to assist with airline tickets. Al Qaeda expands presence in Yemen . One of the recruiters was Sharqawi Abdu Ali al-Hajj, a Yemeni who ""had access to the identities of many al Qaeda-related travelers and plausible knowledge of the detainees' travel times and locations,"" according to the documents. Al-Wadi, who died in 2001, and other radical imams in Yemen also provided money to several of the jihadists who would end up among the ""Dirty Thirty."" Many of the young Yemenis who ended up in bin Laden's security detail were capable fighters but poorly educated. Mohammad al-Ansi failed 11th grade three times and worked as a bus driver before turning to jihad. Another detainee never made it past seventh grade, while Mahmud al-Mujahid finally got his high school diploma at 22. Several had odd jobs and felt unable to support their families. Frequently, recruitment into al Qaeda was a family affair. Among those captured in that freezing mountain pass in Pakistan was a 21-year-old by the name of Uthman al-Rahim. His brother was also an al Qaeda fighter and he allegedly had ties to several al Qaeda members responsible for the attack on the USS Cole in 1998. Mahmud al-Mujahidand and his brother were both bodyguards to bin Laden. 2010: USS Cole crew praised at memorial . The Yemeni recruits were given similar basic training before being deployed to the front near Kabul to fight against the Northern Alliance as members of al Qaeda's elite 55th Arab Brigade. They later became bin Laden's bodyguards, according to the profiles. The documents say several of the ""Dirty Thirty"" also took part in a close combat course that bin Laden used to select militants for special operations. Some of the Yemenis were fast-tracked for advanced training. Mohammed al Ansi would later train for an aborted al Qaeda operation in southeast Asia to hijack airliners and crash them into U.S. military bases in the region. Bin Laden planned to use Yemenis in the operation because they could easily travel to the region, according to another detainee. Others ran training camps or safe houses. Hamza al-Qaiti was one; he was at large until 2008, when he was killed in Yemen. The Guantanamo documents might be solely of historical interest were it not for Yemen's chronic instability today, and the growing presence of al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula in the provinces of Shabwa, Abyan and Hadramut. Even though Yemeni security forces have stepped up operations against al Qaeda in the last year, U.S. officials describe al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula as the most effective operational arm of the group. John Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said in December the group was ""increasingly active"" in reaching out to find terrorist recruits, even in the United States, and was ""the most operationally active node of the al Qaeda network."" It was in Yemen that the alleged Detroit ""underwear"" bomber was recruited and trained in 2009. Al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula militants have killed dozens of Yemeni soldiers and police; earlier this month Islamist militants briefly occupied a town in southern Yemen and raided an ammunition factory. The Guantanamo documents suggest that Yemen remains a recruiting ground for al Qaeda, with one written in 2008 saying Yemeni sheikhs ""continue to recruit Yemeni youth to participate in hostilities against U.S. and coalition forces."" That's perhaps why today so many Yemenis are left at Guantanamo. The risk of sending them home to a volatile country with a history of jail breaks and a vibrant al Qaeda franchise is too great. Of the 112 Yemenis taken to the detention center over the past nine years, nearly 90 are still there. (The New York Times, which has seen all the Guantanamo documents, reports that 23 have been sent back to Yemen and two died in custody.) Few of those left are likely to be leaving anytime soon.","WikiLeaks releases documents on al Qaeda detainees from Yemen .

"(CNN) -- A 1-year-old child whose family fought a Canadian hospital over whether he should be allowed to die will likely have an operation to allow the insertion of a breathing tube by the end of the week, his new hospital said. Joseph Maraachli, widely known in the media as Baby Joseph, is being evaluated by doctors at SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center, a Catholic hospital in St. Louis, hospital spokesman Bob Davidson said. The hospital had planned to have a press conference on Tuesday but canceled it ""because there is not yet a firm treatment plan,"" he said in a statement late Monday. But the head of pediatrics at the hospital, Robert Wilmott, expects a tracheotomy to go ahead by the end of the week, the statement said. A tracheotomy is a surgical procedure to create an opening into the airway through an incision in the neck. A tube allows for suction of fluid out of the lungs, creates a safe and stable way to use a mechanical ventilator, and is more comfortable for the child, the statement said. Joseph, who has a deteriorating neurological condition, was transferred to Cardinal Glennon Sunday from a hospital in London, Ontario. Joseph, who was born in January 2010, had been in the care of the London Health Sciences Centre in Canada since October. His doctor, in court papers, said that ""all cranial nerve functions are now absent"" and there is no hope for recovery. He recommended that the infant's breathing tube be removed and he be allowed to die. The child's parents, Moe and Sana Maraachli, sought instead to have their son receive a tracheotomy combined with continued mechanical ventilation so that he could be transferred home, where he would be cared for by his family. The child's aunt, Samar Nadar, has said that in 2002 the Maraachlis' daughter died at home with a tracheotomy after suffering a similar condition. In January, a Canadian Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the hospital, saying it could remove the child's breathing tube without a replacement, and issue a do-not-resuscitate order and recommendations on palliative care. The Maraachlis fought to have their son relocated to a U.S hospital for a second opinion. The hospital in Canada said it would not perform a tracheotomy because it is an invasive procedure typically recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine. In a statement on the hospital's website, it says Joseph's transfer on Sunday happened ""despite the strongest possible medical advice to the contrary from medical experts."" The Maraachli case gained the attention of pro-life groups including Priests for Life and the Terri Schiavo Life and Hope Network, who organized prayer vigils and rallies in support of the family. In February, the hospital began receiving threats and increased security to protect its staff. Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, flew to Ontario Sunday night to help with the transfer. He issued a news release saying: ""After around-the-clock negotiations, this really became a race against time."" Joseph ""needs to be in a hospital that cherishes life over the bottom line,"" he said. CNN Medical Producer Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.","The child has a deteriorating neurological condition .

"Watch the full interview with Larry Flynt tonight. ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" airs weeknights on CNN/US at 9 p.m. ET and on CNN International at 0200 GMT (Live simulcast), 1200 GMT and 2000 GMT / HKT 2000 . CNN -- ""I don't have any regrets,"" Larry Flynt tells CNN's Piers Morgan. ""And I do feel that I've done a great deal to expand the parameters of free speech."" The ""Hustler"" magazine publisher, free speech advocate, and the man whom Morgan called ""America's king of porn"" will be a guest on Wednesday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Flynt's new book, ""One Nation Under Sex: How the Private Lives of Presidents, First Ladies, and Their Lovers Changed the Course of American History,"" presents an in-depth study of the sex lives of U.S. presidents. Flynt told Morgan that he reached out to Columbia University history professor David Eisenbach when he decided to write the book partly because ""nobody would want to read a history book written by a pornographer."" Flynt and Eisenbach's research uncovered facts about presidents that they themselves unearthed. For example, the youngest-ever first lady was 19. After Grover Cleveland's wife died during the campaign, he married his young nanny. ""What does that mean, culturally speaking,"" asked Flynt. ""Today we would not accept an 18 or 19-year-old girl as first lady."" When Morgan asked who the most sexually promiscuous president was, Flynt said it was a toss-up between Warren G. Harding and John F. Kennedy. Morgan also asked if a rumor that Kennedy would have been disgraced in a year or so -- had he not been assassinated -- were true, Flynt said it was ""probably true."" In the book, Flynt refers to Bill Clinton as ""the loveable rogue"" because even though he lied, Clinton ""always wore it on his sleeve. He didn't hide it like many of the conservative Republicans do. So the nation was able to forgive him."" Sex scandals have been prevalent since the founding fathers established the United States Constitution. Flynt pointed out that Thomas Jefferson fathered children with one of his slaves, and first lady Dolly Madison ""almost single handedly turned the White House into a brothel."" Flynt also stated that ""most people are under the impression that if somebody is promiscuous that they can't be a good president. There's nothing more ridiculous than that."" When Morgan asked whether ""most of the greatest American presidents would have been unfaithful,"" Flynt replied ""yes,"" to which Morgan observed ""there seems to be a link between naughty boys and good presidents."" Flynt was nearly assassinated in 1978 when he was shot outside a courthouse. No one was ever charged in the shooting, but Flynt maintains the sniper was a white man upset about an interracial photo shoot published in ""Hustler."" Flynt remains partially paralyzed and uses a wheelchair. Flynt told Morgan that he doesn't look back at that day and that when people ask him what being in a wheelchair is like, he tells them he ""wouldn't have even thought about it"" had they not mentioned it. Morgan also asked Flynt why the issue of freedom of speech means so much to him. ""Freedom of speech is not freedom for the fellow you love,"" answered Flynt. ""It's freedom for the fellow you hate the most. And a democracy can't exist without free speech and the right to assemble. And that's what Americans tend to forget. And they're born into a culture where they take all of their freedoms for granted."" ""When I first started out,"" continued Flynt, ""I used to buy into a former Supreme Court justice's argument that you can't scream fire in a crowded theater. Well, I think you can."" Morgan asked Flynt what his preferred news headline would be following his death, ""Larry Flynt, pornographer,"" ""Larry Flynt, free speech campaigner,"" or ""Larry Speech, lifelong controversialist."" Flynt told Morgan he wanted something ""much bigger than that. I always felt Moses freed the Jews, Lincoln freed the slaves, and I wanted to free all the neurotics. And I realized in the process that I've helped millions of people get through puberty. I think that's a great accomplishment."" Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNET) -- Its shape and feature set will be familiar to anyone who's seen other Pavilion dv6000 series laptops, but the Special Edition HP Pavilion dv6985se stands out for two reasons. First, its upscale design includes an eye-catching, copper-colored lid and silver interior, both bearing a faint imprint that looks like etching. The other special feature: a 12-cell battery that provided one of the longest battery lives we've seen in CNET Labs. Otherwise, the Pavilion dv6985se is a fairly typical mainstream laptop, with a decent feature set and strong performance. Of course, the features that make the Pavilion dv6985se special are also its downside. That extra battery does add weight, and the flashy design certainly isn't for everyone (though we happen to love it). Users who want something more portable or more subdued should look to the Sony Vaio NR498, which offers similar performance and features (but lacks multimedia controls) for a slightly lower price. Or you could scrap the 15-inch size entirely and go for a 14-inch model like the Gateway T-6836 or the Sony Vaio CR510. The Pavilion dv6815se's shape is essentially the same as the Pavilion dv6915nr we reviewed earlier this summer. The ""Special Edition"" designation, however, warrants a spiffy new color scheme; in the case of the Pavilion dv6985se, that means a shiny copper-colored lid and display bezel with a silver keyboard deck and keys. Both the lid and wrist-rest incorporate a subtle imprint design of narrow stripes that morph into organic shapes reminiscent of Art Nouveau; the pattern even extends across the touch pad. The overall effect is very appealing--certainly more expensive-looking than its actual price (more so when you factor in Best Buy currently offers it with a $100 discount)--but also seems destined to look slightly dated by the time you graduate. The Pavilion dv6985se we reviewed differs from its siblings in one other significant way: the laptop includes a bulky 12-cell battery that raises the back of the system an inch and contributes to its hefty 6.6-pound weight. (With HP's standard Pavilion battery, the system would weigh closer to 6 pounds--but a smaller battery isn't an option on this fixed configuration.) The extra juice will come in handy when cranking out term papers, but you probably won't enjoy carrying the laptop to the library. The 15.4-inch wide-screen display on the HP Pavilion dv6985se has a typical 1,280x800 native resolution, which is standard for a screen this size. The screen's glossy finish produces rich colors and contrast; we found it minimally distracting while surfing the Web and typing e-mail but quite enjoyable for watching movies. A 1.3-megapixel Webcam above the display lets users conduct video chats. Typing was comfortable on the Pavilion dv6985se's nearly full-size keyboard. The wide touch pad includes a scroll zone, and we love the on/off button above the pad, which is handy when you want to use an external mouse or just type without worrying about misplacing the cursor. Above the keyboard sits a row of light-touch controls to launch HP's QuickPlay media player, control disc playback, and adjust volume. Perhaps to maintain the laptop's polished aesthetic, HP left off the handy port labels found on the keyboard deck of nearly every other Pavilion laptop. The HP Pavilion dv6985se includes most of the ports and connections we'd expect to see on a laptop of its size, though the Sony Vaio NR498 does manage to squeeze one more USB port into its similar footprint. (We have a feeling a USB port was jettisoned to make room for the HP Expansion Port, which lets you connect to an HP docking station.) The HP also lacks Bluetooth, which is surprising given its otherwise upscale bent. We do like the Pavilion's dual headphone jacks, which make it easy to share movies and music with friends. We're less impressed with the Altec Lansing stereo speakers, which are loud and clear but produce too-treble sound. The retail-only Pavilion dv6985se comes in a single fixed configuration that includes a 2.0GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor--part of Intel's previous-generation Centrino platform and the standard for mainstream systems--plus a generous 4GB of RAM. Paired with 64-bit Windows Vista, that 4GB of RAM gave the Pavilion dv6985se a notable boost on our Photoshop CS3 benchmark, where the first three spots among Back-to-School systems went to 64-bit-equipped laptops. Otherwise, the Pavilion dv6985se performed admirably on CNET Labs' benchmarks, showing enough multitasking and processing oomph for all your scholarly pursuits (and diversions). As mentioned above, the HP Pavilion dv6985se includes a massive 12-cell battery that adds significant weight to the system. But it just might be worth schlepping around: it ran for 5 hours and 17 minutes on CNET Labs' video playback drain test. That's one of the lengthiest battery scores we've seen, and bests all our other mainstream Back-to-School systems, which featured six-cell batteries, by nearly 2 hours. Our video playback battery drain test is especially grueling, so you can expect even longer life from casual Web surfing and office use. HP backs the Pavilion dv6985se with an industry-standard one-year warranty. Toll-free telephone support is available 24-7 during your warranty period, and the HP support Web site includes real-time chat with a tech representative.

Brooklyn, New York (Motherboard.tv) -- Video game pioneer Richard Garriott resides in a castle-like mansion outside of Austin, Texas, that would be the fantasy dwelling for any grown-up kid. But his favorite place to live is a five-bedroom fixer-upper some 250 miles up. In 2008, Garriott parlayed his success in the video game industry into a lifelong dream: to fly to the International Space Station. ""Literally, throughout my entire professional career, I've been investing in the privatization of space,""says Garriott.""Helping to unlock the gates of private space travel."" Life back on Earth is far from boring for Lord British, as he's known to video game fanatics the world over. Over the years, he's amassed a spectacular array of toys, ranging from medieval weapons to a fully-functional observatory dome. Britannia Manor, Garriott's haunted house/amusement park residence in Austin is a veritable shrine to discovery, teeming with sentimental and inventive nods to the importance of science and curiosity. In 2009, Motherboard producer Juan Carlos Pineiro-Escoriaza traveled to Garriott's home to learn how his whimsical yet inherently scientific modus operandi is helping to usher in a new generation of exploration. Not to mention, securing his seat as ""nerd par excellence"" for brandishing an impressive collection of rare and unreleased versions of ""The Lord of the Rings"" series. So jealous. Garriott is perhaps most famous for developing the seminal video game series, ""Ultima""and coining the term Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game, or MMORPG, under his Lord British moniker. His success as a game developer earned him a stately fortune, with which he had long hoped to become the first private citizen to go to space. He wasn't the first -- the burst of the dot-com bubble led Garriott to sell his spot to Dennis Tito. Garriott would become the sixth private citizen to reach space, a distinction held only by a handful of people, including engineer and first self-funded woman and Iranian citizen in space, Anousheh Ansari and entrepreneur/philanthropist/poker player Guy Lalibert. But don't call them space tourists -- they're ""spaceflight participants"" who've paid millions and spent years in training (and learning Russian) in preparation for orbit. See the rest of ""Richard Garriott A.K.A. Lord British"" Garriott's salad days were spent nearby Texas' Johnson Space Center, where his father, scientist and early space shuttle astronaut Owen Garriott was stationed. He grew up in a community of astronauts and rocket scientists, nurturing his belief that space would become a common destination for everyone -- sooner rather than later. With the space shuttle program gearing up for its last two scheduled flights, Garriott has become an ambassador of the next monumental relationship between mankind and the cosmos -- the privatization of space. When the space shuttle program does finally end in June, leaving behind an exciting 30-year history, some of NASA's facilities will be turned over to Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), the leading contender in an industry poised to help NASA send astronauts and materials to the ISS. Meanwhile, an important corollary to missions contracted by the government are those with more regal intentions, such as Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, which aims to offer sub-orbital spaceflights to anyone who can shell out $200,000 for a flight. Somewhere in between this new spectrum of chartered space flight sits pioneers like Garriott, who is showing that even without NASA's support, everyone should get excited outer space, and have a chance to get there too.","Video game pioneer Richard Garriott is also avid space fan .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- The final autopsy report on a San Diego State exchange student whose body was pulled from a Madrid river last March indicates an accidental drowning death with no signs of external violence, a Spanish court official said on Tuesday. The student, Austin Taylor Bice, 22, was studying a semester of business courses at the University of Carlos III in Madrid when he went missing after a night out with friends. He was last seen outside a nightclub on the banks of Madrid's Manzanares River. Ten days later, on March 8, police pulled his body from the river. ""There was nothing found in the body that would indicate external factors in the death. There were no wounds on the body,"" said the official from Madrid's Superior Justice Tribunal. He spoke on the customary condition of anonymity. He said the autopsy also showed a ""high level"" of alcohol in the blood. A Madrid judge has kept the case, which is confidential by law, open for further investigation. There was no immediate word on when it might be closed definitively, the official said. After his disappearance, Bice's friends quickly organized a campaign to put up posters of him around Madrid, which read ""Missing. Austin Taylor Bice. U.S. citizen, 22, 1.95 meters tall and 100 kilograms"" (6 feet, 5 inches and 220 pounds), and Spanish and U.S. media reported on the search. Bice's father Larry, an accountant, rushed to Madrid from San Diego to search for his son and met several times with Spanish and U.S. authorities. The family hired private investigators, at first to try to find the student, and later, after his body was recovered, to try to determine what happened, the elder Bice told CNN. At the time of the search, a family member told CNN in Madrid that contrary to initial reports, Bice was not refused entry to the nightclub by doormen and was not drunk, although ""he had a few beers."" Instead, he just decided to go home. On March 8, when police recovered the body, an initial visual inspection did not indicate any signs of violence, Madrid officials said at the time. The U.S.-based Institute of International Education said that in 2007, Spain was the third most popular destination worldwide for Americans studying abroad, after the United Kingdom and Italy. It said there were about 17,000 American students in Spain. The University of Carlos III, where Bice was studying, has 18,000 students, of whom 1,500 are from abroad, including about 220 Americans, Carlos Lopez Terradas, the school's head of international relations, told CNN in early March.","Student went missing after a night out with friends .

"(CNN) -- The Norse god of thunder makes his big-screen debut in the latest Marvel movie, the first of three heading our way this summer. Portents are good for future developments, but director Kenneth Branagh makes heavy weather of the back story. If you're not up on your Viking mythology, Thor is the guy with the hammer and the tempestuous temper. In Stan Lee's resurrection, his father, Odin, punished Thor's recklessness by condemning him to a double life as Dr. Donald Blake, a physician who would pick up the cudgel when evil threatened mankind. The movie gives us a brand new deity who is also a bit of both. The story teeter-totters between the exiled Thor crash-landing in New Mexico -- where he's immediately run over by Natalie Portman's storm-chasing astrophysicist, Jane -- and Asgard, where he vies with half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to vanquish the Ice Giants (not a hockey team) and win the respect of their father (Anthony Hopkins, gamely trying to inject some Lear-like gravitas while modeling an eye patch and several bespoke bronze helmets). An unholy combination of a Vegas penthouse and Disney palazzo, Asgard is a computer-generated Valhalla with gold fixtures and diaphanous walls revealing Hubblesque views of the cosmos. A vast waterfall drains out into space, and an electric highway allows the gods to drop in on any of the nine realms, one of which is Earth. The stereoscopic scenery is impressive, but the screenwriters have a tin ear for god-speak, settling for something between Shakespeare and the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Presumably this is why Marvel turned the reins over to Ken Branagh, whose credentials include ""Hamlet,"" ""Henry V"" and ""Much Ado About Nothing."" Branagh has a penchant for back-slapping bluster and bravado, as well as the kind of kinky camera-angles that make you wonder if someone's tripod has lost a leg -- which pretty well describes the movie's exhaustingly lop-sided first act. ""Thor"" is on much safer ground here on Earth. The tone is immediately different: more relaxed; comic, not cosmic, as Jane and her colleagues (a wisecracking Kat Dennings and mistrustful Stellan Skarsgard) figure out whether the blond muscle man who fell to Earth is a lunatic or a miracle. In this incarnation, Thor has lost his power tool -- the hammer affectionately known as Mjolnir -- but he has kept his wits about him and takes his new circumstances in his stride. iReport: ""Natalie Portman should give her Oscar back"" Beefy Australian newcomer Chris Hemsworth seems to be channeling the young Branagh in his portrait of an impetuous, gallant alpha male, burning to be king. There's no finesse in the performance, but broad strokes are all it takes; the other actors just bounce off him, and the movie finds its sense of fun. But it never settles for long. All the substantial plotting takes place on the astral plane in Asgard. The New Mexico episodes feel like a sideshow. iReport: Fans rave for ""Thor"" In essence another plank in the elaborate foundation work for the forthcoming ""Avengers"" movie, what ""Thor"" sorely lacks is a center of gravity. On the other hand, it is as spectacular as $150 million can buy and very much at the milder end of the PG-13 spectrum. It should hook legions of kids, who can look forward to years more Thor ­-- probably bigger and better ­-- in the future.","Thor, the Norse god of thunder, gets an updated look .

"(WIred) -- Have you been wondering if that new 4G smartphone you purchased is really getting 4G speeds? Wonder no longer. RootMetrics performed an extensive study to determine how each network's 4G speeds are holding up to their claims. The testing was performed across the Seattle area. Their findings showed that Verizon's LTE network performed at a 100 percent data-success rate. Its average data speeds were between four and 14.5 times faster than competitors, and average upload speeds were between 4.7 and 49.3 times faster. The phone models tested included the HTC Thunderbolt (Verizon), HTC Inspire (AT&T), HTC Evo (Sprint) and Samsung Galaxy S (T-Mobile). RootMetrics' CEO Paul Griff said that the smartphone model and its hardware had very little to do with 4G performance -- that performance is almost all network related. Wired has previously broken down what each carrier means by 4G, and what speeds should be expected from each service. Verizon's LTE network promises speeds of 5-12 Mbps down and 1-5 Mbps up; AT&T's HSPA+ network should provide 6 Mbps down (and they plan to upgrade to LTE in 2011); Sprint's WiMax technology promises an average of 3-6 Mbps down and 0.6-1.4 Mbps up; and T-Mobile's HSPA+ is supposed to provide 5-10 Mbps down. AT&T has reportedly been capping 4G speeds on Android handsets, but this has not been definitively verified. Over in Oakland, California, the folks at TechnoBuffalo decided to perform a 4G speed test of their own using the HTC Inspire and Thunderbolt. Using SpeedTest.net's services and the phones' Wi-Fi hotspot modes, they discovered median speeds of 8.85 Mbps down and 3.68 up on Verizon's LTE network, and 2.16 Mbps down and .16 up on AT&T's HSPA+ service -- on par with RootMetrics' results. RootMetrics was careful to point out that merely achieving high data speeds doesn't mean much unless it happens on a regular basis, though. It found that Verizon's 4G download speeds were greater than 10 Mbps about 90 percent of the time, and their upload speeds were between 5 and 10 Mbps 100 percent of the time. And Verizon's average upload speeds were faster than every other carrier's average download speeds by 37 percent. A graph of how often each 4G service achieved a certain range of download speeds (from 0-500 Kbps to greater than 10 Mbps) shows Verizon dominating the high end, AT&T spending most of its time in the lower half, and Sprint and T-Mobile's services ranging widely throughout. How will AT&T and T-Mobile's recently announced merger affect their 4G services? That's yet to be seen. ""Our results stand alone and provide interesting context around consumer data experience for both carrier's networks in the Seattle area,"" said a representative from RootMetrics. Until it is known how and if the two carriers will combine their networks, it's difficult to say how the merger will affect their future 4G service. But it's safe to say, unless it's LTE, it won't hold a candle to Verizon's network. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(Rolling Stone) -- This has been the first rock & roll decade without revolution, or true revolutionaries, to call its own. The Fifties witnessed nothing less than the birth of the music. The Sixties were rocked by Beatlemania, Motown, Phil Spector, psychedelia and Bob Dylan. The Seventies gave rise to David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, heavy metal, punk and New Wave. In comparison, the Eighties have been the decade of, among other things, synth pop, Michael Jackson, the compact disc, Sixties reunion tours, the Beastie Boys and a lot more heavy metal. But if the past ten years haven't exactly been the stuff of revolution, they have been a critical time of re-assessment and reconstruction. Musicians and audiences alike have struggled to come to terms with rock's parameters and possibilities, its emotional resonance and often dormant social consciousness. Rolling Stone's Original 1980 Review . The following survey of the 100 best albums of the Eighties, as selected by the editors of Rolling Stone, shows that the music and the values it stands for have been richer for the struggle. Punks got older and more articulate in their frustration and rage, while many veteran artists responded to that movement's challenge with their most vital work in years. And rap transformed the face -- and voice -- of popular music. The first 10 entries here span the Clash's polyglot punk, Prince's crossover funkadelica, Afro-bop from Talking Heads and Paul Simon and hymns of innocence and experience by U2 and Tracy Chapman. Further down the list, old-timers like Dylan, the Stones and Lou Reed hit new highs; Public Enemy and Run-D.M.C. kicked out some serious streetwise jams; Metallica and Guns n' Roses established new hard-rock beachheads; and Hüsker Dü, Sonic Youth and the Replacements offered definitive statements of postpunk angst. The embarrassment of riches on this list is all the more remarkable, since arthritic radio programming, corporate sponsorship and outbursts of racism and sexism in rap and metal have complicated rock's present and raised fears for its future. Best-of lists such as this one are by nature subjective. But rock in the Eighties was like that -- lively, varied, contentious and, to some degree, inconclusive. Looking at the best rock has had to offer in the Eighties, it's clear that there's plenty of life left in the old beast yet. The next revolution may be just around the corner. See the full list of 100 best albums of the 1980s here. 1. The Clash, ""London Calling"" This album could not have come at a more perfect time or from a more appropriate band than the Clash. Released stateside in January 1980, with the decade but a pup and the new year in gear, ""London Calling"" was an emergency broadcast from rock's Last Angry Band, serving notice that Armageddon was nigh, Western society was rotten at the core, and rock & roll needed a good boot in the rear. 2. Prince and the Revolution, ""Purple Rain"" Released in tandem with the film of the same name, ""Purple Rain"" was more than simply a soundtrack, and it stands as Prince's most cohesive and accessible album. ""He envisioned the film as he made the album,"" says Alan Leeds, vice-president of Paisley Park Records, Prince's label. ""He had a vision in his mind of the film a year before he got in front of the cameras, and he wrote the music to that vision."" 3. U2, ""The Joshua Tree"" ""The Joshua Tree"" is the rather esoterically titled album he's referring to -- a title that even the typically solemn Bono could joke about. 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: 'London Calling' by the Clash . 4. Talking Heads, ""Remain in Light"" ""Remain in Light"" may have been a commercial disappointment, but musically, the band's 1980 album -- which combines funk, disco and African rhythms -- was years ahead of its time. ""It got great critical acclaim, and we felt that it kind of took popular music to the next phase,"" says Frantz, ""which is what we always wanted to do."" 5. Paul Simon, ""Graceland"" The journey to ""Graceland"" began with an unlabeled cassette tape that guitarist Heidi Berg gave to Simon, who listened to it incessantly, without knowing what it was, throughout the summer of 1984. 6. Bruce Springsteen, ""Born in the U.S.A."" ""Born in the U.S.A."" -- the album, the song and the sixteen-month tour -- turned out to be the breakthrough that Springsteen fans had been expecting for a decade. The influential Jersey musician became the world's biggest rock star -- and a bona fide American icon, to boot. 7. Michael Jackson, ""Thriller"" ""Thriller,"" reportedly recorded for $750,000, has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide -- and it still sells. It earned Jackson over 150 gold and platinum awards worldwide and a record seven Grammys. 8. R.E.M., ""Murmur"" The members of R.E.M. incorporated elements of folk and country music into pop that was, by turns, bright and murky. Theirs was a quasi-traditional yet boundary-breaking sound that served as a blueprint for alternative bands throughout America for the rest of the decade. 9. Richard and Linda Thompson, ""Shoot Out the Lights"" ""Even in the best days of our marriage, Richard and I didn't communicate with each other fabulously well,"" says Linda Thompson. ""I think that the reason the music was good was that we tended to save it for work."" Perhaps that explains why ""Shoot Out the Lights"" is both the best and last album Richard and Linda Thompson made together. 10. Tracy Chapman, ""Tracy Chapman"" Tracy Chapman was discovered in 1987 by fellow Tufts University student Brian Koppelman. ""I was helping organize a boycott protest against apartheid at school, and someone told me there was this great protest singer I should get to play at the rally,"" says Koppelman, who now works in A&R at Elektra. He went to see Chapman perform at a coffeehouse called Cappuccino. ""Tracy walked onstage, and it was like an epiphany,"" he says. ""Her presence, her voice, her songs, her sincerity -- it all came across."" See the full list of 100 best albums of the 1980s here.

"(WIRED) -- And then there was Chrome. Apple made it clear this week that the next version of its Safari browser -- which will ship with the upcoming version of Mac OS -- will include the ability for users to tell websites not to track them, by using what's known as the 'Do Not Track' header, according to The Wall Street Journal. It's a technically simple change that Mozilla (the maker of Firefox) and Microsoft (the maker of IE) have already included in their newest browsers. Those companies included the change despite the fact that no one has actually defined what tracking is. So far only two ad networks, Blue Kai and Chitika, have pledged to obey the flag. That leaves Chrome, the browser created by the online-advertising giant Google, alone in not supporting the nascent feature. And according to Google, it has no plans to do so anytime soon. ""The idea of 'Do Not Track' is interesting, but there doesn't seem to be wide consensus on what 'tracking' really means, nor on how new proposals could be implemented in a way that respects people's current privacy controls,"" a Google spokeswoman told Wired.com by e-mail. ""We're encouraged that standards bodies are working on these issues, and we will continue to be involved closely."" Instead of ""Do Not Track,"" Google says it offers a plug-in for Chrome called ""Keep My Opt-Outs,"" which prevents users from deleting opt-out cookies from advertising networks when they delete their cookies. Third-party ad networks, including Google's Display Ad network, use cookies on the sites they advertise on to watch what users do across the net, in order to make guesses about their interests. They then can sell ad space at a premium to advertisers, offering them the opportunity to show ads for trucks only to young men interested in sports, for instance. Currently, none of those networks pays any heed to users who choose to turn on the ""Do Not Track"" flag, but do pledge to respect opt-out cookies that can be set in bulk on the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page. Google says it will have a version of the cookie-retaining plug-in for IE and Firefox soon. The plug-in Google built mimics the functionality of one built by Indiana University security researcher Christopher Soghoian in 2009, drawing on Google's own open source code. Ironically, Soghoian was also the first to suggest the idea of a DNT header, rather than a centralized list, and helped build the first prototype last summer. Soghoian says Google's current lack of support from its ad side is ""pretty shocking,"" given that the company just got slapped by the FTC over privacy. ""Even more shocking is the lack of support from the Chrome team,"" Soghoian says, pointing out that Google Chrome routinely supports tech specs that haven't been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force or IETF. Still, Google has a point about the ambiguity of ""Do Not Track."" In fact, Apple has many of the same concerns. In a new paper about online privacy (.pdf) submitted to the W3C standards-setting body, Apple questioned what ""tracking"" means online. It argued that sending a ""Do Not Track"" signal to a website would only work for sites that decide to obey it, calling it ""akin to hanging a 'privacy, please' door hanger on an unlocked door -- most will respect it, but the persistent will simply walk in."" There is, therefore, an urgent need to document what, fairly exactly, it means. What stops working? If nothing stops working, from the user's point of view, there is a risk that it will be turned on all the time. Can I login? Buy something? What constitutes 'track'? If someone buys something, I can obviously record the purchase, and pretty clearly the affect [sic] on my inventory. Am I allowed to record statistical data (e.g. the type of goods bought at different times of day)? At what point does this 'personally derived data' turn into 'tracking'? Even though the FTC and the Commerce Department are behind the new technology, both companies are correct that it's not clear what counts as tracking. For instance, if you are signed into your Facebook or Google account, can those sites catalog what you do, even if you have the flag on? What about companies that provide analysis of what users do in bulk on a website -- such as telling you how many people visited a given page and how many pages on average a visitor looks at? And what about so-called ""A/B"" testing tools that let sites experiment by showing one logo to one set of visitors and another to a different set of users, to see which logo is more likely to convince people to sign up for the service? But Soghoian argues that both Google's ad program and its analytics program already let users opt out, so why not simply adopt the ""Do Not Track"" flag as another signal to opt out. Answering his own question, he says it's about money that Google stands to lose if users of its browser get an easy way to opt out of its advertising tracking. ""The opt-out cookies and their plug-in are not aimed at consumers,"" Soghoian says. ""They are aimed at policy makers. Their purpose is to give them something to talk about when they get called in front of Congress. No one is using this plug-in and they don't expect anyone to use it."" Of all the major browser makers, Google would have the most to lose if many people starting setting the flag and companies were forced, by public opinion or law, to obey it. While Google's largest source of ad money -- search ads related to search terms -- doesn't rely on behavioral tracking, its growing business of display advertising (on other websites and in YouTube) does. Ironically, the DNT header is likely not to affect Facebook, the net's single largest display advertiser and the one company Google seems to fear. Although the social networking site knows every page you visit that has a ""Like"" button or Facebook widget (at least while you are signed into Facebook), the company says it doesn't keep that data for long and doesn't use it to create a profile. Instead, it targets the ads inside Facebook relying on the data its users put in its profile -- which is not likely to count as ""tracking"" if a spec is finalized. In that process, Google's concerns are being ironed out, according to Soghoian. A first pass by a Mozilla engineer and two Stanford researchers at defining the problem for the IETF suggests that sites that get opt-in consent from users can ignore the flag. So, for example, if Facebook asked users if they would mind having Facebook know what sites they visit around the web with ""Like"" buttons, Facebook can make use of that data, even if a user has the ""Do Not Track"" setting. Tracking users around your own site would be fine, as would be analytics software, including those run by third parties, so long as the data isn't shared with other companies. Even if Google adopts it, right now the tool is in some ways toothless. In absence of legislation, the ""Do Not Track"" header doesn't mean anything legally -- unless a company promises to obey it, but then doesn't. That's a situation the FTC or state attorneys general could look into under current law. But otherwise, an ad network can simply ignore it, with no legal consequences. Privacy legislation introduced this week by Sens. John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) and John McCain (R-Arizona) tightens information-sharing rules, and could include a mandate requiring U.S. companies to follow the DNT flag. And finally, Apple and Microsoft's decision to include the ""Do Not Track"" header in their browsers (and Google's not to) brings up the question of how such a rule would apply on mobile devices and whether there should be a ""Do Not Track"" flag for mobile apps. Right now, there's no way to get a ""Do Not Track"" --capable browser on the iPhone, and Android users need to switch to Firefox Mobile to get the flag. Mobile apps have come under scrutiny from the press and even the Justice Department for allegedly mining users' data in secret. But to have a ""Do Not Track"" setting for apps would require the app platform makers -- Google, Apple, RIM and Microsoft -- to bake it into their OSes, which is a trickier situation businesswise, because the two dominant platform makers, Google and Apple, are battling over supremacy in the growing market for in-app ads. Which is a long way of saying that the ""Do Not Track"" header is a simple technical change that is likely to have profound effects on the online world and the politics that surround it. Chrome didn't have to be last to the antitracking party, which shows no sign of ending soon, because Google was in on the first call when the idea was proposed, according to Soghoian. ""Google could have been first, but instead they will be last,"" Soghoian said. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- Tottenham fought back to clinch a 3-3 draw with Arsenal that further dented their north London rivals' English Premier League title hopes as another capital club, Chelsea, claimed second place on Wednesday. Arsenal led 3-1 five minutes before halftime, but fifth-placed Tottenham rallied with a stunning strike from Tom Huddlestone and then a Rafael van der Vaart penalty after the break. The result allowed defending champions Chelsea to go second on goal difference after a 3-1 victory at home to Birmingham, leaving Manchester United six points clear with five games to play after Tuesday's 0-0 draw with Newcastle. Alex Ferguson's United are in pole position, but the May 1 trip to Arsenal and the home clash with Chelsea the following week will have a massive bearing on the title outcome. Man United draw a blank at Newcastle . Chelsea also face an April 30 home clash with Tottenham, who can still qualify for next season's Champions League after moving to within two points of fourth-placed Manchester City -- a team Harry Redknapp's men will travel north to face on May 10. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has now seen his team draw five of the last six league matches, including Sunday's demoralizing 1-1 stalemate with Liverpool when both goals came in a lengthy period of stoppage time. ""It's not over -- we'll fight,"" the Frenchman told reporters. ""In the second half we dropped physically because we had a difficult game on Sunday. We've had two games in three days, our recovery was a bit short. ""Maybe the second (Tottenham) goal was decisive because we wanted to get to halftime with a two-goal lead, but we had an outstanding spirit and we have to keep battling to the last day."" The Gunners looked like avenging November's 3-2 home defeat by Spurs when Theo Walcott ran clear to slot home from Cesc Fabregas' well-timed pass in just the fifth minute. But Tottenham responded immediately as Van der Vaart controlled a pass from Vedran Corluka and fired a right-foot shot past goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who was beaten at his near post. Arsenal suffer late, late Liverpool blow . Samir Nasri restored Arsenal's lead in the 12th minute with a right-foot effort from outside the area as he was given space to shoot, scoring his first league goal since New Year's Day and his 10th this season. Robin van Persie made it 3-1 in the 40th minute with his 14th in the Premier League, as the Dutchman lashed home at the second attempt after Heurelho Gomes parried his header from Walcott's delightful chip. But Huddlestone gave the home fans hope as he drilled in a sublime, low left-foot strike a minute before the break as Arsenal failed to clear a corner. Spurs appealed in vain for a penalty when Luka Modric was shunted to the ground by Johan Djourou in time added on, while Van Persie had the ball in the net a second time in the 57th minute but the offside flag was up. His compatriot Van der Vaart leveled the scores for the third time with 20 minutes to play with his 12th league goal since joining from Real Madrid in August after winger Aaron Lennon, who came on at halftime for Gareth Bale, was brought down by Szczesny. The result left Spurs five points clear of sixth-placed Liverpool, having -- like City -- played one less game. Chelsea clinched a second successive victory as France international Florent Malouda scored twice against visiting Birmingham. Coach Carlo Ancelotti opted to leave $80 million signing Fernando Torres on the bench again along with Nicolas Anelka, as Didier Drogba started up front with Malouda and Salomon Kalou flanking him. The combination paid off as early as the third minute as Drogba flicked on a cross from Paulo Ferreira and Malouda finished off at the far post. Drogba's fellow Ivory Coast forward Kalou curled a superb effort in off the post to double the lead in the 26th minute, and winger Malouda made it 3-0 just after an hour with a header from a cross by debutant left-back Ryan Bertrand for his 12th league goal this season. Birmingham, five points clear of the relegation zone, pulled a goal back in the 71st minute as Sebastian Larsson converted a penalty after Chelsea's Brazil defender David Luiz fouled substitute striker Matt Derbyshire.","Manchester United lead Premier League by six points with six matches to play .

"Washington (CNN) -- With a short video on BarackObama.com, the sitting president of the United States has launched his bid for re-election. Using what apparently will be one of his campaign slogans, ""It begins with us,"" the campaign has told supporters that the kickoff of the campaign has started and that means the race for contributions is on. The familiar-looking blue ""O"" over red and white stripes is back again for 2012. And at the bottom of the website, the candidates' names are clearly identified: OBAMA-BIDEN -- for Vice President Joe Biden. Shortly afterward, Obama sent an e-mail to supporters to say he will also file papers Monday with the Federal Election Commission. ""We've always known that lasting change wouldn't come quickly or easily. It never does. But as my administration and folks across the country fight to protect the progress we've made -- and make more -- we also need to begin mobilizing for 2012, long before the time comes for me to begin campaigning in earnest,"" Obama said in his e-mail message. He is expected to host his first re-election fundraiser in Chicago on April 14, according to the sources. The president is making his campaign official slightly earlier than is typical for an incumbent so he can get a jump on fundraising in a season that's likely to shatter all records. Obama's team has been asking campaign bundlers to raise $350,000 each, no easy task since campaign finance laws limit gifts to $2,500 per donor. Two sources tell CNN the campaign team hopes that in total its bundlers will raise $500 million, leaving the campaign to raise another $500 million and amass a record-breaking $1 billion war chest. According to these sources, the president has made calls to top donors, and conference calls are planned this week to supporters and key Democratic groups. Biden is already planning to be in New Hampshire on Monday and will meet with key supporters in that crucial early voting state. For the past few weeks, Jim Messina, who will manage the campaign, and Patrick Gaspard, executive director of the Democratic National Committee, have been flying around the country meeting with frustrated donors working to get them re-engaged. So far no Republican contenders have formally announced. But these days, the likely Republican presidential contenders are making endless visits to key early voting states and meeting with supporters across the country. One top Democrat says, ""The Republicans are out there day in and day out beating up on the president -- they're basically running without filing. So to say we're going first isn't totally fair."" This person adds, ""No one wants to start running now. The president is engaged in the country, this is about getting (campaign) staff up and running."" Additionally, top Democrats say two former White House staffers are likely to set up a third-party outside spending group. Former deputy press secretary Bill Burton and Sean Sweeney, former aide to then-Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, have been approached by Democratic donors who are concerned about countering the influence of Karl Rove and the Koch brothers in the upcoming 2012 election. CNN's Sam Feist also contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama says he will file papers Monday .

"(WIRED) -- Cisco is shutting down a business unit that it bought for over half-a-billion dollars: the Flip camcorder division. That's a shame, considering how high the Flip was flying a few short years ago. It's also a waste, considering that Cisco bought Flip from Pure Digital only two years ago for a cool $590 million. But Cisco probably had to act fast, because its earnings fell 18% in the second quarter of 2011, and CEO John Chambers had to show he was doing something decisive to stanch the flow. It's not like the Flip was doing that well of late. When was the last time you saw someone actually using one of these low-quality, ""good-enough"" Flips? Probably about two years ago. Just what murdered those cheap, adorable camcorders? The obvious culprit is the general-purpose smartphone. When iPhones and Android phones began shipping with decent cameras for shooting stills, the Flip seemed excessive. When phones got HD video recording, the Flip was downright redundant. But the smartphone wasn't the sole cause of the Flip's fate. The Flip would still be around if Cisco had bothered at all to adapt to the market. After all, there are plenty of camera businesses like Canon that are still alive and well. Here are a few reasons why the Flip flopped. Smarter general-purpose devices . Let's get the obvious reason out of the way first. When Steve Jobs introduced the camera-equipped iPod Nano in 2009, he made it clear that the Flip budget camcorder was Apple's primary target. ""We want to get in on this,"" said Jobs regarding the budget-camera industry, while showing a slide of the Flip at the 2009 iPod event. Why buy a cheap camcorder if you could buy an iPod Nano that shot video, too? In addition to the Nano, Apple had already released the iPhone 3GS, also capable of capturing standard-definition video. Eventually, a slew of Android smartphones also shipped with video-capable cameras, and so did Apple's iPod Touch. The iPhone 4 and others brought HD video recording to smartphones, eliminating the Flip's last possible advantage. Suddenly, the notion of carrying around a cheap camcorder in addition to a general-purpose smartphone or iPod seemed impractical -- extra bulk in your pocket. A slew of general-purpose devices made the Flip irrelevant. The shift to real-time social networking . The Flip probably wouldn't have been murdered so easily if Cisco had caught on to something that's been trendy for years: real-time social networking. To make that work, the Flip would have required an internet connection. You'd think that would be an easy addition, considering that Cisco is a networking company. After Apple released the video-equipped iPhone 3GS, Cisco should've quickly shipped a Wi-Fi--enabled Flip for customers to immediately shoot and post media on social networking sites such as Flickr and YouTube. Instead, existing Flip camcorders require a wired connection to a PC in order to transfer the files and upload them to a website. That's old-school, PC-centric social networking. These days, people like to share their media wherever they are, when it's happening. Because the Flip lacked a wireless connection to the internet, this was another reason to just buy a smartphone. Here's where the Flip had a chance to survive. Kids love social networking and sharing pics and video, and they can't afford smartphone plans. An affordable, cheap camera with an internet connection would've been pretty compelling. Furthermore, Flip customers didn't particularly have anywhere they belonged to feel special. Cisco could've bolstered an internet-enabled Flip with a unique social network made just for Flip users. To be fair, evidence shows Cisco was trying to ship a Wi-Fi--enabled Flip, but it moved too slowly. At this point, smartphones are already too far ahead, with popular social media apps such as Instagram and Ustream making them even cooler. No compelling high-end option . Cisco's line of ""high-end"" Flip products are yawn-inducing. The high-end Slide HD ($230) includes 16 GB of storage, 720p video and 2x video zoom. For the same price, a low-end iPod Touch includes 8 GB of storage, 720p video, an internet connection and access to hundreds of thousands of apps in the App Store. Which would you choose? If Cisco had focused on optimizing the high end of its Flip camera line, it would've offered a compelling reason to buy a Flip versus a smartphone or iPod. Imagine a high-end Flip with a Wi-Fi or 3G internet connection, 1080p video, a decent zoom lens, and a touchscreen with apps made just for Flip video and photo. A solid, premium multimedia device would've enabled Flip to stand out among the ""jack-of-all-trades"" multifunction devices out there. But alas, the Flip is dead. RIP, Flip.

"(CNN Student News) -- April 12, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Ivory Coast  • Japan • France . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Carl Azuz, and this is CNN Student News! We don't need 80 days. We're taking you around the world in 10 minutes. Asia, Europe, North and South America. But we're starting things off in western Africa. First Up: Ivory Coast Crisis . AZUZ: The civil war that's been raging in the nation of Ivory Coast seems to be coming to an end. In fact, a United Nations representative said yesterday that while there are still some small signs of resistance, to his knowledge, most of the fighting has stopped. That is because Laurent Gbagbo, Ivory Coast's former president, was arrested on Monday. This is Gbagbo, and this is the hotel that he was taken to yesterday. It's the headquarters of both the U.N. group in Ivory Coast and of Alassane Ouattara, the man who defeated Gbagbo in last year's presidential election. Gbagbo refused to step down despite having lost the election, and that is what led to the violence. Hundreds of people killed. Thousands fleeing from the country. Now that Gbagbo's been taken in, one U.S. official said Ivory Coast can start to return to normal. Libya Civil War . AZUZ: Moving northeast across Africa, we come to Libya. That country's government and military, led by Moammar Gadhafi, have been fighting against rebels who want him out of power. The African Union has come up with a plan to end that fighting. They're calling it a ""road map."" What it would do is immediately stop the fighting and help bring humanitarian aid into Libya. Colonel Gadhafi has signed off on the plan. But the rebels who are fighting against him haven't. The plan doesn't force Gadhafi to step down from power, so he could continue to lead Libya. And while rebel leaders say they're open to ideas, they say Gadhafi leaving power has to be included. Quake Anniversary . AZUZ: In Japan, rescue workers briefly stopped their search yesterday as the nation paused to remember the victims of the deadly earthquake and tsunami that hit exactly one month earlier. Special ceremonies, moments of silence paying tribute to the more than 13,000 people who were killed and the more than 14,000 others who are still missing. Just a short time later, Japan was hit by another earthquake. There have been hundreds of these aftershocks since the quake on March 11th. Yesterday's had a magnitude of 6.6. It caused landslides that trapped several people in one city. It also caused a temporary evacuation at that troubled nuclear power plant where engineers have been trying to cool down nuclear reactors. Just the Facts . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Just the Facts! Burqa is an Arabic word that dates back to the 1800s. It is an article of clothing that covers someone's face and body. Burqas are often associated with Islam, as they are worn by some Muslim women. Burqa Ban . AZUZ: In France, it's illegal to wear a burqa according to a new law that went into effect this week. Two women who were protesting the ban were arrested on Monday. Police say they weren't arrested for wearing burqas, but rather for being part of an unauthorized protest. French officials say burqas pose a security concern and affect the dignity of women who wear them. But critics of the ban say it violates European human rights laws. Atika Shubert is in France. She has more on this new law and the reaction to it. (BEGIN VIDEO) ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A highly controversial law has gone into effect, and it's the talk of the country, as you can imagine. In fact, I'm going to hold up just a section of Le Parisien newspaper here. The headline is ""the full veil is banned on the road."" It actually has a small diagram here to show exactly what is allowed and what is not allowed in France now. The burqa, which covers the entire face, is banned. The niqab, which covers everything but the eyes, is also banned. But the hijab, which covers the head but leaves the face unveiled, is allowed. Now, the nuts and bolts of this law: Basically, it is now illegal for anyone to wear a full veil covering on the streets of France in public. And in public, it means anywhere on the streets, in a public office, such as a post office or a train station, even in a cinema, it is not allowed. Really, the only place where the full veil is allowed is in a car, the private vehicle, or in the privacy of your own home. There are only an estimated less than 2,000 women in France that actually wear the full veil, so it won't impact that many people, but it is highly controversial. Now, CNN did have the opportunity to speak to one woman who is wearing the full veil and says she will continue to wear the full veil even as this law goes into effect. And she told us what she thinks of this new face of France. HIND AMAS, VEIL WEARER IN FRANCE [TRANSLATED]: In all honesty, I'm just sad. I'm just sad and disappointed, because quite frankly to get to this point, I think it's very revealing about many things. And thankfully, thankfully, not all of the French population think like the politicians who voted this law. SHUBERT: Now, even though this only affects a small portion of women here in France, this law is very popular. It was passed with an overwhelming majority in France's parliament. And in the most latest polls, more than 80% of French respondent say they support the law. Atika Shubert, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEO) Debt Ceiling . AZUZ: To North America, Washington, D.C.: the U.S. Congress just finished up one round of financial debate. There are several more of those to go, and one of the big ones coming up soon is about the U.S. debt ceiling. Now, that is the legal limit for how much money the U.S. can borrow. Congress has about a month to work on this. But with a two-week spring break coming up, that doesn't leave a whole lot of time. So, what is the current debt ceiling? How close are we to it? And what are the options facing Congress? Ali Velshi is here to help break it all down. (BEGIN VIDEO) ALI VELSHI, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The real fight, the one that's getting started, is over the country's debt limit. By law, the amount that the U.S. can carry, the amount of debt that the U.S. can carry, is $14.294 trillion. It's a credit limit that Congress sets. Now, that's what they can borrow. Here's where we stand right now. The actual current debt of the United States: $14.208 trillion. The difference between the two is $86 billion. Now, the U.S. is going to exceed this limit by May the 16th, based on current spending. The government can pull a few tricks and get away with being over the limit until about July 8th. But not increasing this credit limit is going to create some problems. Now, there are two scenarios for what could happen if Congress doesn't raise that debt limit by May 16th. Neither of them are good. The government can cut spending or it can raise taxes. They need to raise $738 billion to keep the country running until the end of the fiscal year, which is September 30th. But Democrats oppose cuts and oppose increasing taxes, so if they don't do that, the U.S. could default on its loans. That could create a big problem. That could send the dollar plummeting. It could send oil prices higher. It could hobble an already delicate economy, which is why this, this debt ceiling, is going to become the focus of our attentions for the next month.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Thousands of Spaniards protested on Saturday in defiance of a court-approved ban on demonstrations the day before Sunday's local and municipal elections. The largest crowds, for a seventh straight day, were in Madrid and Barcelona, but there were also protests in Valencia and smaller cities, protest organizers and Spanish news media reported. Overall, reports indicated that tens of thousands took to the streets across the nation, which is struggling with a 21% unemployment rate, the highest in the euro zone. The ruling Socialist Party's candidates are widely expected to suffer deep losses to the conservatives, according to recent polls. The Socialist government did not immediately order the police to move in to disband the demonstrations. ""What we are going to do is comply with the law,"" Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told reporters Friday. Yet Rubalcaba, who is also deputy prime minister, added that the police would not be there to create even more problems than already exist in the streets. Spain's supreme court rejected an appeal late Friday to overturn the electoral board's order banning demonstrations on Saturday. Authorities insist that the day before elections in Spain should be free of political messages and campaigning, for a so-called day of reflection. ""Please don't bother us. We are reflecting,"" read a large placard held by demonstrators in Madrid's central Puerta del Sol plaza on Saturday. The protests against Spain's political and financial establishment started on May 15. To sustain them, the protesters have erected a sprawling tent city in the plaza, with a kitchen, a painting workshop to churn out protest placards, a communications office to answer media inquiries and even a day care nursery. Young people dominated the protests on Saturday but there were also families with young children strolling through the encampment, senior citizens and many people who have jobs but say they're concerned about the nation's future, which has a 42% jobless rate for people ages 15 to 24. ""Everybody here is a volunteer and everything started very small but we got organized very fast and it started growing very fast,"" said Juan Lopez, a protest spokesman who's an internet technology manager who is currently unemployed. ""You just can see how well one of our best committees, which is the infrastructure committee, work. They made all this in just four days,"" Lopez said, pointing to the bustling encampment. Economist Fernando Fernandez of the IE Business School said, ""The government does not want to have any sort of violence taking place the day prior to the elections. This would have a very large political cost and electoral cost."" Sofia de Roa, a spokeswoman for the protesters, said Friday, ""People want to participate. This is a fiesta of democracy."" The protests gained momentum in the closing days of the campaign and captured considerable news media coverage. All major parties have acknowledged them. Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said in an interview with SER radio on Friday that voters ultimately will decide whether and how much change will be made. On Sunday, voters in Spain's 8,000 cities and towns will elect mayors, along with 13 out of 17 regional presidents and parliaments. The results are expected to be a bellwether for national elections, which must happen no later than March 2012. ""It's just before elections when the Spanish politicians usually hear the voice of the people,"" Lopez said. ""Now on Monday, we have to see how this develops and what the answer is. The best-case scenario, which is the one we would like, is that they will come down here as citizens to hear us, and to make a new and better Spain, a new and better democracy with all of us are together."" The protesters indicate they will maintain the demonstrations after the elections on Sunday.","Thousands turn out over 21% jobless rate .

"(CNN) -- It's not specifically called a ""birther"" bill and it doesn't mention President Barack Obama by name, but proposed state legislation in Louisiana appears to be the latest attempt to keep alive arguments over whether Obama can prove he was born in the United States. The proposed Louisiana legislation would require an affidavit to accompany documents, including a birth certificate and a sworn statement that identifies the candidate's place of residence for the preceding 14 years, for someone to quality for the presidential ballot. Similar requirements are set for other offices including Congress. Bill co-sponsor state Sen. A.G. Crowe told CNN's ""AC360"" Thursday night that his constituents wanted the legislation, although he said he had no comment on whether Obama was born in the United States. ""The issue won't go away,"" said Crowe, a Republican. Obama has been hounded by allegations since he began running for president in 2008 that he was not born in the United States. Critics -- often called ""birthers"" -- contend, among other things, that Obama was born in his father's home country of Kenya. The U.S. Constitution stipulates that only ""natural born"" citizens are eligible to be president. Obama, who is seeking re-election, has insisted that he was born in Hawaii, and arguments to the contrary have been repeatedly discredited in investigations by CNN and other organizations. In an effort to counter the claims, Obama's 2008 campaign produced a ""certification of live birth,"" a document traditionally accepted legally as confirmation of a birth. Both the current Hawaii governor, Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat, and the previous governor, Linda Lingle, a Republican, have insisted that Obama was born in their home state. Nevertheless, the issue remains politically potent among segments of the electorate and has served as a rallying cry for many of the president's opponents. In a call to CNN's ""American Morning,"" potential presidential candidate Donald Trump said of Obama's constitutional eligibility to be president: ""We're looking into it very, very strongly."" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, has said he would sign the proposed legislation if it passes, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper. But a growing list of Republican politicians and strategists, including Rep. Michele Bachmann, Republican strategist Karl Rove, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a likely GOP presidential candidate, have distanced themselves from the ""birther"" issue. Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on Monday vetoed similar legislation. Nearly 75% of Americans believe Obama was definitely or probably born in the United States, according to a March 11-13 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll. More than four in 10 Republicans, however, believe the president probably or definitely was not born in America. Fourteen other states are considering similar legislation this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Measures have failed in three states -- Connecticut, Maine and Montana. Obama touched on the issue Thursday night during a fundraiser with Hollywood luminaries at the Tavern Restaurant in Brentwood, California. ""You all got involved when the prospect of electing Barack Hussein Obama was slim,"" he said. ""None of you asked for my birth certificate. It was a complete leap of faith.""

"(Mashable) -- Lady Gaga fans were delighted Monday to learn that they could download her new album, Born This Way, from Amazon for a mere $0.99 -- until, of course, technical difficulties set in. Downloads of the album are delayed, leaving folks unable to get the entire album immediately upon purchase. Amazon issued the following statement: . ""Amazon is experiencing high volume and downloads are delayed. If customers order today, they will get the full Lady Gaga, Born This Way album for $0.99. Thanks for your patience."" However, the damage has already been done, as users are meting out one-star ratings in droves, most of which deal with Amazon's slow service as opposed to the quality of the music (although some reviews in the lower bracket did dub the disc ""disappointing""). As a result, the album has a relatively low three-star rating. Reviews of the following nature reign: ""This review isn't a review of the album, but of the Amazon's digital music service. I tried this as an experiment to see if I wanted to order more music this way, but it only downloaded half the songs. Still a deal at 99 cents, but not an experiment I'll want to repeat with a full-price album."" Many reviews also trumpet the user's intent to buy from iTunes in the future, instead of Amazon -- a state of affairs Amazon would want to avoid, considering iTunes already holds most of the market share for digital music. This backlash does not bode well for the future popularity of Amazon's new Cloud Player service, which the company was touting in the promotional language of the deal, offering users more storage space for buying the album. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- The trial of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on charges of sex with an underage nightclub dancer and abuse of power opened Wednesday in Milan. It lasted 10 minutes and was adjourned until May 31. The case is the latest in a long-running series of legal wrangles featuring the scandal-plagued politician and promises to be one of the most controversial trials ever to take place in Italy. What is Berlusconi accused of? Prosecutors allege that Berlusconi paid for sex with Karima El Mahrough, a nightclub dancer nicknamed Ruby who at the time was 17-years-old. Prosecutors also say, in legal papers seen by CNN, that Berlusconi had sex 13 times with El Mahrough. Who is 'Ruby the heart-stealer?' They claim he abused his position when he intervened in May 2010 to get her released from the jail where she was being held on charges of theft. Berlusconi says the allegations are politically motivated and are an attempt to smear him. In Italy, the age of consent is 14, and it is not illegal to pay for sex. However, paying for sex with a minor (under 18) is a crime, and can be punished by up to three years in jail. Berlusconi has said the dancer had been introduced as a 24-year-old. Did he give her any money? El Mahrough said she did not know Berlusconi well but that she did receive 7,000 euros (about $9,300) from him the first time they met, on Valentine's Day 2010, because a friend told Berlusconi she needed help. Has he been in court before? Yes. Many times but on March 28 he made his first personal appearance in court in for eight years. It was a two-hour closed-door hearing in Milan on corruption charges. He and others - including his son - are accused of tax fraud and misappropriation of funds. What other legal issues is Berlusconi facing? The 74-year-old Italian PM, currently serving his third term in office, also faces charges of bribing British lawyer David Mills to secure favorable testimony in legal cases. His trial, suspended last spring after he was granted temporary immunity, resumed this month. Mills denied receiving bribes and his conviction in the case was overturned last year. He has survived a series of political, corruption and sex scandals over the years, involving allegations of embezzlement, tax fraud and bribery. Berlusconi has been tried on at least 17 charges since he was first elected prime minister in 1994, but none of the cases have resulted in lasting convictions; several were overturned on appeal. He has always denied any wrongdoing, and had previously claimed immunity from prosecution, though a 2008 law granting him this was overturned the following year. How has he reacted to the claims? Berlusconi insists he has never paid for sex -- ""not even once in my life"" -- and says any suggestion he did so is ""degrading for my dignity."" Both he and El Mahrough, who is now 18, deny ever having had sex with one another. But the young woman's former roommate told investigators that El Mahrough confided to her that she did have a sexual relationship with the premier. Berlusconi says he did call the police on El Mahrough's behalf, but denies this was an abuse of power. He says he thought El Mahrough was related to the since-deposed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and he was acting in Italy's interest by trying to avoid a diplomatic incident. The billionaire media magnate and football club owner says the allegations against him are simply political mudslinging. His lawyers have called the investigation ""absurd and groundless"" and a ""grave interference"" in Berlusconi's private life. Will this case damage him financially? A media entrepreneur, Berlusconi and his family were number 74 on the Forbes list of The World's Billionaires for 2010 and worth an estimated $9 billion, so the trials are unlikely to make a significant dent to his wealth. So, will Berlusconi attend any or all of the trials? Yes, according to his attorney Niccolo Ghedini, who said: ""Absolutely yes, we have decided to blank his agenda for one day per week, every Monday, in order to allow him to participate to all the hearings."" Berlusconi's lawyers have previously argued that courts in Milan do not have jurisdiction in the case -- because of where the alleged crimes were committed -- or the authority to try a prime minister. What about Berlusconi's political reputation? Long-running scandals, a playboy lifestyle and a series of well-publicized gaffes have opened the Italian PM up to widespread ridicule. Berlusconi has survived two votes of no confidence in recent months, and while his personal approval ratings have been dented, his party, the People of Freedom, still enjoys widespread support in Italy. Has the Vatican commented? The Vatican has made no comment on 'Rubygate', which is in keeping with normal diplomatic relations between the Vatican City and the Italian state, says CNN's Diana Magnay. What has the public reaction been in Italy? In mid-February thousands of Italians took to the streets in some 200 cities across the country in protest of Silvio Berlusconi's alleged behavior toward women. The largest gathering was in Rome, where organizers said 100,000 people gathered, under the slogan, ""If not now, when?"" In Milan, Berlusconi's birthplace, organizers estimated that 60,000 people gathered. Protests also took place outside Italy, including marches in Tokyo and Geneva. Many Italians on the street were clear about their opinion. ""It doesn't really matter if he is found guilty or not. I find it deeply upsetting when I watch the TV news, when I read the paper and when I hear about Berlusconi and Ruby, I feel sick,"" said Rome resident Belinzone Gianlice. ""I think that the example that is coming from the higher powers must be different,"" said Giovanni Nani. And in Milan, one banner captured the sentiment felt by many Italian women and particularly feminists, ""Stop the merchandising of women."" CNN's Hada Messia, Diana Magnay and Dan Rivers contributed to this report.","Prosecutors allege that Berlusconi paid for sex with a 17-year-old nightclub dancer .

"(CNN) -- It all started with ice cream. ""I saw a long line of people waiting for a free scoop at the Baskin Robbins next to my store,"" said Joe Field, owner and operator of Flying Colors Comics & Other Cool Stuff in Concord, California. ""Knowing that comics are even cooler than ice cream, I was convinced that publishers, retailers and our major distributor, Diamond, could all band together to do something powerful to attract people of all ages and interests to check out their local comics shops."" Thus, Free Comic Book Day was born. It was during a tough time for the comic book industry. The first one came in 2002, the same year ""Spider-Man"" became a blockbuster in theaters. Just six years earlier, however, Marvel Comics filed for bankruptcy, and comic books had been struggling ever since. The idea of Free Comic Book Day is simple: Publishers put out one or two comic books each year for free on the first Saturday in May for the 300,000 to 500,000 customers who show up at local comic book stores. Saturday's event will be the 10th. Store owners like Kyle Puttkammer, of Georgia's Galactic Quest, see it as a big success. ""It's the biggest sales day of the year for us, and many people discover us for the first time,"" he said. Many store owners make the day into an all-out event. Puttkammer plans to have an '80s cover band, a replica of the 1960s Batmobile and actors from AMC's zombie-themed TV show ""The Walking Dead,"" among other things, at his two stores. At Earth 2 Comics in Los Angeles, customers will be able to meet popular writer and DC Comics Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns. ""I consider it to be like a national holiday celebrating comic books, where the industry metaphorically opens their doors to the public,"" said Valerie D'Orazio, editor of MTV Geek. ""Gaining new -- and especially younger -- readers is absolutely crucial to the health of the comic book industry, now more than ever before."" Comic book publishers usually offer titles with storylines that can be easily followed and, in many cases, issues aimed at younger readers. ""We try to make them as new-reader-friendly as possible,"" said Axel Alonso, editor-in-chief at Marvel Comics. ""We usually don't push the envelope in terms of content."" ""Our hope is that the comic books that fans pick up on Free Comic Book Day, for a lot of them, might be their first one,"" DC Comics co-Publisher Jim Lee said, explaining how it chooses which issues to offer. ""We want to take a character that's well-known and accessible to the readership and at the same time, tie in to some of the future plans we have for publishing."" ""When I was growing up, there were comics in the barber shop. Not any more,"" said Bob Bretall of the Comic Book Page podcast. ""Today, comics are mostly in specialty comics shops. They are not anyplace that a kid is likely to see them by happenstance, so having an event that will draw people to the 'few and far between' locations that offer comics is crucial to getting this key demographic interested in comics."" According to trend-watching magazine ICv2, the industry is starting to see growth. ""ICv2 has tracked industry sales since 2005, when North American comic and graphic novel sales were $565 million,"" Publisher Milton Griepp said. ""In 2009, industry sales were $680 million."" ""We anticipated that this year's event would be the biggest ever based on the best selection ever of free comics based on well-known properties, and based on the record orders for comics to be give away, it will be,"" he added. So why is ""FCBD"" so highly anticipated this year? Here's what some of the major publishers have on tap for Saturday's big event: . Marvel Comics . Marvel's superheroes have had movies in theaters over the weekend of ""FCBD"" for several years now. This year, it's ""Thor,"" and this year's free comic is an all-ages story starring Thor and Captain America (who has his own movie in July), entitled ""Captain America/Thor: The Mighty Fighting Avengers."" Alonso compares it to ""a Pixar movie that's accessible for adults and children. It's meant to be a jumping-on point into comics, essentially."" The ""Spider Island"" story arc is going to be big for the company this year, and so many fans, as well as new readers, will probably seek out the free ""Amazing Spider-Man"" comic, by Dan Slott and Humberto Ramos, that ties into it. ""It's two of our top talents on a full-length story,"" Alonso said. DC Comics . Not to be outdone, one of DC's characters is headed to the big screen for the first time next month, and ""Green Lantern Special Edition"" will be a hot issue this year. It also includes a preview of the big crossover ""Flashpoint."" ""We've seen some orders that have been better in the past than Free Comic Book Day,"" co-Publisher Dan DiDio said. ""The preview of 'Flashpoint' is exciting a lot of our retailers."" DC will also offer a ""Young Justice/Batman: Brave and the Bold"" issue aimed at young readers, based on the two animated series on Cartoon Network (both Cartoon Network and DC are owned by Time Warner, which also owns CNN). Dark Horse Comics . The company best known for ""Hellboy,"" as well as the adaptations of ""Star Wars"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" will also be aiming for readers of all ages with an issue that features ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" and ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars."" ""We have an expanded library of 'Star Wars: Clones Wars' comics but are just beginning our Last Airbender program,"" Editor Sierra Hahn said. ""I think we're constantly trying to find material that will appeal to younger readers. When you discover something you love at a young age, chances are you'll stick by it through adulthood, and the material will age with you."" Like many of the other companies, it also has something for older readers in two horror comics, ""Baltimore"" from ""Hellboy"" creator Mike Mignola and ""Criminal Macabre."" Image Comics . ""The Walking Dead"" has been a runaway hit for this company in recent years, but its ""FCBD"" offering is decidedly tamer in the ""Super Dinosaur Origin Special,"" written by ""Dead"" creator Robert Kirkman. ""Super Dinosaur"" made its debut in stores last month, and the company hopes Kirkman will hit another home run, this time with a broader audience. ""Whether you're talking comics or movies or music or television -- any form of entertainment -- a graying fan base is going to be your undoing just through attrition,"" Publisher Eric Stephenson said. ""You have to continually find ways to appeal to a younger audience, and I think what Joe Field has come up with Free Comic Book Day is a great way of doing that."" IDW Publishing . It made its name with licensed properties like ""True Blood,"" Transformers,"" ""G.I. Joe"" and ""Doctor Who,"" and this year, IDW is offering up an original issue of its cult hit ""Locke & Key."" ""It was recently nominated for four Eisner awards,"" CEO and Publisher Ted Adams said. ""Fox just shot a pilot for it, and hopefully it will be on air this fall."" ""Locke & Key"" is usually intended for mature audiences, but this issue is different: ""We purposefully chose a story that was all ages. It's an action-based story, so it's OK for kids, but the actual book is intended for adults."" No matter their ages, Adams, like others in the industry, hopes readers will enjoy Saturday's festivities at their nearby comic book store: ""It's sort of like Christmas and Halloween and Thanksgiving rolled into one.""","Free Comic Book Day celebrating its 10th year Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Major questions hang over the investigation into a deadly accident involving an Amtrak passenger train and a tractor-trailer truck, and it could take up to a year for investigators to come up with answers, a federal official said Sunday. At least 20 people listed on the manifest for the California Zephyr have not been accounted for by authorities, National Transportation Safety Board member Earl Weener told reporters at a news conference. Officials have been trying to resolve the discrepancy since Friday, when a tractor-trailer truck slammed into the Chicago-to-California Amtrak train at a railroad crossing east of Reno, Nevada, killing six people. Weener told reporters at an earlier news conference that investigators believed the discrepancy in passenger numbers arose because some people had either already gotten off the train or bought a ticket but did not take the train. There are also troubling discoveries about the trucking company involved in the crash, John Davies Trucking of Battle Mountain, Nevada. Records indicate that the company had 19 previous safety violations, Weener said. But he warned that further inquiry was in order, since officials didn't have the ""context"" to put the violations in perspective. The NTSB is planning to visit the company this week. Investigators will review records for the company and the driver, Weener said. They will examine the driver's health and medical history as well as his training and experience, he said. The investigation could take up to a year to complete, Weener said, adding that this is the ""fact-finding"" portion of the inquiry. The trucking company, which advertises itself as a family-owned business that hauls concrete, did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. ""An investigation of this sort has many different facets,"" Weener said. ""As we've gotten into the investigation we've realized there are other skills and specialties that we need, such as fire inspectors ... there are just a lot of loose ends that you have to tie up as fast as you can."" Weener said portions of the truck are still embedded in a rail car, making it difficult for investigators to do an assessment. Authorities do not believe the accident was caused by a problem with the safety measures at the intersection where the accident occurred. It has cantilevers, lights, crossing gates, signs and crossbar markings on the pavement, Weener said. Additionally, the light that warns of an approaching train is set to flash for a period that's longer than the federal standard. The 10-car train was carrying 204 passengers and 14 crew members when the accident happened, according to an Amtrak statement released Friday. Skid marks show the driver of the truck involved in the crash slammed on his brakes and slid more than 300 feet before hitting the train, Weener said at an earlier news conference. The slide sparked a fire that burned the truck and two train cars, he said.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Army's 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment -- The Old Guard -- has posted watch at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery every second of every day for more than 63 years. And they weren't about to let a hurricane get in the way of their tradition. Members of the regiment earned new admiration this week for their unwavering dedication during Hurricane Irene. As the storm whipped the capital with driving sheets of rain, soldiers kept their vigil at the tomb, one hour at a time. Word of their service during the storm has prompted hundreds of comments on the regiment's Facebook page since Saturday, including plenty of ""hooahs"" -- the Army battle cry. ""So proud of you guys!"" said Kristina Wilson. ""Thank you for the honor you are showing to these brave men who are known but to God. You might meet them one day and they can say themselves how proud of you they are."" ""Very few things get me choked up, but seeing this put tears in my eye,"" said Greg Ledet of the photos showing the sentinels at the height of the storm. ""Thank you seems not enough, your stewardship of our collective history is wonderful,"" David Magart said. ""Honor, integrity, respect, these are the values your demonstrate and live by."" The foul-weather display even prompted some cross-service pride from George Gipson. ""You certainly have the respect and admiration of *this* Marine.

"(CNN) -- It's a community of crude green metal sheds, baking hot during the day and lacking clean running water. Residents say thieves can slice through the thin walls with their knives. A man packs up his belongings after being evicted from Borei Keila to Tuol Sambo. Locals call it ""the AIDS colony."" The Cambodian government set up the community on a site known as Tuol Sambo, on the outskirts of the capital, Phnom Penh. It began relocating families affected by HIV and AIDS from the neighborhood of Borei Keila last month, and last week removed 20 more families. The move sparked outrage among human rights groups, which said the conditions in Tuol Sambo do not meet standards for even emergency housing, and that the isolation would further stigmatize those affected by HIV. ""By bundling people living with HIV together into second-rate housing, far from medical facilities, support services and jobs, the government has created a de facto AIDS colony,"" said Shiba Phurailatpam of the Asia-Pacific Network of People Living With HIV. Human Rights Watch released a letter Tuesday that was signed by more than 100 global HIV/AIDS and social justice organizations and sent the day before to Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen and Health Minister Mam Bunheng. ""We are deeply disturbed by the Cambodian authorities' creation of a de facto AIDS colony at Tuol Sambo,"" the letter said. ""Tuol Sambo is far away from the jobs, medical facilities and support services that had been available to Borei Keila residents in the city."" The letter said HIV-affected families are being moved to unsafe housing while, just a short distance from ""the AIDS colony,"" nonprofit agencies are helping build brick houses for other homeless families -- ones without HIV. The letter acknowledged the international recognition the Cambodian government has received for treating and supporting people living with HIV. But it called the Tuol Sambo relocations ""discriminatory"" and ""life-threatening"" to people whose immune systems are compromised. The evictions took place despite repeated appeals to the government, including from the United Nations, the human rights activists said. ""We have reason to fear that relocations of HIV-affected families are continuing even as we sign this letter,"" they said. Reports compiled by the United Nations show that HIV is declining in Cambodia. In 2008, an estimated 67,200 adults and 3,800 children were living with HIV. A resurgence of an epidemic exists, however, according to UNAIDS. The agency reported a risk of second-wave HIV infections among high-risk populations, such as female sex workers, their clients and their partners. The HIV/AIDS families relocated by the Cambodian government worked mostly as day laborers, motorcycle taxi drivers, seamstresses and cleaners, the human rights groups said. They said most of those relocated have little prospect of finding work in Tuol Sambo. Government officials told The Phnom Penh Post that they knew about the problems at Tuol Sambo and that steps were being taken to improve conditions. ""We are trying to find clean water for them,"" Phnom Penh's Deputy Governor Mann Chhoeun told the English-language newspaper. ""They will also no longer face problems getting medicine, because we have given one house to [Center of] Hope, which has improved the health of the village."" A mission of an area hospital, The Center of Hope provides free medical care for the poor. But Gerlinda Lucas, the deputy director of grant management, told the Post that the center had no plans to open a permanent clinic at Tuol Sambo, though it will continue weekly mobile clinic service. Meanwhile, the relocated families expressed relief that they were leaving a neighborhood where landlords refused to rent to them. But they worried about their safety after thieves cut through the metal walls of one resident's home. ""I do not feel safe here because our houses are not strong,"" Chheang Toma told the Post. And then, there was the added fear of starting anew in an unfamiliar community.","Cambodian government began relocating families last month .

"(CNN) -- John Memmer said his light bulb moment occurred when he couldn't fit on an amusement park ride with his son. The 39-year-old auto insurance underwriter from Bloomington, Illinois, was on a family outing at a theme park in Missouri and his son, Alex, desperately wanted him to share a seat next to him. ""The attendant tried to push and squeeze me into the seat, but to no avail. I was too big to fit,"" said Memmer. ""So there I was with hundreds of people staring at me as all of this was going on, and then I heard my son start to cry as I had to climb off the ride,"" he said. A stranger in line agreed to sit with his son, but at that moment, Memmer knew it was finally time to lose weight. ""All the shoulda, coulda, wouldas catalyzed into an intense desire to finally do something about it,"" he said. Memmer had noticed before the trip to the amusement park that he would get winded walking up the stairs in his home and had trouble keeping up with his kids while they were playing. And this depressed him. But the incident at the theme park was the ""straw that broke the camel's back."" He started his weight loss program during the summer of 2009 and eventually lost about 115 pounds over the course of a year. His initial weight was 300 pounds. Memmer said he kept his plan simple: eating less and consuming fewer calories. ""While I was losing the weight, hunger was always a factor,"" he said. ""So to counter that, I worked in lots of fruits and vegetables, as they provide lots of nutrients and have a lot of fiber and bulk per serving -- it really helped to satisfy me when I was hungry."" Memmer rediscovered his love for soup during his weight loss campaign and has learned his local grocery store stocks a large variety of options to prevent him from getting bored. Although many soups contain a high amount of sodium, Memmer says ""this does not weigh on his mind and a recent check with the doctor showed a clean bill of health."" It took some time to adjust to his new eating habits. Snacking became a rare event because he knew he was eating fewer calories and wanted to make each calorie count. He didn't want to go on a crash diet, so instead he decreased his daily caloric intake so he'd shed about two pounds a week, which many dietitians consider safe. Memmer changed his mind-set about food, too. ""I realized early on that I would just eat absent-mindedly, and all those calories have to go somewhere,"" he said. He now makes a conscious effort to be aware of what he's consuming and mostly selects nutritious foods to eat. ""I'm not on quite as strict a regimen as I was when I was losing my weight, but I've found a nice balance that has allowed me to maintain my current weight level and I don't feel deprived at all."" The main staples of his diet are vegetables, whole grains and lean meats, but nothing is forbidden. ""I may have a cookie here and there, or even a piece of pie, but I consider it a special treat instead of a daily food item."" Memmer does not think in terms of ""going on a diet"" when he eats, either. ""Dieting implies that you're making a temporary change, and what is essential is making a commitment to a different way of living,"" he noted. ""Once you've made the mental leap over that hurdle, you've taken the hardest step."" In moments of weakness, Memmer reminds himself to try to stay focused on his goals -- and thinks of his family and how he wants to stay healthy for them. Memmer does not consider himself an athlete and doesn't have a regular workout routine. But he has found ways to incorporate activity into his life. He'll use the stairs at work and parks his car farther away from his office than before his weight drop. Work in his garden keeps him active, too. ""If you want an upper body workout, I highly recommend wrestling with a gas-powered tiller on unbroken ground,"" he chuckled. He enjoys taking walks and appreciates the fact he can get around without his knees hurting or back aching, which wasn't the case before he shed pounds. Memmer says his weight loss has inspired those around him and sparked a lot of conversation around his workplace. In fact, some of his colleagues have started their own campaigns to lose weight and achieve a healthier lifestyle. ""Sometimes, all it takes is a spark, someone you can point to and say -- if he can do it, so can I,"" he said. As for amusement park rides, Memmer has ""upped his game"" and recently spent a family vacation at Walt Disney World's theme parks in Orlando where he was able to comfortably get on any ride he wanted with his children. ""Space Mountain and Tower of Terror were my favorite rides."" Do you have a weight loss story? Tell us about it at iReport.com.","John Memmer lost about 115 pounds over the course of a year .

"(CNN) -- The embattled Syrian army is being pushed to the limit as anti-government demonstrations persist across the restive landscape, and the opposition ""will likely take on an increasingly armed aspect in the face of brutal oppression,"" a new report says. ""There are signs that army units are increasingly identifying with protesters, especially where security forces are employing violence against unarmed demonstrators,"" according to a report by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank. ""Although the regime's forces are not defeated and the army's potential tears may prove to be small, the dynamics for greater problems are in place. Given the widespread nature of the disturbances, the regime cannot mass personnel in more than a few places."" The report, written by Washington institute defense fellow Jeffrey White and published Monday, is entitled ""Syrian Army Shows Growing Signs of Strain."" It says the various units deployed to put down disturbances since mid-March are facing ""unprecedented"" challenges. ""The continuing pressure of the demonstrations, which are liable to swell during Ramadan, will stretch the army still thinner, with more defections likely given the regime's increasingly violent tactics,"" the report said. ""As the army becomes less reliable, strain will increase on the regime protection forces, stretching them further and tiring them faster. Clashes within army units and between army and security forces may increase as well. And escalating regime violence will likely provoke a more violent response over time, fueled by armed defectors."" This grim assessment comes as two dozen people were killed overnight by security forces in various cities and towns and international condemnation against the regime rolls in toward the Bashar al-Assad regime. The army is a conscript force ""in which largely Alawite officers lead largely Sunni soldiers,"" and it has ""traditionally been marked by a difficult relationship between officers and enlisted personnel, making it ill suited for the internal security missions it is now being given."" The government is dominated by the minority Alawites, who are an offshoot of Shiite Islam. ""The security forces have not been able to permanently secure any area and have had to shuttle personnel from one flashpoint to another, sometimes over considerable distances. As disturbances have spread, additional divisions and brigades have been pulled into the struggle,"" the report said. The report said the government appears ""reluctant to order regular army units to fire on demonstrators, though it has done so in some cases where regime protection forces were inadequate."" But that produced ""breakdowns in loyalty and cohesion among the army units so ordered."" ""Current trends suggest that the army's loyalty and cohesion are not just fraying, but beginning to tear."" The opposition's ""center of gravity,"" the report said, ""is increasingly moving to the cities,"" and that is a challenge, ""forcing the regime to conduct a 360 degree defense."" With the exception of the Alawite heartland in the northwest, the report said, no area appears secure. Other than Aleppo, which has seen only ""isolated protest,"" ""disturbances have erupted in more than 50 localities."" ""Subduing restive urban populations is a demanding and troop-intensive task, one that will become more difficult as demonstrations grow in size and as protesters or defectors take up arms. More forces will be required, and without adequate training, they are more likely to resort to violence early. More opportunities for violent, casualty-producing incidents will emerge as well. This was reportedly the case in Hama on Sunday, as tanks and infantry fighting vehicles encountered protestors armed with sticks and stones,"" he said. The government also faces problems along the borders, saying the flow of refugees into Turkey has been embarrassing to the government, and both Lebanon and Iraq ""are potential sources of arms and fighters."" There have been several attacks on oil facilities and a train derailment, but the cause is not known. ""If such incidents mount in numbers and seriousness, the regime will have to stretch its forces even thinner to protect key facilities,"" the report said. The report thinks the opposition could adopt ""an increasingly armed aspect in the face of brutal repression"" as defectors join them. ""As you get more defectors and guys who take their guns with them and they see people get killed when they yell 'Allahu Akbar,' or God is greatest, some people are going to say 'we've got to do something,' "" White said.","Report raises the specter of an ""increasingly armed"" opposition .

"Washington (CNN) -- Twenty-one-year-old Erica Ruiz plans to graduate from college in the spring with a degree in psychology and continue on to graduate school. Her family is from Mexico, but she and her two brothers were born in the United States. ""My parents always encouraged me to go to college and get educated because they didn't get the opportunity,"" she said of her mother and father, both farm workers. Ruiz is part of a recent increase in the number of Hispanics attending college in the United States -- a figure that spiked last year and even surpassed that of young blacks, according to a study released last week by the Pew Hispanic Center, part of the Pew Research Center. In 2010, approximately 1.8 million Hispanic students aged 18 to 24 were enrolled in college, the study showed. In the same age group, there were 1.7 million African-American students enrolled, although when students of all ages were counted, blacks outnumbered Hispanics. Analyzing U.S. Census Bureau data, the researchers found that in 2010, Hispanic enrollment surged by 24% over the previous year. For that same time period, college enrollment for blacks and Asians also increased, but not as dramatically as that of Hispanics. Although the enrollment of white students decreased to 7.7 million, the study showed, whites still make up the vast majority of college students. Researcher Richard Fry, who worked on the Pew study, attributes the gains in Hispanic enrollment to the overall population increase of Hispanics and an increase in the number of Hispanics graduating from high school, making them eligible to go to college. ""Improving the educational attainment of young Hispanics would improve the long-term socioeconomic prospects of the nation's largest minority group,"" Fry said. ""It would not only be beneficial for Hispanics themselves but would also raise the education and skills of the nation's future work force."" Raul Gonzalez, the legislative director for the National Council of La Raza, a Latino civil rights and advocacy group, noted that ""a spike does not a trend make."" ""We are hoping that this carries through to be more of a trend,"" Gonzalez said of the findings. Gonzalez gives some credit for the gains to the Bush administration's No Child Left Behind law. ""It's been about a decade of the No Child Left Behind policy. We are one of the few groups that still likes that law,"" he said. ""I don't think it's coincidental that (the increased Hispanic enrollment is) coming at a time when a cohort of kids has gone through a school career under No Child Left Behind."" There was a 4% decline in college enrollment among young whites since 2009, the largest drop since at least 1993, the study showed. This is at least partly due to a decrease in the 18- to 24-year-old white population. Ruiz said she sees her college education as part of the American dream, and she's encouraging her brothers to take advantage of their educational opportunities as well.","A larger Hispanic population and better high school graduation rates boosted college enrollment .

"Minami Sanriku, Japan (CNN)  -- A 60-year-old Japanese man was rescued Sunday more than nine miles out at sea after clinging to the swept-away remnants of his home for more than two days. ""I thought today was the last day of my life,"" Hiromitsu Shinkawa told his rescuers, according to Kyodo News Agency. Amazing stories of survival began to emerge in Japan, even amid the horrific destruction of the massive quake and subsequent tsunami that has killed nearly 1,600, destroyed tens of thousands of homes and stoked fears of a potential nuclear power plant meltdown. Three elderly people were found alive in a smashed car that had been tossed by the tsunami. Another woman clung to branches in a tree and took her chances by grabbing onto a floor mat that drifted nearby. The rushing currents pushed her around and around, past many buildings, she said. Her daughter was washed away and remains missing. ""I had been waiting for help all night,"" the rescued mother said. Prime Minister Naoto Kan said about 15,000 people have been rescued so far. Japanese troops were canvassing the destruction by the thousands in search of any sign of life. Hiromitsu Shinkawa, the man rescued at sea, told rescuers he and his wife had returned home shortly after the 8.9-magnitude quake to pick up some belongings when the tsunami slammed the city of Minamisoma. ""I was saved by holding onto the roof, but my wife was swept away,"" he said, according to Kyodo. Video showed him barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood, shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles (15 kilometers) at sea. He could be seen waving a self-made red flag. Rescuers aboard a Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer spotted him and quickly dispatched a smaller rescue boat to pick him up. When a member of the force handed Hiromitsu something to drink on the rescue boat, he drank it and burst into tears, Kyodo reported. ""No helicopters or boats that came nearby noticed me,"" he said. In Minami Sanriku, a town in northeastern Japan, a family photo album lay on the sodden ground, showing a beaming man holding a newborn baby -- happiness out of place amid the devastation. It's been estimated that some 9,500 people -- half the town's population -- may be unaccounted for. Only a handful of buildings were left standing, with the rest a mangled mess of rubble. A boat sat on the edge of town, carried more than two miles inland by the tsunami. When the tsunami warning sounded Friday, ""most people ran away,"" said Choushin Takahaski, who was working in a local government office near the water. ""Some had to leave the elderly or disabled behind on the second floor. I think a lot of those left behind probably died."" As the wave hit, he said, it felt like a dream. ""I saw the bottom of the sea when the tidal wave withdrew and houses and people were being washed out,"" another resident said. ""I couldn't watch anymore."" Forty-two people were found alive Sunday in Minami Sanriku. Search-and-rescue efforts were frequently disturbed by tsunami alerts prompted by ongoing aftershocks. When the alarm sounded, police abandoned their cars, rescue workers blew whistles and people rushed to high ground. ""It's your life!"" shouted one man. ""Run!"" It was a false alarm, but such warnings are taken seriously in the wake of the disaster. In Sendai, south of Minami Sanriku, Hiroki Otomo said his mother and uncle remain missing. They were at the family's home when the tsunami struck. ""Frightening beyond belief,"" Otomo said. ""I have no words."" Many areas of the town are simply gone -- mud and boards littering an area where a row of homes used to stand. A vehicle was found upside-down among tree branches. A school, which had 450 people inside when the tsunami hit, stood with its doors blown open and a jumble of furniture -- plus a truck -- in its hallways. Some teachers and students were able to escape the building, but officials said others did not. Sendai residents said the water reached the treetops as it swept into the town. Cars were tossed like toys, windows blasted out and homes crushed or swept away completely. ""As I was trying to evacuate, the tsunami was already in front of me,"" another young man said. ""I tried to drive, but I ended up running instead."" CNN's Paula Hancocks, Kyung Lah and Wayne Drash contributed to this report.","Prime Minister Naoto Kan says about 15,000 people have been rescued so far .

"(CNN) -- Li Na set up a French Open semifinal clash with former world number one Maria Sharapova after toppling fourth seed Victoria Azarenka at Roland Garros. It is the first time that Li, from China, has made the final four in Paris and she did it in style by knocking out the highest remaining seed 7-5 6-2 on Court Philippe Chatrier. Sharapova looked in fine form after a ruthless display against Andrea Petkovic, beating her German opponent 6-0 6-3, and is now in sight of completing a career Grand Slam, having won the other three major tournaments on the tennis calendar. The winner of their clash will face either defending champion Francesca Schiavone, from Italy, or France's 11th seed Marion Bartoli in the final. Li was beaten in the final of the Australian Open by Kim Clijsters back in January, when she became the first Chinese player to make a major final. And she is now one win away from another after a battling display against her opponent from Belarus that saw her hit back from a break down in each set. In the opener, Li dropped the third game on her serve but hit back immediately, before taking a 4-3 lead after a marathon seventh game. She held out to clinch the first 7-5. Again Li found herself a break down early in the second set but made her speed around the court count to peg Azarenka back instantly and surge to the finishing line. ""After I won the match I was feeling, 'Wow, I can play semi in Roland Garros'. I never think about that before,"" Li told AFP. ""So many people think I'm not so good on a clay court, but I think now they should change a little bit."" Sharapova took just 91 minutes to seal her victory, breaking Petkovic in the first, third and fifth games to complete a whitewash in the opening set. Despite being held at 3-3 in the second, Sharapova then stormed ahead to clinch the match. ""It was tougher than the scoreline suggests. There were a lot of games that could have gone either way. I played really smart on the important points,"" Sharapova was quoted as saying by AFP. ""There is no doubt I have improved on this surface. As the years have gone on I feel I have got better and better. ""I feel physically I have overcome many challenges that maybe a few years ago would have been tough for me.""","Li Na will play Maria Sharapova for a place in the French Open final .

About 50% of U.S. power still comes from burning coal. In West Virginia, over the past few decades, there has been a push for Mountaintop Removal Mining, a destructive yet highly effective form of strip mining that literally blows the tops off of mountains to reach the rich coal seams buried inside. Miners say mountaintop removal projects provide much-needed jobs. Their opponents say the cost of those jobs -- to the environment, the people and the future -- is just too high. There is an intense, enormous struggle going on in tiny Sharples. Soledad O'Brien is there to cover it from all sides in her documentary, ""Battle for Blair Mountain: Working in America.""

How might the various stakeholders seen in this documentary use different forms of media to influence public opinion? Learning Activity . The Economy, the Environment and Public Health . Ask students to consider how businesses in communities might impact local economies, the environment and public health. Direct small groups of students to conduct research to learn more about businesses and their impact -- both positive and negative -- on the communities in which they are located. Have each group choose one of these businesses and present a case study on the business and its impact on the region. Groups may want to include information, for example, about jobs generated and community and infrastructure development, as well as any resulting pollution, habitat destruction and/or alleged ties to health hazards. Groups will also want to share any evidence of balance among the business, environment and public health. After the presentations, generate a class discussion to help students draw conclusions about what they have learned. Ask: . • What benefits might a business operation bring to a region's economy? • How might a business operation negatively impact a region's quality of life? • Do you think that it is possible to promote economic development while protecting the environment and human health? If so, how? If not, why not? After discussion around the last question, challenge students to write emails to their local elected officials expressing their opinions on economic development and quality of life. They might choose to offer their suggestions for promoting economic development while protecting the environment and public health in their community, or advocate positions that prioritize one or more of these factors.

"(CNN) -- ""Even Superman has daddy issues."" Damon Lindelof -- who, along with Carlton Cuse, oversaw ""Lost's"" six-season run -- had that to say when asked to compare the story of Superman to the story of the TV series for which he's best known. Lindelof is one of a dream team of writers contributing stories to the landmark 900th issue of ""Action Comics,"" in stores Wednesday. The others include David Goyer, writer of ""Batman Begins"" and the upcoming film ""The Man of Steel""; Richard Donner, director of ""Superman: The Movie""; Geoff Johns, DC Comics' chief creative officer and one of its most popular writers; Paul Dini, best known for producing ""Batman"" and ""Superman: The Animated Series""; and Paul Cornell, who has been writing ""Action"" since last year and is best known for his work on the ""Doctor Who"" novels and TV series. Nine hundred issues is the most any monthly comic book has ever published (though it went weekly for a brief time in the 1980s), with the first issue of ""Action"" having introduced the character of Superman in 1938. (That issue also recently sold for $1.5 million.) CNN recently interviewed Lindelof and Cornell, separately, about the historic issue and Superman's legacy. They addressed a few topics of heated fan debate in the process. CNN: What can readers expect in this 900th issue? Lindelof: Obviously, ""Action"" No. 900 is a landmark issue -- one that covers Superman's past, present and future. I tried to (write) a little story that fits into the myth that we all know but looks at it from a different point of view. Cornell: (There's) an enormous lead story, closing Lex Luthor's adventure into ultimate power, setting him up against Superman in their fight of their lives and then continuing into Superman's new ongoing adventure against Doomsday. With loads of extra features in the back! CNN: What was it like writing for Superman? Lindelof: To actually play in a world that was so inspirational to me since I was a kid is nothing less than a dream come true. CNN: What did you hope to accomplish with your story? Lindelof: My hope was to drum up a little emotion: As heroic as Superman is, there is also an inherent sadness to his story. I wanted to try to tap that. CNN: Is there anything that's surprised you about writing the character? Cornell: I've discovered he really needs thought balloons. He can't show doubt or fear to the world, because he wants to enthuse and support the people around him, but he can doubt and fear inside. CNN: What have you hoped to accomplish in all of your time writing for him? Cornell: To show his essential humanity, especially in comparison to the bad parenting that produced Lex. CNN: Did you grow up as a Superman fan? Cornell: I think we all did. He's one of the most recognizable characters on Earth, and we all know many details of his life and supporting cast, far more than you would with virtually any other character. I think that's the power of radio, that first mass medium, to establish details in the heads of a truly enormous audience, and it all got passed down from there. CNN: If you could have one of Superman's powers, what would it be? Cornell: Flight, obviously. I'd love to be able to take off and go visit people in the States. Customs might be a problem. Lindelof: I'm sure everyone picks flight, so in the spirit of being unique, I'm gonna go with the ability to take the ""S"" insignia on his chest and make it grow to gargantuan proportions so I could throw it at people and ensnare them (as demonstrated in ""Superman II""). CNN: Who is your favorite villain? Cornell: It's obviously Lex. I've been living in his head for a dozen issues now. I think we have a lot in common. Lindelof: Bizarro. I just love everything about that guy. CNN: Do you have a favorite incarnation of Superman, whether it be in the comics, TV, or movies through the years? Cornell: Christopher Reeve. He sorted it and balanced it so well that everyone else since has been influenced by him. Lindelof: Chris Reeve will always be Superman to me ... but as far as comics go, you're never gonna do better than Alan Moore's ""For the Man Who Has Everything."" CNN: Can you settle this ongoing debate: Is Superman Clark Kent's secret identity, or the other way around? Cornell: Clark Kent is a real person who acts slightly more bumbling at the Daily Planet and has an interesting ethnic heritage. Superman is the job he puts on a uniform to do, and like a cop, he's a somewhat more serious person when he's doing it. Lindelof: As I'm of the belief that everything uttered in ""Kill Bill"" has to be right, I have to agree with David Carradine on that one. (Carradine's character, Bill, argued that Clark Kent was Superman's secret identity.) CNN: What can we expect beyond issue No. 900? Cornell: A huge fight against Doomsday for the next several issues, with Superman and a bunch of his friends repeatedly saving the world. That's what everyone's after!","""Action Comics"" hits historical 900th issue this week .

"Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- Each March, college basketball's regular season fades from memory as fans and players gear up for the NCAA Tournament and all the hoopla that comes with it: The brackets. Cinderellas. Buzzer beaters. But this year was different. Long before March arrived, this season was officially Jimmered. Brigham Young University guard Jimmer Fredette spent his senior season torching opposing defenses and shooting 3-pointers from unguardable distances. ""In a day and age where there's very little must-see TV, I think he's must-see TV,"" said David Locke, host of an afternoon sports radio show in Salt Lake City. Heading into the postseason, Fredette isn't just leading the nation in scoring (27.9 points per game) and starting to pile up player of the year awards. In the world of college hoops, the unassuming kid with the funny name is also tops in Twitter references and YouTube videos. He doesn't really look the part -- undersized (listed at 6 feet 2 inches) and a little slow, with a linebacker's shoulders. Yet he scores at will, inspires songs and is responsible for college basketball's version of a catchphrase -- teams don't just lose to BYU, they get Jimmered. ""He's one of those guys you expect the ball to go in and when the ball doesn't go in when he shoots it, you're kind of like 'Wow, he just actually missed a shot,' "" says Bill Riley, the play-by-play announcer for BYU's chief rival, the University of Utah. Fresh off a road win over then-No. 6 San Diego State, the Cougars looked like a sure-fire No. 1 or 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament -- a huge boon for a program that has yet to reach a Final Four. Then news broke that the team's primary inside player, Brandon Davies, had been suspended indefinitely for violating the Mormon Church-owned school's strict honor code. Critics called BYU too Jimmercentric before. Now the Cougars may have no choice but to feed him the ball early and often when the tournament begins next week. A social media 'phenomenon' What separates Fredette from recent college basketball stars -- say, Stephen Curry or Adam Morrison -- isn't so much what he's achieved on the court, but rather how much attention he's garnered off it. It's arguable whether the state of Utah has ever produced a better college basketball player -- Utah's Keith Van Horn and Andrew Bogut and BYU's Danny Ainge are close -- but there's no comparing the hype. ""He's a fabulous player, I'm not trying to take anything away from him, but he's a little bit of a social-networking phenomenon,"" Locke said. Consider Fredette's place in the hierarchy of collegiate sports. He doesn't play for one of college basketball's blue bloods like Duke or Kentucky. BYU plays in the relatively obscure Mountain West Conference with an abysmal TV contract. Jimmermania exploded on January 26 during a game on CBS College Sports, a network lost in the hinterlands of paid-TV programming. Fredette scored 43 that night in BYU's first meeting against San Diego State, prompting defending NBA scoring champion Kevin Durant to famously tweet, ""Jimmer Fredette is the best scorer in the world."" In the week that followed, he became a sports media darling. Fans quickly learned that Fredette's biography was just as compelling as his scoring ability. Raised in Glens Falls, New York, by a Catholic mother (who nicknamed him Jimmer; his given name is James) and a converted Mormon father. His brother TJ served as a mentor and is now an aspiring rapper, best known for his song ""Amazing"" and the accompanying Jimmer highlight reel on YouTube. Big brother took Jimmer to play pickup ball in New York, arranged games at a nearby prison against inmates and made him sign a contract that he'd do everything in his power to reach the NBA. It's a goal Jimmer will reach next season -- though scouts remain torn on his professional potential. In that last week of January, Fredette quickly rose from regional fame to household name -- and it didn't hurt that his name was a bit on the quirky side. ""If his name is James, I can't Twitter search James. But if somebody types in Jimmer, the only reason, they're typing in Jimmer is because of (Fredette),"" said Locke. YouTube is is loaded with Fredette highlights, clip after clip of him raining 3s from seemingly ill-advised distances or twisting in the lane for how-did-he-do-that? layups. ""He makes the long-range ones, but he's really creative, really clever. ... Sometimes he uses his feet, sometimes he pauses, does all sorts of little things here and there that throw his defender off just enough where he can create space for himself and get off a shot,"" said Jay Drew, who covers BYU for The Salt Lake Tribune and calls Fredette ""the mentally strongest athlete I've covered in 20 years."" Music videos sing his praises, such as the multiple versions of a ""Teach Me How to Jimmer"" song on YouTube. There is even a blond BYU student singing him an acoustic Valentine ode that goes, ""So baby come on over, be my point guard."" Heckling via Facebook . But technology can have a downside, too. San Diego State fans organized a massive Facebook onslaught on Fredette's girlfriend, BYU cheerleader Whitney Wonnacott. Students reportedly ""poked"" her 7,000 times on the site before the February 26 game in San Diego. SDSU student Brent Duclos designed and sold ""I Poked Jimmer's Girlfriend"" T-shirts. ""They honestly were just meant as good fun, and of course to try and get into Jimmer's head,"" said Duclos via e-mail. Jimmer had a bit of an off day, scoring a mere 25, but the Cougars won and Fredette and Wonnacott simply shrugged off the hijinks. To a degree, that's part of college basketball and regionally part of playing for BYU. Some call the school the Duke of the West because of vitriol the school attracts from opposition -- love or hate, no middle ground. Somehow, Fredette seems to buck that trend. He's heckled, to be sure, sometimes to classless degrees, but even opposing fans say they can't help but at least respect what he does. He's unflappable. ""For the most part, you always have to respect a talented player,"" said Duclos. ""I've never seen as many off-axis, fade-away 3s in a career, let alone a season. That's why it gives him a bigger target on his back compared to his teammates."" The real test, however, comes closer to home in Salt Lake City, where Utah fans are bred to hate BYU and boo their players relentlessly. ""He's kind of that rare guy that even (University of Utah) Ute fans seem to appreciate what he's done, whereas (normally) most of them would just hate the guy simply because he puts on a BYU jersey,"" Drew said. Kristin Ward, a 20-year-old University of Utah junior, isn't about to start rooting for Fredette, but recognizes his ability -- especially after Jimmer's monster 47-point performance at Utah's Huntsman Center earlier this season. ""It was hard to watch and I don't compliment BYU sports that often, but Jimmer's a really good player and it's interesting to watch a player that never misses and at the game against us, he never missed,"" she said. ""He shot from everywhere and made it.""","BYU guard Jimmer Fredette is leading the nation in scoring and YouTube highlights .

"(CNN) -- Hassan Addahoumi fled Libya in the late 1970s, driven from his homeland by the hard-line tactics of Moammar Gadhafi. More than 30 years later, his son has returned and is watching what could be the longtime leader's collapse. ""He's going to be part of the history,"" Addahoumi said about his son, Sammi, who is in the rebel hub of Benghazi. ""This is our dream come true."" Addahoumi spoke to CNN from his home in Columbia, South Carolina, where he said he was glued to news about Libya. The nearly 42-year rule of Gadhafi appeared on the verge of collapse early Monday, with rebel supporters making it to the same Tripoli square where regime loyalists had congregated for months. Addahoumi said he left his country after studying law in Benghazi. ""The regime was very, very tough,"" he said. ""If you stayed there, you had to be in either the prison or the cemetery."" Over the years, Addahoumi said he has returned to Libya from time to time and that he wishes he could be there now. ""I wish I could be part of this history,"" he said. A part of him is. Addahoumi's son, Sammi, sent CNN an iReport from Benghazi that showed video of large, boisterous crowds in the city's Freedom Square as developments played on a large screen. He also spoke to CNN by phone. ""The spirits are quite high,"" said Sammi, 28, a deli manager. ""Everyone is expecting Tripoli to fall."" He said he has spent time off and on in Libya since 2005. Every summer, he tries to spend at least a month there, he said. Watching the uprising, which he called ""42 years in the making,"" Sammi said he was filled with joy. ""It's exhilarating,"" he said. ""And it's also a lot of anticipation ... will Libya stay together?"" An ocean away, his father voiced confidence. He said Libyans have the resources they need to build the country and that they will do it, piece by piece. ""This is the best thing that could have happened to us,"" Addahoumi said.

Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Canadian photographer Donald Weber has been documenting the long-term effects of the Chernobyl meltdown since 2005. Originally an architect, Weber came to photography as a freelancer for the international press. After years of drifting through the post-Soviet landscape, shooting from the perspective of the skytalets (a traditional Russian wanderer), Weber has seen the reality of the area with an intimacy few outsiders have been granted. Following the earthquake and tsunami that struck the northeast coast of Japan in March, Weber watched as the damaged Fukushima power plant quickly threw the country into nuclear panic. What was once seen as an isolated and frankly unrepeatable incident, Chernobyl has found a twin in Fukushima. On April 11, the Fukushima nuclear crisis was upgraded from a 5 to a 7 on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale, a level previously only reached at Chernobyl. In the wake of the compound disasters, Japan has been struggling to contain the nuclear fallout in addition to rebuilding the nation's infrastructure and morale. Residents of the area still cannot access their homes to retrieve personal belongings and Japanese officials have said it will be another 10 months, at the very earliest, that people can begin returning to the area. See the rest of Picture Perfect: Donald Weber at VBS.TV . VBS traveled with Weber to the empty streets and abandoned homes surrounding Fukushima, where the eerie silence mirrors that at Chernobyl. One of the first photographers inside the zone, Weber set out to document the unfolding nuclear crisis and we set out to document him. Officials who took part in the Chernobyl cleanup a mere 25 years ago say they are shocked at how slow Japan's response has been. The Japanese government has yet to ask for international help in the cleanup, seemingly determined to solve the problem on its own and so far making many of the same mistakes that were made at Chernobyl. ""With the earthquake and tsunami, it was a catastrophe, but it's more of an engineering catastrophe and we can fix this,"" Weber says. ""But you can't fix what's happening at Fukushima. People just don't understand the whole scope of the matter ...""","Photographer who documented the Chernobyl disaster goes to Japan .

"(CNN) -- The roar of the jubilant crowd assembled in Cairo's Tahrir Square said it all. Nearly four months ago, longtime Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak finally yielded to political reality and stepped down from power. Mubarak's fall -- coming on the heels of the ouster of neighboring Tunisia's Zine El Abidine Ben Ali -- was seen by many as part of a domino effect. The Arab world, it seemed, was finally on the brink of a peaceful democratic transition that had eluded the troubled region for generations. Today, however, the promise of a peaceful Arab Spring appears to be yielding to the reality of a long, violent summer as dictators across the Middle East and North Africa draw a line in the sand and fight to maintain control of their countries. Protesters, meanwhile, are showing no sign of backing down. ""We've seen the last (Middle East) dictator leave voluntarily,"" Michael Rubin, a regional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington think tank, recently told CNN. See the latest daily developments at CNN's This Just In . U.S. President Barack Obama and other Western leaders will continue to push for peaceful change when possible, Rubin said. But dictators in the region have been spooked by the fate of Mubarak, who is now facing trial and a possible death sentence, and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, who is facing an onslaught from armed rebels and NATO air forces. They ""see there is no possibility of a peaceful retirement,"" Rubin said. And many of them also ""believe that their country is their personal fight."" While it is possible to identify trends that pertain to the entire region, a number of analysts stress that each country has unique circumstances and challenges that throw the notion of an all-encompassing Arab Spring into question. Libya: No signs of waning . In Libya, opposition to Gadhafi has been hampered by the fact that the country's sense of national identity is ""very weak,"" according to Robert Danin, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Tribal loyalty in the sparsely populated North African country comes first, a fact that has made it extremely tough for Gadhafi's opponents to present a unified front. Gadhafi's violent reaction to protesters -- and threats of a massacre in the rebel-held city of Benghazi -- led to the passage of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing military steps to protect civilians. NATO leaders, who believe the safety of Libyan civilians can't be secured without Gadhafi's ouster, have since embarked on a two-month bombing campaign targeting government forces. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced Wednesday that the alliance has decided to extend its mission in the country by 90 days. Gadhafi still refuses to step aside, but has been discussing a possible African Union-brokered cease-fire with South African President Jacob Zuma. Libya's war has the potential to become a ""protracted and costly stalemate,"" Max Boot, another senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, recently told reporters. There's a ""real danger of chaos"" and protracted tribal warfare if Gadhafi falls, Boot said. Al Qaeda may be able to exploit such a situation, he warned. 5 options for the U.S. in Libya . Close to 900,000 people have fled Libya since that country's conflict began in February, according to the United Nations. Egypt: Tension escalates . Meanwhile, in nearby Egypt reformers are upset with the pace of change since Mubarak's fall. ""We've waited ... and nothing has happened,"" Mehdi Ibrahim, 43, said Friday at a demonstration in Tahrir Square. ""Mubarak and his men have not (yet) been punished for their crimes. We need accountability."" Some protesters on Friday urged the creation of a civil presidential council to replace the military regime now running the country until democratic elections are held in September. Others called for the expeditious return of stolen assets, as well as a generally more open society. Fareed Zakaria: Military threatens Egypt's revolution . Tension continues to exist between some of the more secular, liberal-minded activists and the more conservative Muslim Brotherhood, Mubarak's primary opposition for years. ""We need rules and regulations to guide us and to protect individual freedoms and the rights of minorities"" before the elections, said law student Mohamed Badawi. But Saffa Mohamed, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, said the September election will be good for the country, even if it benefits more established groups like his or remnants of the once-ruling National Democratic Party at the expense of newer political parties. ""Why won't Egyptians just accept the results of the recent referendum?"" he asked. ""The date ... has already been set."" Syrian powder keg . To the northeast, Syria's government stands accused of committing atrocities against its own people. The international watchdog group Human Rights Watch released a report Wednesday alleging that President Bashar al-Assad's regime has carried out a ""systematic"" series of abuses against protesters that could ""qualify as crimes against humanity."" The group's 57-page document contains details from dozens of victims and witnesses to abuses in Daraa province, the southwestern Syrian powder keg where the unrest engulfing the country began in mid-March before spreading across the country. At present, the report said, there have been around 887 deaths across Syria, including at least 418 people in Daraa. The crackdown in Daraa last month became so intense that eyewitnesses spoke of bodies bloating in the streets and injured people being treated at makeshift secret clinics to avoid detection by government security forces. Human Rights Watch is urging the United Nations to hold al-Assad's regime accountable. Western leaders have imposed new sanctions against al-Assad and several of his most prominent supporters. For its part, the Syrian protest movement shows no sign of waning. A two and a half minute YouTube video clip showing multiple wounds on the body of a 13-year-old boy from Daraa -- Hamza Ali al-Khateeb -- has prompted international outrage. A Facebook page calling itself ""We are all the martyr, the child Hamza Ali Al-Khateeb"" had 60,000 followers by Tuesday. Bahrain: 'Iran's Kuwait' The push for democratic reform is also encountering fierce resistance on the strategically critical Arabian Peninsula. The leaders of two key U.S. allies, Bahrain and Yemen, are struggling to maintain control despite slowly mounting international pressure. On Wednesday, Bahrain lifted state of emergency laws in place since March that had allowed the silencing of opposition leaders and journalists. King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa has appealed for dialogue, saying that talks with opposition groups will begin in July. The minority Sunni government, however, continued its crackdown on the country's major Shiite political opposition movement. Among other things, security forces fired tear gas to disperse pro-reform demonstrators in several Shiite residential areas, according to one human rights activist. A source for the opposition told CNN that ""sporadic sounds of bombs and bird-shot clusters were also heard."" The government also filed charges Wednesday against four top opposition leaders in a move that could weaken the country's Al Wefaq party, according to two opposition sources. Regional monarchies eye Bahrain unrest . Bahrain is set to hold parliamentary elections in September, filling seats vacated by members of Al Wefaq, which left parliament in protest over the crackdown. The question of how hard Western powers -- the United States in particular -- should push for change in Bahrain is complicated by the fact that the tiny Persian Gulf country is home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. Neighboring Saudi Arabia and the United States are both worried that a successful Shiite uprising would transform Bahrain into an Iranian client state. ""Bahrain is Iran's Kuwait,"" Rubin said, referencing former Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein's insistence that Kuwait was rightfully an Iraqi province. If Bahrain's government falls, ""there is no question -- no ifs, ands or buts -- Bahrain would become an Iranian satellite, and the Fifth Fleet would be sent packing,"" he predicted. Bahrain is ""pretty much the one country where (Washington) can't afford regime change,"" he said. Yemen: Possible al Qaeda stronghold? Finally, nearby Yemen continues to be rocked by escalating clashes between rebels and forces loyal to embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom on the worsening crisis in Yemen . Four missiles struck a compound Wednesday where generals who defected from the Yemeni regime were meeting, according to a spokesman for the generals. Fierce clashes also erupted between government security forces and Hashed tribesmen Wednesday in front of the Ministry of Local Administration in Sanna, eyewitnesses and residents said. The Hashed tribe has opposed government forces in intermittent fighting for more than a month. Fifteen tribesmen have died and 31 have been injured from clashes in the past two days, said Abdul Qawi Qaisi, spokesman for the head of Hashed tribe. Witnesses also reported seeing at least three houses on fire near where the clashes were taking place Wednesday. Saleh, who has ruled his poor, arid country since 1978, ""does not want peace,"" said the spokesman for the head of the Hashed tribe. ""Saleh thrives with blood being spilt. They attacked us and we had to defend."" Government spokesman Tarek Shami said mediation efforts meant to stem the rash of recent violence between the country's tribal groups and Saleh's government ended Saturday without a peace accord because Hashed tribesmen would not negotiate. At least 100 people have also been arrested in the city of Taiz, while hundreds more have been injured across the country in recent fighting, according to a U.N. statement released Tuesday. The U.S. Embassy in Sanaa has condemned what it called the ""unprovoked and unjustified attack"" on demonstrators in Taiz. It praised the protesters and called on Saleh ""to move immediately"" on the president's previous promise to transfer power. Saleh, however, has been a leading U.S. ally against al Qaeda, which has a Yemen-based branch that has claimed responsibility for two attempted attacks on the United States. America's main concern regarding Yemen is that the country could become an al Qaeda stronghold if Saleh falls, Rubin said. But U.S. policymakers also ""have to recognize that al Qaeda rose under Saleh,"" he said. ""Keeping him in doesn't keep al Qaeda out.""","Violence has escalated across the Middle East and North Africa in recent months .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan authorities have recovered the bodies of five police officers and three intelligence agents just days after they were kidnapped by insurgents in the country's volatile Wardak province, officials said Sunday.

"(CNN) -- The census is inherently political, even if most people don't see it that way. Every 10 years, new census data is used to reapportion congressional seats across the country, while all states must use the census to redraw congressional districts. These processes don't get much attention, but the stakes are high: They help determine control of Congress and state legislatures and, because they determine the Electoral College map, who wins the White House. And the census's political influence doesn't stop there. Because it presents a unique demographic portrait of the country, the census is mined for political intelligence by strategists from both parties and applied to campaigns from the county level all the way up to the presidency. Here are eight political takeaways from the 2010 Census: . 1. Republicans need to improve relations with Hispanics. Fast. The single biggest headline from the 2010 Census may be the explosion in Hispanic growth. More than half of U.S. population growth in the last decade is due to growth among Hispanics; nearly one in six Americans now identify as Hispanic. That's bad news for Republicans, who've seen Hispanic support slip since 2004, when President George W. Bush made major inroads among those voters. Bush won 44 percent of Hispanics. Last November, by contrast, when the GOP wave swept control of the House out of Democratic hands, Republicans captured just 38 percent of that vote. Much of the falloff is due to the tough Republican line on illegal immigration, including widespread GOP opposition to immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for undocumented workers. Bush's efforts at such reform were brought down by his own party. And then there's Arizona's 2010 immigration law, championed by Republicans, that requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and allows police to question people's residency status while enforcing other laws. Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and an influential conservative strategist, says the problem runs deeper. ""Republicans have not reached out to Hispanics as they should have for the last 20 years,"" he says. ""The census numbers are not the wake-up call, they're the follow-up call."" Look for a handful of rising Hispanic Republican stars, like newly elected Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, to echo that line. 2. Democrats need to compete harder in red states . Of the 12 new U.S. House seats that will be created this year because of population shifts revealed by the 2010 Census, eight are in solidly red states: Arizona, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas and Utah. The booming Hispanic population -- among which Democrats have an advantage -- is responsible for much of that growth, but not all of it. Demographers say there has also been a migration of Americans from the Northeast and the Rust Belt, both traditional Democratic strongholds, to the more Republican-dominated South and West. GOP strategists argue that those transplants are more likely to be entrepreneurial and connected to business -- and therefore more likely to vote Republican. And they say that policies like no state income tax in Texas and Florida, identified with the GOP, will win over new arrivals. ""People who are showing up here are tired of policies that have driven jobs and families from their old states,"" says Chris Elam, a spokesman for the Texas Republican Party. ""They're showing up with a chip on their shoulders about failed government policies."" Democratic pollster Cornel Belcher, who worked for President Barack Obama in the 2008 campaign, won't go that far. But he says his party has a lot of work to do in the South and West. ""The Western states don't lean left, so the Democratic Party has to shift its brand,"" he says. ""Issues like new energy sources and energy independence are what appeal to a Western audience."" 3. The battleground states are moving south and west . It wasn't long ago that Ohio was considered the central battleground in presidential politics. Winning the Buckeye State put George W. Bush over the top in 2004. But Ohio and other Rust Belt battlegrounds have seen their populations plateau, shifting electorate clout to the West and parts of the South, like Georgia and North Carolina. The 2010 Census numbers will take two House seats each from Ohio and New York and give seats to states like Georgia and Arizona. But it's not just that Southern and Western states are gaining political muscle. They're also growing more politically competitive, thanks to increasing racial diversity and suburbanization, both threats to Republican hegemony. ""Moving forward,"" Belcher says, ""we're going to be waiting for returns from states like Colorado, Nevada and Arizona to determine how our national elections turn out."" 4. New electoral math makes it harder for a Democrat to win the presidency . In shifting congressional seats to the South and West, the 2010 Census is also shifting Electoral College votes in that same direction. While deep blue New York will lose two Electoral College votes, deep red Texas will pick up four. Measured against the national total of 538 Electoral College votes -- used to determine the outcome of presidential elections -- such modest swings might seem like small potatoes. They certainly wouldn't have mattered in the landslide 2008 election, when Obama beat Republican presidential nominee John McCain by 192 electoral votes. But in squeaker elections like 2000, when George W. Bush bested Al Gore by just five electoral votes, the slightly revised electoral math could have big consequences. 5. Mormon political influence is growing . The U.S. Census Bureau hasn't asked Americans about their religious affiliation since the 1950s, saying that such questions infringe church/state separation rights. But the 2010 Census found that Utah, home to the headquarters for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and to the nation's largest Mormon population, was the second-fastest-growing state in the last decade, seeing a 24 percent population spike. The other three fastest-growing states -- Nevada, Arizona and Idaho -- all have substantial Mormon minorities. With Mormon numbers growing, through high birth rates and proselytization, and with the religion gaining greater acceptance among other Americans, especially in the West, look for more Mormon-fueled political activism, especially in the GOP. The trend is already visible: Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, both Mormons, may soon announce bids for the presidency. 6. The face of American politics will get less white . Obama is the country's first African-American president, but, racially speaking, he's probably more of a sign of things to come than a political anomaly. New census figures show that minorities are becoming a bigger slice of the American pie, while white Americans are claiming a smaller share. In fact, white Americans were the only racial group to see their proportion of the population shrink in the last 10 years, from 75 percent to 72 percent. Want to help define America? Take the iReport cultural census . That's due to more than just Hispanic growth. The Asian population, for instance, grew by 43 percent in the last decade, faster than any other major racial group. The election of Indian-American governors like Bobby Jindal in Louisiana and Nikki Haley in South Carolina, both Republicans, shows how the face of politics is already changing to reflect the new racial map. The next frontier: Congress, where whites are still overrepresented. Asians occupy just 3% of congressional seats, while Hispanics occupy 6% -- substantially less than those groups' shares of the nation's population. 7. Our politics are moving from country to city, or at least near the city . More than 80% of Americans now live in metropolitan areas -- places with cities of 50,000 or more people. An additional 10%, the 2010 Census found, live in so-called micropolitan areas, organized around towns of 10,000 to 50,000. Both kinds of population-dense areas saw big growth in the last decade, with greater Houston and metro Atlanta watching their numbers surge by around 25 percent. Some of that growth came on the backs of the country's rural areas. The census found that large swaths of Appalachia and the Great Plains -- which encompasses the Dakotas, Kansas, Nebraska and the Texas panhandle -- lost population. Many Democrats argue that a national shift from traditionally Republican rural areas to more urban ones gives them a leg up. ""It's the red states that are growing, but it's blue terrain in those states,"" says Jesse Ferguson, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But it's suburban and exurban counties -- as opposed to cities themselves -- that are seeing the biggest growth, which means that areas outside of cities are becoming more politically powerful -- they'll be focal points for many new House districts that will be carved up this year -- and more competitive, but not necessarily more Democratic. 8. 2011 is a good year to be a Republican . OK, this isn't political intelligence gleaned from the census -- it's a fact that will determine how census numbers are used politically: The state governments tasked with drawing up new House districts based on the most recent census data are dominated by Republicans. Every 10 years, each state is required to draw up new congressional and state legislative districts that reflect population shifts from the last census. This year, the GOP has a big advantage: It controls 26 state legislatures, while Democrats control just 15, with eight others divided. (Nebraska, not included in that tally, has a nonpartisan legislature.) ""Republicans are in the best position for redistricting since the 1960s,"" says Tim Storey, senior fellow with the National Conference of State Legislatures. Redistricting of House and state legislative districts will occur in all states by early next year. Look for Democrats to challenge most of the redistricting plans in Republican-controlled states -- and for the GOP to do the same in Democratic-controlled states. Political posturing around the process is already under way. ""Even in places where Republicans control the process,"" says the DCCC's Ferguson, ""they can't control the demographic realities that voter growth is happening among Democratic communities.""","The census's influence doesn't stop with redistricting .
Hispanic population is exploding, but GOP has seen Hispanic support slip since 2004 .
The battleground states are moving south and west .
New electoral math makes it harder for a Democrat to win the presidency ."
"(CNN) -- For the second time in two days, security forces fired live ammunition and lobbed tear gas during protests in Change Square outside Sanaa University on Sunday, Ala'a Al-Khowlani, a witness at the scene, said. Other witnesses told CNN that at least 10 people were injured. The clashes began after pro-government demonstrators and security forces set up a road block preventing anti-government protesters from entering Change Square, witnesses said. While protesters were allowed to leave, they were not allowed to re-enter. Anti-government protesters demanded they be allowed in, and tensions heightened when they forced themselves through the road block, witnesses said. After the protesters made their way in, the shooting started and tear gas was used, they reported. According to Al-Khowlani, some believe that security forces and police dressed as civilians were shooting into the crowd from nearby rooftops. In Aden City on Sunday, four protesters were injured by security forces gunfire, witnesses there said. One day earlier, three people in Aden City died from gunshot wounds when security forces tried to disperse an anti-government rally, a medical official with the group Youth for Change said. A fourth person was killed in Dar Saad, in Aden Province, when a group of anti-government protesters stormed a government complex and set a police station on fire, the medical official said. A Yemeni Interior Ministry official acknowledged that one person was killed by security forces, but said those who raided the complex were gang members and not protesters. Regarding the killings in Aden City, a security official called the demonstrators ""separatists"" rather than protesters, and would not comment on the alleged shootings by security forces. ""The government is trying to keep people as safe as possible,"" the official said. Across Yemen, high unemployment fuels much of the anger among a growing young population steeped in poverty. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom. On Thursday, President Ali Abdullah Saleh -- who has promised not to run for president in the next round of elections -- pledged to bring a new constitution to a vote by the end of the year and transfer government power to an elected parliamentary system. Human Rights Watch released a statement Saturday, calling on countries that support Saleh to make aid contingent on the government stopping its attacks on demonstrators. ""President Saleh has once again broken his promise to end attacks on peaceful protesters, and those who supply his government with weapons risk complicity in this bloodshed,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at the rights organization.","Anti-government protesters wanted to enter Change Square .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan rebels expressed fresh optimism that Moammar Gadhafi's reign is about to crumble as a deadline looms for Gadhafi loyalists to disarm or face assault. ""I think this thug, this killer knows that he has nowhere to go,"" said Ali Tarhouni, finance and oil minister for the opposition's National Transitional Council. Tarhouni said he expects Gadhafi's four-decade rule to fall apart within a week. ""I really have no problem with waiting another week,"" he said Tuesday. ""I've waited 42 years."" But Gadhafi's whereabouts are still unconfirmed, 11 days after opposition forces stormed the capital and later captured his Tripoli compound. Rebels now have their sights set on the remaining bastions in Libya under Gadhafi's control, including his hometown of Sirte. The rebel government issued an ultimatum Tuesday for tribal leaders in towns under the control of loyalists: Surrender or face attack on Saturday, after Eid al-Fitr festivities end. While battles rage on between pro-Gadhafi and rebel forces, a humanitarian crisis in Tripoli mounts. Sixty percent of Tripoli was without water or sanitation, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Tuesday. ""I cannot overstate the urgency of this moment,"" he said. ""Time is of the essence."" Ban said he hoped to have U.N. personnel on the ground ""as quickly as possible."" The European Union said pro-Gadhafi forces closed water-pumping stations while fleeing the capital. The resulting disruption of the water supply in Tripoli is ""a major issue,"" an EU spokeswoman said, adding that security concerns along the road to the stations made it impossible to predict when the flow could be restored. The U.N. children's agency was gathering 5 million liters (1.3 million gallons) of water to ship to Tripoli. And the United Nations' World Food Programme was sending 600 tons of food commodities -- wheat flour, pasta, vegetable oil and tomato paste -- for the Red Cross to distribute in Tripoli. Elsewhere in the capital, a former Gadhafi family nanny has emerged as the marred face of brutality in the country. Shwygar Mullah said Aline Gadhafi, the wife of Gadhafi's son Hannibal, poured boiling water on her. Mullah said Aline lost her temper when her daughter wouldn't stop crying and Mullah refused to beat the child. Mullah's scalp and face are now a grotesque mosaic of red wounds and scabs. Her chest, torso and legs are all mottled with scars -- some old, some still red, raw and weeping. As she spoke, clear liquid oozed from an open wound on her head. ""She took me to a bathroom. She tied my hands behind my back, and tied my feet. She taped my mouth, and she started pouring the boiling water on my head like this,"" Mullah said, imitating the vessel of scalding hot water being poured over her head. Mullah is now being treated at a Tripoli hospital after a guard secretly brought her in. While rebels continue searching for Moammar Gadhafi, a clue came from a 17-year-old who told Sky News he saw Gadhafi on Friday in a Tripoli compound belonging to Gadhafi's son Khamis. The teen said he had been working for the previous month as a guard for Khamis Gadhafi. The ruler arrived and spoke with his son for 10 to 15 minutes, said the teen, Abdu Salam Ataher-Ali. Friday's visit by Moammar Gadhafi came as rebels were seizing control of the capital and Gadhafi loyalists were preparing to flee, the teenager told a translator during an interview in a rebel compound. During the visit, the leader's daughter, Aisha, arrived at the compound, where she and her father got into a convoy of vehicles and drove off, the teen told the translator. ""He said one of the high-ranking soldiers come to us and we asked him, 'Where is Gadhafi going?' and he said, 'To Sabha,'"" the teen said. Sabha is a city in southwestern Libya and one of the loyalist strongholds. Khamis Gadhafi then got into an armored Toyota Land Cruiser and drove toward the town of Bani Walid, the teen said. Bani Walid is a city in the Misrata district in the north. An armored Land Cruiser was among a number of vehicles that were destroyed later by NATO bombs along the road northward. It was not clear whether Khamis died in that attack, though residents in Tripoli celebrated word that he was dead. A rebel commander said Khamis Gadhafi was buried in the area. The teen said he had been persuaded to join Khamis Gadhafi's group when he was told that foreign forces were attacking the country, Sky News reported. CNN has not been able to verify the Sky News report. A rebel military commander claimed Tuesday that at least 50,000 people have been killed in the Libyan conflict. The number was calculated by adding death tolls reported in battle zones and accounts from agencies such as the Red Cross, said Hisham Abu Hajer, the Tripoli Brigades coordinator. But he did not divulge the data underlying the total and CNN cannot independently verify it. After months of carnage on both sides of the battle lines, rebels say a peaceful resolution is possible. Tarhouni, the TNC minister, said one of Gadhafi's sons -- he did not disclose who -- is trying to negotiate. But ""there is really nothing to negotiate,"" he said. ""What we offered -- and are still offering -- is that (if) they surrender, they will be safe, they will be brought to court under international supervision, and that's basically the deal on the table. Take it or leave it."" CNN's Nic Robertson, Dan Rivers, Frederik Pleitgen and Arwa Damon contributed to this report .","Opposition member: ""I think this thug, this killer knows that he has no where to go""

"(CNN) -- Jihad Azour (JA) was hand-picked by Lebanon's Prime Minister to steer the country's economy in 2005. Finance Minister, Jihad Azour, talks about how the political deadlock may affect the Lebanon's future . MME's Charles Hodson (CH) has a frank conversation with the country's finance minister about how the ongoing political upheaval may impact on Lebanon's future. Plus, Azour who is a key figure in compiling the country's budget shares his insights into economic growth and the government's ongoing reform program. (CH): With the uncertainty in your region, and your neighbors in particular, Syria and Iran, Iraq and clearly Israel, where is the growth going to come from in Lebanon over the next few years? (JA): Growth will come in Lebanon from high-value added services and industries. This is a country where in fact talent is driving growth and the economy. We don't have natural resources. We have, in fact, the best resource which is the brains of the Lebanese. We are very well positioned in the region as you know at a crossroads between various economies. Therefore, we project that growth, as soon as the political situation improves, can reach easily seven to eight percent. (CH): You've talked about the reform process and said that of 300 odd measures which you plan, about 123 have already been achieved. What are the next major steps going to be along this road to reform? (JA): In fact, it showed that one third of the reform measures were introduced in the first year of a five year reform program, which is a good track record. And by the way, the International Monetary Fund in assessing the implementation of our reform program is very much satisfied with the results Lebanon is achieving despite a very challenging political and security environment in Lebanon. In less than nine months we were able to move ahead with one third of our reform agenda. We were not really navigating in calm waters -- on the contrary. The region was not also in the best environment and the international markets were not conducive with the increase in oil prices and international interest rates. But despite all of that, we are on track when it comes to our reform agenda. (CH): You've also signed an agreement with the World Bank to cut red tape, to decrease bureaucracy in order to make it easier for companies to come in. How do you plan to improve the climate for investors in Lebanon? (JA): First of all, we are working on several reforms and changing the legal framework. We have sent to Parliament more than 10 different pieces of legislation to improve the business environment. Privatization will also play a great role in improving and attracting additional investment to Lebanon. In addition, there are a certain number of doing business measures that we are changing in Lebanon. Lebanon, as you know, is one of the most attractive platforms for business and for trade in the region. We want to bring it back as a center for excellence, as a center for finance, as a center for trade, as a center for business in the whole Middle East region. (CH): So it's very much, it's that old role that you always traditionally had -- a kind of Switzerland of the Middle East. Do you seriously think that you can get that back, that you can attract those sort of sectors - or have they already gone down the road to Dubai? (JA): Of course we can. In fact, we're not competing. We believe that everybody can has their own chance. You know activities like technology, like media, advertising services, financial services, even industry. Lebanon and the Lebanese entrepreneurs are very well equipped to compete in the region. The diaspora is huge and it's very successful and many of them are interested in coming back and investing in Lebanon. (CH): You say, as soon as the situation improves. (JA): A lot of it seems to be on hold until the political situation changes, particularly in terms of bringing the diaspora back home and harnessing it to the Lebanese economy. (JA): We were able to maintain the stability in Lebanon despite the challenging political and security environment we're living through today. We were also able to keep attention on investment in Lebanon. Of course, we're expecting much more investment. In fact, we're expecting to be one of the best destinations for investment in the Middle East. This is what the figures were showing in early 2006. The political uncertainty, it is hurting us. But I think what makes Lebanon unique is despite all these difficulties, the system is still holding. There is financial stability despite the macroeconomic imbalances. We were less hurt than other emerging markets after the crisis of the international capital markets. Still, we see a lot of appetite in investing in Lebanon in the real estate. And you know, many Arab and non-Arab investors are very bullish on Lebanon.  E-mail to a friend .","MME's Charles Hodson sits down with Lebanon's Finance Minister, Jihad Azour .

"New York (CNN) -- A bit actor who appeared on ABC's ""Ugly Betty"" series has been charged with second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon after police said they found him wielding a 3-foot long sword near the body of his dead mother. Police arrested Michael Brea, 31, after responding to neighbors' complaints of shouting coming from a Brooklyn apartment that Brea shared with his mother, New York Police Department spokesman Paul Browne said. Neighbors described hearing screams and loud voices coming from the apartment early Tuesday. ""I heard the scream for help. 'Call 9-1-1',"" said Clinton Clare, a neighbor who lives below the Brea apartment. ""It's like something you would hear in the movies,"" said neighbor Vernon Bent. ""A scream, like, 'Ahhhh'. It's more feminine, fear, a curling scream."" The victim, Yannick Brea, suffered multiple stab wounds and was found in a kneeling position in the apartment's bathroom, police said. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Neighbors said they heard chanting coming from Brea's apartment after the screaming had subsided. Bent said he heard what he believed to be Brea's voice ""repeating certain words, religious words."" Bent quoted the voice as saying, ""Jerusalem, Aaron, Moses. Jesus said pick up your bed and walk."" When authorities entered the apartment, in Brooklyn's Prospect Heights neighborhood, they found Michael Brea sitting in a chair with the sword in his hand, the police spokesman said. Brea's father, Marcel Brea, said the sword allegedly used to kill his former wife is a martial arts weapon that he used for martial arts practice . The elder Brea said that he refuses to believe his son committed the alleged crime. ""My son is not a violent person, a peaceful person,"" he said. ""My son would have done anything for his mother. I don't know what happened,"" he added. ""My son did not kill his mother."" The elder Brea said his son -- a Freemason -- had attended a Freemason's meeting at a Masonic Lodge in Harlem, on the day of the incident. He said he later recieved a phone call from his son, complaining of a headache. The elder Brea -- who is also a Freemason -- said he told his son just hours before the incident occurred to ""say your prayers [and] lay in your bed and your headache will go away."" Neighbors said police arrived at the building quickly following reports of a disturbance, but questioned how long it took authorities to actually enter the apartment. Neighbor Gregory Clare, who lives in Brea's apartment building, told CNN affiliate NY1 that ""for about 45 minutes, [police] didn't follow through [in entering the apartment]."" ""It would've made a big difference,"" he said. ""I think Miss Brea would still be here [had police responded sooner]."" But New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said during a news conference officers were following police procedures. ""When there is a barricade situation, responding patrol officers, if possible, wait for emergency service officers to come,""  he said. Brea is being held at the Bellvue Hospital Psychiatric Ward, after having first been evaluated at Kings County Hospital, according to the spokesman. Yannick Brea had worked as housekeeper at a Marriott Hotel in Manhattan, New York. ""We were shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our housekeeping associate, Ms. Yannick Brea,"" said Kathleen Duffy, spokesperson for NYC Marriott Hotels. ""Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to Ms. Brea's family and friends,"" she said. The elder Brea said he is in the process of hiring a lawyer to defend his son.","NEW: The 3-foot sword allegedly used is a martial arts weapon, suspect's father says .

"(Mashable) -- Groupon is fervently preparing for its most ambitious venture yet: the launch of a new mobile application that the company hopes will change when and how society chooses to eat, shop and play. The application, known as Groupon Now, is remarkably and elegantly simple, yet it's a radical departure from Groupon's current deal-a-day business model. When a user opens up the smartphone app, he or she will be presented with just two buttons: ""I'm hungry"" and ""I'm bored."" Clicking either button will open up a list of time-specific daily deals, based on his or her location. The familiar $10 coupons for $20 worth of food are still there, but they're not one-time offers. Instead, businesses can choose when they want these deals to be available. Say a restaurant is incredibly busy on Saturdays but could use more business on Wednesdays. With Groupon Now, that business can fill its seats during slow business days using time-specific deals. That's the beauty of Groupon Now: local businesses have never really had a simple way to manage their perishable inventory, especially labor and food. Why waste those resources during slow periods when you can bring savings-savvy consumers through the doors with a highly targeted Groupon deal? ""For merchants, the daily deal is like teeth whitening, and Groupon Now is like brushing your teeth. It can be an everyday thing to keep your business going,"" Groupon founder and CEO Andrew Mason told Bloomberg Businessweek in an extensive interview on the new product. The daily deals company has been on a tear recently -- in fact it is the fastest growing company in history -- but it faces stiff competition from companies with increasing muscle. Groupon is reportedly preparing for a $25 billion IPO just months after famously rejecting a $6 billion acquisition offer from Google, but its biggest competitor, LivingSocial, is preparing to raise half a billion dollars in funding. Not only that, but the #2 daily deals service has an app similar to Groupon Now already on the market. Groupon clearly believes Groupon Now is the future, so much so that its employees call the current iteration of its daily deals service ""Groupon 1.0."" While the market has made it clear that the group-buying business model is easily replicable, the coupon giant believes that its new offering will provide it with a unique technology and value proposition that will keep it ahead of the pack. With 70+ million subscribers and growing, Groupon will also have a big head start. It won't be long until we find out if Groupon Now is the future of local commerce; the mobile app launches in April. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Numerous U.S. rescue and assistance teams arrived Sunday in Japan and are helping lead a broad international effort to bring relief to areas ravaged by Friday's earthquake and tsunami. The United States, the United Kingdom, China, and South Korea are among 69 governments that have offered to help, Kyodo News Agency reported, citing the Japanese foreign ministry. Aid groups such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have sent teams to some of the worst-hit areas, including Sendai, Narita, Asahi and Tokyo. Mercy Corps International teamed with Peace Winds Japan to rush aid to affected regions. Stephen McDonald of Save the Children told CNN Sunday his group had multiple teams in the country, reaching out to families left homeless. There are water shortages at evacuation centers, creating hygiene challenges, he said. Children are distressed and shaken by the many aftershocks, and unable to rest at the cramped evacuation sites. ""In many cases, they've lost their homes. Some have lost family members,"" he said. Doctors Without Borders said it sent a 10-member team to the area and is assisting ""in the massive government-led relief effort."" The group will split in two on Monday and expand its reach. ""On Sunday, we conducted mobile clinics and assessments in two evacuation centers,"" said Mikiko Dotsu, coordinator of the team, in a statement Sunday. ""It appears that medical needs are increasing in evacuation centers."" The group said it is ""closely monitoring the situation around the Fukushima nuclear power plants."" But it warned, ""In the event of a serious nuclear incident, it is only the Japanese government that will be in a position to react."" The U.S. response effort includes supplies, several warships, search-and-rescue teams, radiation-contamination specialists and two officials from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission with expertise in nuclear reactors. On Sunday, the USS Ronald Reagan started delivering aid in the coastal regions of Japan's Miyagi prefecture. Crew members, in conjunction with the Japan Maritime Self Defense Forces, conducted 20 sorties delivering aid pallets using eight U.S. and Japanese helicopters, according to Sgt. Maj. Stephen Valley of U.S. Forces Japan. The team hopes to deliver 30,000 portions of emergency food rations in this initial operation, Kyodo reported. U.S. Ambassador to Japan John Roos said Sunday that numerous helicopters were ready to take part in missions to reach different parts of the country. A U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Disaster Assistance and Response Team was in Japan and working to coordinate the overall response effort with the U.S. Embassy, Roos said on Twitter. Urban search-and-rescue teams, including about 150 personnel and 12 canines trained to detect live victims, arrived in Japan as well on Sunday, Roos said. The teams are from Los Angeles and Fairfax County, Virginia. ""There are a lot hazards that have never been experienced by a search-and-rescue team,"" Los Angeles Fire Department Inspector Don Kunitomi said, including ""the radiation factor."" He added, ""We're all a little anxious about this."" ""It looks like it'll be part Katrina because of the flooding and part New Zealand because of the earthquake,"" Kunitomi said, referring to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and last year's earthquake in New Zealand. He also noted lessons the search-and-rescue team had learned in Haiti. The Chinese government sent a 15-member team to assist in the search for disaster survivors on Sunday, the Xinhua news agency reported. The team brought with them four tons of equipment and material for the search as well to provide power and telecommunications to areas that have temporarily lost those services because of the quake. A British search-and-rescue team comprising 63 fire service search-and-rescue specialists, two dogs and a medical support team are in Japan, the UK foreign office said Sunday. Specialist consular teams are in the country as well. The teams were taking up to 11 metric tons of rescue equipment, including heavy lifting and cutting equipment to extract people trapped in debris, the government said. South Korea said it was sending two rescue dogs, two handlers and three assistants to carry out what are expected to be dramatic searches of people inside collapsed structures. ""U.S. experts have been in close consultation with Japanese experts regarding the evolving situation at the Fukushima nuclear power plant,"" Roos added. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Incident and Emergency Centre has offered technical assistance to Japan in the wake of an explosion at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The government has evacuated more than 200,000 residents from homes close to the plant and tested 160 people for radiation exposure, authorities said Sunday.

"(CNN) -- When Michele Maro became captivated by ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies, she never imagined she would one day be walking around in the Shire, touring Hobbiton and peeking into hobbit holes. Fans of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy can tour a New Zealand farm that was used as the setting for Hobbiton. Those are all fictional places, but fans can visit the closest thing possible in New Zealand, where the trilogy was filmed and where specially designed tours will take visitors to some of the stunning locations featured in the movies. Maro, who lives in St. Petersburg, Florida, spent two weeks in New Zealand in 2003 being guided around forests, national parks and farms, exploring sites that she didn't think were real when she first saw them on the big screen. ""The scenery was so pretty that I thought it had to be computer-generated,"" Maro said. But the place that moved her most was a serene sheep farm in Matamata, New Zealand, where filmmakers brought to life author J.R.R. Tolkien's vision of Hobbiton, the hobbit village where Frodo Baggins lives, complete with hobbit holes peeking out of hill sides. ""I just stood there and cried. It was like, 'I can't believe I'm actually here,' "" Maro said. ""I loved the movie so much, and to actually be there where they filmed that, it overwhelmed me.""  See iReporters' film location photos » . Sing along with 'The Sound of Music' Such passion has prompted tour operators all over the world to take fans to sites that have served as settings for blockbusters on the big and small screens. They can be legendary places recognized on their own or seemingly mundane restaurants, houses and street corners that become instantly recognizable when put in the context of a favorite movie or TV show. In London, England, you can visit locations used in movies such as ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" When in Rome, Italy, world-famous landmarks like the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain and the Colosseum will make you feel as if you've stepped right into ""Roman Holiday"" and ""La Dolce Vita."" Tours highlighting sites used during the filming of ""The Sound of Music"" have many visitors singing with joy in Salzburg, Austria. ""The buses were packed. It seemed to be very popular,"" said Kelly Van Baren, a sales manager who lives in suburban Chicago, Illinois. She and her sister watched the musical over and over while growing up, she recalled, and when they visited Munich, Germany, in the fall of 2007, they made a special one-hour train trip to Salzburg just to take one of the tours. It turned out to be an adventure in itself. A convoy of three huge buses with scenes from the film painted on their sides shuttled mostly American tourists to various sites, including the church where the main characters were married and a gazebo featured during some of the musical numbers, Van Baren recalled. Her favorite site was a majestic palace used as the von Trapp family home in some of the exterior shots. The movie was played on the bus during the tour, and the sightseers were encouraged to sing along, prompting Van Baren to wonder what the locals must think of the visitors. ""It was just hilarious, these three giant buses full of Americans driving around the countryside. It wasn't a proud moment, but it was fun,"" Van Baren said. Big Apple lures fans . Movie and TV fans who want to stay closer to home to explore famous locations have plenty of movie tours to choose from in the United States. New York, which has served as the backdrop for countless films and television shows, offers a wide variety of sites. Seeing them in person for the first time can be shocking, tour operators say. ""Guests are definitely surprised by the appearance of the locations,"" said Pauline Gacanja, public relations and marketing assistant for On Location Tours. ""On TV, things generally look larger and more dramatic than they really are."" The company takes about 100,000 visitors a year to dozens of well-known sites around the city by bus, by water taxi or on foot. Buildings used as homes in ""Friends"" and ""The Cosby Show"" are among the most popular places, Gacanja said. Visitors can also see locations such as the diner used in ""Men in Black"" and the firehouse used in ""Ghostbusters,"" according to the company's Web site. But the most popular tour focuses on sites used in the television and big screen hit ""Sex and the City,"" Gacanja said. Fans of ""the Sopranos"" also have their own tour.

"(CNN) -- As the Passaic River in New Jersey threatened to crest to dangerously high levels Tuesday, residents continued to battle the floodwaters that have forced thousands of people to relocate, authorities said. Search and rescue teams are combing through Passaic County, evacuating residents who are still stuck inside their flood-ravaged homes in the wake of Hurricane Irene, said Edward O'Connell, a spokesman for the county's Office of Emergency Management. About 1,700 residents have been evacuated from their homes in Wayne, Towa, Little Falls, Paterson and Woodland Park communities, said O'Connell. Many more left their homes on their own over the weekend, he added. Rescuers are pulling families and pets alike from their homes and using rafts to transport them down the county's flooded roads. Evacuees are being transferred to several area shelters or taken to the homes of family members living on higher ground. ""It's been pretty much 24 hours a day,"" said Sgt. Alex Popov of the Paterson, New Jersey, Police Department. Popov estimated that about 500 people had been rescued from their homes in Paterson. ""We're dealing with elderly people, families, small children and pets,"" he explained. Forecasters have predicted that the Passaic River, which runs through the southern tip of the county, will swell to a level that is double what is considered to be a ""flood stage"" in some areas. ""They are expecting it to crest sometime today and the other rivers will be rising a little bit as well,"" O'Connell said. ""Hopefully it will crest soon and we can assess the damages,"" he added.

"(CNN) -- Just a few weeks after the Los Angeles Unified School District approved thousands of pink slips for employees, incoming superintendent John Deasy has requested a pay cut. The superintendent position pays an annual salary of $330,000. But Deasy, who is currently serving as deputy superintendent, sent a letter to the district requesting he keep his current salary of $275,000, according to A.J Duffy, president of the teachers union. Duffy said the request comes as the district is dealing with budget shortfalls and after it approved layoffs for more than 5,000 teachers, and health and human services personnel. The teachers union is praising Deasy's decision. ""Bravo John, you did the right thing,"" Duffy said.

"(CNN) -- Two blasts -- the second coming after police and passersby had gathered at the site of the first -- killed seven people and wounded 18 Tuesday evening in the Russian republic of Chechnya, according to the Russian news agency RIA Novosti. The state-run agency said the first blast occurred when officers attempted to detain a suspected militant in the Chechen capital of Grozny. About 30 minutes after that explosion, a second blast hit the same area after people had gathered there, RIA Novosti said. The news agency quoted Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov as saying five police officers, an emergencies ministry official and a civilian died in the two blasts. Rebels in Chechnya started out fighting for independence in the 1990s, but in recent years the fight has been aimed more at imposing Islamist rule and asserting their authority in the area. The standard of living in the southwestern republic is poor compared with the rest of Russia. Unemployment is rampant and infant mortality is high. In addition, the Chechen population of about 1 million is mostly made up of Sunni Muslims, who maintain a distinctly separate cultural and linguistic identity from Russian Orthodox Christians.","NEW: A second blast hits where an earlier one had killed two police officers .

"(CNN) -- Alan Morris talked very fast about the dangers of thyroid gland radiation poisoning as his business line rang incessantly in the background. ""Look, I really have to go,"" Morris said as he abruptly ended the telephone interview to fill another order. Morris is president of Anbex Inc., one of only two FDA-approved U.S. manufacturers of potassium iodide, a medication that can block the thyroid glands of human beings and animals from absorbing excessive amounts of radiation from a nuclear accident. Experts believe that many of the dangers posed by overexposure to nuclear fallout, including cancer, can be diminished by blocking thyroid absorption of radiation. On Friday, a massive earthquake and tsunami triggered what is being called Japan's worst nuclear emergency since World War II. Since, Morris said his Williamsburg, Virginia-based company has received hundreds, if not thousands, of calls from potential buyers in Asia as well as repeat U.S. customers suddenly seeking to replenish their stockpiles of the drug. So, too, has Fleming Pharmaceuticals in Missouri, which, according to the FDA, is the only U.S. manufacturer of the anti-radiation medication in liquid form. Anbex is the only company in the United States that manufactures the tablet form of potassium iodide, according to the FDA. Fleming's owner, Debbie Fleming-Wurdak, said her is currently getting inundated by more calls than her 85 employees can handle. She and company President Phill Dritsas said they are looking to add temporary employees to help handle the flood of calls. They also said they've added a second shift and are considering staying open around the clock until the current crisis is over. Officials for both companies said the deluge of requests stemming from Japan's nuclear crisis comes as state and local governments, hospitals, schools and other institutions in the United States have expressed renewed interest in replenishing their supplies. That's partly because the threat of nuclear fallout in Japan appears to have heightened demand in this country, they said. It is also because some of those stockpiled medications are close to expiring. That includes the 6 million doses of liquid potassium iodide provided to the U.S. government in 2006 by Fleming Pharmaceuticals. The expiration dates for those medications begin in April, Fleming-Wurdak said. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said that although weather conditions in Japan have moved ""small releases"" of radiation from damaged reactors in the Fukushima prefecture out to sea, the United States was ""not expected to experience any harmful levels of radioactivity"" given the thousands of miles that separate the two countries. The federal government, Fleming-Wurdak said, isn't currently planning to purchase more potassium iodide for national stockpile. The Strategic National Stockpile is a repository of vaccines, antibiotics, antidotes and other drugs and supplies for use in natural disaster, pandemic or bioterrorism attack. Fleming-Wurdak said she began alerting customers that their potassium iodide supplies were starting to expire two weeks ago. That prompted an uptick in orders, including one from New York state for ""hundreds of thousands of bottles,"" she said. ""We don't have enough to meet the current demand,"" she said. Fleming-Wurdak said eyedroppers for the medication are particularly in short supply. Dritsas said the U.S. government should consider tapping into the Strategic National Stockpile for Japanese earthquake victims threatened by nuclear fallout from the Fukushima Daiichi plant. ""Help Japan now,"" Dritsas said. ""In the meantime, we would be definitely working towards filling those quantities that are being ordered now."" Dritsas said he made that request Monday to U.S. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Markey has warned that Japan's nuclear accident highlights the vulnerabilities of reactors in the United States. On Monday, he called on the Obama administration to fully implement a provision in the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 to make potassium iodide available for anyone who lives within 20 miles of a nuclear power plant. The federal government has never purchased enough to meet that standard. There is currently only enough of the medication available for populations living within 10 miles of nuclear reactors in the United States, according to U.S. officials. That's not nearly enough, Morris said. He cited the April 1986 incident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, considered the worst nuclear reactor accident ever. Death tolls resulting from the accident have varied widely according to various studies, with totals ranging from the thousands to more than a million. Several studies have found that the accident led to a rise in thyroid cancer cases in children as far away as Poland. ""Even taking the most conservative numbers, it all says there is something wrong with this picture when we know there isn't more potassium iodide out there,"" Morris said as he talked on his personal telephone line. In the background, the other phone was ringing.","The Japanese nuclear crisis prompts calls to U.S. manufacturers .

"CAMEMBERT, France (CNN) -- We're up in the north central part of France -- Normandy -- to see what's happening with French cheese. Cheese lovers will be happy to know, just about nothing, at least as far as the traditional cheeses are concerned. Cheese from the Camembert region now carries the same cachet as a chateau label for wine. But for the milk industry in general, it's another story. It has now a larger annual turnover than the steel industry in France (which admittedly is in decline.) Somehow the French have figured a way to export dairy products to people who already have cows and their own dairy industries-- to the tune of nearly €4 billion ($6 billion) per year. CNN spoke to a few of the people who do just that everyday and who are part of the changing face of France. Philippe Meslon, the mayor of Saint-Loup de Fribois and the administrator of the Saint-Loup cheese works says: ""A camembert not made out of raw milk is like making love without sex. ""A Frenchman is someone who cultivates with modern evolution his past. It's someone who protects moral values, cultural values and artistic values, and when I say cultural values I would include camembert."" Meslon and small cheese makers like Francois Durand, who has 40 cows, have struggled and won the right to an Appelation d'Origine Controllee -- the mark AOC for their ""Camembert de Normandie"" which carries the same cachet as a chateau label for wine. For Durand making cheese is about not cutting corners. ""You have to have the passion,"" he says.  ""Yes it's difficult because it means a lot of work. We make it all by hand. I do believe it is important because the cheese is an emblem of France. It is a gastronomic emblem."" Still some small cheesemakers have been driven out of business and the taste and smell of their particular cheeses are lost to the world forever. For Michel Delorme it was a combination of new, more stringent rules and his age that led him to quit producing his handmade Camemberts. Michel Delorme: ""It's more and more complicated for those who stay in the business. They must hold out! Yes I miss the cheese a little. That's true. But I've kept my souvenirs, you see I've kept my old milk cans so I can stay in the spirit of Camembert!"" Despite those who've quit, the actual number of the variety of cheeses in France is growing. At the last cheese census more than 1,000 different kinds of cheeses were made here. The milk industry is no small cheese in France, thanks to the efforts of people like Philippe Jachnik who travels the world endlessly promoting milk products, which these days include protein supplements and milk derivatives that can go into all sorts of processed food. Jachnik, who works for the milk marketing consortium, says: ""I really would say I am selling the French approach to milk. We EAT a lot of milk. We DRINK a lot of water, wine, beer and coffee. But drinking milk is not a big business here. ""France has developed technological and marketing knowledge about adding value to a raw material-- milk. I have been traveling for 40 years all around the world and I feel so welcome. When you are French and you demonstrate that being French you can listen to others, people are interested in knowing about this country, about its people, about the way of life here."" Jachnik must be doing a good job as it's not just abroad that the French are selling more milk products-- cheese consumption in France has doubled from 12 to 24 kilos per person per year. It seems there's no curding their enthusiasm ...  E-mail to a friend .","Milk industry is booming in France, now has larger turnover than steel industry .

"(CNN)  -- Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel has made an emotional appeal after his father was abducted in his native Nigeria. ""Please just let him go,"" he told Sky Sports News. ""He's just an old man, he hasn't done any harm to anyone as far as I know and I don't know why he has been taken."" Michael Obi, who runs a transport company in Jos, the main city in Plateau State in central Nigeria, has not been seen or heard of since he failed to return home from work last Friday. Obi Mikel was told of the problem just before the start of Chelsea's Premier League match at Stoke Sunday which finished goalless and said his father was at the forefront of his thoughts throughout the match. ""Nigeria is the country I am from, I've always tried to help my country in any way I can, playing for my country or anything,"" he said. ""This is a time where I need the country to help me. Whoever has got my dad, whoever knows where my dad is, please contact me and hopefully he can be released."" Chelsea have given Mikel their support in a statement on their official website. ""Everyone at Chelsea Football Club was very concerned to hear that John Mikel Obi's father has been reported as missing and possibly abducted. ""We will give Mikel and his family our full support at this most difficult time."" Mikel confirmed they had not heard from his father's abductors and no ransom had yet been demanded. He expressed surprise that it had happened in the region of Nigeria where he hailed. ""I think this happens a lot in the eastern part of Nigeria, but I think my dad will be the first this happened to in the north,"" he said. ""It's a very safe place where I live. That's why they live there."" Mikel's plight is similar to that of fellow Nigerian international, the Everton defender Joseph Yobo, whose elder brother was kidnapped in Port Harcourt in 2008. Nornu Yobo was released after 10 days, but it was unclear if any financial demands had been met. Obi Mikel has been at Chelsea since 2006 and helped them to the EPL and FA Cup double in the 2009-10 season. He has played 30 times for the Nigeria national team.","John Obi Mikel's father abducted in Nigeria where he runs a transport company .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- In one of soccer's biggest showdowns, Mexico rallied from an early deficit with four straight goals to defeat the United States 4-2 and win the 2011 Gold Cup on Saturday. The American team jumped out to an earlier lead when Michael Bradley, a center midfielder and the son of coach Bob Bradley, scored the first goal just nine minutes into the game. Landon Donovan, the leading goal-scorer in U.S. history, netted a second goal roughly 20 minutes later. But Mexico answered back, with Pablo Barrera and then Andres Guardado scoring two goals within 10 minutes of each other to tie the score. A few minutes into the second half, Barrera scored another goal to give Mexico its first lead of the game. Giovani dos Santos gave Mexico a 4-2 advantage with a score with about 13 minutes remaining, effectively cinching his team's victory. Fox Soccer reported that 93,420 spectators watched the game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, above its capacity of 92,542 according to the stadium's website. Mexico's win gives in bragging rights in the rivalry, the third consecutive time both teams have met in the tournament's final. As it is every year, the game was organized by the soccer confederation for North America, Central America and the Caribbean. Besides boasting privileges, Mexico earns a ticket to the Confederations Cup in Brazil in 2013, a year before the World Cup. Mexico and the United States had split the last two Gold Cups, with the Mexicans embarrassing the Americans with a 5-0 thrashing in 2009. In 2007, the Americans took the contest, sending the team to the 2009 Confederations Cup where it finished second behind Brazil. Until Saturday night, the United States had not lost to Mexico on American soil when at full strength in 12 matches dating back to the year 2000. Still, the American players know that soccer draws many fans to Mexico's team, as was evident at this weekend's game. Hispanics are now the nation's second-largest group under the latest census. ""You come into your country and you know they are going to have more fans than you are,"" U.S. defender Jonathan Bornstein said in remarks on the confederation website, ""but nonetheless, we're going to have enough fans out there supporting us. We're on our home turf, and so we need to be considered the home team even though we might not have all the fans."" Added U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard about the rivalry: ""It's been the same since I was a kid watching it. It's the same today. It's passion. There's a ton of respect, but yet again it borders on hatred."" ""But it's passion. It's good. I think we have very healthy respect for them and whether they want to say it or not, they have healthy respect for us and they should,"" Howard said on the confederation website. Mexico's team manager Jose Manuel de la Torre said before the contest that the game ""has transformed into something very important to the Mexican people that live in the United States."" ""It is a clasico,"" de la Torre told the confederation, before Saturday's match. ""That makes for a heated atmosphere. But the final is still a soccer game featuring two strong, well-coached teams that have worked hard to reach a final we will enjoy."" For the United States, it marks its fourth consecutive appearance in the final -- a confederation record, according to the U.S. Soccer Federation. The Gold Cup is being held in Southern California for the first time in nine years, the federation said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Mexico scores 4 straight goals to earn a 4-2 win over the United States .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- When police walked into the home, they found a 5-year-old girl weighing nearly 160 pounds, her teeth rotting, her skin covered in spider bites. Her 4-year-old sister was lying on a filthy mattress, wearing only a urine-soaked diaper. Police were responding to a domestic dispute call at the Marietta, Georgia, house Monday when they encountered the shocking scene. They called in child abuse investigators, and ultimately arrested the parents, James and Anne Cardona, charging both with second-degree child cruelty, Cobb County police spokesman Joe Hernandez said. The children are now in the state custody. Their parents were released on bond, but Anne Cardona was arrested again late Thursday for giving ""misleading information"" to a magistrate judge at the couple's first court appearance Tuesday, said Col. Milton Beck of the Cobb County sheriff's department. She remained in jail Friday without bond until further notice from court, he said. Attempts to reach her husband were unsuccessful Friday, and it wasn't immediately clear whether they had retained legal counsel. Asked by CNN affiliate WSB-TV on Thursday whether the children were mistreated at the home, Anne Cardona said no. Police had only stopped at the family's home in the Atlanta suburb one other time, more than a year ago, but hadn't observed anything like they saw Monday, Hernandez said. The house ""stunk of urine and mold,"" according to the arrest warrants for the Cardonas. It is ""infested with roaches, [fleas], cobwebs and gigantic spiders,"" the documents said. The bathroom and shower are covered in black mold and dirt, they said. Neither girl is enrolled in school. Both are severely obese. The older daughter, who weighs 158 pounds, could not walk 10 feet without ""becoming out of breath and wheezing,"" officers said. The younger child weighs 89 pounds and still drinks from a baby bottle. Her feet were blackened with dirt, her skin also covered in insect bites. ""A situation like this is tragic -- tragic for the family, but mostly for the kids,"" said Normer Adams, executive director of the Georgia Association of Homes and Services for Children, a trade group representing a range of agencies, including foster homes and family support programs. ""This is an extreme case of neglect by the parents,"" he said. ""These kids are hurting on many levels -- certainly educational development, and probably social development."" Adams said it's unlikely that the Cardonas would be able to regain custody of their children, saying it's ""too late"" for the family to avoid foster care.","Police found the two young Georgia girls covered in filth and bug bites .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan, whose career has been derailed by drunken driving convictions, probation violations and a shoplifting charge, admitted in an interview with talk show host Jay Leno to ""poor decisions in the past"" -- but predicted an Oscar is in her future. Lohan, in a ""Tonight Show"" interview taped Monday and broadcast Tuesday, said she's ""willing to do the work that I have to do to follow through with being an actress."" She hopes to be back on Leno's show in a few years with an Oscar, Lohan said. ""I've made a lot of mistakes and I've recognized that, but I'm in the clear now and I feel like as long as I stay focused then I will be able to, you know, achieve what I want to be able to achieve,"" Lohan told the NBC show's host. When Leno asked what one thing she would like to change about herself, Lohan said it would be the public perception of her. ""I want the public knowledge to be about my work, not about things that I didn't get into this business for, that I've put myself into positions where that was the bigger story than what I was working on,"" she said. Lohan, 24, said she's been cast to play mobster John ""Junior"" Gotti's wife in a movie, but a 120-day jail sentence and several months of community service for a probation violation threatens to keep her out of the movie. It starts shooting in October. Lohan's next stop: Skid Row . She is also scheduled to go on trial in June for allegedly stealing a gold and diamond necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. If convicted, Lohan could face up to a year in jail. The 13 days she spent in a Los Angeles jail last summer ""was an interesting experience and it was definitely a wake-up call,"" Lohan said. ""And I think when it happened, everything happens for a reason. I don't know exactly what will happen."" Her latest legal setback came Friday when Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner ruled that Lohan violated her probation on two 2007 drunken driving convictions by being arrested for the necklace theft. Lohan said she was ""kind of numb"" when Sautner sentenced her to 120 days in jail and 480 hours of community service. Lohan released from jail after posting bond . ""I was kind of shocked, I didn't really expect the outcome to be what it was, but I'm a big girl and I'm going to do what I'm told to do, continue on with working in my life and I'm taking responsibility,"" she said. The actress has admitted a drug addiction in the past, and she's spent at least eight months in substance abuse rehab in the last four years. She blamed her youth on her bad choices. ""Being young and being in a position that I was in, you don't really take the time to appreciate what you have, and it's all kind of a whirlwind and people make decisions for you,"" she said. ""But I'm not a kid anymore."" Lohan's most optimistic statement came when Leno asked where she sees herself when she turns 30 -- six years from now.

"(CNN) -- Rail riders along the California coast and the Boston-Washington ""Northeast Corridor"" are set to reap much of the benefits from $2 billion that Florida policymakers had earlier rejected for high-speed rail development. The Obama administration on Monday announced the reallocated funding, part of its push to spur environmentally friendly transportation and modernize the nation's infrastructure that's supported partly by the 2009 economic stimulus package. Fifteen states and Amtrak will receive the money to back 22 high-speed intercity passenger rail projects. Among other things, the funds will be used to improve speed and service in the Northeast, add faster rail lines in the Midwest and help spur more efficient train service between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Nearly $300 million will be spent to reduce major delays for trains coming in and out of Manhattan -- the nation's busiest passenger rail junction. Within the next four years, high-speed rail advocate Petra Todorovich estimated trains between New York and Philadelphia will routinely move at 160 mph because of a host of upgrades aimed at improving ""train speeds, capacity and reliability."" While billed as new funding, the money actually is previously pledged funds being directed to new recipients. Soon after taking office, Florida Gov. Rick Scott cited expected cost overruns and long-term operating costs for his call to block federal funding for an 84-mile-long high-speed rail line that would link Tampa and Orlando. Days after the Florida Supreme Court issued a ruling that allowed the Republican government to reject the federal money, the U.S. Transportation Department opened up a process to solicit fresh bids from other states and entities. It is all part of the $53 billion that the White House has proposed spending over the next six years to promote high-speed rail -- an initiative facing a chilly reception in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. ""President Obama and I made a commitment to improve and expand America's transportation system,"" Vice President Joe Biden said in a statement. These new investments ""will continue our progress toward making this vision a reality."" Biden, a regular Amtrak commuter between his home state of Delaware and Washington during his 36 years in the Senate, is known as a leading supporter of federally supported rail travel. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, on hand at New York's Penn Station for the announcement, insisted the funds will ""help states across the country create jobs, spur economic development and boost manufacturing in their communities."" Obama said in January's State of the Union address that he was setting a goal of giving 80% of Americans access to high-speed rail within 25 years. The stimulus act has provided about $10.1 billion toward Obama's goal so far, according to the Transportation Department. ""By 2050, the United States will be home to 100 million additional people -- the equivalent of another California, Texas, New York and Florida combined,"" LaHood noted. ""We simply cannot build enough highways and airports to accommodate this growth."" Supporters insist the emphasis on faster rail transportation is a necessary investment in the country's economic competitiveness. Critics contend it's little more than a massive boondoggle that is contributing to skyrocketing federal deficits while providing few proven benefits over the long term. Scott's decision this winter to reject what eventually worked out to $2 billion in federal funding for the Orlando-to-Tampa plan surprised a number of observers. This came after the Obama administration pulled another $1.2 billion in funding from Ohio and Wisconsin after their newly elected GOP governors vowed to kill high-speed rail projects that were under way. LaHood portrayed those cases Monday as relatively rare exceptions, noting that the Transportation Department received $10 billion worth of requests for the $2 billion available. ""Who says America does not have a pent-up demand?"" he asked. Amtrak officials note that they set a new annual ridership record of more than 28 million passengers for the last fiscal year. Regardless, the new spending makes little sense at the current time, according to Sam Staley, an analyst at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian-oriented Los Angeles-based think tank. The administration ""seems to be completely deaf to the real concerns about whether this is a well thought out program,"" Staley told CNN. ""There are so many other transportation needs that are going unfunded, including just bring existing transit systems up to a good state of repair."" ""I don't see how anyone looking at the numbers can say that high-speed rail is going to be a primary driver of economic growth"" in the regions targeted by the new money, Staley said. ""What it will do is supplement the existing transportation network and serve a very targeted niche of that market. But it's not going to be a broad-based transportation solution."" Todorovich, the director of the urban planning initiative America 2050, said she believed critics would continue to target the rail initiative because it is ""one of Obama's signature initiatives."" But she believes such efforts run counter to the needs and wants of policymakers and citizens nationwide who want such infrastructure projects to go forward -- even if that's not true in Florida. ""(This) announcement helps to restore public confidence in the program, as we see that many states around the country are ready to put Florida's unwanted funding to use,"" she said.

"New York (CNN) -- One of the most well-known sports franchises in the world is facing a lawsuit over its famous logo. A Yonkers, New York, woman is suing the New York Yankees for trademark infringement, claiming her uncle created the Yankees top hat logo but never got paid for his work. In a complaint filed in Manhattan Federal Court, Tanit Buday claims her uncle Kenneth Timur was a graphic designer commissioned in 1936 to create a logo for the Yankees. Buday says former Yankees owners Jacob Ruppert and Del Webb heard of Timur's work from his sister, who worked in Brooklyn as a manicurist in the 1930s. Timur, who lived in Europe at the time, created a logo that incorporated a top hat and bat similar to the one now used by the team. Buday says the logo has Timur's established signature ""P,"" which appeared on his other artwork. According to the complaint, Buday took the logos to Rob Wallace, a design analyst -- who concluded it to be ""evident that they are so significantly similar that they could not have been created independently from one another."" Buday explains that her uncle was not aware that the Yankees adopted the logo until he immigrated to America in 1947 and was asked to revise the logo for their 1952 celebration of 50 years based in New York City. She claims Timur was hopeful that this time the sports franchise would offer him some kind of recognition, but took the opportunity to ""sign"" his work with a ""P."" Instead of 1903 to 1952, the logo appears as ""1P03-1952"" on the patches of the uniform. Alice McGillion, spokesperson for the New York Yankees, said they haven't been served with the lawsuit. ""This is a wonderful country where anybody can sue for anything, even when the allegations are over 70 years old,"" she said. Buday says that because of scarce resources and trust in Yankees owners, her uncle never got a lawyer and did not copyright his work, but in 1960 he lost his confidence in the team and passed on the fight to her, in hopes she would pursue the claims.","Woman claims uncle created Yankees logo in 1936 .

This time it's a hacker attack on various websites associated with Sony Pictures.

An additional 75,000 music codes and 3.5 million coupons were also uncovered. The attack, part of a campaign known as Sownage, was announced on Twitter and on the LulzSec website. LulzSec said that it didn't have enough resources to copy all the data that it was able to access. But the group did manage to grab a collection of databases that contain thousands of usernames. The accounts, presumably associated with any sort of registered activity on SonyPictures.com (or its subsidiaries or partners), contain information like passwords, email addresses, dates of birth and other Sony opt-in data. This certainly isn't as dangerous as the information that was exposed during the PSN hack, but it could still be used to gather access to more important accounts elsewhere. The scariest part of this attack isn't what was taken, but how easy it was for the LulzSec members to take it. According to the groups own press release, access to the main Sony Pictures website was gained using a very basic tactic called a SQL injection. We haven't had a chance to examine the released files to see what this injection was, but it's likely that an out-of-date software stack and relatively unprotected web server made passing the injection trivial. LulzSec says that all of the information it took was unencrypted. ""Sony stored over 1,000,000 passwords of its customers in plaintext,"" says the hackers' press release, ""which means it's just a matter of taking it. "" Seeing as this is the second security breach of a major Sony-branded website in just outside of a week, we have to ask: Is anyone at Sony employed to handle web security? Sure, managing a large number of brands and properties that are often connected in name only has to be a challenge, not to mention the logistical and administrative challenges of managing websites that can store millions of user profiles. Still, that doesn't make up for what by all appearances is an abysmal security record. LulzSec has been on a tear, infiltrating the websites and databases for the UK television program, ""The X Factor,"" parts of Fox.com, Sonymusic.co.jp and many parts of PBS.org in the past three weeks alone. The attacks, while often juvenile in nature and execution (the Lulzsecurity.com website plays the theme from ""The Love Boat""), underscore just how important it is for brands to keep their web servers updated, hardened and monitored. In the age of simple publishing tools like WordPress, it's easy for managers to underestimate the importance of having someone on contract or on staff to keep data encrypted and protected. We can only hope the most recent cyber attacks convince executives to think seriously about investing in online security. See the original article on Mashable.com . © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"New York (CNN) -- AT&T will acquire T-Mobile USA from telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom for an estimated $39 billion in cash and stocks, the companies said in a joint release Sunday. The acquisition will expand AT&T's 4G network 1.2 million square miles and will be accessible to an additional 46.5 million Americans, the statement said. AT&T also expects to gain enough cell towers to increase its network density by 30%. ""This transaction represents a major commitment to strengthen and expand critical infrastructure for our nation's future,"" AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson said in a statement. The $39 billion purchase will include a $25 billion cash payment; the remainder will be paid using AT&T stock. AT&T can increase the cash portion of the price tag by up to $4.2 billion while cutting the stock portion. As part of the acquisition, Deutsche Telekom will have an 8% equity stake in AT&T and a company representative will join the AT&T board of directors. The agreement has been approved by the boards of directors at both AT&T and Deutsche Telekom. CNNMoney: AT&T to acquire T-Mobile for $39 billion . The new entity would be the biggest in the US, combining AT&T's 95 million customers with T-Mobile's 34 million users for a total of 130 million subscribers. AT&T said the transaction would quickly provide ""the spectrum and network efficiencies necessary ... to address impending spectrum exhaust in key markets"" due to the exponential growth of traffic on its network. The telecom giant added that it expects to gain enough cell towers through the deal to increase its network density by 30%. As part of the merger, AT&T committed to expand its 4G network 1.2 million square miles, making it accessible to an additional 46.5 million Americans, mostly in rural and smaller communities, the statement said. The AT&T release notes that its 4G expansion would help achieve the Federal Communications Commission and President Obama's goals to connect ""every part of America to the digital age."" The $39 billion purchase will include a $25 billion cash payment; the remainder will be paid using AT&T stock. AT&T can increase the cash portion of the payment by up to $4.2 billion while cutting the stock portion. AT&T didn't directly address how the merger would affect the new company's pricing. But on the website it built to announce the deal, www.mobilizeeverything.com, it notes: ""Historically, during periods when carriers combined to achieve efficiencies, U.S. wireless prices fell."" The company also cites a 2010 report from the U.S. General Accounting Office which found that the average cost of wireless services (adjusted for inflation) ""declined 50 percent from 1999 to 2009, during a period which saw five major wireless mergers."" The agreement has been approved by the boards of directors at both AT&T and Deutsche Telekom, but will be subject to regulatory approval. Fortune: Regulatory hurdles await merger . Charles Golvin from Forrester Research said: ""AT&T's acquisition of T-Mobile, if approved, brings good news and bad news. The good news: high-speed mobile broadband service will improve in quality and coverage, including ? in the long run ? those in rural communities outside the reach of terrestrial broadband today. ""The bad news: the cost of that service won't come down nearly as fast as customers would like, since AT&T and Verizon Wireless combined would own nearly three out of every four wireless subscriptions in the US. While clearly troublesome for Sprint and other mobile smaller mobile competitors, It's also bad news for cable operators, whose incipient mobility products will suffer in comparison to what AT&T and Verizon can offer.""

"(WIRED) -- LinkedIn announced a new platform Wednesday for its business-focused social networking site -- offering websites and developers easy tools to embed ""recommend"" buttons, company-profile boxes and contact widgets on third-party websites -- as well as a way to log in to other sites using LinkedIn. Calling it ""a new platform for building the professional web,"" LinkedIn is seeking to challenge Facebook's growing control over online identity. Once just a site for sharing photos and updates with friends, Facebook has woven itself into the fabric of the net with its Open Graph platform, that lets other websites embed Facebook widgets, install ""Like"" buttons, plug-in a commenting system, and let users log in with their Facebook credentials. Though LinkedIn's new platform doesn't mention Facebook by name, the term ""Professional Web"" clearly shows the company trying to position itself as a more mature and respectable alternative to Facebook. The new tools rely on JavaScript APIs and the OAuth 2.0 system for logins (the same as used by Yahoo, Google and Twitter, among others). Among the offerings: . -- A Share button that posts a link to a page or news story to the user's feed on LinkedIn. -- A Recommend button to give a vote to a product you like. WIRED: LinkedIn scores $53 million . -- Member profile widgets that show the LinkedIn profile of a company executive or website owner. LinkedIn's Share button joins a growing number of plugins that try to get users to spread the news about a site or news story, a pantheon that includes Facebook's Like, Twitter's Tweet button, and social voting and submission widgets from Digg and Reddit. For those who run their own blogs or websites, LinkedIn is making it simple to show off a snippet of your LinkedIn profile and for visitors logged into LinkedIn, they'll see thumbnails of connections they have in common. Companies can also embed widgets that shows off employee profiles or profiles of companies featured on their site or in a news story, showing off the ones that are ""in"" your network. The box can also be configured to show off key information about the company -- and a link to its official LinkedIn page -- instead of employee profiles. WIRED: LinkedIn to lay of 10% of staff . It's a powerful challenge. LinkedIn has a solid and growing user base, one that's shown it's willing to pay for extra features. The company is preparing for an IPO, and extending the power of LinkedIn's focus on business, not pleasure, outside of its online walls could help the company grow into a powerful competitor to Facebook. WIRED: Let IPOs bloom again -- LinkedIn files with SEC . It would be the ""real world"" site that people graduate to, from the college fun of Facebook. Unfortunately, LinkedIn's platform faces the tough challenge of coming almost a year after Facebook debuted its Like button and its Open Graph API.

"(GOOD.IS) -- Our collective use of the word ""addiction"" is getting out of hand. What are you hooked on? A quick Twitter search shows the absurd range of meanings carried by one word: ""addiction."" Pain-med addiction in the NFL and Charlie Sheen's presumed addictions fit the medical definition, but apparently cupcake enthusiasts suffer from a ""cake tin addiction."" Technology is an addiction magnet: People love to confess/boast about their addiction to YouTube, iPhone, Droid, Twitter, and CrackBerry. Others have low-tech addictions to tattoos, Gatorade, worrying, hockey, green tea, Shamrock Shakes, coffee, white chocolate, porn, American Idol, jazz, love, and Reggie Bush. This word covers everything from America's gasoline intake to a psychotherapy-soaked update of a classic excuse: ""My dog has a digging addiction and buried my homework."" GOOD: Fashion addicts stop shopping for one year . Like so many words, the meaning of ""addiction"" has varied wildly over time, but the trajectory might surprise you. The common perception is that ""addiction"" was drug-centric at birth, before gradually spreading to broader and sillier stuff, like sex addiction and Internet addiction. In reality, it's gone from broad to specific to broad, taking on and shuffling off many meanings. Addictions have always been with us, but a single, unified meaning of ""addiction"" is hard to score. GOOD:Would a laptop for every student help? The ultimate authority on English language history, the Oxford English Dictionary, shows the first variation of ""addiction"" popping up in the 1500s. The term comes from the Latin addictus, and in Rome, being ""addict"" -- originally an adjective -- meant being forced by a judge to be a servant or slave, often because of debt. From there, ""to addict"" started meaning to voluntarily ""bind or attach oneself to a person, party, or cause; to devote oneself to as a servant, adherent, or disciple."" The meaning of ""addiction"" then grew to mean a zealous, disciple-like devotion. You can see traces of this meaning in a classic Kramer rant to chocoholic George: ""You may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master: the cocoa bean!"" Also in the 1500s, ""addiction"" is first found with a broader meaning of ""immoderate or compulsive"" dedication or devotion to something, which is exactly like our current addictions to cinnamon rolls and Angry Birds. Not until the 1700s did ""addiction"" start to become substance-specific, and it took much longer for the William S. Burroughs sense to take hold. In Psychology Today, social/clinical psychologist Stanton Peele wrote an excellent piece on the evolution of addiction, noting that, ""Only in the 20th century was it narrowed and restricted to the use of narcotics, specifically heroin. Any 'expansion' is thus a return to addiction's traditional meaning."" GOOD: How to share your stuff with groups . Word maven Michael Quinion has more addiction history here, and a recent update to the OED filled in some blanks. Terms such as ""addiction counseling"" and ""addiction counselor"" didn't pop up till the early 1970s, perhaps because of post-1960s drug awareness. We've been talking about Internet addiction almost as long as we've been talking about the Internet (or at least since 1994). Though Tiger Woods owns the term these days, ""sex addict"" goes all the way back to 1927, and the narcissistic ""self-addiction"" -- custom-made for the Twitter age -- is found in 1642. I love the term ""over-addiction,"" which is traced to 1662 and seems to mean ""mega-addiction."" These days, we might call it an addiction-pocalypse. With so many types and meanings of addiction, it's always been a challenge for medical professionals to determine, as Peele writes in PT, ""Just what does addiction refer to? Is it a brain disease? A behavioral pattern? Or is it a larger experiential pattern?"" Medical tomes such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual are continually revised but Peele summarizes the key points for layfolk: ""Addiction is the search for emotional satisfaction -- for a sense of security, a sense of being loved, even a sense of control over life. But the gratification is temporary and illusory, and the behavior results instead in greater self-disgust, reduced psychological security, and poorer coping ability. That's what all addictions have in common."" That's what all illness-type addictions have in common, anyway. I get plenty of emotional satisfaction from my daily fix of books like the OED and Green's Dictionary of Slang. My word obsession hasn't raised or lowered my ability to cope, and my level of self-disgust has held steady since Catholic grammar school. I guess I'm in the safe, general range of addiction rather than the medical danger zone. © 2010 Good.

"New York (CNN) -- The remains of three additional people were discovered Monday morning near Gilgo Beach on Long Island, according to Richard Dormer, Suffolk County Police commissioner. A total of eight human remains have been found in the area since a missing New Jersey woman prompted the searches beginning in 2010. Shannan Gilbert, 24, of Jersey City, New Jersey, has been missing since May 1 and was last seen alive in the Gilgo Beach area. As authorities searched for clues about her disappearance last year, they uncovered the bodies of four prostitutes in various stages of decomposition. Police say the hunt for a potential serial killer continues, as does the search for Gilbert, who, like the women whose bodies have been found, advertised for prostitution services on such sites as Craigslist. An additional body was found March 29 off Ocean Parkway, west of Cedar Beach. When medical examination determined they were not Gilbert's remains, the police continued to search, leading to Monday's discovery. Gilbert's family is being asked to identify whether the remains found Monday are those of their missing daughter, Dormer said. ""We should move forward to find out quickly if it's her or not her. We put a priority on identification,"" Dormer said. ""We haven't given up on the search for Shannan Gilbert,"" Dormer said, ""just in case the remains we discovered today are not hers."" Gilbert's sister, Sheree Gilbert, told HLN's Nancy Grace Monday night that her family was notified about the discovery of the latest bodies Monday afternoon. Authorities told them that DNA testing to determine identities will be done ""as soon as possible,"" she said. ""We're just hoping and praying that it's not her,"" she added. The initial four bodies were discovered stuffed into bushes on a quarter-mile stretch of waterfront property on Oak Beach, indicating ""they were dumped there by the same person or persons,"" Dormer said in December. ""It's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location."" The remains of the fifth body were found about a mile from where the other corpses were discovered, he said, refusing to disclose exactly where the three additional remains were found on Monday. Of the first remains found, all four women had advertised for prostitution services on the Craigslist website, with one body having been there for as long as two years, police said. The highway is closed Monday night with officers on guard from the Causeway to Nassau County Line so the search can resume Tuesday, Dormer said. ""The investigation is going to move forward over the next hours, and into tomorrow,"" days and weeks ahead, Dormer said.","Total of 8 bodies found during monthslong search for New Jersey woman .

"(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal overcame an injury scare to win a four-set classic over Juan Martin Del Potro and claim a place in the last eight at Wimbledon. With the light fading on Centre Court and Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge watching on, Nadal eventually beat his Argentine opponent 7-6 3-6 7-6 6-4 in just under four hours to book a quarterfinal berth. Nadal called for the doctor at the end of the first set after suffering an injury to his left foot that impeded his movement but he battled through the pain to take the opener on a tie-break. However, as Nadal moved gingerly around the court in the second set, Del Potro took full advantage to level the match thanks to some booming ground strokes. Injury casts doubt on Nadal's Wimbledon defense . In the third set Del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion, fell awkwardly when trying to change direction on the baseline and he left the court to be seen by the doctor. The 22-year-old returned and ensured the third set went into a tie-break but made a series of unforced errors to hand his Spanish opponent the upper hand before Nadal powered to victory in the fourth. After the match Nadal told reporters: ""I don't know what the problem is, it seems to be a problem with the bone in the foot. ""I thought I would have to retire at the end of the first set because there was a lot of pain. But the tape changed the situation. Now I will have to check with the doctors and the physios. Something is there."" Nadal will play 10th seed Mardy Fish in the last eight after the American battled past sixth seed and last year's runner-up Tomas Berdych 7-6 6-4 6-4. World number two Novak Djokovic eased into the quarterfinals with a straight sets win over Michael Llodra. The Serbian, seeded second, powered to a 6-3 6-3 6-3 victory over the 19th seed in just an hour and 40 minutes on Court No. 1. He will now face qualifier Bernard Tomic after the 18-year-old Australian continued his dream run at the tournament by defeating Belgium's Xavier Malisse 6-1 7-5 6-4. Tomic, who was born in Germany, is the youngest Wimbledon quarterfinalist since former champion Boris Becker in 1986. Britain's number four seed Andy Murray enjoyed a comfortable passage into the last eight with a 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 6-2 victory over France's Richard Gasquet. He had been surprised to see William and Kate in the Royal Box on Centre Court and joked to reporters afterwards he would have liked advance warning. He said: ""If I'd known they were coming, I would have shaved. I was thinking to myself as I came off I was sweaty and very hairy. I said to them, 'I'm sorry, I'm a bit sweaty.' ""No-one else had heard anything. I saw them when I went out. It's obviously great to get the chance to play in front of them and it was very nice to get to meet them."" Murray will now play Spain's Feliciano Lopez after he beat another unseeded player, Lukasz Kubot from Poland, 3-6 6-7 7-6 7-6 7-5. Six-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer dropped the first set against Russian 18th seed Mikhail Youzhny but recovered to triumph 6-7 6-3 6-3 6-3.

"(CNN) -- A federal grand jury indicted four more people on charges involving the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, that left more than 160 people dead. The case is linked to David Headley, who pleaded guilty last year to all 12 charges against him in connection with the four-day siege on India's financial capital and a plot to attack a Danish newspaper. Headley was not charged in the new indictment, but his role is spelled out in detail throughout the charges that describe an extended plot involving years of surveillance, setting up a front organization to hide activities, getting money to pay for planning, and communications between some of the suspects and the Mumbai attackers as the siege took place. The new indictment included charges of aiding and abetting the murder of U.S. citizens in India and conspiracy to bomb public places in India. Both carry a maximum penalty of life in prison or death. In addition, some or all of the suspects in the new indictment were charged with conspiracy to murder and maim in India, conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism in India, conspiracy to murder and maim in Denmark and others that carry a maximum penalty of life in prison. Named in the new indictment were Ilyas Kahmiri, Tahawwur Hussain Rana, Abdur Rehman Hashim Syed, Sajid Mir, Abu Qahafa, Mazhar Iqbal and an unidentified man referred to by the alias of Major Iqbal. Rana, a Canadian citizen and Chicago resident, is the only suspect in U.S. custody. Rana, Kahmiri and Syed were named in previous indictments that charged Headley, who also lived in Chicago. The other suspects were all believed to live in Pakistan. Kahmiri is a leader of the Pakistani terrorist group Harakat ul Jihad al Islami, or the Islamic Struggle Movement, and has close contact with a known al Qaeda leader, according to the indictment. The four new suspects named in Monday's indictment were Mir, Qahafa, Iqbal and the unidentified man referred to by his alias. Headley, the son of an American mother and Pakistani father, was accused of extensive involvement in planning the devastating attacks on hotels in Mumbai, which the Indian government says were carried out by the Pakistan-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. At least six Americans were among the dead. Headley initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, then changed his plea as part of a deal with the government to cooperate with investigators in exchange for a maximum possible sentence of life in prison. By pleading guilty, he also gave up his right to appeal. Headley's actual sentence will depend on how much he cooperates with authorities. The new indictment Monday charged that Headley, working in connection with the other suspects, scouted targets in Mumbai for more than two years to set up the November 2008 attacks. It included details of what happened that day, saying that ""during the course of attacks in Mumbai, the attackers were in telephonic contact with defendants Sajid Mir, Abu Qahafa and Mazhar Iqbal, all of whom were then located in Pakistan."" ""More specifically, during the course of the attacks, the attackers were advised to, among other actions, kill hostages, set fires and throw grenades,"" the indictment said. ""Sajid Mir also sought to arrange the release of a hostage in exchange for the release of a captured attacker."" It also accused Mir of working with Headley to plan a terrorist attack on a Danish newspaper, which was never carried out. The newspaper became the target of Muslim fury in 2005 after it published cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed in a manner offensive to Muslims.","The indictment charges seven men who worked with David Headley .

"(CNN) -- Before the tabloid headlines, before the media crush, before Casey Anthony and her daughter Caylee became instantly recognizable, there were only two phone calls. ""I have a possible missing child,"" Cindy Anthony said in the first of two 911 calls made July 15, 2008. The little girl -- her granddaughter, Caylee -- ""has been missing for a month,"" she said. In another call, she added an ominous statement: ""There's something wrong,"" she said. ""I found my daughter's car today and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car."" Caylee was 2 when she was last seen June 16, 2008. It wasn't until six months later the little girl's skeletal remains were found in woods about a quarter of a mile from the home of her grandparents. The girl's mother and Cindy Anthony's daughter, Casey Anthony, had also lived there, moving out around the time the child was last seen. On Tuesday, Casey Anthony, now 25, will stand trial, accused of a crime unthinkable to many: Killing her daughter. Besides capital murder, she faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and providing false information to authorities. If she is convicted by jurors -- seven women, five men and five alternates -- she could face the death penalty. Anthony has pleaded not guilty, and denies harming her daughter or having anything to do with her disappearance. One of her defense attorneys, Jose Baez, has said that once all the facts are known, it will become clear his client is innocent. The case has generated intense media attention, prompting the court to move jury selection to Clearwater, Florida, in Pinellas County, because of concern about getting an impartial jury in Orlando, in Orange County. Jurors were being transported Monday to Orlando in preparation for opening statements Tuesday. Both the prosecution and the defense face hurdles, said ""In Session"" correspondent Jean Casarez, who has followed the case from the beginning. The cause of Caylee's death was homicide by undetermined means, meaning there is no cause of death, she said. ""One of the elements in the statute for murder is that the defendant caused the death,"" Casarez said. ""This is a circumstantial case, so prosecutors will build their building blocks toward that answer, but they don't have a definitive cause of death, and that can be a problem. I have seen cases where there are acquittals because the prosecution does not have a cause of death."" The fact that the remains were skeletal also prevented authorities from getting definitive answers on toxicology, as well as evidence that Caylee was abused -- something her mother is charged with doing. ""How do you prove that when you just have skeletal remains?"" Casarez said. Duct tape was still stuck to the lower facial region of the child's body, authorities have said. ""(Caylee's) killer prepared some substance in advance that would render her physically unable to resist,"" prosecutor Jeff Ashton said at a December 2009 hearing, ""administered the substance, awaited its effect and then methodically applied three pieces of duct tape to completely cut off the flow of air through her mouth or her nose and let nature take its course."" Authorities have said that the amount of decomposition would seem to indicate Caylee died shortly after she went missing. Anthony initially told police that she had last seen her daughter in the custody of a babysitter named Zenaida Gonzalez. Investigators never tracked down the babysitter; later, a woman named Zenaida Gonzalez filed a defamation suit against Anthony, saying she had never met her and lost her job over the claims. Anthony countersued, accusing Gonzalez of attempting to cash in on the high-profile case. Prosecutors allege that after killing her daughter, Anthony stashed her body in the trunk of her Pontiac Sunfire before disposing of it. A cadaver dog has alerted to the scent of human decomposition in the trunk, and testing showed the presence of chloroform. Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. ruled last month jurors can hear the chloroform testimony. In addition, investigators have said they found Internet searches of websites mentioning chloroform on Anthony's computer. Anthony's high-powered defense team, fighting to save her life, will likely try to cast doubt on prosecutors' scientific evidence. At pretrial hearings, they have argued that evidence regarding a potential odor of decomposition in the trunk, chloroform and other evidence is not reliable enough for jurors to consider. Perry has also ruled jurors can hear testimony about a stain in the trunk, as well as the decompositional odor. In March, Baez contended that having jurors look at the stain might have a ""prejudicial effect,"" alleging it could have been caused by a wet bag of garbage or gasoline cans. The stain was negative for DNA, as well as for the presence of blood or other bodily fluids, he said. ""There is absolutely no proof whatsoever that this is a biological stain,"" Baez said. Perhaps the biggest hurdle for the defense is the fact that Caylee had been missing for 31 days before authorities were aware of it, and her mother failed to report it, Casarez said. In addition, some have alleged that Anthony didn't behave like the worried mother of a missing child during the search for Caylee. She went to nightclubs and sent hundreds of text messages to friends, according to cell phone and text transcripts and investigative reports released by police. Those records show she rarely mentioned her missing daughter. ""She doesn't report her child missing but she actively parties,"" Casarez said. Perry has allowed pictures of Anthony taken at nightclubs, both before and after Caylee went missing, to be presented at trial. Why before? ""Probably (for prosecutors) to show that this was her lifestyle before and after her child was missing, and it's not a reaction to not knowing how to deal with Caylee suddenly out of her life,"" said Casarez. Another potential defense hurdle: During the time Caylee was missing, Anthony also got a tattoo on her shoulder reading ""Bella Vita"" -- Italian for ""beautiful life,"" Casarez said. The car also poses a huge obstacle for the defense, with evidence of chloroform found inside along with hair that potentially showed signs of decomposition, she said. The defense has also objected to the jurors chosen. Baez told Perry as the jurors were seated Friday that ""we do not accept the panel as seated."" The defense wanted more than the 10 peremptory challenges it was allowed. The challenges let attorneys on both sides reject jurors without having to provide a reason. Perry overruled his objections. Early in the jury selection process, defense attorneys hinted that mitigating circumstances including ""a history of sexual abuse"" may have explained Anthony's behavior in the days after her daughter disappeared and her failure to alert authorities sooner. Anthony herself told police she had been trying to find her daughter on her own. Defense attorney Ann Finnell raised a host of potential mitigating circumstances to gauge what would-be jurors might consider if they had to decide whether to sentence Anthony to death. Those circumstances included a ""lack of maturity,"" ""lack of impulse control"" and ""a history of sexual abuse."" Anthony alleged her father and brother sexually abused her in a letter from jail last year. In an interview with NBC News afterward, her father, George Anthony, denied the claims and criticized Baez's judgment in questioning him about the allegations. Finnell asked potential members of the jury pool whether the assertion her client came from a ""dysfunctional family"" might factor into their penalty decision.

"(CNN) -- The European Commission found leading computer chipmaker Intel guilty Wednesday of violating European anti-trust rules and ordered that it pay a fine of 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion). Intel was allowed to present a defense to the European Commission ahead of Tuesday's ruling . It is the largest fine the commission has ever imposed, said Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner for competition. Intel has said it plans to appeal the decision. The commission found Intel abused its dominant market position in the market for computer chips known as the x86 computer processing unit (CPU), Kroes said. The abuse lasted more than five years, she said. ""Those x86 chips are the engine of the car, so to say,"" Kroes said at a news conference in Brussels, Belgium. ""Your computer won't work without these chips."" Intel held a 70 percent share of the market during the period of the violations, she said. ""That Intel had such a large market share is not a problem in itself,"" Kroes said. ""What is a problem is that Intel abused its dominant position. Specifically, Intel used illegal anti-competitive practices to exclude essentially its only competitor, and that reduced consumer choice -- and the whole story is about consumers."" Intel's actions frustrated innovation and reduced consumer welfare, Kroes said. The commission found that Intel awarded major computer manufacturers rebates on the condition that they purchase all or most of their supplies from Intel. Intel also paid Europe's biggest computer retailer, Media Markt, to sell Intel-based PCs exclusively, the commission found. Media Markt has some 200 megastores in nine countries. The commission also found that Intel awarded payments to computer manufacturers so they would postpone or cancel the launch of products containing parts from its leading competitor, AMD. ""The commission found that these payments had the potential effect of preventing products for which there was a consumer demand from coming to the market,"" the commission said in a statement. ""Given that Intel has harmed millions and millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for more than five years, the size of the fine should come as no surprise,"" Kroes said. Intel was allowed to present a defense to the commission's preliminary conclusions. But Kroes said the company ""went to great lengths"" to cover up its anti-competitive practices, resulting in a long and complex investigation. In a statement on the company Web site, Paul Otellini, Intel's president and CEO said the company took strong exception to the ruling and planned to appeal. ""We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace -- characterized by constant innovation, improved product performance and lower prices,"" Otellini said. ""There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers. He added that the compnay did not believe its practices violated European law and accused the Directorate General for Competition of the Commission of ignoring or refusing to ""obtain significant evidence that contradicts the assertions in this decision."" Otellini added that the company had never sold products below cost but had invested in innovation, manufacturing and developing leadership technology with the result that it could ""discount our products to compete in a highly competitive marketplace."" ""Despite our strongly held views,"" Otellini concluded, ""as we go through the appeals process we plan to work with the Commission to ensure we're in compliance with their decision.""","European Commission launched anti-trust investigation nearly two years ago .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The commander of a British regiment has become the country's highest-ranking soldier to be killed in action since 1982's Falklands War after he was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Lt. Col. Rupert Thorneloe was killed when a roadside bomb denotated in Helmand province. Lt. Col. Rupert Thorneloe, 40, was killed along with trooper Joshua Hammond, 18, Wednesday as they were traveling along a canal in Lashkar Gah, in Afghanistan's southern Helmand Province, the British Ministry of Defense said. Thorneloe, a commanding officer who oversaw more than 1,000 men, had left the battle group headquarters on the resupply convoy so he could visit his men, because they were conducting a major operation in hostile territory, the ministry said. He and Hammond, a tank driver, were killed despite traveling in an armored vehicle, the ministry said. Britain's Prince Charles knew Thorneloe and said he was ""completely mortified"" to learn of his death. Charles is the regimental colonel of the Welsh Guards, where Thorneloe served. ""It's a wonderful family, the regiment, so everybody knows everybody,"" he said. ""And being involved for 34 years I start to see the sons and the grandsons of people I first met 34 years ago coming into the regiment, so you can imagine the shock and horror."" Watch Prince Charles speak . Defense Secretary Bob Ainsworth called Thorneloe's death a ""hard blow"" to the army and the military's operations in Afghanistan. ""I knew him myself, as a man of incisive thought, enormous professionalism and the greatest decency, who could not wait to leave the high-profile post in the Ministry of Defense where he had performed so impressively in order to take command of his battalion on operations,"" Ainsworth said in a statement. ""He saw it as the best job he would ever do, but I know that his genuinely exceptional abilities would have ensured him a brilliant career,"" Ainsworth added. ""He led his men with energy, care, and pride -- and he died leading his men."" Thorneloe spent two years at the Ministry of Defense, during which he was the military assistant to the secretary, before he assumed command of the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards last October, the ministry said. He leaves behind a wife and two young daughters. Hammond enlisted in the army when he was 16 and deployed to Afghanistan a month ago, said Lt. Col. Marcus Simson, his commanding officer. He was a week away from his 19th birthday, Simson said. ""He had a glint in his eye and a wry smile which always made one feel that you were in on the joke,"" said Major Charlie Burbridge, his squadron commander. ""He was professional and capable and was only just getting into his stride as a soldier. Only days before his tragic death he had said how much he was enjoying the job. ""My words will do little to console his mother or fiance whom he planned to marry on his return from Afghanistan, but our prayers are for them. 'Hammy' was a Tankie, through and through; I am proud to have served alongside him and we will never forget him.""","British commander country's highest ranking soldier to be killed in action since 1982 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lenny Dykstra, a three-time major league All-Star outfielder who played for the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies, was charged Monday with multiple counts of allegedly leasing cars using phony businesses and credit information, and with drug possession, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office announced. At a court hearing Monday, Dykstra was taken into custody and jailed, with bail set at $500,000. According to the complaint, Dykstra, 48, and two co-defendants -- Robert Hymers, 27, his accountant and friend; and Christopher Gavanis, 30, a friend -- are accused of trying to lease various luxury vehicles from several dealerships by providing fraudulent information and claiming credit through a phony business called Home Free Systems. None of the defendants could be reached for comment Monday, and it could not be determined whether they had retained attorneys. Dykstra's attorney in a pending federal case told CNN he no longer represents Dykstra, and representatives at the public defenders' office told CNN none of the three defendants had retailed public defenders. At two dealerships, Dykstra and Hymers allegedly provided information from a man they claimed was a co-signer but who had not authorized his name to be used, the complaint alleges. Leases were not approved at two dealerships and all three men allegedly drove off with three cars at one company without lease approval, said Deputy District Attorney Alex Karkanen, with the office's Auto Insurance Fraud Division. When Dykstra was first arrested in April, Los Angeles police detectives investigating the case executed a search warrant at his Encino home and allegedly found cocaine and Ecstasy along with Somatropin, a synthetic human growth hormone. Dykstra was charged Monday with five counts of attempted grand theft auto, eight counts of filing false financial statements, four counts of identity theft, three counts of grand theft auto and three counts of possession of a controlled substance. All are felonies. In addition, he is charged with one misdemeanor count each of possession of a controlled substance without a prescription and unauthorized possession of a syringe. If convicted, Dykstra could face up to 12 years in state prison. In a separate case, Dykstra was indicted in May on federal bankruptcy fraud charges including obstruction of justice, for allegedly taking  more than $400,000 in property that should have gone to his creditors, then lying about it under oath, prosecutors claim. In the federal indictment, Dykstra is accused of stealing, hiding and destroying items such as chandeliers, artwork, and sports memorabilia from his repossessed $18 million Ventura County mansion. His attorney, Mark Worksman has characterized the federal case as ""a scorched-earth bankruptcy proceeding"" and blamed the auto-related accusations as a ""vendetta"" by former caretakers. Dykstra had remained free on $150,000 bond in the federal case.","NEW: Lenny Dykstra is jailed with bail set at $500,000 .

"New York (CNN) -- The parents of a murder victim are suing Facebook after a paramedic pleaded guilty to photographing their daughter's corpse and posting the image to the social networking site, according to court documents. Caroline Wimmer, 26, was found by her parents, Ronald and Martha, after she was strangled with a hair-dryer cord in March 2009 in Staten Island, New York. Paramedic Mark Musarella -- who responded to their corresponding emergency call -- later pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after posting to Facebook the photographs he took, the documents said. ""All I want is my daughter's picture back,"" Martha Wimmer told CNN. ""I want it destroyed,"" noting that the image is no longer posted on the site. The couple is suing Facebook in an effort to force the company to turn over the image, identify who may have downloaded the photograph and prevent the image from being further disseminated, according to the couple's attorney Ravi Batra. They ""would like to move on,"" Batra said, adding that ""it's very tough to heal when you know there are sick people out in the world look at their dead daughter's image."" But the social networking site could be protected by the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which says ""no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said, ""The case is without merit."" ""We will fight it vigorously,"" he added. The parents are also suing their daughter's convicted murderer, Calvin Lawson, paramedic Musarella, the city of New York and Greenleaf Arms Incorporated -- the company that owns the apartment building where Wimmer's body was found. The pair are also suing Fire Commissioner Salvatore J. Cassano and Richmond University Medical Center, where Musarella had been employed. ""This lawsuit assumes traditional defendants as well as nontraditional defendants, including the City of New York and Facebook, that are unique to this case arising out of cybercrime,"" Batra said. Connie Pankratz, a spokeswoman for the city's law department, called the situation ""tragic."" ""We extend our sympathy to the family,"" she said. Pankratz said the city has ""not yet received the legal papers, but will review them thoroughly upon receipt."" Meanwhile, Musarella has forfeited his EMT certification and was ordered to 200 hours of community service. The image was discovered by an acquaintance of Musarella, who alerted Richmond University Medical Center, according to Batra. Wimmer's murderer, Lawson, is serving 25 years-to-life. Martha Wimmer said Tuesday that she is traveling to the state capitol in support of pending legislation that would enact harsher penalties for a public worker who broadcasts or publishes an image of a crime scene outside their official duties. The law would raise the offense to a Class E felony.","Parents sue Facebook in an effort to compel the company to turn over the image .

"Paris (CNN) -- A French politician said Monday that International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is facing sexual assault charges in New York, attacked her daughter in 2002. Anne Mansouret, a member of parliament for the Socialist Party, said she cautioned her daughter, Tristane Banon, not to file a police report at the time, saying it might adversely impact her career. At the time, Banon was an aspiring journalist. Strauss-Kahn was never charged. However, in light of the charges against Strauss-Kahn after an alleged incident at a Sofitel hotel in New York on Saturday, Banon's attorney in France, David Koubbi, said he and the young woman are considering whether to file a complaint. Strauss-Kahn's attorney in France, Leon Lef Forster, did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment on the allegations. One of his New York attorneys, Benjamin Brafman, said Sunday his client is innocent of the alleged assault in New York, and he pledged to vigorously defend him in court on those charges. Who is Strauss-Kahn? Mansouret told CNN her daughter had asked to interview Strauss-Kahn, and met him in his office in the National Assembly. The initial interview went well, she said. However, Strauss-Kahn sent Banon a text message later, saying he was not happy with the interview and asking if he could speak with her again. He sent her an address, she said. Banon went to the address, where Strauss-Kahn then locked the door to the room they were in, took her hand and grabbed her arm, according to Mansouret. Banon told him to let her go, and the incident ended with the two struggling on the floor, Mansouret said. Banon managed to escape the apartment and locked herself in her car outside, calling her mother. Mansouret said she arrived about an hour and a half later to find her daughter still locked in the car and looking ""roughed up."" The heel of one shoe was broken, Mansouret recalled to CNN. But Mansouret told her daughter not to file a complaint out of concern she would become known as Strauss-Kahn's victim. Banon is now 31 and a journalist. Her mother said it is up to her whether to take any legal action against Strauss-Kahn. CNN does not typically name assault victims, but Mansouret said her daughter gave permission for her name to be disclosed. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","Anna Mansouret says she told her daughter not to file a police report .

"(CNN)  -- Natasha Richardson, who died Wednesday following a ski accident Monday, comes from an illustrious British acting family -- one whose name she's often found a challenge. Natasha Richardson comes from a family of well-known British actors, including mother Vanessa Redgrave. Richardson, the daughter of Oscar-winning actress Vanessa Redgrave and the late director Tony Richardson (""Look Back in Anger,"" ""Tom Jones""), has said, more than once, that she found it difficult to live up to the family reputation. ""The names Richardson or Redgrave didn't help,"" she told About.com's Rebecca Murray in 2007. ""But the last thing you want is to ride any coattails, because you don't want people to be accusing you of nepotism. You want to be able to learn and practice, and not to be thrown into a spotlight before you're ready for it."" But Richardson, 45, was practically born to the stage. Besides her mother and father, several members of her family are performers: Her grandparents were Sir Michael Redgrave, a famed British actor, and actress Rachel Kempson; uncle Corin Redgrave, aunt Lynn Redgrave and sister Joely Richardson also are noted actors. She's even married to an actor, having been wed to Liam Neeson (""Schindler's List"") since 1994. She first appeared in a movie when she was 4, earning a bit part in her father's ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1968). By that point, her parents had divorced, and she was living with her mother, who already had dazzled movie audiences with her work in ""Morgan!"" (1966), ""Blowup"" (1966) and ""Camelot"" (1967). Despite her mother's success, Richardson said that the family was sometimes in financial straits because the politically controversial Redgrave gave away money to various causes, according to the BBC.  Watch Richardson talk about acting along side mom » . Though Richardson appeared in regional theater and a CBS television miniseries by the time she was 22, she first gained renown for her performance in Anton Chekhov's ""The Seagull"" in a 1985 production that featured her mother and Jonathan Pryce. The performance earned her the London Drama Critics' most promising newcomer award. She's earned her strongest notices for her stage work. She won a Tony for her performance as Sally Bowles in the 1998 revival of ""Cabaret"" and earned raves for her Blanche DuBois in a 2005 production of ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" Other productions include a 1993 production of Eugene O'Neill's ""Anna Christie"" and the original 1999 production of Patrick Marber's ""Closer,"" later made into a film with Julia Roberts. Critics have turned into fans. ""Her Sally Bowles is a dazzling example of how star power can be harnessed to create a devastating portrait of someone who is definitely not a star,"" wrote The New York Times' Ben Brantley on ""Cabaret."" ""Born-to-lose characters can be tedious, but Richardson turns this one into an electrifying triumph."" On screen, Richardson deliberately has picked a wide range of roles, many in independent films. She makes no apologies: ""I am attracted to the darker places than I am to the lighter, frothier stuff and I'm not sure why that is,"" she told the Web site Filmfreakcentral.com in 2006. ""I do think that it's certainly more challenging to play the dark places. But it's the part, primarily, and on the whole I'd rather play a wonderful part in a movie that few people see rather than a sort of cosmetic role in a blockbuster. Not that I've been offered many of those."" There have been a handful of major Hollywood productions, however, most notably the 1998 version of ""The Parent Trap"" and the Jennifer Lopez vehicle ""Maid in Manhattan"" (2002), which she took as ""a laugh,"" she told Filmfreakcentral.com. ""You'll have to blame Ralph [Fiennes] for that one. He's the most wonderful actor, a good friend; we thought we'd have a laugh."" Richardson met Neeson during the 1993 Broadway run of ""Anna Christie"" and later made the film ""Nell"" with him. When the two met, Richardson was married to producer Robert Fox, but that marriage ended. She later married Neeson. The two have generally stayed out of the tabloid press, but they won a 1998 libel suit against the London tabloid The Mirror over a story that claimed their marriage was a sham. The newspaper apologized, and Neeson and Richardson were awarded $85,000, which they donated to victims of a Northern Ireland car bombing. Richardson has come to terms with her famous name -- and, having worked with her mother more than once, greatly appreciates her abilities. ""What's always different about my mother is that there's always something unexpected about her work, because she's sort of fearless,"" Richardson told About.com's Murray. ""When she hits it, then it sort of is just incandescent."" She added that ""her children have entirely forgiven her"" for the difficulties when they were younger, ""because she is a great mother."" Richardson and Neeson have two children: Michael, 13, and Daniel, 12.","Actress Natasha Richardson granddaughter, daughter of Britain's famed Redgraves .

"Dallas (CNN) -- A federal judge has blocked key parts of a Texas law that would require doctors to provide a sonogram to pregnant women before they get an abortion, days before the law was set to take effect. U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks, in Austin, Texas, found that several portions of the law are ""unconstitutionally vague,"" and that it violates the First Amendment by compelling doctors and patients to engage in government-mandated speech. As written, the law would require women seeking an abortion in Texas to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure. It was to take effect on September 1. The preliminary injunction, issued Tuesday, blocks the state from enforcing any penalties against a doctor who does not place sonogram pictures where a pregnant woman may see them, or does not make the heartbeat audible. It also blocks penalties against the woman. ""Today's ruling is a huge victory for women in Texas and a clear signal to the state legislature that it went too far when it passed this law,"" said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. ""Politicians have no business telling doctors how to practice medicine or meddling in women's private medical decisions."" The Center filed the lawsuit, which was granted class-actions status. Texas Gov. and Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry said the state would appeal the decision. ""Every life lost to abortion is a tragedy and (the) ruling is a great disappointment to all Texans who stand in defense of life,"" he said in a statement. ""This important sonogram legislation ensures that every Texas woman seeking an abortion has all the facts about the life she is carrying, and understands the devastating impact of such a life-changing decision."" The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, ""in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,"" the law states. In his order, Sparks agreed with the abortion providers that many clauses in the law were too vague. He wrote, ""The court is inclined to agree with (the) defendants' characterization that (the) ""plaintiffs have chosen to throw everything at the wall and hope something sticks."" The court also found that the sonogram law goes beyond existing informed consent laws regarding abortion and constituted a violation of the First Amendment. The law ""compels physicians to advance an ideological agenda with which they may not agree, regardless of any medical necessity, and irrespective of whether the pregnant women wish to listen,"" Sparks wrote.","A judge ruled that doctors cannot be penalized for not showing images to women .
The law was to go into effect September 1 .
The judge found some of the language unconstitutionally vague .
He also said that it violated the First Amendment ."
"(CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot's lawyer has quit defending him against murder allegations in Peru, citing unspecified differences over strategy. Van der Sloot, the onetime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, faces a possible trial on first-degree murder and robbery charges in the killing of 21-year-old Stephany Flores. His lawyer, Maximo Altez, filed papers to withdraw from the case Tuesday. ""I cannot defend this case in the way he wants me to,"" Altez told In Session. He would not elaborate. Flores was found dead in a Lima hotel room registered to van der Sloot in May 2010. Police say van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. Peruvian authorities have yet to file formal charges against van der Sloot, who is expected to appear in court for a preliminary hearing on June 8. Once the discovery phase of the case ends, prosecutors will file charges and a trial date will be set. Altez has been defending van der Sloot on a pro bono basis and said he expects a public defender will be assigned to the case. He said the lack of payment did not play a role in his decision to quit. ""I thought this case would be a good opportunity to show the world that in Peru detainees are abused, and the Peruvian justice system is very informal,"" he said. And he said he will continue to represent van der Sloot in a related habeas corpus case claiming human rights violations during his arrest -- a case that would be thrown out if Altez withdrew from that case too. Altez threatened to quit the case once before after complaining of receiving threats by phone, e-mail and Facebook. The 23-year-old van der Sloot was once the prime suspect in the disappearance of Holloway, who vanished at age 18 while on a graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba. He was arrested twice but never charged in connection with her disappearance. Shortly after his 2010 arrest, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges that he tried to extort $250,000 from the Holloway family. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Natalee Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the charges.","Onetime suspect in Natalee Holloway case faces a possible murder charge in Peru .

"(Parenting.com) -- A new report from the AAP clues parents into what their kids are really doing online. Good news: It's not all bad! Facebook, Twitter, Shelfari, Moshi Monsters, Club Penguin, The SIMS -- the list of online games and social networking sites seems to grow longer every day. Also on the upswing: the alarming headlines about cyberbullying, sexting, and other forms of online harassment. This ever-increasing presence of social media in kids' lives, often starting in the prepubescent years, has prompted the American Academy of Pediatrics to issue a clinical report to increase parental awareness of the sites their kids are visiting and how they work. Parenting.com: How texting changes the way kids communicate . ""The digital world is an evolving landscape that parents have to learn to navigate,"" says Kathleen Clarke-Pearson, M.D., an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill and coauthor of the report. Tweens in 2011 socialize more and more online, rather than at a friend's house or the mall, and even though Facebook and other sites have age limits -- technically no one under 13 is supposed to have a ""page"" -- 30% of parents admitted on Parenting.com that they allow their tweens to log on anyway. Parenting.com: 10 violent video games to avoid . And this trend is likely to continue: According to the AAP, more than half of adolescents visit a social media site more than once a day, and 75% have cell phones, which are often used for texting and instant messaging. Because of the intensity of the online world, teens who spend a great deal of time there may be at risk for a new phenomenon called ""Facebook depression."" Teen development is, in large part, about separating from parents and gaining peer acceptance, and social networking sites allow them to do both. But if online harassment or rejection occurs, such as ""de-friending,"" symptoms of depression may be the result. Contact your pediatrician if you notice any of the following: sadness, anxiety, pessimism, difficulty concentrating, a drop in grades, insomnia, loss of appetite and irritability. Parenting.com: 7 ways to fix rude 'tween behavior . While the news media tends to focus on the negatives of this new technology, social networking also has many advantages for kids. In addition to strengthening connections with friends and family, social networking encourages participation in community service activities, collaboration with classmates on group projects, the sharing of musical and artistic achievements, and communication with sports coaches and teammates, and that's just for starters. ""In addition, the online world is beneficial for those kids who don't quite 'fit in' at school -- it can help foster their identity and unique social skills,"" explains Clarke-Pearson. So how does it go wrong? ""Teens are susceptible to peer pressure and are also naturally impulsive, so they may quickly comment on an inappropriate post without thinking. This can easily snowball and become very hurtful to the person who's targeted,"" says Clarke-Pearson. Some families have also become so overly digitized that time together at home and during meals is being displaced. Direct interaction with peers is disappearing as well. Parenting.com: 25 awesome iPhone apps for kids . ""When texting becomes the main mode of communication, it doesn't allow for tone, body language or facial cues,"" says Clarke-Pearson. But the right parental interaction and involvement can ensure that won't happen. Here's how to help your child use social media and game sites to her advantage: . Get schooled: Immerse yourself in the technology so you know how to create a profile, ""friend"" your child, and be a part of her online life. She may insist that you don't embarrass her by posting on her wall for her friends to see, for instance, but that's okay. You still get a window into her world. 13 Tips for monitoring kids' social media . Model it: If you're constantly on the cell or computer, your kid will want to be, too. Limit your time so you can help your child strike a balance with her own use. Power down: Insist that family meals are device-free and set reasonable bedtimes. ""Children and adolescents don't get enough sleep as it is, so staying up half the night on line certainly doesn't help,"" says Clarke-Pearson. Chat her up: Don't rely exclusively on a ""net nanny"" program to keep you up-to-date on her activity. Instead, ask who she's texting or IM'ing lately and share some of your own social media experiences (she just may open up about hers). Parenting.com: Keeping your child safe on the internet . Go public: Keep the computer centrally located (like in the family room or kitchen) so you can check on the sites she visits and the amount of time spent there. Be kind: Discourage meanness, gossiping, and posting anything that's untrue or potentially harmful or embarrassing. Remind your child that there's no real privacy online -- every email, text or IM leaves a digital footprint, which future employers and colleges might access.

"(Budget Travel) -- Game drives and the Big Five -- pulling off a classic African safari is easier (and cheaper) than you might think. Africa's a big place. How do I decide where exactly to go? To the uninitiated, planning a safari can seem daunting, but it doesn't have to be. Wildlife excursions are largely confined to eastern and southern Africa, where the Big Five (lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants, and Cape buffalos) converge. Within those regions, there are some basic rules that help distinguish the kind of experience each country offers. On the approachable end of the spectrum, Kenya and South Africa are among the easiest-to-navigate nations in Africa. Both have well-developed tourism infrastructures with accessible parks, plush lodges, and plenty of flights and outfitted trips, so safaris there tend to be simple to arrange and comparatively cheap. On the more adventurous side, Tanzania and Uganda in the east and Botswana and Zimbabwe in the south offer more rugged, unique experiences and fewer crowds, although generally at a higher price. Once you decide which type of adventure you'd prefer, it seriously helps to zero in on specific trips by tapping a safari-savvy travel agent. Travelhub.com has a robust database that lists hundreds of travel agencies, and it allows you to search specifically for safari specialists. 26 Stunning Ireland Photos . How much can I expect to pay? Regardless of how you do it, safaris don't come cheap. A weeklong trip is typically at least $4,000: Guided safaris start at roughly $250 per person per day -- and that's before you've paid for airfare to Africa. International flights aren't usually included in safari packages and typically cost $2,000 or so. That said, there are some strategies that help keep prices relatively low. Booking your initial flight through an Africa-focused ticket consolidator, such as Premier Tours or Magical Holidays (800/228-2208) can save you up to 30 percent. Also, if you don't mind a little rain, you can cut the cost of lodging in half by traveling during the wet season, from November to March. The Mara Serena Safari Lodge in Kenya's Maasai Mara reserve, for instance, charges $260 for a double room in early December and $600 for that same room during the peak July--October period. Also, storms are brief and usually limited to the afternoon. ""Personally, I think you're missing out if you never see a rain shower in Africa -- they're spectacular,"" says Bill Given, a biologist and researcher at the Denver Zoo who also guides custom safaris for his company, The Wild Source. ""The worst that happens is you get a little wet and wind up spending a few hours indoors watching a powerful display of Mother Nature."" 17 Breathtaking Sunset Photos . Finally, make sure to read the fine print. Much like an ocean cruise, a safari with a higher price tag may end up being cheaper than one that costs less up front but requires paying extra for one-off experiences as you go. Upgrades such as traveling in a private group, visiting private game reserves, and hopping around on charter planes will quickly ratchet up costs, sometimes to the tune of $1,000 a day. And those splurges don't always pay off: ""You don't necessarily get better wildlife experiences by spending lots of money,"" Given says. ""At some point, the steep rates are because the lodge has a spa and you're eating gourmet, six-course meals."" 15 Places Every Kid Should See Before 15 . How do I find a good outfitter? Bottom line: It's all about your guide. ""That person will absolutely make or break your trip,"" says Peter Allison, who chronicled his own adventures in ""Whatever You Do, Don't Run: True Tales of a Botswana Safari Guide."" ""A good guide will not only point out where the lions are, but will also teach you how to listen to calls, follow tracks, and spot that lion tail in a field of tall grass."" Allison recommends looking for outfitters that specifically tout the expertise of their trip leaders. Fodor's The Complete African Safari Planner, which lists descriptions of 24 reliable agencies, is a good place to start. When you speak to the company representatives, don't hesitate to ask about the strength of individual guides, and be sure to request references. Finally, because animals move based on migratory and weather patterns, a good safari operator will adjust itineraries throughout the year to maximize wildlife sightings. Consider it a red flag if a company offers the exact same trips year-round. 10 Most Beautiful Waterfalls . Any other general tips? Focus on the experience, not your photo album. If your head is behind a lens the whole time, you may not be able to take in the bigger picture. Also, don't have unrealistic expectations about the number of animals you'll see. ""Some novices expect every plain to be carpeted with cheetahs chasing gazelles,"" Allison says. You're not on a Discovery Channel show; it's a vacation. So keep an open mind and remember that every animal has its charms, from warthogs (""possibly the only animal that looks better from the back than the front,"" Allison says) to zebras (""no less fantastic-looking than unicorns""). FIELD ETIQUETTE 101: The Do's and Don'ts of Life in the Bush . Do blend in. Now is not the time for tie-dye. Stick to muted brown, khaki, and light green clothes when spotting wildlife. That said... Don't wear camo. In Africa, it's associated with the military -- often negatively. You're a tourist, not G.I. Joe. Do pack soft-sided luggage. Hard-shell bags are typically packed at the bottom of the pile in buses and Jeeps, and they're the last to be unloaded. Don't wear cologne or perfume.

"(CNN) -- I can't tell you how much sex has complicated my life -- my writing life, that is. When I'm not being a university professor of Shakespeare studies, I write historical romance novels as Eloisa James. My colleagues in the academy -- who may have read romance fiction in high school, but haven't stooped to read it since -- have an unfortunate predisposition to characterize my entire genre by referring to its books as ""bodice-rippers."" I'm not rejecting the term ""bodice-ripper"" out of hand. It refers to romance novels published in the 1980s, novels in which the hero, overcome by lusty passion, quite literally ripped the heroine's blouse, the better to expose her bodacious breasts. His button-scattering fervor allowed the heroine to enjoy sexual pleasure, but without having to explicitly agree to sexual acts, a stance that feminist scholars since then have tied to 1980s mores about women's erotic behavior. One thing we Shakespeareans tend to forget (surprisingly, given our scholarly historical focus) is that sex -- its practices, its customs and conventions, and prevailing attitudes toward it -- is a function of the historical, cultural and social conditions of a given time and place. What was considered fun to read in the 1980s isn't necessarily considered fun to read now, and thus the bodice-rippers of the '80s went the way of that decade's aggressive shoulder pads and crumpled leg warmers. The United States of the 21st century is no longer in the same place when it comes to desire, women and the need to wreak havoc on apparel: In keeping with the times, my heroines tend to do their own button-scattering. What I'm saying is that although eroticism is culturally, geographically and historically specific, we writers of historical romance sexualize history without regard for the specific epoch in which we set a novel. No matter how historically accurate the details and language in our novels might be (and mine, in case you're wondering, are pretty accurate), we write sex from the point of view of our own contemporary attitudes and mores. Sex would be hard to be historically precise about anyway: Who really knows what sex was like in 1600? Shagging (popular British slang as early as 1770) surely involved the same acts -- but who can say with certainty what emotions were involved? Scholars are working on that. In mid-March I took myself off to an academic conference at the University of Pennsylvania entitled ""Historicizing Sex: A State of the Field Conference in Early Modern Gender and Sexuality Studies."" The conference pulled together scholars working in feminism, queer theory and gender studies, and asked them to think about when and where cultural meanings get ascribed to sexual acts or anatomical categories. If I'm accused, in my fiction, of sexualizing history, this conference looked as if it was doing the opposite: historicizing sex. For my money, the best paper delivered at the conference was Richard Rambuss' ""Cosmopolitan Crashaw: A Study in Style."" As Rambuss pointed out, Richard Crashaw (c. 1613-1649) was an odd bird: a male university poet who wrote rapturously of female patrons and saints, but also of a naked Jesus in extremis. He wrote letters to fellow (need I add, male) poets with talk of ""flaming kisses."" Gender seems to have been a flexible concept to Crashaw; his poetry rings changes, occasionally referring to female saints with masculine pronouns. Apparently, Crashaw has often been dismissed by poetry scholars, viewed as un-English in his luxurious emotionalism, an ""exotic Italian import, like pasta or castrati,"" in Rambuss' citation of Frank Warnke's assessment. Rambuss concludes that Crashaw is the ""queerest"" of English Renaissance poets, pointing -- in a flurry of lit-crit terms of art -- to his ""queer, ecstatic, transportive traversal of identity positions."" What fascinated me about this paper -- and others at the conference -- was its move toward talking freely about depictions and explorations of historical sex as always being predicated on the present. In other words, there is nothing to recover if we don't bring ourselves to the task; once we do, our ""discoveries"" are tied to the '80s, or the '90s, or the moment of writing. Rambuss says this rather wonderfully, concluding that he wants to think of Crashaw as an ""early modern proto-gay man -- or a prototype of a certain kind of gay man -- one profoundly enmeshed in various male cultures and forms of male camaraderie, but who is also in love... with his divas -- real divas, heavenly female figures the likes of Teresa, Mary Magdalene and the Madonna."" Rambuss' revelation that he ""wants to think of Crashaw"" as a prototype of a modern gay man is important. I too want to find myself in the past. The difference between us is that Rambuss turns to Crashaw's poetry written for his ""sweet friends,"" and I turn to my computer and to my imagination. In both cases, when it comes to sex, our observations are circumscribed by our own predilections. So, for all my colleagues, friends and strangers who may be reading this piece, let me make it very clear. My novels are not bodice-rippers, because I am a creature of 2011. My heroes are prone to whipping out a ""French letter"" (now called a condom). My heroines apparently all saw an early modern version of ""Tootsie,"" and know where their responsibilities lie. What neither my heroes nor heroines do is shag. Because I don't know what that looked like.","Eloisa James writes historical romance novels with a contemporary perspective on sex .

"New York (CNN) -- As they worked to determine if new bones found off Long Island, New York, were human -- and possibly those of victims of a suspected serial killer believed to have targeted sex workers -- tests were underway Monday to match up identities with at least four other sets of discovered remains. Police have previously identified four victims found on Oak Beach in December 2010 as women who advertised prostitution services on websites such as Craigslist. Now, ""the DNA process is underway"" on at least five other sets of remains found in and around nearby beaches in the time since, New York City medical examiner's office spokeswoman Ellen Borakove said Monday. Investigators are trying to determine the identities of these victims, while looking for clues about their killer or killers and any link between all the deaths. The remains include a skull and bones found as recently as last week in Nassau County, as well as a bone fragment of unknown origin found by divers off the Oak Beach area last Friday. New York City's medical examiner office -- the largest non-profit DNA lab in the United States, according to Borakove -- is doing the analysis, and will then turn over the information to investigators in Suffolk and Nassau counties and the New York state police. Experts will extract DNA from the remains to create a profile, which can be used by investigators. ""We're going back to some of the unidentified people in our system to try to see if we can identify them, so we can notify loved ones if we have their remains,"" said Borakove. ""Hopefully ... we'll find out who these people are."" Meanwhile, the search for more clues continued Monday. FBI agents flew a Blackhawk helicopter over area beaches using high-tech equipment to photograph areas that have been previously examined and searched from the ground. The flyovers were finished by Monday evening. New York State troopers and some 30 police officers from Long Island's Nassau and Suffolk counties hacked their way through the area's thick brush and bramble last week, using guidance from a helicopter overhead and, in some cases, using chainsaws to cut through the thick foliage. Aviation teams that flew over parts of Long Island had ""identified a significant number of items that aren't natural for the area,"" Nassau County Acting Police Commissioner Thomas Krumpter said last Thursday. Last week, police discovered skeletal remains -- including the human skull -- prompting the wider search. Police have not said whether the remains are from different people or if they could have come from the eight bodies found previously. Police have used canine search units to scour the beaches and diver teams to search the waterways on the north side of the barrier island. But they have met obstacles, such as thick brush that canine teams won't go in. On April 11, remains were found in a Nassau County wildlife preserve, a law enforcement official said. The remains were wrapped in a ""black plastic product"" similar to a plastic bag, a law enforcement source said. The remains ""appeared to be part of a lower extremity,"" the source said. Medical examiner investigators have been trying to determine the age and sex of the people whose remains were found, as well as how long they were at the locations before they were discovered. A lawyer for the mother of 24-year-old Melissa Barthelemy, who police have identified as one of the victims, said that a man -- using the woman's cell phone -- made taunting phone calls and claimed to have killed the woman. The lawyer, Steve Cohen, said on one August 26, 2009, call, the man said, ""Do you think you'll ever see her again? You won't. I killed her."" Police have not publicly identified any suspects in the case, nor offered a profile of the person or persons they believe may have been responsible for the multiple deaths.

"(CNN) -- A Southern California man allegedly hit his crying 7-year-old son and then threw him off on a tour boat in busy Newport Harbor, Orange County, authorities said Tuesday. Sloane Briles, 35, of Irvine, California, has been charged with felony child endangerment and resisting arrest, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said. He was released Monday in lieu of a $100,000 bond. Briles, who's divorced, was on the tour boat Sunday afternoon with his two sons, ages 6 and 7, when he got into an argument with his current girlfriend, said sheriff's office spokesman Jim Amormino. The boat takes passengers past Newport Beach houses that are or were occupied by celebrities, including the home where the late John Wayne lived, Amormino said. His 7-year-old son became upset about the argument and started crying, Amormino said. The father took the boy to the bow of the boat and told him, "" 'If you don't stop crying, I'm going to throw you overboard,' "" Amormino said. ""And he hits the kid a couple of times,"" Amormino said. ""The boy is crying. He picks him up and throws him overboard. They are in the middle of a harbor, and there is a lot of boat traffic."" The boy's life was endangered several ways, authorities said. ""The main one was throwing him off the front of the boat because the boat could run over him. There was the danger of him being hit by the prop. And the other danger is that because there are so many boats out there, it's no place to swim, and because he's so small, the other boats wouldn't have seen him,"" Amormino said. The boy was also ""only a fair swimmer,"" Amormino said. ""But luckily, three boats saw the kid and converged on him, and plucked him from the water,"" Amormino said. ""The father did jump in (after his son), but the crowd on the boat became angry when he was hitting the kid and became more angry when he threw him overboard,"" Amormino said. There were 85 people on the tour boat. A sheriff's patrol boat responded to a call about the incident. After deputies boarded the tour boat, one of them suffered minor injuries to the hand and elbow during Briles' arrest, authorities said. Deputies took the two boys to their harbor station and later turned them over to their mother, Amormino said. Briles couldn't be reached for comment, and an attorney for him couldn't be immediately located, the sheriff's office said.","A man allegedly hits his 7-year-old son, then throws the boy overboard .

"(CNN) -- Your kids deserve better. Because Congress failed to pass the Child Nutrition Bill last week, bad school lunches will remain bad. While the bill wasn't perfect, it would have created stronger nutritional standards and provided more money for the school lunch program -- adding six cents per lunch for the first time in 30 years. This was the first step on the long ladder to fresh food, and now it's a missed opportunity. Among other things, this bill would have banned the junk food that is served in schools and competes with the fresh food your kids need. Eating this junk every day will take 10 years off their lives and cost you a fortune -- adding thousands of dollars to the family health care tab. When Congress returns, members should not only support these new standards but also give people the necessary dollars to get on the path to fresh food. At the moment, $4.5 billion is attached to the bill, which only works out to six cents on the plate -- not much, but better than nothing if it can buy an apple for each child's breakfast or lunch tray. Over the last two years, more than 700 advocacy groups have been working to get these important changes written into law. Yet Congress could not bring enough support to pass the bill. Do members not value the health of America's kids? Since I've been working in America, I've been overwhelmed by the number of people who write to me. More than 600,000 people have signed the Food Revolution petition for better school food. They are really worried about the quality of food their kids are served in school -- the soda, chocolate milk and pizza for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's not just me who thinks we need change. Parents deserve to know what their kids are being fed at school. If Congress won't put the regulations in place, then Americans are going to have to take things into their own hands. Here's how you do it: . Drop into school and eat lunch with your child. See for yourself what is being served on the breakfast and lunch trays. If you don't like what you see, find other parents in your school who are as frustrated and disgusted as you are. Band together and go to your school board and demand change. Love your lunch ladies. Go visit them and thank them. Let them know you appreciate that they take care of your kids and that you want to help them get better equipment, training and information to make their jobs easier. Make noise. Send e-mails, meet your school nutrition director, go to PTA meetings, get your kids involved. Take every opportunity to keep school food change front and center. If this bill doesn't get passed when Congress comes back in November, then it's going to be another five years before we have another shot at fixing these regulations. Five years is too long to wait. Without this legislation, school food will stay in the Dark Ages of nutrition and your kids are going to suffer. They deserve better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jamie Oliver.","Jamie Oliver: Child Nutrition Bill failed, which means same old unhealthy school lunches .

"(CNN) -- A Mario Gomez hat-trick earned Bayern Munich a 3-0 win over Kaiserslautern at the Fritz-Walter-Stadion on Saturday to send them top of the Bundesliga. The German striker opened the scoring in the 37th minute from the penalty spot before added a second in the 55th minute. His third came 14 minutes later with a left foot strike after some good work by Thomas Muller. The win puts Jupp Heynckes' men ahead of Werder Bremen, who also won on Saturday, on goal difference. Goals from Austrian striker Marko Arnautovic (38th minute) and an 83rd minute strike from Sweden's Markus Rosenberg ensured Bremen beat Hoffenheim 2-1 after Roberto Firmino had given the home side the lead in the 37th minute. The Bundesliga's top two teams last year, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen, played out a goalless draw at the Bay Arena with both sides finishing the match with ten men. Leverkusen's left back Michal Kadlec was shown a straight red card in the 64th minute and was soon followed by Dortmund midfielder Mario Gotze who was shown a second yellow for kicking out against Hanno Balitsch with 13 minutes remaining. The result leaves both teams on seven points, with Dortmund in fourth place. Leverkusen are sixth. Freiburg secured their first win of the season with a 3-0 victory against Wolfsburg. Oliver Barth opened the scoring for the home side with a 30th-minute header, before Slovakian striker Erik Jenvresik added a second 10 minutes later. Congolese midfielder Cedrik Makiadi sealed victory with a fine volley in the 59th minute. Nuremberg claimed their second win of the season with a 1-0 at home to Augsburg but Hamburg continue their poor start to the season going down 4-3 at home to Cologne. Third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach travel to Schalke on Sunday while Hanover host Mainz. Over in Spain, La Liga kicked off with wins for Real Sociedad, Valencia and Real Betis. Spanish striker, Imanol Agirretxe scored both goals for 10-man Real Sociedad in a 2-1 win at Sporting Gijon, while Ruben Castro scored a late winner for Real Betis as they overcame Granada 1-0. But the game of the day was at the Estadio Mestalla as Valencia overturned a 3-1 deficit against Racing Santander to run out 4-3 winners, thanks to a hat-trick from striker Roberto Soldado. His two late goals capped a stunning comeback for last season's third-placed team. After giving Valencia the lead in the opening minute, Soldado then conspired to score a headed own-goal six minutes later. Racing took full advantage of the gift with Lautaro Acosta adding a second in the 14th minute, before Adrian Gonzalez netted a third ten minutes into the second half. French defender Adil Rami pulled one back for the home side moments later before Soldado's goals in the 88th and 90th minute ensured the new season opened in memorable fashion.","Bayern go top of the table after a 3-0 win against Kaiserslautern .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two women who say they suffered severe medical complications from a generic drug lost their Supreme Court appeal Thursday, essentially ending their separate lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers. The justices in a 5-4 ruling said generic drug companies do not share the same level of responsibility as makers of brand-name equivalents, to update their warning labels when significant new risks emerge. The financial and safety implications from the court's ruling, could prove enormous. Generic drugs currently account for more than 70% of prescriptions filled in the United States. That number is expected to rise in the coming years, with patent protection due to expire on several popular and lucrative consumer drugs, including Lipitor and Viagra. The blockbuster health care reform bill championed by President Barack Obama would also encourage greater use of generics. About a third of generic drugs have no brand name competitors. The court split along conservative-liberal lines. ""It is beyond dispute that the federal statutes and regulations that apply to brand-name drug manufacturers are meaningfully different than those that apply to generic drug manufacturers,"" said Justice Clarence Thomas. ""Indeed it is the special, and different, regulation of generic drugs that allowed the generic drug market to expand, bringing drugs more quickly and cheaply to the public."" In dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor countered, ""These divergent liability rules threaten to reduce consumer demand for generics... Nothing in the court's opinion convinces me that, in enacting the requirement that generic labels match their corresponding brand-name labels, Congress intended these results."" Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan supported Sotomayor. Gladys Mensing of Minnesota and Julie Demahy of Louisiana both were prescribed metoclopramide -- marketed as Reglan by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals -- to treat their heartburn and acid reflux. Their pharmacists separately filled the prescription with a generic equivalent made by PLIVA, Inc. and Actavis, Inc. After four years of taking the drugs, the women each developed tardive dyskinesia, a severe longterm neurological disorder that causes involuntary muscle movements. They sued the generic manufacturers of the metoclopramide, claiming that inadequate warnings were provided about the long-term risks of taking the medicine. It was also alleged there was growing evidence of the dangers posed by the drug, but that the companies took no steps to change the warning labels. In 2009, the FDA acted on its own and issued an order to the makers of both brand-name and generic versions of metoclopramide to add a specific warning about the increased risks of developing tardive dyskinesia. The generic drug makers are trying to dismiss the lawsuits. They cite a 1984 congressional law pre-empting state ""failure-to-warn"" claims. Drug companies have long asserted various doctrines of pre-emption, saying they are protected from most product-liability claims if they have met federal safety approval standards. They argue that federal regulatory judgments trump state consumer safety laws, which are often tougher than Washington's standards. But the high court had given a big victory to patients and consumer rights groups in 2009 when it ruled in favor of plaintiff Diana Winn Levine, when she sued Wyeth -- now owned by Pfizer -- after losing an arm to gangrene from a common, brand-name anti-nausea prescription medication. She had won a $7 million judgment from a Vermont jury for her claims. Thomas acknowledged that from the plaintiffs' perspective in the latest cases, ""finding pre-emption here but not in Wyeth makes little sense."" But he added, ""because pharmacists, acting in full accord with state law, substituted generic metoclopramide instead, federal law pre-empts these lawsuits. We acknowledge the unfortunate hand that federal drug regulation has dealt Mensing, Demahy and others similarly situated."" The majority noted Congress and the FDA, not the courts, can now change the law if they want. Sotomayor, expressing her frustration, said, ""As a result of today's decision, whether a consumer harmed by inadequate warnings can obtain relief turns solely on the happenstance of whether her pharmacist filled her prescription with a brand-name or generic drug. The court gets one thing right: This outcome makes little sense."" The American Association of Justice -- representing trial attorneys -- said the ruling was ""disastrous"" for consumers. ""Patients will now be taking generic drugs at their own risk,"" said the group's president Gibson Vance. ""It is absurd that doctors and patients will have to make medical decisions knowing that only brand-name drug manufacturers -- not generics -- can be held accountable for their drugs' dangerous side-effects."" But one of the generic drug makers sued applauded the high court's decision. ""This ruling furthers meaningful consumer protection while also safeguarding against lawsuits that threaten the availability of safe and affordable pharmaceutical products by misconstruing the labeling responsibilities of generic manufacturers,"" said Activis CEO Doug Boothe. The Obama administration was backing the plaintiffs, concerned that if state lawsuits are pre-empted by federal law, that will reduce the incentive for generic drug makers to provide the most current safety information to the FDA.","Court: Generic drug companies don't have same responsibility as makers of name brands .

"(CNN) -- In a televised address Monday night, U.S. President Barack Obama explained the reasons he involved the U.S. military in the U.N.-authorized mission in Libya, saying ""it was not in our national interest"" to let the citizens of a rebel stronghold suffer a massacre at the hands of approaching pro-government forces. Obama also said that NATO would take full control of the military mission on Wednesday. Following is a collection of reactions from people including U.S. politicians and political analysts. U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona: . ""I think that the first part of his speech was excellent, and he laid out the reasons why it was important to intervene and what would have happened in Benghazi. ... He made a strong case."" ""Then ... he made a very puzzling comment, and that was (regime change by force) would be a mistake. Gadhafi must have been comforted by that."" ""The president's policy is Gadhafi must go. I think there's a chance, if we keep the pressure on, Gadhafi could be thrown under the bus (by people surrounding him.)"" ""It's clear we're on the side of the rebels in this conflict. ... (But) if we tell Gadhafi, 'Don't worry, you're not going to be removed by force,' I think that's very encouraging for Gadhafi."" Fareed Zakaria, host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"": . ""It was actually an important speech. It was quite carefully constructed. It had a humanitarian angle, a strategic angle. But at the heart of what Obama is saying is that there are places in the world where the United States does not have vital national interests, where we have not been attacked, but we have limited interests and we're going to try to find a way to have some kind of limited military response."" ""What John McCain was suggesting (in the reaction above) frankly strikes me as a very dangerous argument -- that in a place where we have clearly limited interests, clearly nonvital interests, the United States and the president should (have) an open-ended policy of military escalation and say we will do whatever it takes to get Moammar Gadhafi out of office. That is, frankly, the way we got in conflicts like Vietnam. In order to not be humiliated, we couldn't back down."" Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio: . ""The speech failed to provide Americans much clarity to our involvement in Libya. Nine days into this military intervention, Americans still have no answer to the fundamental question: What does success in Libya look like?"" U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina: . ""I thought he did a good job talking about the signal we would send, that we are a values-based people, and stranding by these young people in Libya will serve us well in the future. But the line that really sort of broke my heart was that regime change by force would be a mistake. The goal of this country is to replace Gadhafi. If you look at the balance sheet of what it costs this nation with Gadhafi versus what it costs without him, it is in our interest to get rid of him, and the opposition needs continued military support -- not a ground invasion by the U.S. or any other Western power, but air support -- all the way to Tripoli."" ""If we continue the model we have in place ... (the rebels) will win. If we back off, this thing is going to go on for a long time, and a lot of people will die unnecessarily."" Ali Suleiman Aujali, former Libyan ambassador to the United States: . ""I think it is a great speech. The president was very clear and very determined, and defended his position in a nice way, and I think he convinced the American people."" ""The Americans, they proved to the world they will not only intervene if there (are) American interests only, but ... also when human life is in danger. This is a historical decision. ... We really appreciate what America did for the Libyan people. The Libyan people ... deserve a better government."" Rudolph Giuliani, former New York City mayor: . ""The president's speech tonight has made things even murkier than they were before. The whole purpose of this was to clarify our mission. Our mission is just internally contradictory. The president says our mission is to protect the people of Libya. Well, how do you protect the people of Libya and not be for regime change in Libya? Isn't the danger to the people of Libya Gadhafi?"" ""The president's speech is illogical. If you were grading this on a Greek logic exam, you'd give it an F. The speech contradicts itself. It says limited action; we're not going to go any further than just protecting the people of Libya; we're not going to be for regime change. But you can't protect the people of Libya without regime change. Why are we there in the first place? Because Gadhafi was slaughtering his people. How can you leave him there?"" P.J. Crowley, former U.S. State Department spokesman: . ""The president's policy is to assist in the removal of Moammar Gadhafi. The issue is not with the policy. The issue is the mechanism. We're acting in a limited manner to level the playing field so the Libyan people themselves and the opposition that has formed, they'll do that job. It's not for the United States to impose that from the outside."" Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson: . ""I felt the president was very presidential tonight. He explained the purpose: To avert a humanitarian disaster, to protect civilian lives. He even added ... a (potential) refugee crisis going to Tunisia and Egypt."" ""I was very satisfied with his speech tonight. Again, consultation with Congress in the days ahead is going to be very important. But he explained the objective, and he explained what he wants to do, and the airstrikes have succeeded. Air defenses of Libya have been almost destroyed. The rebels are gaining momentum. Look, they're probably not perfect revolutionary characters, but they're sure as heck a lot better than Gadhafi staying. ... I applaud the president tonight."" Fouad Ajami, professor of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins University: . ""I think it's the right thing at last. I think the president did a great job. I'm not a fan of President Obama; I didn't vote for him. I think he should have done this much earlier. But ... he finally did it. And I think he answered the great questions about this intervention. ... And he told us the truth: This was always about Benghazi. It was about a rescue operation that he was forced to do, and I think it's the right thing."" Anne-Marie Slaughter, professor of international affairs at Princeton University: . ""I think (Obama) ... made clear that we went in to avoid what he described as violence on a horrific scale in Benghazi; that the mandate of the U.N. coalition ... is to protect Libyan civilians. I think that makes very clear what success looks like there. It means that Libyan civilians are safe -- safe in their houses, safe in their cities. At the same time, he made very clear that in his U.S. policy -- and the policy of many of our allies -- that Libya needs to have a new government that responds to the demands of the Libyan people, and that we will pursue every diplomatic and economic means to that end. And leveling the playing field militarily will certainly help."" David Gergen, CNN senior political analyst: . ""I thought in general (Obama) made a compelling case -- a very strong case for intervention itself on humanitarian grounds. He made a compelling case that the United States has helped to organize the international coalition much more rapidly than has happened in the past, as in Bosnia. And furthermore, I think he made a compelling case that these early U.S. actions really have accomplished what the United States promised to do, and that was to stop Gadhafi from killing other people. ""But ... the success of the speech ended there, because he left open all these questions about where we go from here if there's a stalemate -- and there were signs today that there may be a stalemate. What are we going to do? What is NATO going to do? Who knows? I don't think anybody knows that. What is going to happen if Gadhafi hangs in there for six months? What do we do then? Nobody knows. What happens if Gadhafi gets forced out? What happens if the regime cracks and they turn on him -- even assassinate him? What's the United States' role going to be in building a new Libya? It thought that was left cloudy, and is going to continue the debate. ""But give President Obama his due.

"(WIRED) -- For downloading data, the Verizon iPhone is slower than the AT&T iPhone, and it's also slower than most other Verizon smartphones, according to a study published Monday. Mobile analysis firm Metrico performed a comprehensive study on several AT&T and Verizon handsets, including the iPhone on both networks. The data suggests the differences between AT&T and Verizon are greater than we initially thought. The debut of the iPhone on Verizon sheds light on more subtle differences between the Verizon and AT&T networks. Now that both networks have the same data-intensive iPhone capable of performing identical tests, it's been easier for researchers to collect more comparable data. Independent tests by multiple publications, including Wired.com, have found that AT&T's network is faster, while Verizon's is more reliable with phone calls. Metrico's tests paint a conflicting picture. Some of their findings: . -- The Verizon iPhone performed ""below average"" in data download speeds when compared to other Verizon phones including the HTC Incredible. -- For voice calls, the Verizon iPhone was one of the highest ranked in noise-canceling performance and was an average performer in voice quality. -- The AT&T iPhone was the top performer in data transfer rates, but it ranks lower in call performance and Bluetooth speech quality compared to some BlackBerry, HTC and Samsung phones. -- The AT&T iPhone completed 10% more download sessions than the Verizon iPhone when the handsets were moving  in a car, for instance. -- But the Verizon iPhone had a 10% better success rate when uploading data in a stationary environment, like sitting at your desk. The rest of Metrico's results tell the story we've already heard: The AT&T iPhone's download speeds are about double the mean download speed of Verizon's. However, even though AT&T's iPhone downloaded files faster, when it comes to loading web pages, the average load time is about the same on both devices, Metrico added. Metrico explained that many different factors affect web performance, including network latency and the operating system's rendering times. (Indeed, a previous bandwidth test performed by Speedtest.net found that both the Verizon and AT&T iPhones turned in the same average latency times of about 350 milliseconds.) Most peculiar to Wired.com is that the Verizon iPhone is ""below average"" in download speeds compared to other Verizon handsets. Was the handset purposely slowed down to avoid overloading Verizon's network? Is there something about Apple's hardware that makes it slower than other handset makers? It's tough to say: Metrico doesn't have theories to explain the test results. ""I can't say it's related to technology at this point,"" said Rich McNally, vice president of information product at Metrico. ""We're measuring what happened, not necessarily why."" To perform the study, Metrico put each phone through live tests on the AT&T or Verizon networks, as well as Metrico's own simulated network. On the simulated network, the phones completed tests and transferred data to Metrico's servers for more consistent, controlled results. The phones were also tested in both stationary and mobile environments. For mobile testing, the phones were tested inside automobiles while driving. In all, the company performed more than 10,000 web page downloads, 2,000 data download/upload tests, and 4,000 voice calls. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

"(CNN) -- Libyan Transitional National Council Chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil has dismissed the rebels' 14-member executive board, a spokesman for the council said Tuesday. The death of the rebel government's military commander, Gen. Abdel Fattah Younis, on July 28 played a role in board members' ouster Monday, said Shamsiddin Abdulmolah, the council's media director. ""They were dismissed because of some are directly responsible for how Gen. Younis was arrested,"" Abdulmolah said. ""There were shortcomings and mishandling of the events that led to his assassination."" Younis and two other rebels were killed after the TNC sought to question him about allegations that he or those close to him had ongoing ties to Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi, Younis' supporters have said. ""There are two investigations going on now in relation to his assassination,"" Abdulmolah said. ""There is the criminal investigation, and there is another investigation looking for the administrative mistakes that led to Younis' death."" At least four people are directly responsible administratively for the events leading to the Younis assassination, Abdulmolah said. But the criminal investigation is still ongoing, and no arrests have been officially been made. Despite their dismissal, Abdulmolah said ""some of the people who served on the board can definitely be included in the new Cabinet."" The rebel government's chairman commissioned Mahmoud Jibril, the former head of the executive board, to submit new names to be considered for a new board soon, Abdulmolah said, but no exact deadline was mentioned. NATO has used air power to enforce a U.N. resolution protecting civilians from the Gadhafi regime, and world powers have announced their support for Libya's rebel umbrella group. But concerns have been raised that the mysterious assassination might have been carried out by feuding rebel groups. According to Gadhafi spokesman Musa Ibrahim, Younis' killing represented ""more proof that the transitional council of the traitors is not able to lead any sort of government or have any control of eastern cities of Libya."" In July, rebel military council member Mohammad Ethish released a statement that seemed to imply that Gadhafi loyalists had something to do with the death. ""This incident will increase the will and courage of the rebels, and it will even get us close together to reach the home of the tyrant,"" Ethish said. ""We promise our brothers in the East that we will do the impossible to avenge the death of Abdul Fattah Younis, and we promise that we will increase our blows and empower our will. Until we capture the tyrant Moammar Gadhafi."" A one-time general in Gadhafi's army, Younis told CNN in February that he switched sides after Gadhafi told him he planned to bomb Benghazi -- a move Younis said would have killed thousands. Meanwhile, the Libyan Embassy in London re-opened Tuesday under National Transitional Council management, a shift that ""marks very clearly the fundamental change that is taking place in Libya,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said. Rebel forces also reported Tuesday that they had advanced more than 9 miles (15 kilometers) north from B'ir al Ghanam toward the key coastal city of Az Zawiyah, which is about 27 miles (43 kilometers) west of Tripoli. Rebels took B'ir al Ghanam in fierce fighting Saturday. CNN's Elise Labott, Ivan Watson and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","NEW: Council reopens London Embassy; rebels report advances near B'ir al Ghanam .

"(CNN) -- If the excessive lifestyles of the rich have been partly to blame for destroying the environment, then it seems equitable that they use their money to preserve it. But the degree to which they are actually helping does largely depend on what they do with their money. And some 'beneficiaries' of that aid are yet to be convinced. Richard Branson, Bill Clinton and Al Gore at the Clinton Global Initiative last September. According to last year's Merrill Lynch survey of the world's wealth, there are 9.5 million U.S. dollar millionaires in the world today, who have pocketed a cool $37.2 trillion between them. By 2011, Merrill Lynch says, this tiny (but growing) group of people will have more than $50 trillion in their bank accounts. That money could go a long way to aid the fight against climate change and the different ills it brings. Fortunately, a modest proportion of this exclusive group of people have realized this. Around 11 percent of the world's richest gave 7 percent of their wealth to philanthropic causes in 2006; and 17 percent of the world's ""ultra rich"" (those with more than $30 million to their names) gave 10 percent, says Merrill Lynch. In total those donations totaled $285 billion. Some of the more notable donors are household names: Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Richard Branson all dug deep into their pockets in the name of doing good, the latter specifically promising $3 billion to fight global warming over the next 10 years. Ted Turner, George Soros and Luciano Benetton have also contributed, notably buying land in South America in the name of conservation. Turner, the founder of CNN, owns more than 100,000 acres of land there; Benetton owns 2 million acres; Soros 1 million. If you accept the fact that much of the world's environmental ills have landed on the shoulders of the world's poorest nations, then this looks like a match made in heaven. ""It is pretty hard for a country to turn down a gift of 300,000 hectares,"" Doug Tompkins, founder of clothing chain Esprit, told one reporter recently. Tompkins and his wife, Kristine McDivitt, former CEO of Patagonia clothing company, specialize in investing in national parks in South America and own around 900,000 hectares of Chilean and Argentinean land between them. With the amount of money and influence these individuals possess, one key advantage they have is that they can get things done -- and quickly. Dutch philanthropist Paul Fentener van Vlissingen, for example, brought South Africa's Marakele National Park to life in ""barely two years"" by investing millions of dollars of his own money in it, completing a job ""that would likely have taken more than a decade without his backing"" reports The Age. Philanthropy can spur backlash . But not everyone welcomes the foreign assistance. The implication that foreigners can do a better job than those in the host country receiving the aid has been taken as an insult by some. And it has aroused suspicion elsewhere. In the 1990s Tompkins drew ire in Chile, including the Catholic Church and former president Eduardo Frei. The accusations against him ranged from from kicking workers off his land, promoting abortion, and creating a ""Zionist enclave,"" according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. When it comes to rain forests there is also a degree of concern among some environmental groups that any system that allows individuals to take ownership of vast swathes of environmentally crucial land is bound to be flawed. In the case of the Amazon rain forest, Survival International has expressed concerns over the future of the rain forest inhabitants, the indigenous people. The organization points out that if the world really wanted to protect the rain forests, it would just leave them alone and let the people who have been protecting them for centuries carry on doing what they do best. ""The forest cannot be bought, it is our life; we have always protected it,"" tribal leader Davi Kopenawa told the Guardian newspaper recently. Pragmatists would argue there are many ways to ""protect"" a rain forest. Yes, leaving them alone is the ideal solution. But when cash-strapped governments face ongoing pressure from logging companies, mining companies, not to mention the agricultural lobby to convert the land for other uses, there is only one thing that really counts: Money. And indigenous groups don't have any. So, the argument goes, better a philanthropist own the land than a business interest. The business of giving . A philanthropist deciding to do charitable work does not by itself guarantee successful results. Much can depend on the philanthropist doing the ""right thing"" with their money. George Soros, for example, could be seen as either an environmental savior or an eco-villain, depending on one's view of biofuels. The philanthropist manages more than 170,000 hectares of Argentinean land, but his latest venture -- worth reportedly up to $300 million -- is to produce biofuel from corn and sugar cane grown in Brazil's Cerrado. That area of land is among the most endangered on Earth, with deforestation rates easily eclipsing that of the Amazon, according to Conservation International. More than 50 percent of the Cerrado has been converted to farm land in less than four decades and there are genuine fears that by 2030, all remaining natural vegetation will have disappeared, reports the Washington Post. There will be one predominant reason for this if that happens: Worldwide demand for ethanol. It should not be forgotten that the art of giving is a business, too. Some of the favored destinations for philanthropic spending have been in areas of the world offering the potential for the biggest returns. It was the collapse of the peso which led to a collapse in land prices in Argentina that helped remote Patagonia become such a favored investment destination for the world's wealthiest. Equally, if the price isn't right, environmental concern can go out the window. Cameroon has been trying to lease 830,000 hectares of its rain forest since 2001 in an attempt to raise capital and do the right thing at the same time. It could easily lease it to logging companies, but prefers not to, according to The Economist. The problem is, Cameroon can't find a buyer, as no one has been willing to pay the asking rate of $2 a hectare, which would work out at a mere $1.6 million a year. ""The fine words of the rich-world's armchair conservationists butter few parsnips in the poor world,"" writes The Economist. ""Here is a good opportunity to spread some butter.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The floodlights, corporate boxes and big screens at sports stadiums are all massive power sappers - but there's an increasingly popular technology which is chewing more energy than ever before. Power-sapping technology: lighting rigs, like these ones installed at Telstra Dome are used to help grass growth. The culprits are giant lighting rigs. The rigs are being adopted by football stadiums across Europe and the United Kingdom to encourage grass growth, but they're creating a significant footprint in doing so. So, who's using the most power? English Premier League football superpower Arsenal could have one of the worst carbon footprints in the region as its home ground is believed to use the biggest set of lighting rigs in the United Kingdom. The club has been accused by environmental groups of using enough energy to power a small village in order to grow the grass on their home pitch. The team's state of the art Emirates Stadium, which opened in 2006, boasts a set of 12 lighting rigs with huge sunlamps that run most of the year providing sufficient light to keep the turf growing and in a healthy condition. The rigs, which have more than 600 light bulbs, have come under heavy criticism from environmental groups, who say they are ""irresponsible."" What do you think of grass lighting rigs? Do you think they are useful or a waste of energy? Share your thoughts in the Sound Off box below -- we'll publish the best. Purchased for more than $1,400,000 from Netherlands-based business Stadium Grow Lighting Concepts, the rigs can cover almost half of Arsenal's home ground at a time. The lamps contain sensors on the pitch to determine how many hours of light the grass needs in order to stay green. Similar lights are used at seventeen other venues around the United Kingdom. Liverpool's Anfield ground has 10 lighting rigs, and Cardiff's Millennium Stadium uses nine. In comparison, Wembley uses four, while Manchester United use just three rigs, at Old Trafford -- but there are plans to expand this. It's not just in the United Kingdom these lighting rigs are proving popular. The Telstra Dome in Sydney, Australia, earlier this year purchased 15 lighting rigs to improve grass growth at the venue. Other projects have been implemented across football grounds in Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Spain, Russia, Ireland and Qatar. Another major power sapping technology at Emirates Stadium is the air ventilation system below the turf, which is powered by a huge fan that helps keep the grass in ideal condition. The system's pipe-work is in the gravel bed below the turf, and above a heating system. The ventilation can work in two directions. In one direction, it provides aeration through the gravel bed and through the root zone to promote growth. Reversing the air system can provide drainage from the root zone down to pull moisture away from the surface. But, there is hope these stadiums can reduce their energy consumption. While football stadiums in Europe and the United Kingdom are making environmental blacklists -- one stadium in the U.S. has entered the ""green list."" The Washington Nationals' new baseball park that opened earlier this year became the first LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified stadium in the United States. In order to earn the certification, the park was fitted with energy-saving light fixtures, water-conserving plumbing, drought-resistant plants, and a green roof over the concessions area. It also has systems in place to keep storm water runoff from polluting a nearby river, and it was built on a restored brown field that once had contaminated soil. The Green Building Council's Brendan Owens told Reuters, ""One of the things that really strikes me about stadium facilities is that they directly touch millions of people over the course of their existence,"" Owens felt the eco-friendly design would encourage visitors to help the environment in other ways.","Football stadiums across Europe and the UK are using lighting rigs to grow grass .

Originally, Dr. Luke and Martin, the Swedish songwriter behind some of Spears' biggest hits, including ""...Baby One More Time,"" planned to give the song to Katy Perry. ""We might have played it for her, but it definitely wasn't a Katy Perry record,"" Dr. Luke says by phone from Conway Recording Studio in Los Angeles. ""We had it for a while. I wanted to make sure it didn't sound like everything else I've done. I brought it into Billboard, and he just killed it.

""You hear all those little parts that are so Britney -- 'here's the video-breakdown-dance part of the song.' That's what my listeners love about her."" Although her 2008 album Circus sold fewer than 2 million copies, not a huge number given Spears' history of blockbuster sales, retailers have high hopes for the March release.

"(CNN) -- More than 40 people have been killed in clashes between soldiers and a rebel militia in Southern Sudan, an official there said Monday, disputing rebel claims they have killed many more government troops. Rebel leader George Athor has been saying his forces have killed more than 100 people, most of them soldiers, since a fresh round of fighting started last week. But Philip Aguer, a spokesman for Southern Sudan's military, said Athor's claims are exaggerated. Athor took up arms in 2010 when he was not elected governor of Southern Sudan's Jonglei state. His forces have been attacking villages and clashing with the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the military wing of the movement that governs Southern Sudan. People in the region voted overwhelmingly for independence from the north in a recent referendum, setting the stage for Southern Sudan to become a new country. Athor's forces attacked the towns of Fanjak and Bor a month ago, Aguer said at the time. Twenty SPLA soldiers, 39 civilians and 30 of the attackers were killed in the attack on Fanjak, he said. Four SPLA soldiers and 12 attackers died in the Bor attack, he added. The clashes took place February 9 and 10, he said. Athor has accused the Southern Sudan government of election fraud, but signed a truce in January, days before the referendum. As the nation readies for official independence on July 9, violence caused by renegade militias has been a concern. A mutiny among the Joint Integrated Units (JIUs) led by soldiers loyal to militia leader Gabriel Tang resulted in up to 50 deaths in February. Sixty-five civilians were also injured. The JIUs are a coordinated military force consisting of the northern Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the southern SPLA. Tang's forces had been merged into the units along with SAF. Journalist Ismail Kamal Kushkush in Khartoum, Sudan, contributed to this report.","Rebels claim they have killed more than 100 people, mostly soldiers, since last week .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Prominent human rights activist Hu Jia, who was released over the weekend after serving a 3 1/2-year sentence, is promising his parents he will be ""careful"" in the future. In a phone call to CNN affiliate iCable News in Hong Kong on Sunday, Hu said his parents had asked him to not clash with the system. ""Once I saw my family, I understood how much I owe them, especially my parents, my wife and my kid. I realize I've done nothing for them. There is a Chinese saying that 'patriotism and filial piety don't go hand in hand,'"" he said in the phone call. ""They told me to be a good citizen and don't clash with the system. This system is very brutal. It uses government's power to violate people's dignity. I can only tell my parents, I will be careful."" Chinese authorities released Hu on Sunday, days after freeing renowned dissident artist Ai Weiwei. Hu, 37, denounced China's human rights record in a series of articles ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics and was later sentenced to 3.5 years in prison for ""inciting to subvert state power."" He also has been active on AIDS issues in China. Ai, the conceptual artist turned government critic, was released Wednesday on bail after authorities detained him for nearly three months for tax evasion, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. On Sunday, police guarded entrances to Hu's apartment compound and patrolled surrounding streets. Zeng Jinyan, his wife, appeared unreachable via phone or the Internet. Zeng told CNN Friday that authorities started 24-hour surveillance on her several days before Hu's expected return. In an interview last December, she predicted a virtual prisoner's life for the couple in their housing complex, called Freedom City. ""Hu Jia told me that he won't change, and police told him they may put him under house arrest in that case,"" she said. ""I'm prepared for it."" ""As long as there's no democracy or the rule of law in China, our situation won't change at all."" Last year's Nobel peace laureate Liu Xiaobo, also a rights activist, was convicted of the same crime as Hu. Liu is still serving an 11-year jail term. Activists say the Chinese government, worried about potential uprisings inspired by the Arab Spring, has been increasingly tightening its grip on freedom of expression, targeting not only political dissidents but also intellectuals and artists. In his phone call to iCable, Hu talked further about his parents and his responsibility toward them and others like them. ""My parents are very old. How many parents are like my parents? Others, too, are also in pain but not getting as much attention and help from you all as I did,"" he said. ""These people are more isolated. I can only try my best to comfort my parents and comfort the others too.""","Hu: Patriotism and filial piety don't go hand in hand .

Jordan -- who is acting as the honorary assistant captain for the U.S. team at the event -- puffed while playing a practice round despite the city's ban on smoking at public golf courses. Pictures were published in the San Francisco Chronicle of the 46-year-old flouting the rules, a move which prompted city officials to request the PGA Tour to remind Jordan of the law. ""It was sort of a gentle nudge reminding them that smoking is illegal and that we would appreciate their support,"" Recreation and Park General Manager Phil Ginsburg told the Chronicle. The breaking of the smoking ban carries a $100 fine, however, Matt Dorsey, the spokesman for City Attorney Dennis Herrera, told the newspaper: ""Just don't expect me to ask him for it."" Fred Couples invited Jordan to be an honorary assistant captain at the Presidents Cup, and the Hall of Famer spoke to reporters on Monday about his smoking. ""I heard this is a public place, so they limit what you can smoke, but this was a practice round and no one said anything,"" he told the gathered media. British Open champion Stewart Cink backed Jordan despite the outcry suggesting the cigar was unlit: ""The tobacco usage did become a little bit of a story out there, because I saw Michael with a cigar in his mouth that was unlit.

"(CNN) -- He's a best-selling crime novelist from a Scandinavian country, but don't call Jo Nesbø the next Stieg Larsson. It's not that Nesbø doesn't care for the comparison. He just believes it's misleading. The 51-year old from Oslo, Norway says he has more in common with American hard-boiled crime fiction. Nesbø (pronounced NESS-buh) is a former professional soccer player, musician and stock broker, who eventually turned to writing. He was writing bestsellers for ten years before Larsson's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" was published. While his crime novels have sold nine million copies worldwide, he's just becoming widely known in the United States, but his new novel will likely change that. ""The Snowman"" hit bookstores in the United States last week and is winning raves from American critics. It's Nesbø's seventh novel featuring police detective and recovering alcoholic, Harry Hole (pronounced WHO-leh). It's a terrifying thriller, about the hunt for a serial killer, who leaves a snowman as his calling card. The book is already a bestseller in Britain, won Norway's novel of the year in 2008, and appears headed for the big screen. ""The Snowman"" has been optioned by Working Title films, ironically, the same production company behind the movie version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" Nesbø was at the Cannes Film Festival last week to promote ""Headhunters"" a movie based on another of his novels. He's now touring a handful of U.S. cities to promote ""The Snowman."" CNN caught up with the author this week. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: For new readers, tell us a little about your main character Harry Hole. Nesbø: It is not easy to summarize the protagonist of the series in a few words, but here are some features of Harry's personality that are important to me when I write about him: He's the type of guy who is driven by his good side as well as his darker side. At times he believes in his role as law enforcer, at other times he doesn't. And occasionally he is so gripped by his emotions that they overwhelm his basic belief in the principles of a state governed by law. He hunts down criminals with such an intense hatred and finds revenge so hard to resist that at times he could be mistaken for the antagonists he is fighting. But at the same time he can feel empathy for, perhaps even a kinship with, the lawbreaker. Harry Hole is a hero with pronounced weaknesses. All good heroes have an Achilles heel, and in Harry's case, it is alcohol. CNN: What's Harry's up against in ""The Snowman?"" Nesbø: Harry Hole receives an anonymous letter signed ""The Snowman."" A few months later he discovers an alarming resemblance in numerous old disappearances: Married women (who have children) go missing the day the first snow falls each year. CNN: How would you describe Oslo -- where the story takes place? Nesbø: Oslo is a cozy little capital, but it is also what you have seen in my books. For a while it had the highest number of fatalities from drug overdoses in Europe. There is organized crime, hardcore prostitution, trafficking in drugs and women, and a Russian Mafia presence. It's a town that has gone through immense changes over the last twenty years. It's still a very beautiful town in one of the richest countries of the world, and it's safe. But there is all the rest, so it's easier to write about the shady side of Oslo now than it was twenty years ago. I want to describe the contrasts, and to me Oslo today is a perfect setting for a thriller. CNN: Your novels deal unflinchingly with some dark and complex themes, including Harry's alcoholism. Where do your ideas come from? Nesbø: I believe that those of us who were afraid of the dark when we were young have an advantage. If you pretended you were too big to be afraid of the dark, you closed off part of your brain, but if you let your imagination run, it went wild. When I went down to the cellar to get potatoes as a boy, I came back up again with a horror story of novel proportions in my head. And when I'm writing the passage about the woman being chased through the forest, or when Harry gets lost, I draw from the fear and horror I experienced myself. I've been lost in a forest myself and felt I wasn't far away, but suddenly it became darker and darker, and even though I thought the house was close by, it wasn't. And then you're convinced you're lost. Your terror is the fuel for your writing. I was a lot more afraid of the dark and frightened than my brothers, and I'm sure it has given me an extra edge and sense of horror. I was always the one who had to tell ghost stories when we were small because they could hear the terror in my voice. And I was petrified by my own stories. I am attracted and fascinated by the dark side. I write about it because I'm curious. I'm curious about everything that is human. I'm not fascinated by suffering for its own sake - torture scenes don't interest me as such -- but I am fascinated by people who torture, what drives them. CNN: Explain why you say Harry's goal is to understand evil and also love. Nesbø: Harry feels something akin to what the serial killer feels, the same tension and excitement, when he approaches a victim and the same anti-climax after the killer is caught. It is Harry's ambition to understand both love and evil. He is a passionate guy in all ways. And he is the type of man who has no control over his impulses. The fact that he cannot set limits permeates his drinking habits and his attitude to his job. He takes on cases and is swallowed up by them. It is the same with his relationships with women. I could have chosen to make them live happily ever after and have children, but then we have a completely different person, one I find boring. I like the fact that he is in transit in his own life, as far as his emotions and his job are concerned. When you make a person a hero you are bound to have some things in common with him -- at least a basic set of values if you're going to understand him. I think understanding basic emotions like hate and love is something we spend a lifetime trying to achieve. So, yeah, it's true for me too. CNN: How has your success impacted your career? Nesbø: I have less time to write because I have to travel more. Apart from that I do the same things, I keep my life fairly simple and unchanged because I was perfectly happy with the life I had. Having millions of readers is not dramatically different from having a few thousand; you still have to write books and you still wake up in the morning being your own boss, deciding whether you want to get up. CNN: Any thoughts why ""Nordic Noir"" has become so popular among readers globally? Nesbø: The popularity may have to do with the general level of quality in Scandinavian crime. In the 70s, Sjöwall and Wahlöö established the crime novel as an art form, as serious writing, and since then many of the best writing talents have turned to the crime novel and used it as a vehicle for their stories. CNN: Did you always want to be a writer? Nesbø: I come from a family of readers and storytellers. My mother was a librarian and my father used to sit in the living room reading every afternoon. When I was seven I pulled ""Lord of the Flies"" off the bookshelf and asked my father to read it to me. Not so much because I had good taste, but because on the cover there was a picture of a pig's bloodstained head impaled on a pole. My father read and I used to think I could have made the story more exciting myself. I had already begun to impress friends my age, and some older children, with my gruesome ghost stories. CNN: What other authors and artists inspire you? Nesbø: Jim Thompson, Vladimir Nabokov, Knut Hamsun, Henrik Ibsen, Ernest Hemingway, Charles Bukowski, and Frank Miller. Miles Davis, Jayhawks, Teenage Fanclub, Elvis Costello, Ryan Adams, Tom Waits, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young and Bob Dylan. CNN: What's on your summer reading list? Nesbø: ""The Corrections"" by Jonathan Franzen. I read the first half in Asia in February, but lost the book. Now I have a new one. CNN: What's next for you? Nesbø: My next Harry Hole novel, the ninth in the series, will be published in Norway next month. Next year I plan to write a fourth children's book in my Doctor Proctor series.

"Editor's note: This is another in a series of Business Insider commentaries debunking common tech myths. (Business Insider) -- Apple and CEO Steve Jobs have celebrated a string of huge hits over the past several years, including the iPhone, the iPad and the MacBook Air. Reviews have been mostly glowing, sales have been strong and investors have cheered, sending the stock up 40% over the past 12 months. Apple, which was struggling a decade ago, is now the world's most admired and highly valued tech company. But Apple is not perfect. In fact, the company has several weaknesses to address: . 1) The cloud. Apple has been bragging about how the iPad 2 is a ""post-PC"" device, but you still need to plug it into a computer to activate and sync it. The easiest way to get photos off your iPhone is to email them to yourself. You still can't sync your iTunes music over Wi-Fi or 3G. This is a shame. Apple needs to think about the cloud the way Google does -- as the future of mobile services. You shouldn't be tied to a USB cord to access files. You shouldn't need a PC to use a ""post-PC"" iPad. You shouldn't have to email a map link from your computer to your iPhone. Perhaps this is part of Apple's new version of iOS, due sometime this year. (See our list of suggestions for iOS 5 here.) The company has a huge new data center in North Carolina and can't be blind to the fact that other companies -- Dropbox, Amazon, Google, etc. -- are doing very cool things with the cloud. But for now, Apple is still weak here -- MobileMe and Apple's iOS push notifications not withstanding. 2) Social. Apple has tried to do ""social"" a bit with Ping, its social network based around iTunes music, and GameCenter, its social gaming service. They aren't huge hits. Apple has not been able to go as deep integrating Facebook or other social networks into its products as some Android devices or Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 have. Some of this could be to reduce Apple's dependence on other companies, so the iPhone is more reliable. But it seems that Apple and Steve Jobs don't really get social, and don't see its value. That could burn them in the long run. Or perhaps, again, this could be addressed in the next version of iOS. For instance, Apple could go a long way by making the iPhone's built-in Photos app more social, like the popular Instagram app. And Apple's marketing boss Phil Schiller is all over Instagram. So it's not like the company isn't highly aware of what's out there. This isn't to say that Apple should replicate Facebook, or even try to build its own general-purpose social network. But integrating your existing online social connections could be useful for many of Apple's products, ranging from the iPhone's address book to the App Store to photo sharing. So it's time for Apple to do more here. 3) The living room. The new Apple TV just got a small upgrade, in the form of live video streaming for MLB and NBA games. But it's still the weakest of Apple's products, with a relatively limited selection of video. And it's definitely not something TV companies like Comcast or DirecTV are worried about. Apple could improve Apple TV with an app store within the next year or so -- gaming could be big! -- and more video content sooner. But it's a challenge, because this is a situation where Apple has to decide between being a good platform -- and allowing rival companies like Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon to thrive -- and being a dominant content seller by keeping an iTunes monopoly. The good news for Apple is that no one else is really putting up a fight here yet. Google TV isn't a big success, while Boxee, Roku and TiVo Premiere haven't caught on with mainstream consumers. So Apple can take its time. Heck, Apple may even come out with an actual television someday. Also, these are all areas where Apple is relatively in control of its destiny, and can make improvements. There are some other areas where Apple is vulnerable, such as the threat posed by Google's Android system, and possible production problems because of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. But that's a different list. Copyright © 2010 Business Insider.","Is the iPad 2 really ""post-PC"" if you have to plug it into a computer to activate and sync?

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Shazia knows what she sees when she looks in the mirror: a woman, feminine, delicate, attracted to beauty. But when others look at Shazia they see something else: a misfit. Shazia dances for the cameras at a party. ""People start staring at me in such a manner as if an animal from the jungle has come into the city."" Shazia says. Shazia belongs to Pakistan's community of eunuchs. It is a term here that loosely refers to transsexuals, transvestites or hermaphrodites, like Shazia, who are born with both male and female sex organs. For Shazia what nature created, has made a life of hell. ""I get so confused. I feel very strange that Allah could have made me a boy, or he could have made me a girl, but this way, neither boy nor girl. This life is very strange. It is a bad life,"" Shazia said. ""I do not want to accept this life. Had it been legal to commit suicide I would have done it."" When she was a child, Shazia said she had no doubt that she felt more a girl than a boy.  Watch Shazia handle stares from men » . ""When I used to go to school there used to be benches for boys on one side and girls on the other; my teacher always made me sit with the girls."" she said. Shazia left home when she was in her early teens. She said it was to save her family embarrassment and shame. Like other eunuchs in Pakistan, she has lived in colonies. They are often shunned by their families and forced to make a living by begging or as prostitutes. The colonies can be brutal places, where young people are often beaten and exploited. When Shazia was 17, she says she was drugged and the head of the colony performed brutal surgery severing Shazia's penis. But Shazia has survived the taunts, the humiliation and the savagery; now she is fighting back. Shazia has formed an action group and is campaigning for eunuchs like her to get proper recognition. Right now her state identity card lists her as a male. She wants to be counted as a whole person. Shazia has found a champion, human rights lawyer, Muhammad Aslan Khaki. Dr. Khaki presented a petition to the Supreme Court, leading to the first register of eunuchs in Pakistan. The court has ordered Pakistan's government departments to carry out a survey and recommend measures to fully integrate eunuchs into society without prejudice. In earlier centuries eunuchs were seen as having the power to bring good luck. For Shazia and others, their luck may finally be changing.","Pakistan's eunuch community campaigns for proper recognition .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- The brother of the suicide bomber who killed eight people at a U.S. base in Afghanistan last week told CNN his sibling's actions were ""out of character"" and that the man was ""under pressure."" The bomber was a Jordanian doctor recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence source, a senior Jordanian official said Tuesday. A former U.S. intelligence official identified the man earlier this week as Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi. The man's father, who is shocked by his relative's actions, said he was called by an Afghan speaking in broken Arabic from Afghanistan. The Afghan told him his son was dead and that he died as a hero in an operation to kill CIA agents. The caller said, according to the father, the circumstances could make problems for his family and that they will have to cope with it. But the caller told the man's father his son was a hero. The brother and father spoke to CNN's Nic Robertson. The December 30 blast at a U.S. base in Khost, in southeastern Afghanistan, killed seven CIA operatives, including two from private security firm Xe, formerly known as Blackwater. The eighth victim was Jordanian Army Capt. Sharif Ali bin Zeid, a cousin of Jordan's King Abdullah II. The suspected suicide bomber left Jordan a year ago for Turkey to finish his medical studies, but his family realized three months later he wasn't there, relatives said. The family didn't know whether the Afghan caller was from al Qaeda but believes it was some militant group. A Jordanian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said authorities in Jordan arrested al-Balawi more than a year ago ""for some suspicious information related to him"" but released him due to lack of evidence. ""After (a) few months, he got in touch with us through the Internet and sent us several e-mails that include very important and rather dangerous information that might affect the security and stability of the country,"" the official told CNN. ""We kept in touch with him through e-mails in order to get more information and also trying to bring him over to be able to get more information. We shared and exchanged the information he gave us with some other friendly countries that are involved in countering terrorism."" The official said Jordan could not confirm that al-Balawi was the bomber, ""because we are not on the ground."" ""But we are not denying that if he is the one, then he is the Jordanian doctor,"" the official said. U.S. sources said bin Zeid was the Jordanian operative working closely with al-Balawi, who was from the same hometown as the onetime leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently believed al-Balawi had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda's No. 2 figure, the former intelligence official said. Former CIA official Robert Richer called the bombing the greatest loss of life for the agency since the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight agents. An American intelligence official vowed last week that the United States would avenge the attack. CNN's Nic Robertson and Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.","Dec. 30 blast at a U.S. base in Khost, in southeastern Afghanistan, killed 7 CIA operatives, one Jordanian .

"(CNN) -- As Ashton Kutcher becomes the first to collect 1 million followers on Twitter and Oprah Winfrey sends out her first tweet, tech observers are debating: Does Friday mark a new peak for the microblogging service? Or the beginning of its demise? Ashton Kutcher told Larry King Friday that the battle was about proving one person can have a voice. Some bloggers and Twitter users have expressed concern that the once-cultish site is being overwhelmed by celebrities and media hype, while others are excited by Twitter's ever-growing reach. ""It's a big milestone. This brings Twitter mainstream,"" said Andrew Cherwenka, a Huffington Post contributor and Web developer at Trapeze.com, referring to Kutcher and Winfrey's Twitter breakthroughs. ""A lot of people are saying this is going to be the death of Twitter, and I don't understand that at all,"" Cherwenka added. ""It's just another stage in Twitter's acceleration."" ""The challenge for Twitter -- besides, of course, getting a business model in place to handle the infrastructure required to sustain this kind of growth -- is going to be maintaining the fact that it's the community at large, not the celebrity users, that's at the core of this service,"" said Caroline McCarthy, who writes a CNET News blog about social media. ""The power of Twitter is about the millions of people using it and how easily it is to filter and aggregate their thoughts and conversations,"" McCarthy told CNN. ""It can't be all about Ashton and Oprah."" In the much-publicized duel, Kutcher's Twitter account crossed the 1 million mark on Twitter about 2:13 a.m. ET Friday, narrowly beating CNN's breaking-news feed, which had 998,239 followers at the time. CNN passed the mark at 2:42 a.m. ET. On Friday, Kutcher went on ""Larry King Live"" to talk about the battle and why he felt the duel was so important. ""We now live in an age in media that a single voice can have as much power and relevance on the Web, that is, as an entire media network,"" he said. ""And I think that to me was shocking.""  Watch Kutcher discuss reaching one million milestone » . Early Friday Winfrey sent her first tweet from the Chicago, Illinois, set of her TV show. The all-caps message was sent at 10:10 a.m. ET and said, ""HI TWITTERS. THANK YOU FOR A WARM WELCOME. FEELING REALLY 21st CENTURY."" Winfrey drew more than 73,000 Twitter followers before she sent out her first tweet. By Friday afternoon her Twitter following had climbed above 100,000. ""Twitter has experienced watershed events over the last two years since we founded the company, and momentum continues to build,"" Twitter co-founder Biz Stone said Friday in an e-mail to CNN. ""Certainly having Oprah and Ashton embrace Twitter so enthusiastically will be another big moment for us."" But Kutcher also acknowledged on ""Larry King Live"" Friday that while he was able to get so many followers because he is well-known, he was trying to show that anyone can have a voice and let their story be told. ""I think it's really important that Twitter is not about celebrities. It's not a platform for celebrities,"" he said. ""In all these interviews and things, it's been celebrity -- you know, people know have been on TV. It's really about everyday people having a voice. And I don't want it to be dwarfed by celebrity."" Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who joined Twitter and threw his support behind Kutcher, told Larry King that he views Twitter as an important medium for him to share who he ""really"" is, and give fans a direct line of communication to him. ""It's a chance for people to know the real me,"" he said. ""Due to my own fault there's such a persona of the Hamptons and the bling-bling and the ""Forbes"" list and who I'm dating. There's more substance to me than that. Over time I've just wanted to make sure that that has gotten out."" Kutcher told Larry King that initially, Twitter was a tool to feed his ego until he realized that he could use the service to make a difference. ""At the end of the day, we all have ego, we all have some level of ego,"" he said. ""But if we can use our ego to actually create good charitable things in the world in some way, and use our ego -- originally, I defined Twitter as an ego stream when I first saw it. But then what I realized is if we can transform that into something that's positive that can actually effectively change the world, that can be a really valuable tool."" Kutcher had challenged CNN to the Twitter race, saying he would donate 10,000 mosquito bed nets to charity for World Malaria Day in late April if he beat CNN, and 1,000 if he lost. CNN agreed to do the same. The battle between @aplusk, Kutcher's Twitter handle, and CNN's feed gained much attention on Twitter, with fans pulling for both sides. Web junkies watched Kutcher on a live video stream as he celebrated with champagne, surrounded by his wife, Demi Moore, and friends. ""We are over a million. CNN is still trying to get there. And that is just how it goes,"" Kutcher told the camera as his friends screamed. ""There are a million people that need to be thanked for this.""  See Kutcher celebrate his milestone » . No single Twitter account had previously reached 1 million followers, according to two Web sites that track popularity on Twitter, a site on which users post 140-character messages that are distributed to groups of followers. ""Kudos to Ashton and all those in the @aplusk camp. Now more than ever, the consumer is in the driver's seat and we couldn't be more gratified than to be part of this historic social media milestone,"" said CNN spokeswoman Jennifer Martin. CNN maintains more than 40 official Twitter accounts, with a total of more than 1.5 million followers. Kutcher was racing the network's breaking-news feed, @cnnbrk. That account provides only brief updates about breaking news, therefore CNN doesn't send a lot of alerts -- just those for major events the network believes its audience will want to know. ""We'd like to thank every one of our followers for helping CNN reach the 1 million mark, and we are delighted to raise our donation to 10,000 bed nets for World Malaria Day in recognition of them,"" Martin said. Not to be outdone, Winfrey said in a tweet Friday morning that she would donate 20,000 mosquito bed nets to charity. ""American Idol"" host Ryan Seacrest, another popular Twitter user, also agreed Friday to make a donation of mosquito bed nets, which help prevent the biting insects from spreading malaria in tropical countries. ""Ashton's 'Twitter race' is an amazing example of how we can leverage new technology to battle an ancient disease,"" said Scott Case, CEO of Malaria No More, the charity expected to benefit most from the mosquito bed net donations. ""Not only is Ashton helping Malaria No More raise awareness ... he's also galvanizing his Twitter army to help end malaria deaths."" The online feud between CNN and Kutcher also drew attention to the popularity of Twitter, which has seen breakneck growth over the past year. Twitter saw 131 percent growth in March alone, with 9.3 million unique U.S. visitors that month, according to comScore. The group attributes the increase to media attention on the site. Cherwenka, the Huffington Post blogger, believes Kutcher may be one of the first people to leverage the power of online social networking for widespread social good. ""It's a turning point in media. He's one person who uses a free media platform to reach a large audience. And that really hasn't been done before,"" Cherwenka said. ""He didn't spend a penny on this. And that's kind of the point of any kind of social activity on the Web."" But will all this celebrity-driven hype turn off longtime Twitter users? Time will tell, observers say. ""I know some Twitter early adopters and loyalists are feeling a bit ambivalent about this influx of mainstream attention, and are likening it to when their favorite indie band gets big overnight,"" said CNET's McCarthy. ""They're excited to see this service really take off, but at the same time are concerned that it's turning into a sort of novelty fad."" CNN.com's Brandon Griggs and John D. Sutter contributed to this report.","NEW: Ashton Kutcher: ""It's really about everyday people having a voice""

"(CNN) -- One of two wildfires burning in Oklahoma City on Wednesday pushed north toward suburban Edmond, illuminating the windy night sky with spirals of flame and flying embers. The fire broke out Tuesday in the less densely populated northeast Oklahoma City and was moving in a northerly direction toward more largely residential, Edmond Fire Chief Tim Wheeler said. ""The winds have shifted a bit,"" Wheeler said. ""It's current path it's going to travel through a heavily wooded area, which will allow the fire to grow in intensity."" He said it is hoped the fire can be stopped before it crosses Interstate 44 to the southeast of Edmond, but the department had already initiated its Code Red system, which autodials residents' telephone numbers encouraging them to evacuate. About 380 residents were affected by the initial evacuation call, he said. ""It's real difficult to fight a fire like this when it gets to all those trees,"" Wheeler said. ""We can't get our rigs in."" He said that firefighters were getting support during the day from Oklahoma National Guard helicopters equipped with water buckets, ""but now that it's dark, it's up to the crews on the ground."" The northeast fire had claimed about 15 square miles since it broke out on Tuesday. Live aerial images from CNN Oklahoma City affiliate KOCO Wednesday night showed brilliant columns of flame bursting through tree canopies and threatening homes in a residential area. Oklahoma City Fire Chief Keith Bryant said firefighters had ""pretty much"" contained the northeast fire on Wednesday before winds freshened and caused it to flare up anew. Meanwhile, a fire that started Wednesday afternoon in the southeast side of the city had destroyed two structures and caused some evacuations, he said. Bryant said that fire covered an area 1.5 miles long and a mile wide. KOCO reported that the evacuations from the southeast section covered a square-mile area. The fires forced closure of a 40-mile section of Interstate 44 between the capital city and Tulsa, according to Jack Damrill, a spokesperson with the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority. Bryant said that in the case of both fires, the evacuations have been targeted because the areas are not densely populated. He said the department's resources have been stretched thin trying to fight the fires amid the high winds and tinder-dry conditions. Like neighboring Texas, nearly all of Oklahoma is suffering from a severe drought, with two-thirds under the most severe category, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.","NEW: Fire moves north, threatening northern suburban city of Edmond .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- For 42 years, Moammar Gadhafi ruled Libya with an iron fist, a mercurial leader who inspired fear in Libya and beyond. Now he's on the run, hunted by rebels who made a lightning advance into Tripoli. The rebels overran Gadhafi's compound and are scouring the country for signs of the leader, who has not been seen in public for weeks. On Thursday, a radio station aired a defiant message, purportedly from Gadhafi, but most other signs point to the end of Gadhafi's long rule. The 69-year-old strongman came to power in a bloodless coup against King Idris in 1969, when he was just an army captain. By the end of his rule, he claimed to be ""King of Kings,"" a title he had a gathering of tribal leaders grant him in 2008. The fighting that dislodged Gadhafi started with anti-government demonstrations in February and escalated into a nationwide civil war.  The protests started days after the fall of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, whom Gadhafi had supported.  That month, Gadhafi vowed to never leave Libya and to ""die as a martyr at the end."" For months, rebel fighters -- in control of the eastern city of Benghazi and other areas -- had been trying to move closer toward Tripoli, in the west.  Recent advances allowed them to cut off some key supply routes for Gadhafi, bringing them closest yet to their goal, and by August 21, they had broken through into the capital. The following morning, raucous rebel supporters packed the city's Green Square, the same place where the longtime leader's supporters had gathered for months to voice their loyalty.  By Tuesday evening, Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound was being ransacked. When Gadhafi assumed power, he fashioned himself as an Arab nationalist. The United States tried to work with him at first, but quickly found out that his brand of nationalism included opposition to the West. By 1972 he was urging Muslims to fight Western powers, including the United States and Great Britain, and backing black militants in the United States as he pursued a leadership position in the Arab world. His ""Green Book,"" first published in 1975, envisioned a radically simple system of ""People's Conferences"" that would replace political structures from tribes to parliaments. Arab leaders largely shunned him, seeing him more as a ""buffoon"" and a ""clown"" than a potential pan-Arab leader, said Dirk J. Vandewalle, a Libya expert at Dartmouth University. That rejection from Arab and African leaders, combined with his growing anti-Western sentiment, left him to turn to terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s, Vandewalle said. In 1986, Libya was implicated in the fatal bombing at a West Berlin nightclub that left one American service member dead, prompting then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan to dub the Libyan leader the ""mad dog of the Middle East."" Reagan ordered the United States to bomb Libya and imposed economic sanctions against the North African country. Two years later, Libya was implicated in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland. Years later, Gadhafi appeared to moderate and seek rapprochement with the West. In 1999, he turned over suspects in the Lockerbie bombing, and in 2003 the country agreed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. In the years before the current rebellion started, Gadhafi even hired a public relations firm to burnish his global image as a statesman and a reformer. Starting in 2006, the leader spent about $3 million a year to execute a public relations strategy that included paying think-tank analysts and former government officials to take a free trip to Libya for lectures, discussions and personal meetings with Gadhafi. In 2009, he addressed the U.N. General Assembly for the first and only time. In his 96-minute ramble, he denounced the Security Council as a ""terror council,"" suggested the H1N1 swine-flu virus was a military tool and called for renewed investigations into the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. Earlier this year, as people around the Middle East and North Africa began to challenge their leaders in the so-called Arab Spring movement, Gadhafi found himself a target.  But while longtime Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was ousted after a few weeks, and even after the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi fell to the rebels, Gadhafi fought on and blamed outsiders, ""armed gangs"" and others for the violence. In the end, the Libyan leader sealed his reputation with his crackdown on protesters and attacks against rebels and civilians alike. Recently, international leaders accused Gadhafi's regime of committing human rights violations and killing civilians.  The U.N. Security Council subsequently issued a no-fly zone over Libya and approved ""all necessary measures"" short of invasion to protect civilians.  Officials in the Gadhafi regime, in turn, repeatedly accused NATO of killing civilians in airstrikes. In April, Gadhafi wrote a letter to U.S. President Barack Obama, urging him to end the NATO bombing of his war-torn country. Gadhafi asked Obama to stop what he called the ""unjust war against a small people of a developing country,"" adding that those in the opposition are terrorists and members of al Qaeda. The NATO operations continued, however. In June, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Gadhafi, his son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi.  The warrants are ""for crimes against humanity,"" including murder and persecution, ""allegedly committed across Libya"" from February 15 through ""at least"" February 28, ""through the state apparatus and security forces,"" the court said in a statement. CNN's Mike Pearson, Greg Botelho and Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.","Moammar Gadhafi came into a power in a bloodless coup against King Idris in 1969 .

"Oranjestad, Aruba (CNN) -- An Aruban magistrate ruled Wednesday that a Maryland man, detained in connection with the disappearance of an American woman, will remain in custody for another 60 days. A detainment hearing was held Wednesday morning for Gary Giordano, 50. Giordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner, 35, also of Maryland, was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. The magistrate's brief order did not elaborate on the decision beyond saying the suspect, identified by his initials of G.V.G., was ""suspected of involvement in the possible drowning of the American woman,"" and that the custody extension ""was done on request of the Prosecutor's Office."" On August 15, a judge ruled that there was enough evidence to keep Giordano detained for another 16 days as police continued to investigate the death. The missing woman and the suspect arrived on the island July 31 from the United States, according to Aruban prosecutors. Giordano, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, told authorities that he was snorkeling with Gardner and signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, he allegedly said. According to a transcript of a police interview, obtained by CNN, Giordano told police that he feared for his life when he signaled for Gardner to turn back and didn't look for her as he swam for shore. ""I only looked back when I hit a rock,"" the document quotes Giordano as telling investigators. ""Before that, I did not look back. I was only busy saving my life."" Gardner has not been found, although search efforts are ongoing. Giordano also told authorities that he is the beneficiary of a $1.5 million accidental death insurance policy tied to Gardner, a local official told CNN. CNN's Martin Savidge contributed to this report.","NEW: A magistrate rules that authorities can hold Gary Giordano for another 60 days .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A former motor-racing engineer has unveiled a prototype of a new hydrogen-powered city car which claims to emit less than one third of the carbon emissions produced by its nearest rival. The Riversimple Urban Car has been nine years in the making and needs further funding for city trials. The creators of the 'Urban Car,' UK-based company Riversimple, say the vehicle emits less than 30 grams per kilometer of carbon dioxide, less than one third of the carbon produced by the Polo Bluemotion. Riversimple founder Hugo Spowers has spent nine years researching and developing the prototype car. ""I think that the auto industry is focusing a lot of money on research and development at a basic science level on hydrogen storage and fuel cell technology. We don't think it's necessary to do that,"" Spowers told CNN. ""We can use existing technology and integrate it into a whole system design approach -- that is where the breakthrough has come."" Spowers is searching for extra funding to put the 'Urban Car' on the streets, but he says at this stage they won't be for sale. Riversimple plans to lease the car to customers for a monthly fee of £200 ($330). Hydrogen fuel for the cars will cost just 15 pence (25 cents) per mile. It's a long way from the fuel-guzzling world Spowers used to inhabit as a designer and developer of high-powered racing cars. It was the industry's appalling environmental record that encouraged him to leave to try to find a way to make driving greener. ""Certainly the first five or six years were hard work because I did have an awful lot of people telling me I was mad,"" Spowers told CNN, at the launch of the Riversimple Urban Car in London. ""Gradually it all sort of gathered steam,"" he said, adding ""I'm absolutely convinced that we're offering a better solution for a segment of the transport problem and we'd be crazy not to pursue it."" The Urban Car's power comes from hydrogen fuel cells which are linked to four electric motors situated over each of the car's wheels. Almost all of the braking is done by the electric motors, which then capture the energy of the car in motion and store it in a bank of ultracapacitors. In conventional cars, the energy generated through braking is lost as heat. The energy stored in the Urban Car's electric motors is enough to power 80 percent of the car's acceleration. That reduces the energy demands on the hydrogen fuel cell, meaning it can be one fifth of the size of one used in a normal car. The lighter fuel cell also makes it more energy efficient. A large part of the funding for the car's development came from the family of Ernst Piëch, the eldest grandson of Ferdinand Porsche who founded the motor company of the same name in 1931. Ferdinand Porsche's great-grandson Sebastien Piëch is a partner in Riversimple. He says the company's nimble size has given it an advantage over larger car manufacturers whose future he says concerns him. ""It concerns me massively, because I don't see that the model they have now is very relevant to where consumers are going. Consumers are looking for a different solution. I'm not sure if what they're producing is working,"" he said. Riversimple plans to share the designs for its car through open-source licence agreements, a system more commonly used in the software industry. Designers and manufacturers will be invited to make improvements so the car evolves into the most efficient vehicle it can be. ""We don't believe that making money on IP (intellectual property) is really what's actually happening even now. We believe that service and providing the solution for customers will be where we make money,"" Piëch told CNN. The next step now is to find further financing, another £20 million ($33 million), to build and test ten cars. Fifty prototypes will then be built for a pilot project in a small city. The location is still to be confirmed, but Riversimple has narrowed down its options to small towns in the United Kingdom, perhaps Oxford or Peterborough. ""I'm very confident we'll get it to market,"" Spowers said. ""I couldn't say hand on heart that I'm confident that we'll achieve what I think technically can be done. That's a bit in the lap of the gods and it's all to do with people, politics and business -- all a bit more unpredictable.""","Riversimple launches car prototype with lowest level of carbon emissions .

"Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- A series of explosions that killed 15 people when they erupted Thursday morning in a cafe in the city of Marrakech was an act of terrorism, Morocco's interior minister said. ""We will investigate this act of terrorism and find those responsible ... and their nationality,"" Taib Cherqaoui told reporters about the attack, in which at least 22 others were wounded. ""We condemn it as a criminal act."" In an address on state-run television, Cherqaoui and King Mohamed VI said the fatalities included six French nationals, five Moroccans, and four others whose nationalities were not divulged. CNN has learned that, of the four remaining fatalities, two were Russian and one was British. The incident occurred around 11 a.m. at Cafe Argana in Marrakech's old city, which is designated by the United Nation's cultural arm as a World Heritage Site. Tourists flock to it in high numbers this time of the year and it is usually packed with stalls, story-tellers and snake-charmers. World leaders moved quickly to condemn the incident. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was ""appalled,"" according to a statement from his office. ""He reiterates his firm rejection of the use of indiscriminate violence against innocent civilians and maintains that no political objective justifies or is served by such heinous acts."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States ""condemns in the strongest terms today's terrorist attack,"" adding, ""Acts of terrorism must not be tolerated wherever and whenever they occur."" French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe condemned what he called a ""barbarian terrorist attack, which nothing can justify."" ""Such an awful act can only bring indignation and unreserved condemnation. All light must be shed on this revolting crime, officials prosecuted, tried and punished,"" said Juppe, who said French authorities will provide assistance to French nationals in Marrakech. ""We were walking around the souks, right around the corner from Cafe Argana,"" said a German tourist who was about 50 meters from the blast when it occurred. ""We heard a gigantic boom, and everyone immediately starting running towards the square to see what happened."" The woman, who didn't want her name used, told CNN the top floor and terrace of the cafe were ""ripped apart"" by the blast, which caused hundreds of people to run from the area. It was not immediately known whether the attack was linked to unrest across the Arab world or militant activity, although there have been protests in Morocco lately. The blast comes four days after thousands of Moroccans held a peaceful demonstration nationwide, calling Sunday for a radical overhaul of the country's governance before a new constitution is unveiled in June by King Mohammed VI. The march was organized by the Facebook youth movement Fevrier 20. The group said its members would not accept the draft constitution because it was written by the king's own people. It denounced his decision to refer the new constitution to a committee he appointed. King Mohammed announced last month he would give up some of his wide-scale powers and make the judiciary independent -- the latter a particularly hot subject in Morocco. Calls for an end to political detention and questions about the king's personal business activities were also on protesters' banners. There was visible resentment at the royal family's business operations, controlled by its holding company SNI. There were also groups protesting about the prices of basic household items. Since the Casablanca attacks of 2003, in which 33 bystanders and 12 suicide bombers were killed, the Moroccan government has impressed international officials for breaking up Islamic terrorist cells. For example, the Madrid train bombings in 2004, in which 191 people died, were assisted by a Moroccan group of terrorists -- 19 of whom are serving sentences in Moroccan prisons.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-2 at the Camp Nou on Wednesday to claim the Spanish Super Cup in an ill-tempered El Clasico clash. Lionel Messi's volley two minutes from time secured a 5-4 aggregate triumph for Josep Guardiola's side, after French striker Karim Benzema's goal in the 82nd minute looked to have forced the Spanish season's traditional curtain-raiser into extra-time. Tempers flared in injury time when Brazilian full-back Marcelo's dismissal for a lunging tackle on Barca debutant Cesc Fabregas sparked a mass brawl between the two sets of players. Barca's Spain striker David Villa and Real's Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil were red-carded for their involvement in the melee, despite both players having already been substituted. Real coach Jose Mourinho also became involved when he was seen to poke the eye of Guardiola's assistant Tito Vilanova. Recent matches between the two teams have seen similar scenes, with five clashes between the archrivals last season resulting in five red cards. Having drawn Sunday's first leg 2-2 at the Bernabeu, European champions Barca went ahead in the tie when Andres Iniesta latched onto a through ball from FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Messi and clipped a finish over Iker Casillas in the Real goal. Copa del Rey winners Real equalized five minutes later, when Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo prodded Benzema's low cross into the back of the net. Barca regained the lead on the brink of half-time, when Messi found the net following a neat back-heel from center-back Gerard Pique. Benzema scored a second equalizer for Real before Messi's late strike stole glory for Barca, but Mourinho was happy with what he saw from his charges. ""Real Madrid gave a spectacular performance from the first to the last minute,"" Mourinho told the nine-time European champion's web site. ""I just say what I think. We came here to play. Former Inter coach Mourinho stopped short of criticizing the referee for sending off two of his players, but the 48-year-old did appear to suggest Barca's players had made the most of the fouls which were committed. ""The referee must punish what he deems punishable,"" he said. ""Pepe and Marcelo played a great game, one for the entire 90 minutes and the other for 45. Pepe saw a booking for a minor tackle and Marcelo gave a great performance. ""I'm not going to say we're happy because we didn't win the Spanish Super Cup; that would be hypocritical of me. We intend to play like men and not fall on the ground at the slightest touch."" Guardiola has now won 11 major honors since becoming Barca coach in 2008 and the former club captain was delighted with his team's performance. ""What will stay with me is the inhuman effort of the players,"" he said. ""They responded like the players they are: eternal, mythical, unrepeatable, honest, who like to train and play football. ""Truthfully, seeing the way they responded, it's a privilege and honor to be their manager.""","Barcelona have won the Spanish Super Cup after a 5-4 aggregate win over Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- The Security Council of the Republic of South Sudan on Wednesday ordered troops deployed to restore security and prevent retaliatory attacks after violent clashes in the past week. The caretaker minister of interior, Gen. Gier Chuang Aluong, said that Sudan People's Liberation Army troops would be rapidly deployed to the states of Jonglei in the east and Warrap in the north-central part of the country, which became independent on July 9. In the wake of clashes August 18 between the Murle and Lou Nuer communities that left at least 600 people dead, 200 abducted and at least 26,000 cattle stolen, the caretaker minister for information and broadcasting, Barnaba Marial Benjamin, condemned ""such mindless violence that has left so many innocent men, women and children dead or injured, their homes and livelihoods in ruin."" An assessment mission dispatched to Jonglei on Monday confirmed more than 330 buried dead and close to 200 injured. According to Lise Grande, a U.N. humanitarian coordinator in South Sudan, the team identified more than 250 unaccompanied minors and estimated that 26,800 people became displaced. ""It is possible that many more bodies remain unburied in the bush,"" Grande said. ""During yesterday's flyover, the assessment team saw two villages that appeared to be torched to the ground."" Since February this year, a series of clashes between the Lou Nuer and Murle communities has resulted in the loss of more than 1,000 lives, the humanitarian coordinator said Wednesday. Humanitarian assistance has been hindered by the unrest. A warehouse stocked with food from the United Nations' World Food Programme has been looted, and a Medecins Sans Frontieres-supported clinic was partially destroyed, Grande said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Monday called on the government of South Sudan to restore security in Jonglei, protect civilians affected by violence and work with both communities to reduce tensions.","At least 600 people killed in clashes between Murle and Lou Nuer tribes .

"Quito, Ecuador (CNN) -- A judge in Ecuador ruled Wednesday that the directors and former opinion editor of El Universo newspaper must each serve three years in prison for an opinion article about President Rafael Correa, state media reported. The judge also ruled that the accused must pay $30 million, and the newspaper must pay $10 million, to Correa, the state-run El Ciudadano government information website reported. The case drew international attention from press-freedom advocates, who say Correa aims to crack down on critics by restricting the media. Correa filed a libel lawsuit after El Universo published a column in February by the newspaper's then-opinion editor, titled, ""No to lies."" Correa argued that the article, which referred to him as a dictator, unjustly claimed he had ordered security forces to open fire at a hospital full of civilians last September. Correa said Tuesday that the article's assertions were untrue, baseless and ""an outrage,"" according to the state-run El Ciudadano government information website. The president told reporters that he hoped the case would set a precedent. A headline on El Ciudadano's website Wednesday said the ruling was a ""symbol of the fight for true freedom of expression."" Alembert Vera, Correa's lawyer, praised the judge's decision. ""We have defended the right to honor, the right to dignity and any person who has felt offended or humiliated by the publication of false information,"" Vera said, according to El Ciudadano. But the column's author told CNN en Español in an exclusive interview Wednesday that Correa and others had misinterpreted his meaning. Emilio Palacio, El Universo's former opinion editor, said he was not accusing the president of ordering an attack on innocent civilians, but instead saying that a future president who is an enemy of Correa could make such an accusation. Palacio said he planned to appeal the judge's ruling, arguing that he was not given an opportunity to present evidence in court. ""We are living in a country where one cannot say what is going on without facing the penalty of going to prison,"" he said. Palacio resigned from his post at El Universo last week, saying he was innocent but wanted the lawsuit to end. On Wednesday, he said Correa was trying to break him and his former colleagues. ""For what? To fill his pockets and impose a totalitarian regime. This is what the dictator Rafael Correa is trying to do,"" he said. In a statement posted on its website, El Universo decried the ruling as ""a violation against the universal principle of freedom of expression"" and vowed to appeal. ""El Universo newspapers rejects this 80-page sentence, delivered in record time (less than 24 hours), by a judge said that he had worked until 5 a.m. to absorb details of the case, which has moved quickly through the hands of five distinct judges in four months,"" the statement said. Pedro Valverde, an attorney representing El Universo, told CNN en Español Tuesday that the newspaper was not given an opportunity to fully present its side. He argued that the publication's policies indicate that its directors have no influence on the content of its columns. On Tuesday, the newspaper's directors offered to print a correction, but Correa said it was too late. ""The moment of gentlemen, of people who have ethics, has already passed,"" he told reporters. Press-freedom advocates have criticized the case and other recent efforts to regulate media in Ecuador. In a statement Tuesday, the Inter American Press Association criticized ""the ongoing harassment of the Ecuador's independent press through excessive and disproportionate legal suits by President Rafael Correa."" The Committee to Protect Journalists also weighed in on the libel lawsuit shortly after Correa filed it. ""Ecuador's outdated criminal defamation provisions have been systematically used to punish critical journalists,"" the New York-based organization said in a March statement. Palacio pledged Wednesday to keep writing, but urged others to take action. ""The independent press fought as far as it could. Now it is the citizens' turn, united, mobilizing in the streets,"" he wrote in a post on his Twitter account. CNN en Español's Fernando del Rincon contributed to this report.","NEW: The column's author says Correa misunderstood his meaning .

"New York (CNN) -- Christopher Coke, an international drug kingpin whose arrest and extradition to the United States was preceded by a horrific gun battle in Jamaica that left dozens of civilians dead, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to racketeering and assault charges. Coke, who had pleaded not guilty to the charges after his extradition last year, faces a maximum sentence of 23 years in prison with a maximum fine of $500,000 for two charges of racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit assault in aid of racketeering, according to the release. Coke, 42, ran a Jamaica-based criminal organization called the Presidential Click, or Shower Posse, which had trafficked illegal weapons and drugs into New York and Miami, and to other Jamaica-area leaders, since the early 1990s, according to a release by prosecuting District Attorney Preet Bharara for the Southern District of New York. ""For nearly two decades, Christopher Coke led a ruthless criminal enterprise that used fear, force and intimidation to support its drug and arms trafficking 'businesses,'"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of Manhattan said at Wednesday's hearing, according to the release. ""Today's plea is a welcome conclusion to this ugly chapter of criminal history,"" Bharara added. Lead defense attorney Frank Doddato described Coke as ""stoical"" during his court appearance. Doddato said his client has continually expressed remorse. Coke's group of Presidential Click members trafficked in narcotics, including marijuana, cocaine and crack cocaine, under Coke's direction, according to the formal charges Bharara presented at court. Coke also was charged with overseeing the purchase and distribution of firearms among Presidential Click members. Proceeds from drug sales were sent to Coke in Jamaica, in the form of cash and/or goods, according to the charges. These included ""'tribute' payments, in recognition of his leaderships and his assistance,"" which could come in the form of clothing and electronics. In May 2010, a failed attempt to arrest Coke in Kingston, Jamaica's capital, sparked gun battles between security forces and his supporters that ended with 76 people dead, 73 of them civilians. Jamaican police apprehended Coke, who was wearing a woman's wig, at a checkpoint. He was extradited to the United States in June 2010, and pleaded not guilty . Following his extradition, Coke, who also had among his aliases ""Duddus,"" ""Shortman,"" ""Presi"" and ""General,"" responded said he was ""deeply upset and saddened by the unnecessary loss of lives"" in the Kingston shootout, and said the bloodshed ""could have been avoided."" ""Everyone, the whole country, has been adversely affected by the process that has surrounded my extradition and I hope that my action today will go some way towards healing all who have suffered and will be of benefit to the community of Tivoli Gardens"" -- a neighborhood where the violence erupted. During Wednesday's guilty plea, Doddato said the Kingston shootout was one of the reasons Coke surrendered.\ . Coke's sentencing is scheduled for December 8, according to the district attorney's release.","Christopher Coke pleas guilty to two charges in racketeering and assault .

"(CNN) -- World number one Caroline Wozniacki made a shock exit from the Rogers Cup in Toronto after losing her second round match to Roberta Vinci 6-4 7-5 Wednesday night. Defending champion Wozniacki looked set to force the match into a third and deciding set after building a 5-1 lead in the second, but her Italian opponent rallied to clinch her first victory against a top-five ranked player. ""I thought I could win today,"" Vinci, 28, told the WTA Tour's official web site. ""I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I thought I could. ""I saw she was making a lot of mistakes, especially in the first set; then in the second set I was just focusing on every point when I was down, trying to stay aggressive and hit some slice to her forehand when possible."" Wozniacki first rose to the top of the rankings in October 2010, but the Dane has yet to capture a grand slam title and admitted world number 22 Vinci had outplayed her on Wednesday. ""Today was definitely not my best match,"" said Wozniacki. ""It was very difficult with the wind but also the way Vinci was playing, I didn't get a chance to really get any rhythm."" ""She slices the ball. It's tough to get under it, and then she really goes for it on the forehand. She was getting a lot of balls back, as well. She did better than me."" Vinci will come up against Serb Ana Ivanovic in the third round, after the 23-year-old's second round opponent Iveta Benesova was forced to retire in the third set of their encounter. Sixth seed and French Open champion Li Na also benefited from a withdrawal, with Peng Shuai unable to compete due to a hip injury. Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova battled back from 3-1 down in the first set to clinch her match with Anabel Medina Garrigues 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 and Serena Williams' winning streak is up to seven matches after the American beat Germany's Julia Goerges 6-1 7-6 (9-7). Williams, 29, will now face Zheng Jie, who benefitted from second seed Kim Clijsters' retirement on Tuesday.

"Rye, New York (CNN) -- What was meant to be a celebration marking the end of Ramadan turned into a melee at an amusement park on Tuesday when a group of Muslim women were told they weren't allowed on certain rides with their headscarves. Rye Playland was full of visitors celebrating Eid al-Fitr when the festive mood turned angry. Westchester County Police said the women wearing the hijab, a traditional Muslim headscarf, became argumentative when park employees enforced the no-headgear policy and men sprang to their defense. ""(The rule) didn't get relayed to the people who attended, so some people got upset,"" said Westchester County Police Capt. Thomas Gleason. Fifteen people were arrested and two charged with felony assault after two park rangers sustained minor injuries. Among those arrested were three women wearing the hijab. Police shut down the park for several hours during the incident. ""It had to do with headgear. People -- patrons -- are not allowed to wear headgear on rides for safety reasons,"" Gleason said. Zead Ramadan, spokesman for the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), said members of the Muslim American Society who had organized the outing asked him to come to the park to mediate. Ramadan said the women felt they had been targeted by park employees because of their religious views. ""They're the most obvious Muslims around because they have hijabs on. They felt they were discriminated against,"" Ramadan said. ""Maybe there was a level of frustration that went around across the board,"" Ramadan said. ""Then you have the parks people who are trying to explain this and do their job."" Ramadan said he saw a cell-phone video showing police ""yanking a hijabi-wearing woman out of the crowd."" ""She was very small. They turn her around and throw her down on the ground."" Ramadan said that's when the crowd got very angry. ""Nobody was assaulted prior to the police being called, and that in itself is a problem,"" Ramadan said. Gleason said he was aware ""there was some cell-phone footage and maybe some video,"" ""There's no official video that we have released at this time,"" he said. ""There are some videos in the park that we're retaining for our own information."" Gleason said he had seen seen ""bits and pieces"" of phone footage from the incident. He said park officials told the Muslim organizers about the headgear ban but that information wasn't relayed to the group of visitors. Ramadan chalked the whole incident up to ""miscommunication."" ""The women felt they were being targeted, but in fact these were safety precautions,"" he said. ""And maybe (the park) didn't do the best job in disclosing those precautions."" But Westchester County Parks Deputy Commissioner Peter Tartaglia says the policy was made abundantly clear to the group's organizer, and that the rules are clearly posted. ""We repeatedly told him, because we knew this group would have religious headgear,"" Tartaglia insisted adding that a refund booth was set up in case anyone objected to the policy, which he said is posted prominently in the park. ""There's a sign at every ride,"" Tartaglia said. ""When you enter the park, there's a height line and it lists headgear policy. ""What triggered the incident was fighting within the group and the subject was why they didn't know the policy,"" said Tartaglia, adding that he arrived at the scene about 20 minutes after the fight broke out. He said police were called when it appeared the altercation could lead to a riot. Ride safety precautions posted on its website include the following safety rule: . ""Hats must be secured, and jackets/sweaters must be worn properly and not around the waist while on a ride. Some rides do not allow backpacks, purses or head gear of any kind."" Rye Playland, also known as Playland Amusement Park, is located about 17 miles northeast of the Bronx in Westchester County.","Muslims were celebrating Eid al-Fitr; women were wearing the hijab .

"(CNN) -- Five-time winner Roger Federer opened his U.S. Open account Monday with a straight sets win over Santiago Giraldo in New York. Despite surrendering his serve three times, the 30-year-old Swiss enjoyed a relatively comfortable match against the Colombian, ranked 54 in the world, winning 6-4 6-3 6-2 on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court. Leading 5-1 in the opening set, a number of uncharacteristic errors from Federer saw him squander a double-break advantage before he finally rallied to win 6-4. The second and third sets were more straight-forward, though the world number three will be concerned about his winners-to-unforced errors ratio -- he finished with 36 winners and 35 unforced errors. ""It was quite up and down, getting used to the conditions,"" admitted Federer, in quotes carried by usopen.org.

"(CNN) -- Second seed Roger Federer won his first title of 2009 after stunning world number one and clay-court king Rafael Nadal in straight sets in front of his own fans in the final of the Madrid Masters on Sunday. Federer acknowledges the crowd after stunning Rafael Nadal in straight sets in the Madrid Masters final. Swiss ace Federer, who had won 57 career titles but was without a tournament victory since winning on home soil in Basle last October, took the honors 6-4 6-4 in one hour and 26 minutes. The win also ended a remarkable run of success on clay for world number one Nadal, who was unable to repeat his heroics from Saturday's epic semifinal against Novak Djokovic when he fought back from the brink to win a gruelling battle 3-6 7-6 7-6 in four hours and three minutes, saving three match points along the way. That victory over Djokovic was Nadal's 33rd successive win on clay stretching back over a year, while in total the Spanish superstar had won 150 of 154 matches on dirt since 2005. However, the emotion of that success was clear to see on Sunday and the Mallorca-born 22-year-old was no match for his old foe, as Federer took the game to his opponent to beat Nadal for only the second time in 10 meetings on clay and end his long wait for another title. Nadal, despite his epic match on Saturday, was quickly into his stride as he sought a sixth title this year and he created two break points on separate Federer service games early on. The Spanish ace failed to make the most of either of those chances though, and when Federer's first opportunity came along in the ninth game of the first set he was not so profligate. Nadal had fallen 0-30 behind on his serve but looked to have dug himself out of the hole, but Federer hit back again to take the game and moments later he was celebrating the set after holding serve to love. Nadal had lost just one of 41 sets on clay this year heading into his semifinal, but he suffered a second loss against Djokovic to go 1-0 down in Saturday's match and found himself in an identical situation on Sunday. He looked in determined mood in the second set though, holding his first two service games to love, but it would prove to be Federer who was first to break in the fifth game. The Swiss ace got the chance with a superb drop shot and when Nadal then saw his forehand shot go long, Federer had the break to go 3-2 ahead. Federer kept that advantage until the 10th game, when Nadal, with no room for error and staring defeat in the face, had his big chance to get back on terms when he created two break points. However, Federer saved both of those and although he missed his first championship point, he clinched the title with his sixth ace of the match. Earlier in the women's final, world number one Dinara Safina clinched her second title of the year after overcoming Danish teen sensation Caroline Wozniacki. Top seed Safina, following on from her success in Rome last week, was simply too good for ninth seed Wozniacki and powered her way to a 6-2 6-4 win.","Roger Federer stuns clay-court king Rafael Nadal in the Madrid Masters final .

"(CNN) -- The special court trying to bring the killers of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to justice published Wednesday previously secret details of the case against four men it has charged. Prosecutors assert that the ringleader of the group had earlier been sentenced to death in Kuwait over the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies there. The suspect, Mustafa Amine Badreddine, escaped from prison in 1990 when Saddam Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait, the tribunal says in the indictment. He and three other men were indicted by the United Nations-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon in June, and their identities and the charges against them were made public last month. But they remain at-large. The tribunal says it asked Lebanese authorities on June 30 to arrest Badreddine, Salim Jamil Ayyash, Hussein Hassan Oneissi and Assad Hassan Sabra. As of August 9, there had been no progress, the court said Wednesday. The four are accused of involvement in the bombing that ripped apart Hariri's armored car in Beirut on February 14, 2005. It destroyed his motorcade, killing him and 21 others, and injuring 231 people. Badreddine was the ringleader, prosecutors charge. Ayyash was the head of what they call the ""assassination team,"" and Oneissi and Sabra were involved in planting a false claim of responsibility in the media, prosecutors say. They add that all four are supporters of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group, and that Badreddine and Ayyash are related to one of its founders. In a speech, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the indictment contained ""no direct evidence"" against the men. ""The text (of the indictment) is based on circumstantial evidence whose credibility is contested,"" he said. ""This makes us more convinced that what is happening is highly unjust and politicized, and this is unfair to the suspects."" Investigators pieced together a timeline of the assassination plot dating back at least as far as November 11, 2004, based on cell phone data. They identified five networks of cell phones, including one they claim was used by the assassination team. Prosecutors label that the ""Red Network."" A ""Green Network"" was used by leaders of the operation, with the last call between phones in that group made about an hour before the blast. Prosecutors assume that that 14-second last call was final authorization for the attack to go ahead. The last call on the Red Network was made about five minutes before the explosion, prosecutors allege. Cell phone data suggests that Hariri had been under surveillance for at least 15 days before he was killed. It also places Ayyash in the location where the vehicle used in the bombing was bought, the indictment says. Prosecutors concede in the indictment that the charges are based heavily on circumstantial evidence, but they argue that such information ""can be stronger than direct evidence"" because it does not rely on things like potentially faulty witness accounts. Hariri's supporters say the businessman-turned-politician was killed because of his opposition to Syria's long-time military presence in his country, and his death led to popular protests, nicknamed the ""Cedar Revolution,"" that led Damascus to withdraw its troops. Syria has denied accusations that it was behind the bombing. The special tribunal's prosecutor welcomed the publishing of previously confidential parts of the indictment. Unsealing the indictment ""answers many questions about the 14 February 2005 attack,"" Daniel Bellemare said in a statement. ""The full story will however only unfold in the courtroom, where an open, public, fair and transparent trial will render a final verdict."" Judge Antonio Cassese, the president of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, last week publicly urged the suspects to cooperate. He said in an open letter to the four men that they will be treated fairly if they appear before the court or participate in the trial proceedings without being present. Cassese issued the statement after Lebanese authorities told him they had been unable to serve the accused warrants and arrest them. In Washington, the State Department lauded the process. ""This process is a means of ending the era of impunity for the terrible and tragic violence that has touched all of Lebanon's communities,"" the department said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Authorities have found what they believe to be the remains of Breeann Rodriguez, a 3-year-old Missouri girl whose neighbor told police he had suffocated the girl with a plastic bag and then tossed her from a highway. A Missouri State Highway Patrol officer found the remains Tuesday evening along a ditch northeast of Hornersville, Missouri, about 8 to 10 miles from the girl's home in Senath, said Dunklin County Prosecuting Attorney Stephen Sokoloff said. He said the remains are expected to be sent for forensic examination on Wednesday. In a statement, Dunklin County Sheriff Bob Holder thanked the community for its assistance. ""We are saddened to confirm our fears, but glad we are able to recover her remains for her parents,"" Holder said. Earlier Tuesday, 43-year-old Shawn Morgan of Senath appeared in court. He has been charged with first-degree murder in connection with Breeann's death. Breeann was last seen on August 6, riding her pink bicycle with her brother outside their home. Morgan does not yet have an attorney. The August 30 court appearance will be a counsel status hearing, the prosecutor's office said Tuesday. According to a probable cause affidavit dated Saturday, police interviewed Morgan on Friday at the police department in Kennett, a larger community about 10 miles northeast of Senath. The suspect said that he spotted the girl standing on a ladder by the pool in his backyard. He told police that he grabbed the girl and carried her inside his house. There, according to the affidavit, the man ""suffocated the girl with a white plastic trash bag, by holding it over her face and mouth. ""Morgan states that he felt like it took an hour for the girl to die,"" the document adds. It says Morgan told police he put the girl's body into the same trash bag, and then drove to Missouri's Highway 164 and got rid of the body by throwing it over a railing into a floodway ditch. After returning home, Morgan said, he then dismantled the girl's bike and dumped it into another, related waterway, the document says. A bicycle was recovered there and identified by Edgar Rodriguez as belonging to Breeann, his daughter. Police said last week that they had found two training wheels similar to those on the girl's bike. In addition to murder, Sokoloff said in a statement Saturday that Morgan is charged with armed criminal action and tampering with physical evidence. The suspect, who Sokoloff said has three children of his own, is being held at the Dunklin County Justice Center.

"(CNN) -- The debate over funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency continued Wednesday as federal officials traveled to New Jersey and New York to check on local recovery and response efforts after Hurricane Irene. The agency's disaster relief fund has less than $800 million remaining and could run out before the end of the current fiscal year on September 30. With conservative House Republicans, led by Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, calling for spending cuts to offset any increase in emergency funds -- a measure opposed by many Democrats -- the ability of Congress to act quickly on the issue remains uncertain. ""Right now, we're continuing our obligations to respond"" with rescue operations and meeting the immediate needs of storm survivors, FEMA administrator Craig Fugate said Wednesday. The only thing the agency has done, he said, is state that it won't be able to fund permanent work from disasters that has not yet been started. ""We are postponing the permanent work,"" he said. But search-and-rescue teams are on the ground, he said, and food and water is being handed out to those in need. ""This is a team effort,"" he said. ""... Americans help Americans in disasters. We're doing our job. We're working hard."" Mayor Jeffery Jones of Paterson, New Jersey, said he was ""outraged"" about the funding dispute. ""Mother Nature has a mind of her own, a will of her own, and we can't have the petty wrangling going on when we have folks in dire need,"" he said. Gov. Chris Christie echoed those sentiments during a news conference Wednesday, saying, ""We don't have time to wait for folks in Congress to figure out how they want to offset this stuff with the budget cuts. Our people are suffering now. And they need support now."" ""Nobody that got hit with this flooding dodged a bullet,"" Fugate said Wednesday. ""Loss of life, extensive damages, homes flooded. ... It may not have been as big a deal on the coast, but these flood areas definitely got hit hard."" Irene killed 43 people from Florida to New England as it marched up the Eastern Seaboard over the weekend, dumping torrential rain. Some of the worst flooding struck Vermont, New Jersey and upstate New York. More than 1.8 million customers remained without electricity Wednesday from North Carolina to Maine, the U.S. Department of Energy said -- a decrease from the 2.8 million reported Tuesday afternoon. Outage figures include more than 366,000 in Connecticut and 323,000 in New York. The Passaic River in northern New Jersey seemed to mock the town of Little Falls as the water surging through it looked more like Niagara Falls. ""Before Irene hit, the Passaic River was already running high from frequent precipitation this summer,"" Wheeler Antabanez of neighboring Montclair said.  ""When the hurricane blew through and dumped all that water on north Jersey, the river began to rage."" About 1,700 residents were evacuated from their homes in Wayne, Totowa, Little Falls, Paterson and Woodland Park, said Edward O'Connell, a spokesman for Passaic County's Office of Emergency Management. President Barack Obama will travel to Paterson on Sunday to view damage from Hurricane Irene, the White House announced. Rescues were still taking place Wednesday, Jones said. ""All it takes is someone to call and say they're under distress, and we and our boats are going out and taking people to safety,"" he said. City officials were opening schools and other facilities to serve as shelters, he said. ""It's been pretty much 24 hours a day,"" said Sgt. Alex Popov of the Paterson Police Department. Once floodwaters begin to recede, the next step will include going house to house and checking furnaces, hot water heaters and other appliances to reduce the risk of explosions when they are restarted, Jones said. Asked about those who did not heed an evacuation warning, Jones said, ""I don't think folks were aware -- nor were we aware -- that it could get this extreme."" Flood warnings remained in effect for portions of New Jersey on Wednesday, along with parts of North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Also Wednesday, Obama signed disaster declarations for New Jersey, North Carolina and New York. ""I think the conversation of hype is being hyped,"" Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Wednesday on the debate over whether Irene was overhyped. ""The reality is, the people of Connecticut are hurting. ... Although it's sunny outside, we're still experiencing the effects."" He said homes and infrastructure have been destroyed and the Connecticut River basin has experienced heavy flooding. Much of the damage is seen in the state's rural areas, he said. ""We have farms that are under water."" Consolidated Edison reported that it met its goal to restore power to nearly all New York City customers by Tuesday night, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement Wednesday. Work to restore power elsewhere was ongoing Wednesday. The full extent of Irene's destruction won't be known for some time. The federal government estimates that the cost from wind damage alone will exceed $1 billion. Analysts have put the total expected cost of Irene much higher. Vermont transportation officials were able to make emergency repairs on roads to all but one of about a dozen previously isolated towns, officials said. Air drops were being made to three towns. The National Guard is carrying supplies to other communities, said Mark Bosma, spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management. Because the repaired roads are intended for emergency and supply delivery traffic, residents will have to wait for more permanent repairs to resume their old driving habits. That is expected to take at least several weeks or months in some cases. ""We've transitioned into the recovery stage for the most part,"" Bosma said. ""The worst is over."" The Vermont Campground Association reported that only two of its seven member campgrounds suffered significant damage, and more than 70 campgrounds will be open for the coming Labor Day weekend. ""Some are cleaning up downed trees, but most are ready for visitors,"" said Peter Daniels, the association's executive director, in a prepared statement. Most roads leading to campgrounds are open, the association said. The two campgrounds that suffered extensive damage -- Camping on the Battenkill in Arlington and Abel Mountain Campground in Braintree -- remained closed. Storm cleanup efforts also were ongoing in the Bahamas on Wednesday, a week after Irene struck there. The National Emergency Management Agency was coordinating the shipment of goods to Rum Cay, Cat Island, Crooked Island and Acklins, according to Bahamas Information Services. A shipment of goods from Jamaica was received by Mayaguana on Saturday. Meanwhile, some of the areas that escaped Irene without major damage -- such as the state of Maryland -- still took a direct hit in the pocketbook. Maryland lost more than $2 million in direct revenue over the past weekend, including an estimated $1.75 million in sales tax revenue and $150,000 in withholding taxes due to the evacuation of Ocean City, according to Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot. Officials estimated a $60,000 loss in gas tax revenue because of canceled weekend trips, and a loss of roughly $45,000 in toll revenue from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Additionally, Ocean City lost nearly $40,000 of admissions and amusement tax revenue from its many attractions and events . But Franchot did not question the decision to evacuate the town. ""Given the disastrous impact of this storm on other parts of our country ... am profoundly grateful that Ocean City and the state of Maryland as a whole weathered this storm with minimal injury or loss of life,"" he said in a statement.

"Brad, Texas (CNN) -- Firefighters have made some progress in battling a spreading wildfire in northern Texas, but dry conditions contributed to a rash of new fires as well, officials said Thursday. The 101 Ranch Fire in Palo Pinto County had scorched 6,200 acres as of Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The blaze is burning on Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. However, ""we feel much better about this fire today"" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, spokesman for the forest service. Some evacuations were lifted, he said. The flames have destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are working on a re-entry strategy for residents, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer, and they are trying to get the lake open for the Labor Day holiday. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the flames. Tom Hardeston was among the residents watching helplessly. ""My house is right through here, though it may be gone,"" he told WFAA. Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire. ""I'm just moving them from pasture to pasture,"" Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock. ""As one pasture burns, I'm moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around."" The Forest Service responded on Wednesday to 17 new fires burning a total of 4,146 acres. The largest of those is the Hornets Tank Fire, which had burned 3,000 acres and was 40% contained Thursday. It was burning in Briscoe County near Palo Duro Canyon, the nation's second-largest canyon behind the Grand Canyon. In addition, the Legacy Fire had burned 3,400 acres in Howard County and was 10% contained Thursday, the Forest Service said. The blaze threatens numerous structures, but did not show much growth on Wednesday. The weather forecast continued to predict mostly dry weather for the area, with high temperatures from the mid-90s into the 100s, the Forest Service said. Texas is experiencing the worst fire season in state history. Since fire season began last November, a record 3.5 million acres have burned. Hot and dry weather combined with a historic drought have made conditions ripe for rapid fire growth. In the past seven days, the Forest Service has responded to 224 fires burning a combined 31,541 acres. Meanwhile, in neighboring Oklahoma, firefighters were battling hot spots Thursday from a wildfire in northeast Oklahoma City, Fire Chief Keith Bryant said. National Guard helicopters were assisting, Bryant said. The blaze was one of two large brush fires that had covered more than 16 square miles on the city's north and south sides Wednesday, forcing some evacuations and closure of Interstate 40 and the Turner Turnpike. Both roads were later reopened, CNN affiliate KOCO said. Thursday is ""day three of very poor fire conditions for us,"" said David Barnes, Oklahoma County Emergency Manager. Firefighters, including some from around the state, are ""kind of ragged,"" he said. Barnes did not have an estimate on how many homes were lost on the city's north side. On Tuesday, a dozen were lost in that blaze. Fighting the south side fire ""went very well for us,"" he said. Three or four barns were lost, he said, along with one mobile home and one abandoned home. The record-setting heat and drought plaguing Texas and Oklahoma -- as well as a heat wave experienced by other states -- result from abnormally strong high pressure over the Atlantic and Pacific. The high pressure keeps the jet stream, typically a source of cooler air and precipitation, to the north, while winds funnel hot, tropical air into the south-central United States, according to NASA, which released satellite data Wednesday showing the phenomenon during July. But the conditions persist, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. ""The ridge of high pressure aloft refuses to release its grip. There are some subtle signs that it may weaken into next week and allow a tropical system to move into"" southeastern Texas, he said. ""This would have the potential to bring some very significant and beneficial rains to that area. But it looks like Oklahoma is going to remain high and dry.""","The 101 Ranch Fire is 50% contained .

"(CNN) -- World number one Novak Djokovic could face Roger Federer in the semifinals of the U.S Open after the pair were grouped in the same side of the draw Thursday. Djokovic, the top seed, has lost only twice in 2011, and has already clinched the Australian Open and Wimbledon titles this season. He has been drawn to play a qualifier in round one. Switzerland's Federer, who has clinched glory at Flushing Meadows on five previous occasions, begins his campaign with a clash against Colombian Santiago Giraldo. Defending champion and second seed Rafael Nadal will face Andrey Golubev of Kazakhstan as the Spaniard goes in search of an 11th career major. Is Wozniacki feeling the weight of world number one? Nadal told the U.S. Open's official web site: ""I feel great. I am here, and I will try my best. Last year was a really emotional year for me. ""It was the tournament I didn't play my best in the past. Last year, I played one of my best matches in the final. I finally won."" British number one Andy Murray, defeated by Djokovic in January's Australian Open final, will come up against Somdev Devvarman of India. The top-ranked American in the draw is Mardy Fish, and the 29-year-old eighth seed will look to eliminate German Tobias Kamke in the opening round. The 2009 U.S. Open winner Juan Martin del Potro will go head-to-head with Italy's Filippo Volandri. In the women's draw, first seed Caroline Wozniacki will begin her latest attempt to capture a maiden grand slam crown against Spain's Nuria Llagostera Vives. Vera Zvonareva, ranked second in the world, has been drawn against a qualifier, while 2006 winner Maria Sharapova has been paired with Britain's Heather Watson. Li Na, winner of the French Open, will have to get the better of Romania's Simona Halep, while Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova is up against another Romanian Alexandra Dulghera.

"(CNN)  -- Two-time defending champion Kim Clijsters has pulled out of this year's U.S. Open with a stomach muscle injury. The 28-year-old Belgian suffered the injury at the Rogers Cup tournament in Toronto last week and told the official WTA website that she would not be able to recover in time for the final grand slam of the season which starts on August 29 in New York. ""Two weeks of rehab was not enough to heal this injury. Obviously I'm very disappointed,"" she said. ""I trained very hard this summer and felt in a good shape to play the U.S. Open."" Clijsters, the world number three, has suffered an injury-hit year since claiming the Australian Open title back in January, her fourth grand slam crown. She missed most of the clay court season and then Wimbledon with an ankle injury and was hoping for better luck as she chased a fourth triumph at Flushing Meadows where she won in 2005, 2009 and 2010. The injury will also affect her end of season campaign and she acknowledged that she will need careful rehabilitation. ""Now there is nothing else I can do than to rest and have treatment every day. ""If a gradual approach is not taken, I will relapse in the same injury, and therefore I have also no other possibility than to withdraw from the tournaments in Tokyo and Beijing."" Clijsters' withdrawal is likely to leave Serena Williams as a warm favorite to add to her grand slam tally, but the American was herself forced out of the latest WTA event in Cincinnati through injury, but it is not thought serious. Meanwhile, Wimbledon runner-up Maria Sharapova eased into the semifinals of the tournament in Ohio Friday with a straight-sets victory over Samantha Stosur. Fourth seed Sharapova beat the 10th-seeded Australian 6-3 6-2 and next faces second seed Vera Zvonareva of Russia, who battled past unseeded Slovakian Daniela Hantuchova 6-3 7-6. Ninth seed Andrea Petkovic also reached the semifinals with a 7-5 6-1 win over Nadia Petrova. Petkovic will face 13th seed Jelena Jankovic, who went through when Shuai Peng withdrew before the start of their match with a hip injury.","Kim Clijsters pulls out of U.S. Open with an abdominal injury .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- President Ali Abdullah Saleh plans to return to Yemen following the investigation into his attempted assassination, a government spokesman said. The announcement follows claims weeks ago by the Yemeni government it had completed the investigation, accusing two leading opposition figures of planning the June palace bombing that left Saleh with severe burns and shrapnel wounds. The Yemeni government switched gears Sunday, saying the investigation was nearly complete. Abdu Ganadi, the government spokesman, did not say when it would be finished nor whether those accused earlier were still considered suspects. ""I cannot give you a specific time of when President Saleh will arrive. But I can assure you that after the palace bombing investigation is over, the president will be back,"" Ganadi said. The Yemeni political crisis started January 16, when youth protesters took to the streets demanding Saleh's resignation. Fears of all-out civil war have spiked in recent months as government forces and people alleged to be Hashed tribesmen slugged it out in the capital. Saleh, who has been faced with widespread anti-government sentiment and militant activity, has been urged to accept a political transition plan that will lead to his departure. He has been in Saudi Arabia for treatment of wounds he suffered in a June 3 attack on his palace. Some see the timing of Ganadi's announcement as a tactic by Saleh to delay stepping down from power. Saleh said in March he would leave office by the end of the year. ""If Saleh leaves office before the end of the year, history will report it that he was ousted by the revolution,"" said Ali Abdul Jabbar, an analyst and the director of the Sanaa-based Dar Ashraf Research Center. Opposition members, though, see it as a way for Saleh to avoid returning to Yemen to face possible criminal prosecution. ""The opposition and revolution youth hope that Ali Abdullah Saleh comes back to Yemen so that they can try him for all the crimes he committed against the people over the last 33 years,"" said Hamid al-Ahmar, a leading opposition figure. Ahmar, the opposition's wealthiest businessman, and Ali Mohsen, the most powerful military leader in the country, were accused by the Yemeni government on August 18 of planning the palace attack.","Official: ""I cannot give you a specific time of when President Saleh will arrive""

"(CNN) -- England batsman Kevin Pietersen ensured his place in cricket's history books with an unbeaten double-century on day two of the sport's 2,000th Test match. Pietersen passed 200 for the second time in his international career to allow England to declare on an imposing 474-8 at Lord's on Friday, while India reached 17-0 in reply at stumps in the opening match of the series. With much focus on Indian veteran Sachin Tendulkar's bid to become the first player to score his 100th century at international level in such a historic match, Pietersen stole the spotlight as he resumed on 22 after a rain-affected opening day in London. The 31-year-old hit 21 fours and one six from 326 deliveries faced against an Indian bowling line-up missing spearhead Zaheer Khan, who suffered a hamstring injury on Thursday. ""It was quite nice from 150 to 200, but to get there was a mission,"" said Pietersen, who survived an early scare when it appeared he had been caught by Rahul Dravid, but umpire Billy Bowden's decision was overruled by the television official. ""I found it quite hard and a couple of the other boys came in and scored quickly, and that took the pressure off me. It is always nice to get the team into a position where we can hopefully do something in this Test match. ""I haven't had the best couple of years, I had a pretty good winter but there are a lot of players in that dressing room that are doing really well."" Pietersen added 98 for the third wicket with Jonathan Trott before his fellow South Africa-born teammate became the first of five victims snared by medium-pacer Praveen Kumar -- his best effort in just his fourth match in the five-day format. He then put on another 110 with Ian Bell, who also fell to Kumar for 45, while Eoin Morgan went in the 24-year-old's same over without scoring. Matt Prior, another England player with South African ancestry, helped Pietersen add another 120 runs for the sixth wicket as he made 71 off 93 balls before Kumar provided captain and wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni with his third catch of the innings. Stuart Broad was trapped leg before wicket by Kumar's next ball, but Graeme Swann avoided the hat-trick before scoring 24 in a partnership of 61 with Pietersen. The former England captain needed just 25 balls to complete his fourth 50 and was unbeaten on 202 when his successor Andrew Strauss called the players in, 25 runs short of his Test best. India, the top-ranked nation in Test cricket, safely negotiated the six overs before day's end, with the experienced Gautam Gambhir on seven and 21-year-old Abhinav Mukund on eight in just his fourth Test appearance.","Kevin Pietersen scores 202 not out as England declare at 474-8 against India .

"(CNN)  -- Luxembourg's Andy Schleck dramatically revived his Tour de France hopes with a stunning victory on an epic 18th stage which finished at the summit of the imposing Col du Galibier. At 2,645 meters, it was the highest-ever stage finish on the Tour, and Leopard Trek's Schleck certainly hit the heights with a brave solo victory. He broke clear of a group of favorites on the Col d'lzoard with 60km remaining, reeling in the fragmented remains of a breakaway, before crossing the line alone over two minutes clear of his chasers. Schleck, written off after muted performances in the Pyrenees and the first stage in the Alps, said he had decided to take his courage in his hands. ""I don't want to finish fourth in Paris, and I said to myself 'I'm going to risk everything, it'll work or it'll fail',"" he told Eurosport. ""That's the way I am, I'm not afraid of losing. And if my legs were hurting out in front I knew the others would be hurting to catch me up."" But he failed by 15 seconds to take the yellow off the shoulders of French hope Thomas Voeckler, who again performed heroics to take fifth on a stage which effectively marked the end of Alberto Contador's chances of retaining his crown. The three-time winner from Spain struggled on the upper slopes of the Galibier and now trails Voeckler by four minutes 44 seconds in seventh place. To complete a superb day for the Schlecks, Andy's brother Frank took second on the stage to move up to third overall, one minute eight seconds down. He gained precious time on Australia's Cadel Evans, who slipped to fourth at one minute 12 seconds. Friday's 19th stage, the third in the Alps, could well hold the key to the eventual winner with the finish on the famous Alpe d'Huez after another climb on the Galibier. Both the Schlecks will be looking to pick up further time on Evans, who is a stronger time trialist, ahead of Saturday's individual test against the clock over 42.5km in Grenoble.","Andy Schleck wins 18th stage of the Tour de France on Col du Galibier .

The cabin is part of its research project entitled ""A vision of aviation in 2050."" Paris Air Show set for take-off . Airbus says the Concept Cabin is ""inspired by nature"" and will be 100% recyclable with ""self-cleaning materials made from sustainable plant fibres which reduce waste and maintenance and will harvest passenger body heat to power cabin features."" The body of the aircraft has a structure that Airbus says ""mimics the efficiency of bird bone which is optimized to provide strength where needed."" A ""wall membrane"" will enclose the cabin and become transparent to give passengers panoramic views of the sky. ""Our research shows that passengers of 2050 will expect a seamless travel experience while also caring for the environment,"" said Charles Champion, Airbus Executive Vice President Engineering. The Concept Cabin also includes seats that adjust to the passengers' body shape. But the onboard ambience is where airlines will be able to make money.

He and the couple's daughter boarded a plane from Dallas to Venezuela on July 9, Hicks said. The daughter's age is 4 or 5, authorities said. ""We would obviously like to speak with him,"" Hicks said. The father and daughter were scheduled to return to the United States on July 14 but didn't, authorities said. The sheriff's department is working with the FBI because of its contacts in Venezuela, Hicks said. ""Detectives have communicated with Oscar Lozada at the beginning of the investigation into her disappearance, but over the past week, they have been unable to contact him,"" Hicks said. No warrants have been issued in connection with the disappearance, Hicks said. Authorities have examined the husband's credit card statements and found that he bought five-gallon buckets and several bags of concrete mix. But, Hicks added: ""The buckets and concrete mix are unaccounted for."" Detectives believe the missing woman may have occupied her husband's bright-yellow 2001 Nissan Xterra on July 5 or July 6, and investigators are seeking any eyewitnesses, authorities said. The car was found July 24 in Ascension Parish at the home of a family friend, authorities said. Walter Lemoine, principal at Brusly High, said Sylviane Finck Lozada had been a West Baton Rouge Parish Teacher of the Year. She is also a National Board Certified Teacher and had earned a doctorate degree two years ago. Lemoine called Sylviane Finck Lozada a ""tough"" teacher and said her disappearance is ""a major impact"" to the community. On August 8, the 500-student school was scheduled to hold ""a celebration of hope"" in the gymnasium for the missing teacher, and participants were also to move outdoors to light vigil candles, Lemoine said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Sylviane Finck Lozada phoned her family every day .

"(CNN) -- Chinese web developers are using a new weapon aimed at fighting corruption: sites encouraging people to share stories of bribes online. Such sites -- inspired by a similar idea in India -- have surged in the past few weeks, but they've had a shaky start. Interest in the idea gained widespread momentum on June 8, after China's state-run Beijing News published a story about a new website in India called ""Ipaidabribe.com."" The site encourages users to ""tell us your bribe story"" and aims to ""uncover the market price of corruption"" by making people's experiences publicly-accessible online. The website's administrators promise to use the stories ""to argue for improving governance systems ... and thereby reduce the scope for corruption in obtaining services from the government."" The idea quickly caught on in China, where analysts have said corruption is a serious problem. Official statistics on government corruption are hard to come by, but a 2007 report from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argued that corruption threatens China's future, fueling socioeconomic inequality and social unrest. Within days of the Beijing News story, several homegrown Chinese spinoffs had emerged. Visitors began posting hundreds of ""tips"" under headings like ""local officials ... are buying luxury villas at a small fraction of the market value,"" and ""High-ranking official with 146 mistresses writes a letter to his son."" Some contained documentation to back up the claims; others posted the names of the parties accused with no supporting evidence. But a week later, the state-run Jinghua Times reported that the government had declared ""citizens' anti-corruption websites,"" as they had come to be known, illegal. It was a move many predicted. ""People share these websites with one another saying they want to see how long they'll last before they get shut down or blocked. (Their) pessimistic attitudes are not unfounded,"" media critic Wei Yingjie wrote in a June 13 editorial posted on multiple Chinese newspapers' websites. ""In fact, up til now, there has been no shortage of channels for fighting corruption. But in reality, posts (that expose corruption) get deleted; people who file complaints about local government with higher levels of government get sent away; and (corruption) tipsters get shipped from province to province."" Within days, Wei's article itself had been removed from several state-run websites. But last week, an unlikely coalition emerged against the government's declaration: Chinese Internet freedom activists and the Communist Party-supported Global Times newspaper, which published an op-ed that argued against the ban on this class of website. ""Instead of shutting down these websites because of legal issues, the government should take this opportunity to work with the few websites that genuinely want to help, so that they may complement official bodies to fight corruption,"" the newspaper said. A web developer who goes by the name of ""Peater Q"" embodies this alliance. A young Communist Party member and web developer, Peater says his site, wohuilule.com, is the first of its kind to obtain government permission to exist. (""Wo hui lu le"" is a translation of ""I paid a bribe."") He asked to remain anonymous for this article, saying he feared revealing his identity would put his security at risk. CNN did not see his website's application documents, but his site was still viewable online Sunday -- days after many other similar sites were no longer accessible. Peater said he believes the government is working hard to reduce corruption within its own ranks, and he sees his site as ""a very specific resource for tips"" for the government officials who investigate corruption claims. ""I want to reduce their burden,"" he said. The very notion of anti-corruption websites that are vetted, potentially, by the same government officials the sites seek to expose sets off warning signals for some, who fear the sites will be used as a tool of persecution. An editorial cartoon in China's widely-read Southern Weekend newspaper showed a representative of the public security bureau smiling as he says, ""please register with your legal name, address ..."" In front of him, a man is sweating and hiding behind a sign that reads ""I bribed.com"" in Chinese. At least one expert says such sites pose serious ethical questions. ""If you wanted to tarnish the reputation of the government or a department within it, or settle a vendetta, you could just get all of your friends to post claims against them,"" said Raymond Fisman, a professor at the Columbia Business School who has studied corruption. ""There is no way of credibly aggregating the information to assess the magnitude of the problem,"" he added. When asked if he thinks his site, too, could one day run afoul of Internet censors, Peater acknowledged negative consequences could pop up if people use the site for ""reactionary behavior."" But he said sharing information will help tackle corruption. ""Positive things will come from widespread awareness. It's not just a website for bad feelings,"" he said. For now, Peater continues tweaking his site -- now just three days old -- and waiting for the tips to come in.","The sites allow people to report bribes and corruption complaints .

"Washington (CNN) -- The federal government is postponing some of the consumer protections scheduled to take effect later this month after airlines and travel agents said they needed more time to implement the changes. About half the protections will still take effect August 23 as planned. But the Department of Transportation agreed to delay a handful of changes until Jan. 24, 2012, most notably a requirement that airlines disclose the full cost of flights in online and print advertising. The DOT said it is balancing the desire of consumer to have the changes ""as soon as practical"" with the capability of the airlines to comply. Steve Lott of the Air Transport Association, which represents the airlines, said, ""The additional time will help our members navigate some of the significant programming and training complexities involved in implementing the new rule."" Kate Hanni, whose group FlyersRights.org championed the changes, said she was disappointed DOT granted the extensions. ""Every time something is to go into effect, they (the airlines) ask for a delay,"" Hanni said. Hanni noted domestic tarmac delays dropped to almost zero after the three-hour tarmac rule was adopted in April 2010, but said delays have been ""creeping up"" in recent months. There were 16 of the lengthy tarmac delays in May and 14 in June, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. In the meantime, Allegiant Air, Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines have filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals seeking to have many of the rules overturned, asserting that the DOT rules violate their rights. The rules being delayed until Jan. 24 are: . -- Airlines must prominently disclose all potential fees on their websites, including fees for baggage, meals, canceling or changing reservations, and advanced or upgraded seating. Also, airlines and ticket agents must include all taxes and fees in every advertised price. This rule was scheduled to take effect in October, but airlines contended they need additional time to reprogram and reconfigure their online search engines to include the new requirements. -- Airlines must disclose baggage fees on e-ticket confirmations. -- Airlines must apply the same baggage allowances and fees through a passenger's journey, including segments with interline and code share partners. (The airlines argued that there currently is no central repository for baggage policies and fees, and airlines are working to develop an industry solution.) -- Airlines are banned from raising prices after the purchase, unless they are due to government-imposed taxes or fees, and only if the passenger is notified and agrees to the potential increase at the time of sale. -- Airlines are required to provide passengers timely notice of flight delays and cancellations. -- Airlines must allow reservations to be held at the quoted fare without payment, or canceled without penalty, for at least 24 hours after the reservation is made if the reservation is made one week or more before a flight's departure date. These rules will take effect August 23: . -- Passengers involuntarily bumped from flights will be eligible for increased compensation. Currently, passengers can get up to $400 if the airline can get them to their destination within a short period of time (within one to two hours of their originally scheduled arrival time for domestic flights), or up to $800 if they are delayed for a lengthy time. Under the new rule, bumped passengers can get up to $650 or $1,300 respectively. Inflation adjustments will be made to those compensation limits every two years. -- International flights delayed on U.S. airport tarmacs more than four hours must allow passengers to deplane, with exceptions allowed for safety, security or air traffic control-related reasons. (A three-hour rule already exists for domestic flights.) -- Foreign airlines must post contingency plans for lengthy delays, customer service plans and contracts of carriage on their websites. -- Airlines must refund any baggage fee if the bag is lost. (Airlines already must compensate passengers for lost, damaged or delayed baggage.) -- Airlines must post changes in baggage fees on their websites for three months. -- Airlines must prominently disclose all fees for optional aviation services on their websites. -- Where refunds are due, airlines must provide prompt refunds of fares and optional fees. In its Federal Register notice, the DOT also tried to clear up some confusion regarding rules that require airlines to give ""specific baggage fee information"" on websites, and require carriers to provide ""specific charges"" on e-ticket confirmations. The rule ""does not require passenger-specific information"" on e-ticket confirmations, the DOT said. But airlines must provide specific information about fees ""so passengers can determine for themselves the fees that would apply to them.""","Airlines won't have to list extra fees in ads until January .

"(CNN)  -- Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova crashed out and Maria Sharapova survived an almighty scare on the opening day of the U.S. Open Monday. Kvitova, who beat Sharapova in the final at Wimbledon, exited to  Romanian Alexandra Dulgheru in straight sets, 7-6 6-3. Sharapova, second favorite behind Serena Williams to win the final grand slam of the season, flirted with defeat before seeing off British teenager Heather Watson, 3-6 7-5 6-3. 19-year-old Watson led by a set and a break before Sharapova fought back to force a decider. An early break gave the Russian third seed the cushion to wrap up victory, but it was hardly a convincing performance. Kvitova had been set to open on the main Arthur Ashe stadium court, but organizers switched her to the smaller Louis Armstrong court as they made changes to the schedule after Tropical Storm Irene blew through New York over the weekend. 49th-ranked Dulgheru never looked back after taking the first set tiebreaker 7-3 and broke her Czech opponent to lead 5-3 in the second set before serving out for victory to love. Kvitova is the first reigning Wimbledon champion to lose in the first round of the U.S. Open in the Open era. By contrast, second seed Vera Zvonareva of Russia enjoyed an easy passage to the second round as she beat Stephanie Foretz Gacon of France, 6-3 6-0. Two-time champion Venus Williams, who is not seeded this year, opened her campaign in the night session at Flushing Meadows with a 6-4 6-3 win over Vesna Dolonts of Russia.","Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova goes out in first round of U.S. Open .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The closure of a mountain highway pass in the heart of the nation's second-largest city -- an event anticipated to be so calamitous to car-loving Southern California that it's been dubbed ""Carmageddon"" -- hit the area Friday night. Crews began closing ramps late Friday on Interstate 405, where it passes over the Santa Monica Mountains, California Department of Transportation officials said. At about 10 p.m. Pacific, crews began closing lanes, and by midnight, the 405 was expected to be eerily vacant -- a ""carpocalypse,"" some say. It is expected to remain that way for about 53 hours. The moment ""Carmageddon"" began. Rendered desolate will be a 10-mile stretch of all five northbound lanes and a four-mile stretch of all five southbound lanes, officials said. The 405 is usually one of the busiest freeways in the country, carrying about 500,000 cars a day through the Sepulveda Pass, a critical artery connecting Southern Californians to destinations up the coast. The 405 achieved notoriety on national television as the corridor that former NFL player O.J. Simpson used as he was being slowly chased by police in 1994. The highway also cuts through the west side of Los Angeles, an area that includes the high-status communities of Bel Air, Brentwood, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said officials carried out ""an unprecedented"" public awareness campaign urging motorists to stay off the road or use public transportation. ""It doesn't have to be 'Carmageddon.' That's why we have done so much outreach to the public,"" the mayor said Friday. The weekend construction project should be completed by 5 a.m. Monday, to accommodate the morning rush hour, officials said. The $1.2 billion construction project calls for replacing a portion of a bridge at Mulholland Drive, a mountain summit road that is featured in many Hollywood films, authorities said. A year from now, crews will have to shut down the 405 again to replace a final portion of the Mulholland Drive bridge, officials said. The project also calls for adding a car-pool lane in each direction, creating ""the largest HOV system in the world"" at 48.6 miles in length between the San Fernando Valley and Orange County, said Mike Miles, the California Department of Transportation's director for Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. The two-year project will replace two more bridges, also to accommodate the widening of the 405, and will improve about two dozen on-off ramps and add 18 miles of sound-deadening walls for nearby residents, Miles said. ""This is a big project that is much needed, and it will be a great benefit to the public,"" Miles said. Whether it has been overdramatized by locals in the nation's entertainment capital, the project has brought countdown clocks, traffic apps, detour maps and warnings to stay away or enjoy the weekend on the couch. Amtrak and JetBlue are offering specials to get away from it all. ""Severe traffic conditions are anticipated in local and regional areas during the weekend of the full freeway closure,"" Metro warns on its website. The four-mile southbound section will be closed between U.S. 101 and Getty Center Drive ramps. The 10-mile northbound section will be closed between U.S. 101 and Interstate 10. Los Angeles International Airport is urging travelers to get there by public transit, especially rail, or to stay at nearby hotels for early morning flights. The Los Angeles Fire Department is adding 200 firefighters so it can quickly respond to 911 calls in the areas affected by the closure, CNN L.A. affiliate KABC reported. Of course, it may not be all bad. Villaraigosa's Facebook page links to ""405 Things to Do,"" brought to you by the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""The 405 closure is the perfect opportunity to discover ... and rediscover ... the great activities, restaurants, shops and sites close to home in the many unique neighborhoods of Los Angeles County,"" the page touts. ""Over the next few days leading up to the 405 closure, we will be adding 50 suggestions per day."" JetBlue is offering $4 fares each way from Burbank to Long Beach on Saturday and Sunday. Amtrak California offers coach passengers a 50% discount on trains traveling between Los Angeles Union Station and Burbank Bob Hope Airport. There is an app, or several, for ""Carmageddon."" KABC has partnered with Waze to help navigate the traffic. ""The app provides free turn-by-turn GPS navigation based on the live conditions of the road,"" the station said. Celebrities are even tweeting -- cheekily -- about this weekend's affront to the Los Angeles driving experience. Twitter titan and actor Ashton Kutcher has gotten into the act: ""LAPD askd me 2tweet: 405fwy btwn 10 & 101 will b closed July16-17. In xchange I would like a free pass on that stoplight tickt IT WAS YELLOW."" When shown a copy of the tweet while he was being interviewed on CNN, the mayor laughed about the request to fix the ticket. ""No, thank you, Ashton,"" Villaraigosa said. For those venturing out, it's all about the proper attitude. The Automobile Club of Southern California, while urging motorists to stay away from the construction zone, has provided tips for those driving Southern California roadways this weekend. It suggested leaving home early, listening to calming music and news updates, or stopping at a restaurant or park for a break, if necessary. ""Avoid directing anger at other drivers, even if they are discourteous or distracted,"" AAA said. ""Concentrate on your own driving.""

"(CNN) -- The U.N. on Monday called for reconciliation in the newly-established Republic of South Sudan after fighting reportedly left at least 600 dead and at least 26,000 cattle stolen. The Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary General, Hilde F. Johnson urged restraint Monday after fighting between the Murle and Lou Nuer communities in Jonglei State, killed at least 600 and left more than 750 wounded. Clashes broke out early Thursday morning and lasted through the day, South Sudan authorities reported. The U.N. on Friday dispatched an assessment and verification team to two of the conflict areas. The team found 28 casualties at one site and 30 at another along with a number of huts burned to the ground, said Aleem Siddique, spokesman for the United Nations Mission in South Sudan. The violence occurred when members of the Murle tribe attacked villages of the Lou Nuer, Siddique said. Though the violence had largely stopped, reconciliation efforts were needed to maintain the peace, he said. ""Peaceful dialogue is the primary means for reconciliation, and the tribal leaders need to sit down and work out their differences."" Between January and the end of June 2011, nearly 2,400 people had died in 330 clashes across South Sudan, according to a July U.N. report. Most of these casualties resulted from cattle rustling incidents in Jonglei State's Pibor County. Cattle rustling is a main source of insecurity in South Sudan as cows represent wealth and social status, and are used as ""blood money"" or compensation and payment of dowries. According to a 2009 report by the International Crisis Group, ""Sticks and spears have historically been used to carry out rustling and the violent disputes it often causes. However, the proliferation of small arms ... changed the nature of this practice, making raiding far more deadly.""","Fighting in South Sudan reportedly left at least 600 dead, at least 750 wounded .

"(CNN) -- Funeral services will be held Monday morning for a Texas man who died at a baseball game last week. Shannon Stone will be buried in his hometown of Brownwood, Texas. The 39-year-old firefighter fell to his death Thursday while trying to catch a ball at a Texas Rangers game. Ronnie Hargis was seated in the stands near Stone and tried unsuccessfully to save him. ""Your first instinct is to reach out and grab him,"" Hargis told CNN's Don Lemon. ""I tried to grab him. I couldn't catch him. He went down. As he went by me I tried to grab him again and I missed and ... it looked like he was in slow motion as he was going to the ground. There was nothing I could do but watch him fall."" In the second inning of the ill-fated game, star outfielder Josh Hamilton tossed a souvenir ball into the stands after a batter hit a foul ball. Stone stuck out his glove and reached for the ball, but lost his balance and flipped over the railing of the outfield seats. He fell about 20 feet and crashed head-first into a scoreboard, suffering fatal injuries. Stone died of blunt-force trauma, according to the Tarrant County medical examiner. His 6-year-old son, Cooper, witnessed the tragic accident. ""It's just the cruelest of reminders of just how fragile human life can be,"" said Joe Trahan, sports anchor at CNN-affiliate WFAA. ""The mind-boggling thing about this is that everyone's intent was right."" Trahan provided details of the incident for Lemon. ""Josh Hamilton flipped a foul ball up to a little girl an inning or so earlier,"" Trahan said. ""And he heard at that point Cooper Stone ask for a ball. Most of the time, big-leaguers wouldn't even hear that, but he made a note of it, he's trying to do the right thing."" Rangers president Nolan Ryan, a Hall of Fame pitcher, said earlier that the club would review the height of railings at the stadium, even though they currently exceed the city's code limits. Trahan told Lemon that club management is already working on making changes at their stadium. ""I've spoken to Rangers officials, and they tell me that there are meetings that have already taken place with city leaders, meetings with architects at the ballpark, contractors. They're trying to find a permanent solution, not a stop-gap one."" But fan-awareness also plays a crucial role at stadiums, according to Trahan. ""This is a stark and cruel reminder that (safety) is everyone's responsibility when you go to the ballpark,"" he said, adding that he was surprised that injuries didn't happen more often, especially ""down the first and third base lines ... those are rocket shots coming off those bats."" But Trahan also said that the accident should be kept in perspective. ""We go back to the unexplainable issue of why this happened, because there have been thousands and thousands of balls hit in that area, people with gloves trying to get balls and nothing has happened until now."" The Rangers held a moment of silence before Friday night's game against the Oakland A's. Members of both teams wore black ribbons. Flags at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington have flown at half-mast all weekend. The team has set up an account accepting donations in Stone's honor with the Texas Rangers Baseball Foundation. Donated money has been earmarked to help the Stone family. The Rangers have donated an undisclosed sum, according to the team's website, and the A's donated $5,000.","Shannon Stone died after falling over railing at Rangers Stadium .

"(CNN)  -- Uruguay star Diego Forlan said Monday that he is leaving Atletico Madrid and is set to join Serie A Inter Milan. Forlan, who scored two goals in the final as his country lifted the Copa America this summer, has been with Atletico since 2007, but a posting on the club's official website confirmed his departure. Forlan, who appeared at a news conference with Atletico president Enrique Cerezo, said the La Liga club would always be in his heart. But added: ""At the age of 33, going to a club like Inter is not an opportunity that comes up often. ""I am happy with the decision that I have taken, it is normal that some players come and others go,"" Forlan added. Atletico have set up a special Twitter hash tag so their fans could pay tribute to Forlan, who scored 74 goals in 134 appearances for the club. He will replace Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o, who joined Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala from Inter on a massive three-year contract. Forlan, the player of the tournament at the 2010 World Cup, will sign a two-year deal with the Italian giants, Spanish media reported. Inter have also signed Italian Under-21 midfielder Andrea Poli from relegated Sampdoria, the Serie A club announced on their official website Monday.

"(CNN) -- The Syrian president sacked the governor of a restive province, a day after tens of thousands of anti-government protesters took to the streets of its capital. President Bashar al-Assad discharged Dr. Ahmad Khaled Abdul-Aziz from his post as governor of Hama province, the third provincial governor to be fired since the countrywide protests began in mid-March. No reason was given for the move, reported on Saturday by the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. Hama city, the provincial capital, has been the scene of very large demonstrations and the outpourings there have been compared to the gatherings in Cairo's Tahrir Square, where daily demonstrations earlier this year forced the removal of Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak. Security forces withdrew from the Hama city center last month and al-Aasi Square has been packed with protesters calling for the downfall of the regime, displays of grassroots anger that have been gaining momentum in recent days. There have been no recent reports of violence in Hama, and observers believe the government might have been allowing the demonstrations in Hama because of the sensitivities over the city's violent history. The city was the scene of a 1982 brutal military crackdown targeting Sunni Muslims by the Alawite-dominated government of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad's late father. Thousands were killed. Sunni Muslims are the dominant religious group in the country and Alawites are an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Within the past three months, President al-Assad discharged the governors of Daraa and Homs as well. Syria has been wracked with protests that began in Daraa and took hold across the country as government forces cracked down on peaceful demonstrations. The number of deaths in the anti-government demonstrations across Syria on Friday stands at 24, according to the Local Coordination Committees, an activist group. Most were in the Homs and Idlib regions. Rami Abdelrahman, from the London-based Syria Observatory for Human Rights, said more than 1,360 civilians and more 340 army and security forces have died in the violence. Human Rights Watch, the humanitarian watchdog, issued a report on Saturday elaborating on the crackdown in Homs, saying the government security forces and their allies have killed at least 21 people there over the last two weeks. It said security forces have used clubs to beat demonstrators, ""vandalized private property, and broken into homes where they suspected protesters had sought refuge. Security forces dressed in civilian clothes have detained protesters repeatedly, often travelling in taxis to approach and detain people."" International powers have condemned and sanctioned the Syrian government for its crackdown, and there has been talk by some observers that the International Criminal Court should investigate possible crimes against humanity by the government. Amid the criticism, Syria has talked about reforms and this week permitted opposition members to hold a meeting. The government allowed about 200 activists and intellectuals, including some it had previously jailed, to hold a conference on democratic reform Monday at a Damascus hotel, the first such gathering permitted by the regime. The dissidents gathered in the hotel ballroom, including several signatories of a 2005 declaration that called for a democratic transition. On Friday, government minders escorted international journalists to anti-government protests. But reports of violent reactions to peaceful demonstrators persist. Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, was quoted in the report on Homs as saying that al-Assad's ""promises of new laws allowing more political participation ring hollow when security forces are still above the most basic laws."" Mark Toner, U.S. State Department spokesman, told reporters on Friday that despite a ""little flicker of progress"" this week, there has been a ""continued clampdown by security forces on peaceful protests."" He said the United States wants to see ""dialogue and a transition process"" and echoed President Barack Obama's statement that if al-Assad can't lead a reform process, ""he should get out of the way."" Toner said the United States backs the ""universal human right"" of peaceful protests and the right of freedom of expression. He said ""arbitrary arrests of innocent civilians"" must end, political prisoners must be released, state-run media must stop incitement, and violence must end against peaceful protesters.

"(CNN) -- As riots sweep several British cities, the U.S. State Department is cautioning Americans in the U.K. to avoid areas of civil unrest, monitor local media reports and not engage in any debates that might turn violent. The guidance, carried on the website of the U.S. Embassy in London, is part of a well-oiled warning system the State Department has used for decades to alert Americans living or traveling in countries around the world of everything from terrorist threats to hurricanes. Monday, the State Department issued an updated travel warning on Pakistan, cautioning U.S. citizens that Americans in the country have been ""arrested, deported, harassed, and detained"" for visa violations and noting that the number of U.S. citizens arrested, detained and prosecuted for overstaying their Pakistani visas ""increased markedly across the country."" How does the State Department decide when to issue a travel warning as opposed to simple guidance? Michelle Bernier-Toth, managing director of the department's Office of Overseas Citizens Services, said ""It's all premised on the 'no-double -standard' policy. ""If we have threat or security information that is specific, credible and noncounterable,"" she said, ""and that we're warning our own personnel about, we have an obligation to share that information with the public so that American citizens residing or traveling abroad can make informed decisions about their activities."" Some people in developing nations have questioned whether the State Department pulls its punches in issuing travel warnings for Western European countries, especially when those warnings might scare off American tourists, creating economic problems for the given country. ""Not at all,"" Bernier-Toth said. ""We issue emergency messages, formerly known as warden messages, around the world. We issued them routinely in Europe, for example,"" this summer over demonstrations in several cities. ""It has nothing to do with the political situation; it has nothing to do with bilateral relations with the country. Our primary focus is to get information about a security situation to the American public."" Right now, the State Department website includes 35 countries in its list of travel warning countries. Several of them -- Syria, Libya and Yemen, for example -- have been torn by violence during Arab Spring demonstrations. Travel warnings are issued, Bernier-Toth explained, when situations in a given country could pose a risk to U.S. citizens living or traveling there. Americans might not be deliberately targeted but they might be caught up in the violence, for example, in drug violence along the U.S.-Mexico border. ""We monitor what is going on,"" she said, ""in consultation with security experts in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, with counter-terrorism experts, with embassies and consulates on the ground who have first-hand information."" Travel warnings usually are issued in situations that the State Department considers to be a long-term, chronic threat, such as crime or terrorism. But the U.S. also issues warnings whenever it pulls out U.S. government staff or dependents from a mission abroad, even though the turmoil or crisis might be relatively short-lived . The next level down in the State Department's warning system is travel alerts. They are issued in the case of short-term problems, such as hurricanes or upcoming elections in a country that might turn violent. Travel alerts have expiration dates, Bernier-Toth said. ""As we approach that expiration date we review the situation and say 'What's going on now? Is there something that's continuing?' Or maybe the local government has it under control. We can let it lapse or move that information into the country-specific information."" Country-specific information, she says, is on the department's website and includes every country in the world. ""It's our version of the Lonely Planet Guide,"" she laughed. Things like what travelers need to know before they set out for a given country: Crime information, road safety, special requirements, unusual criminal penalties, health conditions, entry-exit requirements, dual-nationality information. To get the word out the State Department uses everything from the latest social network sites to the radio. ""We leave it to our embassies abroad to determine what is the best way, the most efficient way to disseminate information to the American community, given the technological capabilities of that country,"" Bernier-Toth said. In London the embassy uses Twitter, Facebook and other social networking sites. In other countries U.S. embassies may use email or texting. In some developing nations they may use ham radio -- ""communicating with missionaries out in the brush,"" she said. Issuing warnings and alerts, Bernier-Toth said, can have economic and political implications. We ""recognize that the host country may not appreciate whatever the message is,"" she said. ""Nonetheless, we make sure that the no-double-standard policy is adhered to, explaining to the host government this is not a reflection of our bilateral relationship, this is simply a statement of the security situation as we have assessed it. And as we have determined that we need to put this information out. Our message is our message.""

"(Rolling Stone) -- ""Loud"" is the perfect name for Rihanna's summer tour, which kicked off with last night's sold-out gig at Baltimore's 1st Mariner Arena. Beyond just the volume of the show -- which was considerable -- the theme prevailed through the set, built around a giant speaker cabinet; the costumes (mostly neon and shiny); and the entire production itself: a gloriously over-the-top spectacle perfectly befitting the singer, who seems to produce chart-toppers by the dozen. The show began with a blitzkrieg of video, as four hanging, shifting circular video screens joined four giant stationary ones is projecting Rihanna's arrival. She wore an electric blue mini-trenchcoat and hot pink stilleto boots with neon green heels and immediately belted out her Number One hit, ""Only Girl (In the World)"" from her 2010 album, also titled ""Loud."" Photos: Rihanna's Best Looks . Before the audience could catch its breath, the singer had tossed the trench, revealing a day-glo bikini, picked up a gang of matching day-glo-covered back-up dancers and shifted directly into ""Disturbia,"" another Number One hit, this one from 2007's ""Good Girl Gone Bad"" -- and then seamlessly segued into another hit, 2007's ""Shut Up and Drive,"" replete with back-up dancers dressed as crash-test dummies bashing a neon-graffiti-covered car with bats. Over nearly two hours -- a very long set for such a busy production -- Rihanna maintained a relentless pace, working her way through 24 songs, six different wardrobes and endless set changes, all without any significant energy dip. The deft production included several built-in musical and video interludes -- including a staggering number of guitar solos -- to keep from going dark during the changes. Excerpts from Rihanna's Rolling Stone Cover Story . One of the most impressive spectacles was a very erotic S&M-themed mini-set, launched with a fairly faithful cover of Prince's ""Darling Nikki,"" during which Rihanna, dressed in a tuxedo and toting a cane, spanked, groped and pretended to smack three nearly nude female dancers. By the time she had transitioned into ""Loud's"" ""S&M"" -- another Number One hit -- Rihanna's tux had been stripped off to reveal a white bondage corset and she was wearing handcuffs. Nearly nude men and a female audience member were added to the mix before the whole thing ended (cutely) in a pillow fight. In a military-themed mini-set including 2009 hit ""Hard,"" Rihanna rode in atop a double-barreled pink tank that shot T-shirts into the crowd, flanked by sexy-soldier costumed dancers with pink rifles. When ""Breakin' Dishes"" segued into ""Glamorous Life,"" the singer barreled to the back of the arena, where she rode a platform revealing Sheila E-style stand-up drums and played an impressive solo. Video: Rihanna's Hot Rolling Stone Cover Shoot . Soon, she was on to outfit six -- a gold lamé mini-dress -- and her encore, which moved from her Number One hit with Eminem, ""Love the Way You Lie,"" to her Number One hit with Jay-Z, ""Umbrella."" It was understated compared to the rest of the show -- with only a squadron of tuxedoed back-up dancers and a blizzard of pink confetti -- but it was impressive that she was still singing and dancing at such a pace. It was a even more remarkable that there were still more huge hits left to play. She did each one proud.

"(CNN) -- With Libyan rebels on the brink of toppling Moammar Gadhafi's 42-year rule, leaders from around the world weighed in as the battle with regime forces intensified in the capital. Here are a few of the reactions: . . CHINA . . Ma Zhaoxu, Foreign Ministry spokesman: ""We've noticed the development in Libya. China respects the choice of Libya people. China hopes the situation in Libya gets stabilized as soon as possible and people can live a normal life there. China is willing to cooperate with the international society to play a positive role in the future reconstruction of Libya."" . EUROPEAN UNION . . Catherine Ashton, high representative of the EU for foreign affairs: ""We are witnessing the last moments of the Gadhafi regime. I call on Gadhafi to step down without further delay and avoid further bloodshed. I call on the National Transitional Council and opposition forces to ensure the protection of civilians, to fully respect international human rights and humanitarian law and to act with responsibility in the interests of maintaining peace and stability throughout the country."" . Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy, European Commission and European Union presidents, respectively: ""The quest for freedom by the people of Libya is coming to a historic moment. The relentless efforts of the forces of the new Libya, supported militarily by NATO and several EU member states, and countries from the region are bringing the Gadhafi regime to its end. We urge Colonel Gadhafi to accept the will of the people, step down immediately, and avoid further bloodshed and sufferance."" . FRANCE . . Nicolas Sarkozy, president:  ""Whereas there is no longer any doubt  (that Gadhafi will have to go), the president of the republic urges Colonel Gadhafi to avoid inflicting new futile sufferings on his people in abandoning what is left of his power and in immediately calling on his forces, who are still loyal to him, to a cease-fire, to drop their weapons, to go back to their barracks and to put at its disposal legitimate Libyan authorities."" . ITALY . Franco Frattini, foreign minister: ""Time is up. There are no alternatives to his (Gadhafi's) surrender. If Gadhafi keeps calling for a civil war, he will be considered the only one responsible for the bloodbath,"" Frattini said in an interview with Italian news channel Sky Tg24. . NATO . . Anders Fogh Rasmussen, secretary-general: ""The Libyan people have suffered tremendously under Gadhafi's rule for over four decades.  Now they have a chance for a new beginning.  Now is the time for all threats against civilians to stop, as the United Nations Security Council demanded.  Now is the time to create a new Libya -- a state based on freedom, not fear; democracy, not dictatorship; the will of the many, not the whims of a few. . RUSSIA . . Russian Foreign Ministry: ""The latest dramatic development of the Libyan conflict apparently shows that the power in this country will be handed over to the rebel forces very soon. We hope that this will put an end to the protracted intra-Libyan bloodshed, which brought so many woes and so much suffering to this country's population and caused serious damage to the national economy,"" the ministry said in a statement.. SOUTH AFRICA . . Clayson Monyela, spokesman, Department of International Relations: ""With the imminent fall of the government of Colonel Gadhafi, we wish to urge the interim authority in Tripoli to immediately institute an all-inclusive inter-Libyan political dialogue aimed at building a truly representative and people-centred dispensation."" The spokesman refuted ""rumors and claims that it has sent planes to Libya"" to fly Gadhafi and his family out, saying ""we have steadfastly maintained that the future of Libya should be decided by the Libyans themselves."" .

Leaders of other countries should also be aware that they'll stay in power as long as they respond to demands of the people."" . UNITED KINGDOM . .

""At the U.N., we will ... be taking early action in the Security Council to give the new Libyan authorities the legal, diplomatic, political and financial support they need,"" Cameron said. ""We will soon be able to release the frozen assets that belong to the Libyan people."" Nick Clegg, deputy prime minister: ""The UK will stay the course in Libya -- protecting the Libyan people and putting them in charge of their own fate ... It is now clear that the Libyan people will only be safe once Gadhafi has left power. Recent events suggest that day is closer than ever. . Ed Miliband, leader of the Labour Party: ""The situation in Libya remains fraught and fragile, but what is clear is that the regime of Colonel Gadhafi is crumbling. This is to be welcomed by all those who believe dictatorship, brutality and threats against civilians should not be allowed to stand."" . UNITED STATES . . Barack Obama, president: ""Tonight, the momentum against the Gadhafi regime has reached a tipping point. Tripoli is slipping from the grasp of a tyrant.

A ferry that was chartered to take hundreds of U.S. citizens from Libya to Malta was held up for a while yesterday. U.S. officials said everyone onboard was safe. They said the delay was because of the weather. Meanwhile, Libya's leader, Moammar Gadhafi, is blaming the violence in his country on young people. He says they're taking some sort of pills and being manipulated by the al Qaeda terrorist group. But during a speech earlier this week, President Obama said what's going on in that part of the world has nothing to do with outside influences. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: So let me be clear. The change that is taking place across the region is being driven by the people of the region. This change doesn't represent the work of the United States or any foreign power. It represents the aspirations of people who are seeking a better life. Political Unrest . AZUZ: Looking around that region, starting next door to Libya in Algeria.

ANTHONY STEWART, THRASHERS RIGHT WINGER: I just like skating fast, ever since I was three. DUSTIN BYFUGLIEN, THRASHERS DEFENSEMAN: I guess it's just something about being on the ice that I enjoy. It's just me being out there, having fun and enjoying the people around me. CAREY: What's the biggest misconception or false assumption that people make about you? BYFUGLIEN: This guy can't stand on skates. ODUYA: Maybe in Atlanta, you tell people that you're a hockey player and they don't believe you. CAREY: What do you think? ODUYA: I don't know. Maybe basketball or baseball, I have no idea. CAREY: Who here knew that they were going to be a professional hockey player? Anybody here know that? STEWART: I knew probably when I was in grade one. We had an assignment to say what you wanted to be when you grew up. And I said, ""Hockey player,"" and she said, ""Pick something else."" And I said, ""No, I'm going to be a hockey player,"" and I stuck with it. CAREY: Did anybody try to steer you to something different, because you don't look out on the ice that often and see people of color? Did someone say this isn't the right fit for you? KANE: No, I think, honestly, it was almost the opposite. My dad really instilled that drive in me to battle through that kind of stuff, battle through adversity, and that's what made me so successful. CAREY: Anybody else feel that they were steered in a different direction for racial reasons at all? STEWART: I grew up sort of in an urban neighborhood and, you know, a lot of my friends are playing basketball and sports like that. I'd go play a little bit of basketball, but after an hour I'd get bored of it, so I'd say, ""I have to go play hockey now."" And they would go, ""Uh, naw, you're not going to make it in hockey, so you might as well play basketball"" or something like that. But I had some support from my parents. That helped me a lot. All my close friends to date were minor hockey players, and their support helped get me to where I am today. CAREY: We always hear about hockey as, it's an expensive sport for kids who want to play. And often, maybe, that's why minority kids don't get into it. Explain, why is it so expensive? STEWART: I think when you have to pay $500 for a pair of skates as opposed to a $20 basketball or $50 pair of soccer shoes, it makes a lot more sense to play those sports. But there's a lot of community initiatives right now in the NHL helping urban kids. And with the Hockey Is For Everyone program that's helping not so fortunate kids play, they're making good strides.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that federal judges have the discretion to give ""reasonably"" shorter prison terms for crack-cocaine crimes to reduce the disparity with crimes involving cocaine powder. Lawyers argue that crack-cocaine offenders were unfairly targeted. The 7-2 ruling represents a victory for lawyers who argued that crack-cocaine offenders were unfairly targeted under U.S. sentencing guidelines. Current federal penalties for selling 5 grams of crack cocaine can warrant the same prison sentence as dealing 500 grams of the powdered variety. The Supreme Court case centered around Derrick Kimbrough of Norfolk, Virginia, who according to court records, pleaded guilty to distributing more than 50 grams of crack cocaine. Federal sentencing guidelines called for 19 to 22.5 years behind bars. But Judge Raymond Jackson instead gave the defendant a 15-year sentence, calling the case ""another example of how crack-cocaine guidelines are driving the offense level to a point higher than is necessary to do justice."" A federal appeals court overturned the case and sent it to a higher court, saying Jackson's discretion was ""unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses."" Said Kimbrough's attorney, Michael Nachmanoff in October, ""A sentence of 19 years for a man with no felony convictions who served his country honorably, who had never spent a night in jail ... that was ridiculous."" Kimbrough is a veteran of the 1991 Persian Gulf War and is African-American. African-Americans were nearly 82 percent of defendants sentenced in federal court for dealing crack, but only 27 percent of those sentenced for dealing powder cocaine, according to 2006 federal statistics. Each year, federal courts handle about 11,000 cocaine sentences, which are roughly evenly divided between crack and cocaine cases. The issue long has been a source of contention between government prosecutors and civil rights advocates, who argue crack dealers are often targeted for longer prison terms because that drug is prevalent in urban and minority communities, while the powdered version is more commonly associated with higher-income users. Writing for the majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took a practical approach, saying it is important to preserve judicial discretion, while ensuring most sentences remain within federal guidelines established two decades ago to ensure a measure of uniformity. Ginsburg said a federal judge was right to give a crack offender a lesser prison term than the guidelines called for, since federal law ""mandates only maximum and minimum sentences,"" she wrote. ""It says nothing about appropriate sentences within those statutory guidelines."" Ginsburg noted the trial judge ""honed in on the particular circumstances of Kimbrough's case and accorded weight to"" reports by the U.S. Sentencing Commission that show ""the crack/powder disparity yields unjustifiably harsh sentences for crack offenders."" Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented in the Kimbrough case. Thomas said it will now be up to courts ""to assume the legislative role of devising a new sentencing scheme,"" something Congress never intended. The government had no immediate reaction to the high court's ruling. The U.S. Sentencing Commission -- an independent federal agency that advises all three branches of government on sentences -- recently cut the gap in recommended prison time for crack-cocaine offenses. The guidelines took effect November 1 after Congress decided not to overturn the changes. The commission is scheduled to vote Tuesday on whether to make those guidelines retroactive for prisoners convicted in the past of crack dealing. Almost 20,000 inmates could be eligible for shorter sentences under the proposed changes. Congress recently has introduced at least four bills that would reduce the current disparity in cocaine sentences. One widely circulated proposal led by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, would revise the cocaine ratio downward to 20-to-1. That ratio is also supported by the Sentencing Commission. Harsher sentences for crack offenses came after a social epidemic of crack cocaine began destroying many urban areas in the 1980s. ""The crack-cocaine guidelines were put in place because crack was fueling crime waves across the country, in particular with respect to street violence,"" said Kendall Coffey, a former U.S. attorney in Miami who comments on legal matters for CNN. ""And it is clear that crack cocaine and white powder cocaine had a very different impact in terms of not only the lives of the users but the impact on the community."" The case is Kimbrough v. U.S. (06-6330). E-mail to a friend .","NEW: Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas dissent .

"(CNN) -- Libya's transition from autocratic to democratic rule will be a delicate one that will not occur overnight, observers told CNN Monday as rebel forces appeared to solidify their hold on Tripoli. The National Transitional Council, founded months ago in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, is likely to move to Tripoli once the capital is secured, said Mansour El-Kikhia, a Libyan scholar and dissident who is associate professor and chairman of the Department of Political Science and Geography at the University of Texas at San Antonio. The NTC is working to minimize revenge killings, though some have already occurred, said El-Kikhia, who cited conversations earlier in the day with NTC members as his source. ""If you are put in jail by somebody and you were tortured, you're going to remember the person who kidnapped you,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to control them."" Efforts are under way to arrest leaders of the Gadhafi regime and put them into protective custody, he said. ""You find lots of hatred,"" he said. But, he added, ""they have to be fairly tried. I assure you that the intention of the (council) is to apply the rule of law."" He said that would not be a tough sell to the Libyan people. After experiencing more than 40 years of lawlessness, ""you begin to appreciate the law,"" he said. ""There was nothing wrong with the law Gadhafi had; he just never applied it."" Asked how Libya will look in six months, he said, ""Much better than it does today. ... At least you will have some law and order, you will have some accountability, constitutional frameworks, institutions that can be held accountable."" Some NTC members are already in Tripoli, said El-Kikhia, who was planning to return next month to Tripoli for what would be his first visit to the capital in 30 years. ""I'm elated,"" he said. Rebels are working on a draft constitution that is based on the constitution that was in place before Gadhafi took power nearly 42 years ago, he said. Under one scenario, the NTC will continue to work for the next nine months to finish the constitution and hold elections. An alternative also under consideration is for the council to disband and call new elections within three months to form a new government, he said. There is concern about the NTC continuing to lead the new government during any transition because its members are self-selected and drawn largely from eastern Libya. At least 20 senior members of the council were meeting Monday in Doha, Qatar, to plan the move to Tripoli within a few days, said Omar Turbi, a computer company executive in Laguna Beach, California, who was born in Libya and works closely with the Transitional National Council in an unofficial capacity. The council is working to establish television and radio stations to send messages of democracy to the populace, he said. He said the council membership was planning to increase its numbers from a few dozen to about 200 in order to more fully represent the country. But the overall transition to a democracy will take at least two years, he said. ""You cannot transition between a nondemocratic system to a reasonably accessible democratic system in less than 24 months,"" he said. ""I think we could live with that."" He said nongovernmental organizations like the National Endowment for Democracy would prove critical to helping push the process forward. A key element to building a civil society will be the planned creation of a committee to be composed of a chairman and 14 ministers who will establish contacts with the technocrats who have run the country under Gadhafi, he said. ""Many of them are honest, great people who know the lay of the land and what needs to be done to open airports, harbors and start communicating with the outside world, begin a process of reconciliation between tribes,"" he said. He predicted that tribal rivalries will not emerge as an obstacle to democracy. ""Tribes haven't really been a major issue,"" he said. ""Almost every tribe is in the game."" It will take 18 to 20 months to create a political framework for a new government, a Britain-based coordinator for Libya's National Transitional Council said Monday. The council's primary job is to stabilize the country and conduct temporary council elections, Guma El-Gamaty told CNN. It will write a new constitution, and the new government will likely be made up of ""Libyan nationalists,"" he said. It will also include technocrats -- engineers, scientists and health professionals who will work to identify the country's needs and re-establish its infrastructure. The council ""is going to run the country,"" Ali Suleiman Aujali, the rebel government's ambassador to the United Sates, told CNN on Monday. ""Of course, they have to take care of the security of the city and, of course, our concern now is where is Gadhafi,"" he said, referring to longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. ""We have to find out: Where is he?"" Formed this year, the council has won recognition as Libya's legitimate government from the United States, Britain, Spain, Canada and Germany. In a symbol of its diplomatic credibility, the Libyan Embassy in Washington reopened under the control of the council. The former Libyan ambassador under Gadhafi is back in his old role, now representing the NTC. The council regards itself as an interim entity that intends to shepherd the change to a new government. Its power base has been in Benghazi, in the east. It includes representatives from throughout Libya and is headed by Mustafa Abdul Jalil, its chairman and a former justice minister under Gadhafi. The NTC has agreed to expand its membership to include ""newly liberated parts"" of Libya, said Esam Omeish, director of the Libyan Emergency Task Force in Washington. It has also pledged to appoint a constitutional drafting committee, and hold legislative and presidential elections, Omeish said. He said the council chairman foresees a 10- to 15-month transition, and said the NTC has agreed the new constitution would make Islam ""a"" source of legislation, not ""the"" source. Omeish spoke in July in a discussion moderated by Marina Ottaway, a Libya expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. American Libyan Council President Fadel Lamen, who spoke at the discussion, cited ""key players"" who would influence the transition. He said the NTC is the ""main player in the transition, and a consensus has formed around both it and the leadership of Abdul Jalil."" But Lamen said it faces challenges because it is ""an umbrella group composed of a number of smaller groups with differing agendas."" If it does not evolve and become more representative, Lamen warned, the NTC could be swept aside. Other entities likely to prove influential during the transition are councils in Benghazi, Misrata and smaller towns. Lamen also cited a group of lawyers called Coalition of 17th of February. ""They claim revolutionary legitimacy,"" yet their consistent challenges to the NTC could undermine the transition, he said. He noted that Islamists, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, are a ""well-organized,"" but small group. ""The Muslim Brothers in Libya are more traditional, closer to their Egyptian counterparts than to their more liberal Tunisian brethren,"" he said. ""They seek an undefined moderate Islamist state with an active civil society."" Lamen also cited ""older regime elements,"" including ""technocrats of the old regime, the military, the revolution committees and professional syndicates."" Saad Djebbar, a lawyer who negotiated the release in Scotland two years ago of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the man convicted of blowing up a Pan-Am flight over Lockerbie, said it is vital to establish a ""coalition of cultures"" that would represent all regions, tribes and factions to ensure a stable Libya post-Gadhafi. He called on the international community to facilitate that coalition because ""Libyans don't have the expertise to do it."" The rebellion was aided by a campaign of airstrikes by the NATO alliance, acting under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from government reprisals. As rebel fighters pushed into Tripoli, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the international community would help them usher in a new beginning. ""Now is the time to create a new Libya -- a state based on freedom, not fear; democracy, not dictatorship; the will of the many, not the whims of a few,"" he said Sunday in a statement. ""That transition must come peacefully. It must come now. And it must be led and defined by the Libyan people."" There has been friction in the council, illustrated this month by Jalil's dismissal of the rebels' 14-member executive board. The council acts as the opposition's ""legislative branch,"" the State Department said in its background notes on Libya. The council had initially appointed an executive committee, headed by Mahmoud Jibril, to oversee interim issues. But Jalil dismissed the board after the killing late last month of the rebel government's military commander, Gen. Abdel Fattah Younis. His death played a role in the board members' ouster, said Shamsiddin Abdulmolah, the council's media director. Younis and two other rebels were killed after the NTC sought to question him about allegations that he or those close to him were maintaining ties to Gadhafi, Younis' supporters have said. Jalil commissioned Jibril to move quickly to submit new names to be considered for a new board, Abdulmolah said, but no deadline was mentioned. In July, rebel military council member Mohammad Ethish released a statement that appeared to imply that Gadhafi loyalists had something to do with Younis' killing. A one-time general in Gadhafi's army, Younis told CNN in February that he had switched sides after Gadhafi told him he planned to bomb Benghazi -- a move he said would have killed thousands of civilians. Steven Cook of the Council on Foreign Relations cautioned Sunday that rebels still have a ""very, very long way to go."" ""They're confronted with a situation where they have to build the Libyan state from the ground up,"" he said. ""Who is going to pick up the pieces? How unified are they going to be?""","The NTC is trying to minimize revenge killings, a Libyan dissident says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The bitter child support and custody battle between Mel Gibson and Oksana Grigorieva apparently reached a conclusion, with Gibson agreeing in court Wednesday to pay his ex-girlfriend $750,000 and share time with their young daughter. The settlement, which was revealed in a Los Angeles courtroom Wednesday, also allows Grigorieva to remain in the home that Gibson has provided her until Lucia, who was born in October 2009, turns 18. It then would be sold, with the money going into a trust for their child. ""Lucia was born out of love and she was a planned child,"" Grigorieva lawyer Daniel Horowitz said after the hearing. ""They both wanted another child. Oksana wanted a settlement for Lucia's sake."" The leaks to tabloids and negative statements traded between Gibson and Grigorieva since their separation last year will apparently come to an end. The agreement requires both to stay publicly silent about the other. The former couple with share joint custody of Lucia, splitting the time with her evenly under the agreement. At the height of its bitterness, the battle for Lucia included domestic violence accusations made by each parent against the other. Those were later dropped as negotiations, monitored by a judge, proceeded. Gibson entered a ""no contest"" plea in March to a misdemeanor battery charge relating to an incident last year involving Grigorieva. A plea deal put the actor on unsupervised probation for three years and it requires Gibson to complete 52 weeks of anger management counseling. It also allowed him to enter a no contest plea without admitting guilt. HLN's Selin Darkalstanian contributed to this report.","Gibson and Oksana Grigorieva share a young daughter, Lucia .

"Bethesda, Maryland (CNN) -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission announced Thursday a recall of pourable gel fuels used in outdoor decorative lighting because of burn and flash fire hazards. The voluntary recall, ahead of the Labor Day weekend, covers about 2 million bottles and jugs of gel fuel, and it follows a similar recall and warning in June. Incidents of flash fires and burns have been reported when consumers add the gel to an already burning fire pot. The CPSC says the agency has received reports of at least 65 incidents, including two deaths, 75 injuries, and 34 victims hospitalized with second and third degree burns. Because of the alcohol base of the product, the CPSC says the fires spread easily, sometimes resulting in injuries to more than one person, and they are difficult to put out. ""The standard way of putting out flame doesn't work. Water very rarely works. Patting it or smothering the flame does not work. So you have to use a dry chemical extinguisher to get the flame out,"" CPSC Chairman Inez Tenenbaum told CNN. The nine manufacturers and distributors involved in the voluntary recall include Bird Brain, Bond Manufacturing, Sunjel, Fuel Barons, Lamplight Farms, Luminosities, Pacific Decor, Real Flame, and Smart Solar USA. CPSC said a tenth manufacturer, Marshall Group, backed out of a recall agreement at the last-minute. Tenenbaum also said the nine companies agreed to recall the items only if the CPSC would not show a video made in their laboratory of the products exploding. The recalled gel fuel has been sold by retailers since 2008. The CPSC and Napa Home & Garden recalled 460,000 bottles and jugs of gel fuel in June, and the CPSC recommends the removal of all remaining gel fuel stock from store shelves.

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Rafael Nadal has been passed fit to take on American Mardy Fish in the Wimbledon men's singles quarterfinals on Wednesday. Top seed Nadal was a doubt to face Fish after being troubled with an injury to his left foot during Monday's last 16 win over Juan Martin del Potro. However, the 25-year-old has now been given the all-clear to play after scans revealed the injury was not serious. Nadal posted a message to his fans on his Facebook page, saying: ""After the match I went to take an MRI at a London hospital. ""During the match I thought I had something serious -- but as the match went on the pain got better and thankfully the tests don't show an injury. ""I will practice today and I will play tomorrow -- thank you all for the support,"" added the world number one. Nadal's message is in stark contrast to his mood after defeating del Potro in a hard-fought four-hour marathon played in blistering conditions. The Spaniard told reporters he came close to retiring hurt during the first set and shook his head repeatedly during a 10-minute injury break while his foot received treatment from the trainer. After the 7-6 3-6 7-6 6-4 victory, Nadal said: ""I felt really bad during the first set. At 6-5 I felt terrible. I felt that I had broken my foot. ""The point at deuce and the point that gave me set point, I just felt terrible. I seriously didn't know at that moment if I had a chance to continue playing."" Nadal has suffered from several injury problems in recent years, notably when a knee problem meant he could not defend his Wimbledon title in 2008.","Rafael Nadal is fit to face Mardy Fish in Wednesday's Wimbledon men's quarterfinals .

"Washington (CNN) -- Thousands of firearms have gone missing from manufacturers' inventories since 2009 ""without a record of being legally sold,"" according to a report released Thursday by a gun control advocacy group. The report by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence put the number of missing weapons at 16,485. ""It is shocking that gun makers are so oblivious to public safety that they lose track of thousands of guns every year,"" Henigan, acting president of the Brady Center, said in a statement. ""Given the lethality of its product, the gun industry has a special duty to act responsibly. Instead, it has a scandalous record of carelessness."" The Brady Center report suggests that some guns may never have had serial numbers stamped into them, making them virtually impossible to trace. The group says that the missing guns are often used by criminals precisely because they are so hard to trace. The report does not mention which manufacturers are reported to having missing firearms. The Brady Center says the data was collected from a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives report that was presented to the gun industry last month. But the report also states that ATF conducts their compliance examinations at only about 20% of gun dealers and manufacturers each year, and says as a result, ""The 16,485 'missing' guns are likely a vast undercount of the total number of guns that disappeared from gun manufacturers in the last two and a half years."" Andrew Molchan, Publisher of American Firearms Industry Magazine, slammed the report in a statement to CNN. ""The Brady spin and implication that some manufacturers, whose names are not mentioned so we can't check the charges, are knowingly selling guns before they are logged into the manufacturer's records is absolutely ridiculous,"" Molchan said. According to ATF statistics, more than 5 million firearms were made in the United States in 2008 by about 4,487 manufacturers. The federal law enforcement agency is in charge of inspecting companies that make and sell firearms to make sure they are in compliance with federal laws. The ATF says about 600 agents did more than 10,000 inspections last year, but the Brady Center says the agency isn't able to do enough because it lacks manpower and money. The ATF said it had not read the report and would not comment. The Brady Center is an advocacy group for tightened gun laws and was named after Jim Brady, President Ronald Reagan's press secretary, who was shot in the head in the attempted assassination of Reagan in 1981.","Brady Center slams gun makers' ""scandalous record of carelessness""

"(CNN) -- A municipal police captain was fatally shot while driving to work on Thursday in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, becoming the 49th municipal police officer killed since October 2010, authorities told CNN. An average of five local police officers have been killed per month in Juarez during that period, municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez said. Cmdr. Mario Martin Favela Portillo, 25, was shot by unknown gunmen traveling in a truck. The shooting happened about 2:30 p.m. in southwest Juarez, Sanchez said. The commander was in uniform. Suspected drug lords reveal secrets on camera . ""As in all the cases of murder, the police force is very frustrated and hurt. Favela was 25 years old and was registered in the local police when he was 20,"" Sanchez said. Juarez is considered a flash point in Mexico's nearly five-year war on organized crime.

"(CNN) -- An 8-foot-long alligator sank its teeth into a 90-year-old woman's leg and tried to drag her into a canal in southern Florida, a spokeswoman for the state's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said. Margaret Webb was walking in her flooded yard Wednesday in rural Copeland, Florida, about 80 miles west of Miami, when the alligator lunged at her and grabbed her by her left leg, commission spokeswoman Gabriella Ferraro said. Dewain Daniels, who was driving by, stopped to help the woman, Ferraro said, and pulled her out of the water away from the alligator. But that didn't stop the huge reptile, which tried to come out of the water three times. Daniels shot the alligator between the eyes with a .22 Magnum rifle, according to the incident report from the wildlife commission, and it retreated into the water. Webb was airlifted to Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers, where she's in critical condition after having her left leg amputated below the knee, Ferraro said. She's also being treated for a bite on her right leg. Ferraro said alligators are the most active at this time of year, while water levels are at their highest, but unprovoked attacks are rare. In 2010, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reported six unprovoked attacks in the state. Ferraro said the elderly woman, whose home is next to the Florida Everglades, is no stranger to alligator attacks. ""There are reports she has lost pets to alligators,"" she said. Two wildlife officers and trapper David Regel returned to the site of the attack early Thursday morning to search for the alligator in the canals surrounding Webb's home. Ferraro said it's not clear what became of the gator. ""We don't know if it's alive or dead or injured.""","The woman, who has lost pets to alligators before, lives near the Everglades .

"(CNN) -- Tournament favorite Maria Sharapova powered into the Wimbledon women's singles semifinals on Tuesday, crushing Dominika Cibulkova for the loss of just two games. Fifth seed Sharapova, the 2004 champion and only grand slam winner left in the women's draw, proved in a different league to Slovakian Cibulkova, taking just under an hour to reach the last four 6-1 6-1. Cibulkova, seeded 24th, had stunned world number one Caroline Wozniakci in the last 16, but could not match that performance on Centre Court, as Russian Sharapova reached the semifinals at the All England Club for the first time since losing to Amelie Mauresmo in 2006. The 24-year-old Sharapova told reporters: ""It's an honor to be in the semifinal at Wimbledon. ""It's a few years since I've got past the fourth round so it's a great chance to take it a step further,"" she added. ""Every opponent is different. I have a tough opponent coming up and I'm looking forward to the match. ""She's confident and playing great grass court tennis,"" continued Sharapova, who has yet to drop a set in the tournament so far. Sharapova's semifinal opponent is unseeded German Sabine Lisicki, who continued her remarkable run of form by defeating Marion Bartoli of France in three sets. Ninth seed Bartoli came into the tournament on a high after winning the warm-up event at Eastbourne, and she maintained that momentum by putting out defending champion Serena Williams in the last 16. However, wild card entrant Lisicki, who had beaten French Open champion Li Na in an earlier round, proved far too strong in the decisive third set, going through 6-4 6-7 6-1 to become the first German woman to reach a grand slam semifinal since compatriot Steffi Graf in 1999. Czech Petra Kvitova is also through to the semifinals after a battling three-set victory over Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova. Both players had reached the last four of last year's tournament, losing to Serena Williams and Vera Zvonareva respectively, and it was eighth seed Kvitova who got there again -- going through 6-3 6-7 6-2. Kvitova is aiming to become the first left-hander to win the women's title since Martina Navratilova in 1990. The final semifinal was held up because of heavy rain at Wimbledon, and was eventually switched to Centre Court under the roof, where fourth seed Victoria Azarenka claimed a comfortable 6-3 6-1 victory over unseeded Austrian Tamira Paszek. The 21-year-old Belarussian had lost her four previous grand slam quarterfinals, but was never in danger against her unseeded opponent, who was reaching her first grand slam quarterfinal. Azarenka will now face Kvitova for a place in the final, in a repeat of their match here 12 months ago, which went the Czech's way.","Tournament favorite Maria Sharapova reaches the Wimbledon semifinals .

"Washington (CNN) -- National Museum of American History Curator Peter Liebhold describes the day several years ago he spent going through shipping containers filled with debris from United Airlines Flight 93 as ""overpowering,"" even though more than a year had passed since September 11, 2001, when the plane crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. ""Going through the debris of an airplane was certainly an experience that I've never had before,"" said Liebhold, one of three curators from that museum who focused on gathering 9/11 artifacts full time. A special exhibition commemorating 9/11 with the results of their work will open at the museum on Saturday. They were granted access to the materials from Flight 93 after the FBI had finished analyzing them as crime-scene evidence. ""The material was stored in ocean-shipping containers and we opened them up -- I guess we weren't really prepared for how small the bits would be,"" according to Liebhold. ""It smelled of jet fuel, of moldy cloth and paper and just sort of mysterious odors that were -- I guess in all honesty -- plain scary,"" he said. Liebhold and his fellow curators by this time had an idea of what the items they would seek as they dug through the plane debris. ""One of the big stories on Flight 93 was that unlike the other flights (hijacked on 9/11), it was delayed in taking off and the hijacking happened a little bit later,"" the curator said. ""The passengers knew what their fate was going to be through cell-phone communication. People had talked to people on the ground. So finding a cell phone was something we really sought, to tell that story of how people became informed and what helped motivate them to action."" They found a GTE phone that has become part of the Washington museum's permanent exhibit on 9-11. The curators also collected a gauge from the flight panel of United Flight 93, as control of the plane itself was part of the story. They also tried to find items that would represent the people who were on the plane, such as seat belts that had been torn in the crash. And, they found a part of an American flag. ""Every United Airlines plane over the exit door has a small American flag painted into the fuselage and we found the red-and-white stripes of the flag,"" Liebhold said. ""For me, one of the strongest icons is one of the simplest and smallest. And that's the little orange call button that I never really paid attention to,"" he said. ""There was this small little orange button and it's chipped and it's scratched but it's a picture of a person and in a sense, it's asking for help."" The curators were granted a single day to go through the Flight 93 containers. At the end of the day, they threw away the clothes they had been wearing during their search, as the clothes smelled like that strange odor from the container. Liebhold said that during the height of their collecting, he and his colleagues also communicated with family members and others affected by the attacks, to ask for other items related to September 11. But, they always worked through an intermediary so that those affected would be comfortable turning down their requests and would not have to say no face to face. ""It's difficult to know where the boundary between history and current event is, and when you are collecting something that is a current event, you're emotionally tied to it and it's difficult to have any kind of distance to understand it,"" Liebhold said. ""But, so much of it is parting -- if you don't act fairly quickly, it could easily be gone forever."" More than 50 9/11 artifacts collected by curators from the American History Museum will be on display in a special exhibition called ""September 11: Remembrance and Reflections."" The items, collected from New York, the Pentagon and Shanksville, will be on display starting Saturday at the museum on tables, not behind glass, to give visitors a close-up, intimate view through September 11, 2011.","A special museum exhibition commemorating 9/11 opens in Washington .

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. Marine reservist was detained early Friday after being found acting ""suspiciously"" in Arlington National Cemetery before dawn, setting off a security scare that closed commuter routes around the Pentagon for a few hours to snarl morning rush-hour traffic, authorities said. Information from the detained man, identified as 22-year-old Yonathan Melaku, led authorities to a car parked in bushes on the side of a road near the Pentagon and prompted explosives experts to examine the red 2011 Nissan, according to an FBI statement. A security perimeter set up to divert traffic from the area closed Route 27 and other roads around the Pentagon and national cemetery in northern Virginia just across the Potomac River from Washington. The roads were reopened later in the day. No explosives or other suspicious material were found in the vehicle, FBI Special Agent Brenda Heck said. A backpack the detained man was carrying held bags of a ""non-explosive unknown material"" that was being investigated, she said. At the White House, Press Secretary Jay Carney said that ""there were no dangerous materials or explosives found."" The FBI statement said Melaku, of nearby Alexandria, Virginia, was detained for trespass in Arlington National Cemetery when it was closed. Public safety concerns over items Melaku was carrying led to the road closures, according to the FBI. After the car parked near the Pentagon was searched and removed, the FBI and Fairfax County Policy also searched Melaku's Alexandria residence, the FBI statement said. ""At this time, law enforcement believes Melaku acted alone and that there were no other locations or activity involved,"" said the FBI statement. According to the U.S. Marine Corps, Melaku joined the Marine Corps Reserve in September 2007 and currently is listed as a Marine Corps reservist lance corporal and a motor vehicle operator with the Combat Engineer Support Company of the 4th Combat Engineer Battalion in the 4th Marine Division. He has been awarded the National Defense Service Medal and the Selected Marine Corps Reserve Medal, and he was not deployed overseas, said the information from the Marine Corps. A source in the military said Melaku had ""fallen off the radar as a  Marine."" He has failed to pass required fitness tests, and records show that he was given a non-recommendation for promotion, according to the source. The security perimeter set up in the incident was part of the normal response to what Heck called suspicious activity by Melaku. ""From the FBI's perspective, it was just due diligence to protect this area,"" she said. No charges have been filed against the detained man, Heck said, emphasizing that the investigation was still in an early stage. A law enforcement official said the material in Melaku's backpack, which Melaku told authorities was ammonium nitrate, turned out to be inert. The official also said that contrary to some early news reports, no al Qaeda literature was found, but Melaku had a notebook in his backpack in which the words ""Taliban"" and ""al Qaeda"" were scrawled. In addition, the source said some spent 9mm shell casings were found but could not say whether they were in the car or the backpack. According to U.S. Park Police Sgt. David Schlosser, the detained man ""wasn't forthcoming"" about his identification or what he was doing in the national cemetery after midnight. The security response was based on how authorities handle situations involving suspicious individuals or vehicles, Schlosser said. A Department of Homeland Security statement called the situation ""a law enforcement matter at this time, with the U.S. Park Police and the Arlington County Police Department as leads and other federal agencies on the scene.""

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greece is preparing to sell off billions of dollars worth of state assets including airports, highways and state-owned companies, as well as banks, real estate and gaming licenses, to meet international lenders' demands that it raise funds. European finance ministers said Sunday that they were on track to give Greece a second huge bailout to keep the government afloat, but reiterated that Athens had to take tough measures to get it. Greece has to raise 50 billion euros ($71 billion) through privatization by 2015, Eurogroup members said. It also has to push through tough budget-cutting measures, they said, despite widespread protests in the country that forced a government reshuffle last week. Prime Minister George Papandreou faces a vote of confidence in his new ministers this week as his party clings to a wafer-thin majority in parliament. Acknowledging the anger in the streets, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the moves would bring ""hardships"" but were ""long overdue."" ""If there were an easier route out of the crisis, we would have taken it. But there is not,"" Barroso said in a written statement after meeting with Papandreou. ""The only way for Greece to return to growth and create jobs in a sustainable way is to restore competitiveness and put its public finances on a solid footing."" Barroso said the ""crucial vote"" will be at the end of June, when lawmakers are slated to vote on the privatization plan and further tax increases, pension cuts and layoffs of public workers. ""These choices are not easy, but nor are the problems that need to be addressed,"" he said. ""Now is not the time to falter."" Harsh reforms designed to help reduce Greece's enormous budget deficit have so far led to tax hikes and public-sector job losses alongside already record-high unemployment. Papandreou faces opposition from within his own ruling socialists over the austerity measures needed to secure an additional bailout package. Anti-government protests turned violent Wednesday, as demonstrators threw gasoline bombs at the Finance Ministry and police fired tear gas at protesters, police said. But over the weekend, Papandreou told lawmakers, ""The government must stop spending more than it takes in."" The Greek debt crisis raises concerns for Europe's currency, the euro. A default on its debts by Greece, or other struggling nations such as Portugal or Ireland, could adversely affect the world economy. European stocks fell in afternoon trading Monday as investors worried the trouble could spread. After meeting with Papandreou, European Council President Herman van Rompuy expressed his ""strong support"" for the Greek prime minister's economic reforms and said he had underlined the need for further efforts. But Van Rompuy noted that ""national consensus"" was needed for the package to succeed, ""given the length, magnitude and nature of required reforms."" There are fears that efforts to restructure Greece's debt could send shock waves through Europe's banking sector and spark investor panic similar to that in the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, the U.S.-based global investment bank. On June 9, the Cabinet approved a tough five-year plan for 2011-15 and introduced a bill in Parliament to put austerity measures into effect. The government proposes reducing the public-sector workforce by 150,000; workers will also face changes in working hours, practices and wages, and the plan also sets out changes to social benefits, including pensions and unemployment aid. According to the Finance Ministry, these measures will help achieve 28.3 billion euros ($40.5 billion) in cuts from 2012 to 2015, and shrink Greece's public deficit to less than 3% of gross domestic product, in accordance with the EU target. The government has said the passage of these additional measures is essential to Greece's securing the fifth portion of the original 110 billion-euro ($158 billion) bailout package that Greece signed with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund last year to prevent the country from defaulting on its debts. CNN's Diana Magnay and journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.","NEW: European Council president says a national consensus is needed .

"(CNN) -- What happened to the attorney general of Hama? The mystery surrounding judge Adnan Bakkour deepened Thursday as Syrian state media and the attorney general himself offered conflicting narratives of his whereabouts. Syria's state news agency first highlighted Bakkour's case Tuesday, when it reported that he had been kidnapped by ""seven gunmen with rifles and machine guns"" near the village of Karnaz. The next day, however, a video emerged on YouTube where a gray-haired man in a gray suit and tie introduced himself to the camera as Bakkour. ""I announce my resignation from my position with the Assad regime and his gangs,"" the judge said. Bakkour calmly read from a piece of paper, while seated at a desk, with a glass of water by his left hand and a Toshiba laptop by his right. He went on to list reasons for his resignation. Bakkour accused Syrian authorities of killing 72 prisoners at the central prison in Hama. He claimed there was a mass grave with 420 bodies in a place called Al Khalidiya, and accused the government of trying to frame the opposition for the killings. ""They (the government) asked me to prepare a report and present it to them showing that the victims were killed by the protesters,"" Bakkour said. The attorney general also accused security services of torturing and killing more than 300 demonstrators. CNN cannot independently confirm these claims. The government in Damascus has denied repeated requests for CNN journalists to visit Syria. Soon after the release of Bakkour's video resignation, the Syrian state news agency SANA fired back, saying the attorney general had been coerced by kidnappers to make false statements. Citing an unnamed ""official source"" in the city of Hama, SANA wrote that ""armed terrorist groups who kidnapped"" Bakkour ""forced him to say these lies at gunpoint."" The SANA article accused the Arabic news channel Al Jazeera of collaborating with kidnappers to mislead Syrian public opinion. But hours later, Bakkour was back on camera in another video uploaded to YouTube. This time, he appeared standing, wearing the same suit, but now without a tie. ""What Syrian TV broadcast that I had been kidnapped by armed groups is untrue,"" Bakkour said. ""I am now protected by the rebels and I am in good health. Today is Wednesday August 31st. Shabiha (pro-government militia) tried to kidnap me today but they failed to do so. I will make live statements as soon as I leave Syria, soon."" If Bakkour has in fact defected, it would mark a major blow to the Syrian government, said one prominent Syrian activist in exile,. ""He (Bakkour) has been appointed directly by the minister of justice. He is the highest authority among all the judges in Hama,"" said Rami Abdulrahman, director of the London-based Syrian Observatory of Human Rights. ""We cannot confirm whether or not he has defected or whether he has been kidnapped,"" Abdulrahman added. The western Syrian city of Hama has been at the center of the protests, with fierce crackdowns last month that included military tanks and government forces raiding homes. Since the uprising first erupted in Syria more than five months ago, a number of men have appeared in similar videos wearing military uniforms and announcing their defection from the Syrian army. Meanwhile, Syrian state TV has also broadcast televised confessions of men who claimed to commit acts of political violence on the part of the Syrian opposition. The United Nations Human Rights Commissioner has reported that more than 2,200 people have been killed since the security forces launched a bloody campaign to crush anti-government protests last March. Citing a pattern of widespread, systematic human rights abuses, UN Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay says the Damascus regime may be guilty of ""crimes against humanity.""","State media reports that he was kidnapped by seven gunmen .

"(CNN) -- The global H1N1 pandemic is over, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization said Tuesday. ""We are moving out of the pandemic into the post-pandemic period,"" said Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO. Chan said that while several countries -- including India and New Zealand -- are still experiencing significant H1N1 flu transmission, out-of-season flu outbreaks are no longer being reported in the northern or southern hemispheres. ""This pandemic has turned out to have been much more fortunate than what we feared a little over a year ago,"" Chan told reporters in a news conference Tuesday. She attributed the end of the pandemic to several factors: that the virus did not mutate to a more lethal form, the H1N1 flu vaccine proved to be a good match and widespread resistance to the antiviral drug Tamiflu did not develop. ""This time around, we have been aided by pure good luck,"" Chan said. The WHO announced the global H1N1 pandemic June 11, 2009. A pandemic is a sudden outbreak of a disease that is spread by human transmission, which quickly becomes widespread and affects a large region or several countries. The CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, said the U.S. Public Health emergency for H1N1 ended on June 23 of this year. H1N1 is no longer the dominating flu strain. Chan said health officials are now seeing a mixed virus pattern: In addition to the H1N1 strain, an H3N2 flu strain and Influenza B virus also are circulating. All three strains are included in the upcoming seasonal flu vaccine. So H1N1 is not gone, but as the WHO explains, the flu activity health officials are now seeing is typical seasonal flu activity. The CDC statement came after an emergency committee of the WHO said Tuesday the public health emergency triggered by the emergence of the H1N1 virus ""should be considered over."" The committee advised Chan ""that the world was no longer experiencing an influenza pandemic,"" the organization said in a statement. CNN""s Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","World Health Organization chief says the global H1N1 pandemic is over .

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Serena Williams joined her sister Venus in the last 16 at Wimbledon on Saturday, but French Open runner-up Francesca Schiavone suffered a shock defeat. Williams, seeded seventh in only her second tournament since last year's victory in London, had few problems in dispatching Russia's Maria Kirilenko 6-3 6-2 to set up a fourth-round clash with 2007 runner-up Marion Bartoli. ""Every match is getting better, my serve is getting better, just getting the rhythm that I've been missing. It's great,"" said the American, a four-time winner of the grass-court grand slam event. ""I just want to enjoy myself and stay focused. Bartoli is really good. She won in Eastbourne, she's doing great, so it'll be a good match."" Can the Williams sisters triumph after a troubled year? The 29-year-old, making her comeback after complications with a foot injury, has won both their previous encounters. Ninth seed Bartoli, beaten by Venus in the 2007 final, battled her way into the fourth round with a 5-7 6-4 9-7 win over Italian No. 21 Flavia Pennetta in just over three hours. The Frenchwoman, who won her first grass title the week before Wimbledon, fought back after sending her coach and father Walter to the stands along with her mother following her first-set reverse. ""I saw them after the match and they understood completely. It was not against them. It was just that we played a very long first set, and I was exhausted and I was tired and I was feeling worse and worse,"" the 26-year-old said in quotes reported by AFP. ""I needed to get that frustration out, so I showed it that way. I could have broken a racquet. I normally never act like that. I felt at this point I had to get all this frustration out and start again."" Schiavone was also involved in an epic match against unseeded Austrian Tamira Paszek, which resumed at one set all after being halted by rain on Friday. The Italian sixth seed ended up losing 3-6 6-4 11-9 in three hours and 41 minutes against a player who also reached the fourth round as a 16-year-old in 2007 but hasn't got past the first stage since then. Schiavone, who won her first grand slam at the 2010 French Open, has only once progressed past the third round, reaching the quarterfinals two years ago. The world No. 80 has a great chance of making the quarterfinals as she next faces 20-year-old Russian left-hander Ksenia Pervak, who knocked out 11th seed Andrea Petkovic on Friday to continue her promising debut appearance. World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki remains on course for her first grand slam title after beating Australian 27th seed Jarmila Gajdosova 6-3 6-2. The 20-year-old Dane will next play Slovakian 24th seed Dominika Cibulkova, who reached the fourth round for the first time with a 6-4 1-6 6-3 win over German No. 16 Julia Gorges. Wozniacki could face fifth seed Maria Sharapova in the quarterfinals after the 2004 champion progressed with a 6-2 6-3 win over Klara Zakopalova of the Czech Republic. The Russian will begin the second week of the tournament with a clash against Peng Shuai, the only Chinese player left in the draw. Peng, seeded 20th, will be hoping to repeat compatriot Li Na's victory over Sharapova at the French Open after earning her place with a 6-2 7-6 (7-5) victory over Hungary's Melinda Czink. Sabine Lisicki, who eliminated Roland Garros winner Li in the second round, continued her progress with a 6-4 6-2 win over Japan's Misaki Doi. The German will next play world No. 81 Petra Cetkovska, who eliminated Serbian 18th seed Ana Ivanovic. The winner of that match will next face Serena Williams or Bartoli. Cetkovska, who has never before made it past the first round at Wimbledon, won 6-2 7-6 (7-0) against the former world No. 1 and 2008 French Open champion. The rest of the last-16 draw sees five-time champion Venus Williams face 2010 semifinalist Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria, while fourth seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus plays Russia's Nadia Petrova and Czech eighth seed Petra Kvitova takes on Belgian No. 18 Yanina Wickmayer.","Serena Williams beats Russia's Maria Kirilenko to reach fourth round at Wimbledon .

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House and House Speaker John Boehner's office announced Thursday they reached agreement for President Barack Obama to address a joint session of Congress on September 8, resolving a dispute that temporarily overshadowed the focus of the planned speech -- job creation and economic growth. In simultaneous statements, Boehner's spokesman said Obama had been invited to give his speech at 7 p.m. ET next Thursday and the White House said the invitation was accepted. The agreement concluded an unusual spat over the usually non-controversial act of scheduling a presidential speech to Congress. The situation left Obama and the White House struggling to focus attention on the jobs package he will present rather than a backroom showdown that some labeled as childish and nonsense. On Wednesday night, the White House agreed to move Obama's address back one day -- from September 7 to September 8 -- after Republican complaints and follow-up consultations with Boehner. The story generated front-page media coverage Thursday that highlighted the dispute and generated harsh criticism of how the situation was handled. ""This really is just a new indicator, really a new low, about how dysfunctional the atmosphere in Washington, D.C., is,"" CNN political contributor John Avlon said. Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman said on NBC's ""Today"" show that the scheduling spat was ""nonsense"" and showed what people ""hate about politics."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney downplayed the dispute to reporters, saying the American people ""do not give a lick about what day next week the president speaks before Congress."" Obama decided this week that he wanted to deliver his speech on job creation to a joint session of Congress, and September 7 was the first day that both the House and Senate would be in session after their summer recess, Carney said. ""Wednesday was the soonest possible day upon their return from recess,"" Carney said of the date sought by Obama. Of moving the speech back a day, Carney said: ""Thursday is fine."" Asked about what Obama will say in the speech, Carney refused to provide specifics, but said that ""if members of Congress come back focused on the need to grow the economy and increase hiring, they will believe this is a good proposal."" A White House statement Wednesday night attempted to sum up the episode as a professional misunderstanding. ""Today, the president asked to address the Congress about the need for urgent action on the economic situation facing the American people as soon as Congress returned from recess,"" the statement said. ""Both Houses will be back in session after their August recess on Wednesday, September 7th, so that was the date that was requested. We consulted with the speaker about that date before the letter was released, but he determined Thursday would work better."" If only it had been that smooth. What actually happened was a day of back-and-forth accusations that dominated the news cycle and portrayed Washington as unable to work out relatively straightforward scheduling agreements, let alone major policy and legislative packages on job creation and deficit reduction. Aides from both parties, almost all of them speaking on condition of not being identified, tried to portray the other side as the culprit. Republicans said Boehner's office was never consulted before the White House announced around noon Wednesday it was requesting the joint session at 8 p.m. on September 7. That timing conflicts with a Republican presidential debate at the Reagan Library in California. In a letter to Obama later in the day, Boehner complained the White House's request would leave insufficient time for a security sweep of the premise following the first House legislative session after its return from the summer recess. In response, a senior White House official said Chief of Staff Bill Daley spoke with Boehner an hour in advance of going public with the request, and that no objections were raised. A Boehner aide said Thursday that during that phone conversation, Daley told Boehner the specific date and time in the letter but never specifically asked for Boehner to either approve or disapprove at that moment. In moving the speech to September 8, the White House faced the possibility of conflicting with the opening game of the National Football League schedule -- an event particularly anticipated this year because of the labor dispute that once threatened to cancel the season. However, Carney said Obama would finish before the football game began. Another source, a senior White House official, said the decision to change the date, rather than challenge the Republican opposition to September 7, was based on a desire to focus the debate on job creation instead of a scheduling fight. The White House statement Wednesday night tried to emphasize what Obama will say in the speech. ""The president is focused on the urgent need to create jobs and grow our economy, so he welcomes the opportunity to address a joint session of Congress on Thursday, September 8th and challenge our nation's leaders to start focusing 100% of their attention on doing whatever they can to help the American people,"" it said. On Thursday, the Economic Club in Washington announced Boehner will address the group on September 15, a week after the president's speech. A Boehner spokesman said the topic will be jobs and the economy. Initially, the dispute over the timing of Obama's speech focused on logistics. Events like the president's State of the Union address typically involve as much as four to six weeks of lead time and consultation, with a series of meetings among police, Secret Service officials and others, a Republican aide noted, and Boehner's letter to Obama complained the president's proposed timing would make it impossible to complete proper security steps in Congress. The conflict then shifted to consultation, specifically who did or didn't properly notify the other side. A White House official said Boehner's office was consulted and raised no objection. That prompted Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck to insist that ""no one in the speaker's office -- not the speaker, not any staff -- signed off on the date the White House announced today."" ""Unfortunately, we weren't even asked if that date worked for the House,"" Buck said. ""Shortly before it arrived this morning, we were simply informed that a letter was coming. It's unfortunate the White House ignored decades -- if not centuries -- of the protocol of working out a mutually agreeable date and time before making any public announcement."" A senior Democratic aide familiar with scheduling such events in previous administrations said ""the childish behavior coming out of the speaker's office today is truly historic."" ""It is unprecedented to reject the date that a president wants to address a joint session of the Congress,"" the senior Democratic aide said. ""People die and state funerals are held with less fuss, so the logistics excuse by the speaker's office is laughable. Yes, consultation always occurs, but the president always gets the date he wants."" Meanwhile, an aide to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Boehner didn't consult with House Democratic leaders about seeking a new date for Obama's speech. Obama's request for a September 7 speech was accepted by the leadership of the Democratic-controlled Senate, according to a Democratic Senate leadership aide. However, approval of leaders from both chambers of Congress is required for such a presidential request to be accepted. The address to Congress is intended to provide a prime-time platform for the rollout of his highly anticipated job growth plan. ""Our nation faces unprecedented economic challenges, and millions of hard-working Americans continue to look for jobs,"" Obama said in a letter sent earlier Wednesday to Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. ""As I have traveled across our country this summer and spoken with our fellow Americans, I have heard a consistent message: Washington needs to put aside politics and start making decisions based on what is best for our country and not what is best for each of our parties in order to grow the economy and create jobs. We must answer this call."" The national unemployment rate currently stands at 9.1% -- a figure all but ensuring that the state of the fragile economy will remain the dominant issue of the 2012 presidential campaign. CNN's Brianna Keilar, Deirdre Walsh, Kate Bolduan, Jessica Yellin and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama's speech will be at 7 p.m. on September 8 .

"Washington (CNN) -- The wife of Rep. Anthony Weiner returned home from a work trip Wednesday as her husband faced mounting pressure to resign over a ""sexting"" scandal that he lied about before admitting his involvement. Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, is a top aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with whom she had been traveling in the Middle East and Africa since June 8. Abedin, who is pregnant with the couple's first child, returned home Wednesday morning, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of not being identified. Colleagues of Weiner have said he wanted to wait until he could talk to his wife in person before making a decision on his career. A former adult film actress currently working as a stripper said she exchanged e-mails and Twitter messages with Weiner for more than two months. The woman, whose lawyer identified her as Ginger Lee, told reporters in New York on Wednesday that Weiner asked her to lie about it after the scandal broke. ""He asked me to lie about our communication,"" said the woman. She said she issued a three-sentence communication that said, ""I haven't met Representative Weiner. I follow him on Twitter because I support him and what he stands for. I have been hounded by his political opponents, but that has not changed my view of him and what he fights for."" Afterward, she said, ""I did not want to say anything further. I refused to lie, so I went silent and went into hiding."" On June 2, she said, Weiner called her and told her that, if she said nothing to the news media over the following weekend, the story would die. ""I did what he told me to do,"" she said. ""But it did not."" By then, Lee said, her lupus was flaring, she needed the money she would have been making had she continued working and she had received ""threats"" from someone about releasing a statement that she had not authorized. Lee did not elaborate, but said she then arranged for lawyer Gloria Allred to represent her. Asked who had threatened her client, Allred said, ""I would rather not name the individual. He knows who he is."" Though Lee said she initially admired Weiner for his views on Planned Parenthood and health care, her view of the congressman has changed. ""I think that Anthony Weiner should resign because he lied to the public and the press for more than a week,"" said Lee, who was working Wednesday night at a nightclub in Atlanta, Georgia. ""If he lied about this, I can't have much faith in him about anything else."" Allred said her client had received about 100 e-mails from Weiner between March and two weeks ago, when they stopped. ""I have wardrobe demands too,"" the lawyer read from one. ""I need to highlight my package."" ""All right, my package and I are not going to beg,"" read another. ""We both see the hazard of going down the path of comparative sexiness. At least with you, the intrusion ends after a few gawks. I get dragged into long commentary sessions at the corner bodega."" ""You aren't giving my package due credit,"" read yet another. Lee said she never reciprocated when he made suggestive comments. Allred said Lee, who is single, never met Weiner, never received any photographs from him and never sent him any. ""Overall, the e-mails were really not about sex,"" the lawyer said. In addition, the two talked only once, on the phone, she added. Weiner, who admitted sending lewd online messages and photos to women over the past three years, announced Saturday he is seeking treatment and requested a ""short leave of absence"" from Congress. Top leaders from both parties, including President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, have said or suggested that Weiner should step down over the controversy, which has been a major story since the news emerged in late May. A Democratic leadership aide insisted Wednesday night there was no specific move to start the ball rolling removing Weiner from the Energy and Commerce Committee. The aide did say, ""There is a leadership meeting tomorrow to talk about a variety of subjects. And I am sure Weiner will come up."" On Tuesday, a Democratic colleague of the New York congressman said that Weiner might resign ""in a couple of days."" However, Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of New York did not say where she got her information. In response to a question about whether Congress can get on with business if Weiner stays in office, McCarthy responded, ""We're going to find out. Hopefully. We're hearing that he might resign in a couple of days."" Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colorado, said, ""If it were me, I would resign,"" but that the decision was up to Weiner and his constituents. Obama told NBC that he, too, would step down if he was in Weiner's position, while Boehner, R-Ohio, said Tuesday that Weiner should resign. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, declined to echo that call, citing his own scandal from the 1980s involving his relationship with a male prostitute who then used Frank's apartment to carry out his business. ""It's time for me to show a bit of a humility"" and not ""set myself up as the judge of others,"" Frank said.","NEW: Woman says Weiner asked her to lie about their communication .

"(CNN) -- Can the ""birthers"" ever be convinced that Barack Obama was born in America and is eligible to serve as president? Probably not, according to one prominent psychology professor and other political observers. Since Obama launched his bid for the White House, a sizable minority of Americans has expressed strong doubts about whether he was actually born in the United States. Over the past few years, the allegation that he was born overseas -- in Kenya or perhaps Indonesia -- has taken on a life of its own, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll showed that roughly 25% of Americans -- including over four in 10 Republicans -- believe Obama was definitely or probably not born in the United States. Earlier this week, CNN released the results of its own investigation into the controversy. Documents and statements from numerous public officials and childhood friends made clear that the president was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961. On Wednesday, Obama himself addressed the issue, pleading for an end to the distractions of ""sideshows"" and ""carnival barkers."" The president yielded to demands from his critics that he release his original long-form birth certificate, filing a special legal request with Hawaiian authorities to release a document that is no longer used for official purposes and ordinarily remains buried in the basement archives of the state health department. Obama's 2008 release of the more common ""live birth certification"" -- a short computer-generated form typically used for documentation purposes -- did little to silence the chorus of skeptics. It remains to be seen whether Wednesday's release will be received any differently. But the early reaction wasn't exactly positive. One of the main websites pushing the birther claims -- birthers.org -- declared that ""forgery or not, now we can debate the true meaning of a natural born citizen."" The U.S. Constitution says only ""natural born"" citizens can become president -- a vague clause that some members of the birther movement contend disqualifies Obama if he was born outside the United States. Joseph Farah, editor-in-chief of the conservative website WorldNetDaily.com, said that ""we know (Obama's) father was a Kenyan citizen, and that he would therefore confer Kenyan or U.K. citizenship on his son, which would at best make him a dual citizen."" Dual citizenship, Farah asserted, ""is not what the Founders had in mind when they coined the phrase 'natural born citizen.'"" Sharon Guthrie, the legislative director for a Texas state representative backing a bill requiring proof of citizenship for presidential ballot access, told the website Slate.com that she was still suspicious. ""What they produced today ... still says certificate of live birth across the top,"" she said. ""We want to see a 'birth certificate.' ... The one that we have that says 'birth certificate' is from Mombassa, Kenya, with his footprint on it. He has still not produced an American birth certificate."" Why the unrelenting skepticism? Emory University's Drew Westen, author of the ""The Political Brain"" and an informal advisor to Obama's 2008 campaign, chalked up much of it to Obama's reluctance to immediately rebut the charge more quickly in the presidential race. ""The right wing was attempting to make him 'one of them' as opposed to 'one of us,'"" he claimed. Westen, a professor of psychology and psychiatry, cited what psychologists call the ""sleeper effect."" ""If you present negative information about someone and it initially goes unchallenged, you might alter some people's conscious beliefs by challenging it later,"" he asserted. ""But they are left with a negative gut-level feeling that doesn't go away."" ""Political feelings, once they are strongly held, tend to be resistant to facts. It's just the result of the way our brains work,"" he said. Westen mentioned the so-called ""Swift Boat"" attacks against Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry in 2004, which called into question the senator's service in Vietnam. Kerry ""allowed his honor to be challenged and didn't respond for weeks,"" Westen said. ""When finally he did respond and had definitive evidence that the attacks were untrue, it was too late. People's feelings towards him had already changed. They wouldn't change back by that point."" Along similar lines, Westen told CNN that if staunch Democrats or Republicans are presented with clear evidence of wrongdoing on the part of their party's nominee shortly before an election, they'll come up with ""every kind of rationalization to explain it away."" ""We fight off information that makes us feel bad and gravitate toward information that makes us comfortable,"" he said. Westen also brought up the explosive issue of race, one of the biggest political lightning rods in U.S. history. He insisted the birther movement never would have taken hold with a white president. It's not fair to call a large segment of today's electorate ""1950s-style racists,"" he said. But some people are ""unconsciously prejudiced in a way that predisposes them to not believing that a black man with a funny name could have really been legitimately elected president of the United States."" But Bill Mayer, a Northeastern University political scientist, took issue with the notion of race as the critical component of the birther movement. ""The fact that Obama is black may affect the form of the conspiracy, but probably not the fact that there is a following for this rumor,"" he told CNN. ""Conspiracy beliefs have a long history in American politics."" Mayer cited a range of political conspiracy theories, including claims regarding the Kennedy assassination, involvement on the part of the Clintons in alleged murders, and George W. Bush's supposed knowledge of the 9/11 terror attacks. Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley noted that, back in the 19th century, questions were raised over the American roots of Andrew Jackson and Chester Arthur. But it was ""nothing like this,"" he told CNN. ""We are now in the age of electronic journalism. ... This has become a ghastly scenario (over) the last month."" Mayer suggested that Obama's release of the long-form birth certificate will ""further marginalize those who insist (the matter of his birth) is an open question."" Still, he added, ""I don't understand why the White House took so long"" to put out the document. Just how long will the controversy drag on? Westen claimed the birther issue will continue to be political fodder until a critical mass of Republican leaders decide it's making the GOP look ""foolish"" and hurting the party among independent voters. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, released a statement Wednesday claiming that the controversy ""has long been a settled issue."" History suggests otherwise. CNN's Brian Todd and Shannon Travis contributed to this report .","A significant portion of the electorate continues to believe Obama wasn't born in America .

"(CNN) -- Mass protests unfolded in Syria on Friday, and related unrest reverberated across the Lebanese and Turkish borders in a volatile day that left at least nine people dead. Rami Abdelrahman of the London-based Syria Observatory for Human Rights said four people died in Homs and one in Deir El Zour during demonstrations in Syria. Fighting over the Syrian issue left at least four dead in Lebanon, and the number of Syrian refugees now in Turkey is approaching 10,000. Protests swarmed several towns big and small across the country, including the Damascus area, Latakia, Homs and Hama, where thousands rallied, Abdelrahman said. There were reports of detained demonstrators and the military deployment of tanks. There were reports of gunfire in Banias, a coastal city, Abdelrahman said. The government's state-run TV said Syrian security personnel were injured by ""militants"" in the Damascus suburb of Al-Qaboun. The Syrian government has consistently blamed the protest casualties on ""armed gangs,"" and the TV report said the injuries occurred when the perpetrators opened fire in Al-Qaboun, just outside the capital. Nearly 1,000 people in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli gathered Friday after prayers ""in a demonstration in support for the Syrian people,"" the Lebanese National News Agency reported, and fighting ensued between Lebanese Alawites and Sunnis. Clashes in Tripoli killed one soldier and three civilians and injured two soldiers and 10 civilians, the army said. The news agency said one of those killed was an official with the Democratic Arab Party, an Alawite entity. The Lebanese prime minister, Najib Nikati, said the army dispatched reinforcements to Tripoli neighborhoods to impose law and order. The Alawite faith is an offshoot of Shiite Islam that dominates Syrian leadership; President Bashar al-Assad is an Alawite. The majority of Syrians are Sunni Muslim. There's been tension between the two groups in Lebanon. Alawites and Sunni/leftist militias fought at different junctures during the 1975-90 civil war until the Syrians established a presence there. The majority of the Sunnis in Tripoli loathe the Syrian regime, but the Alawites in northern Lebanon thrived during the Syrian presence. Tensions have increased between the groups during the most recent Syrian crisis. And as international powers urge Syria to initiate serious reforms and stop its bloody crackdown against demonstrators, Rami Makhlouf, the powerful head of the Syriatel phone company and part of the regime's inner circle, has announced that he plans to quit his business and go into charity work. Makhlouf, who is the cousin and confidant of al-Assad's, is widely unpopular among protesters and is a symbol among many citizens of the regime. His move, announced Thursday, is seen by some observers as an effort to placate anti-government sentiment. Abdelrahman said he thinks Makhlouf's decision came as a result of this week's talks between Turkey and Syria to find a solution to the crisis and stem the Syrian refugee flow to Turkey. ""The people are aggravated by his control over the economy,"" Abdelrahman said. Makhlouf's name reverberated at one of Friday's mass demonstrations. A crowd chanted ""No to Makhlouf, no to Assad; we just want Syria free,"" according to an Arabic-language news network. Mass protests with specific themes have been held every Friday for weeks after Muslim prayers. Opposition leaders Friday planned demonstrations dubbed ""Friday of Saleh al-Ali,"" referring to a prominent Alawite who commanded one of the first rebellions against the French mandate of Syria in the early 20th century. Some opposition activists said they hope the name prompts the powerful minority ruling class, which is composed primarily of Alawites, to join the demonstrations demanding the fall of the al-Assad regime. They also say the name sends the message that their demands are not directed against Alawites but against the regime. Demonstrators began protests three months ago in the southern city of Daraa and immediately were greeted by a tough government response. Anti-government sentiment caught fire, and protests spread across the country, leaving more than 1,100 dead and thousands more incarcerated. Many Syrians fleeing the violence continued to pour across the Turkish border. Actress Angelina Jolie, who is a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency, went to southern Turkey on Friday to visit the refugees, a trip aimed at shining a spotlight on the plight of civilians in the country. She was headed to a camp in Altinozu. Turkey's state-run Anatolian Agency reported Jolie's arrival at the Hatay airport. Officials greeted her amid tight security, and provincial officials arranged vans for her transportation to the Altinozu refugee camp. ""Toys unloaded from the plane were loaded to one of the vans in her convoy,"" the report said. Refugees there are housed in warehouses at an old tobacco factory, and they staged a demonstration at the camp. They held up signs that said ""Our military is killing its own people, please make it stop"" and ""U.N., help us please,"" and people chanted ""stop killing children"" and other anti-regime slogans. The number of Syrian refugees in Turkey now stands at 9,693, according to a provincial Turkish official. Many of them escaped a security crackdown in and around the town of Jisr al-Shugur, and many took refuge in Syrian locations near the border. Gunshots rang out near the border, according to Mohammed, an activist and resident of Jisr al-Shugur based along the border, and people think the Syrian army might be a few miles away.

"(CNN) -- Jo-Wilfried Tsonga ended Roger Federer's hopes of winning a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon title on Wednesday as the French 12th seed staged a stunning fightback to reach the semifinals. Federer appeared to be cruising into the last four after winning the first two sets, but Tsonga inflicted the Swiss world No. 3's first defeat from that vantage point in 179 grand slam matches. It was only the third time in the 29-year-old's glittering career that the 16-time grand slam champion had surrendered a two-set lead. Tsonga, ranked 19th in the world, triumphed 3-6 6-7 (3-7) 6-4 6-4 6-4 on Centre Court, serving out to love as he earned a clash with second seed Novak Djokovic. The Serbian, who beat Tsonga in the 2008 Australian Open final, ended the dream run of Australian 18-year-old Bernard Tomic. Tsonga defeated Federer for just the second time in six meetings, their first on grass. ""It was amazing. I played unbelievable. It's never easy to come back against Roger. I'm so happy, it's crazy,"" the 26-year-old told reporters after reaching the semifinals at Wimbledon for the first time. ""He's the biggest champion in the sport. He has achieved so much and is the best player in the world. To be two sets down and come back was unbelievable. I served really well. Against Djokovic I will have to come out and do the same again."" Federer has now lost in the quarterfinals two years in a row, being beaten by eventual runner-up Tomas Berdych in 2010. ""Jo played great. Really from start to finish I don't remember seeing a break point after I broke him in the first game,"" Federer said. ""But I was close. I had all my chances. I'm actually pretty pleased with my performance today. It's kind of hard going out of the tournament that way, but unfortunately it does happen sometimes."" Tsonga's shock win also ended hopes of a rematch of the French Open semifinals from the start of this month, when Federer halted Djokovic's unbeaten start to 2011 before losing to Rafael Nadal in the final. Djokovic is now only one win away from overtaking defending champion Nadal at the top of the rankings following his 6-2 3-6 6-3 7-5 victory in two hours and 41 minutes. Tomic, who to come through qualifying rounds, was the youngest player to reach the quarterfinals since Boris Becker won the tournament for a second successive year in 1986. He leveled the match in the second set and led 3-1 in the third, but Djokovic stormed back to take seven successive games as he clinched his 46th victory in 47 matches this season. The 24-year-old will seek to reach his first Wimbledon final, having lost in the semis in 2007 and 2010. Nadal extended his unbeaten run in south-west London to 19 matches as he set up a rematch of his French Open semifinal against Andy Murray by ending the run of American 10th seed Mardy Fish. Fish eliminated Berdych in the previous round but was unable to go one step further, losing 6-3 6-3 5-7 6-4 to the Spaniard. Nadal played within himself against the 29-year-old, having injured his foot against Juan Martin del Potro on Monday, but the 10-time grand slam champion was never seriously threatened by a man he had beaten on five previous occasions. ""My foot is not fine, but this is the Wimbledon quarterfinals so I had to play,"" Nadal said. ""We decided to sleep the zone of the foot to play the rest of the tournament. When you sleep the foot before the match, the anesthetic is for five hours, so you don't feel nothing. ""This is my last tournament for a month or six weeks. It is always a dream for me to play at Wimbledon. I had to do it to play in the quarterfinals, and I'm going to do it for the semifinals too."" Fourth-ranked Murray reached the semifinals for the third successive year, beating Spain's Feliciano Lopez 6-3 6-4 6-4. The British player will on Friday have the chance to avenge his Paris defeat by Nadal, who also beat him at this stage at Wimbledon last year before winning his second grass-court grand slam. ""I think Feliciano was a little bit tired, but I served well for most of the match,"" Murray said. ""I'm playing well. I'm sure in the next round I'm going to get pushed even harder so I'll have to raise my game even more."" Lopez, a three-time quarterfinalist, played with his right leg strapped up following his win over Poland's Lukasz Kubot, when he came back from two sets down.","Jo-Wilfried Tsonga reaches Wimbledon semis for first time after beating Roger Federer .

"(CNN) -- On a hot April afternoon, young Rory McIlroy had the lead and only nine holes to play before he could become the Masters golf champion. Just 24 hours later, the Northern Irishman would tweet a picture of himself and Charl Schwartzel on a jet, both smiling, and one of them wearing the famed green jacket awarded to the winner of the most revered golf title in the world. It wasn't McIlroy. For on that April Sunday, he had fallen apart, blown his lead big-time, shooting a horrendous 8-over-par 80. Schwartzel leaped over him and other contenders to win one of the most exciting Masters ever with birdies on the final four holes. McIlroy's tumble started on the 10th hole, when he hit a tee shot like a public course duffer into the woods and ended up losing three strokes to par. But after his very visible loss, the then-21-year-old didn't hide from defeat or from the press. ""I didn't handle [the adversity on the course] particularly well, obviously, but it was a character-building day, put it that way,"" he said that night. ""I'll come out stronger for it."" Some of the media, impressed by his grace, trotted out the well-worn cliche: He has the talent, but time will tell if he has the stuff champions are made of. It didn't take long for McIlroy to prove he does. Two months later, in the next major golf tournament, he thoroughly dominated the U.S. Open field all four days, winning by an unheard-of eight shots. ""He's certainly captured everyone's imagination,"" said Gary Van Sickle, a senior writer for Sports Illustrated and Golf.com. But Van Sickle warned it might be a little early to call McIlroy the next Tiger Woods, who won the Masters at age 21 after winning three U.S. amateur championships. ""I would hold off on handing him the crown just yet,"" he said of the No. 3-ranked player in the world. ""But he's got a great swing, and he is impressive."" Comparisons are inevitable. Both started as very, very young players. Both appeared on a TV show as a prodigy -- Woods on Mike Douglas at age 3; McIlroy appearing on a Northern Ireland show at age 9. Both were beating older golfers while in their teens and winning many junior tournaments. McIlroy told CNN's Piers Morgan that he sees only a few connections between himself and Woods. ""You know, at 22, we both had one major. He won a couple more times than I have in my career,"" McIlroy said. ""But I mean I have to let other people make comparisons, because if I go -- am trying, you know, to chase his records -- I'll lose sight of what I need to do to actually -- to win tournaments."" And while trying to remain somewhat modest, he agreed with the assessment that he'll be mentioned in future discussions as the greatest ever. ""Yeah, I do. I do. But I don't really know if people want to hear that. I mean, I believe that myself. Yes,"" he told Morgan. ""I'm very confident in my own abilities. I believe in myself. ... ""I said something a couple of days ago. I said, I'm not playing for money, I'm playing for a place in history."" Both Woods and Jack Nicklaus have predicted a very high place in history for McIlroy. After the Open win, Nicklaus, who's counseled McIlroy for several years, said, ""He's humble when he ought to be and confident when he needs to be."" The mop-haired, freckled kid is very likeable, too, Van Sickle said, and not just because of his adorable looks. He's good people, too. It's isn't something put on for the fans now that he is rich and famous, the writer said. And it's not a recent development. Van Sickle recalled asking the young man for an interview as he readied for the 2007 British Open, one of his first times in the media spotlight.  Despite being pursued by the press, the then-18-year-old was like sure thing, whatever you need, no question is off limits. And he's still that same normal guy today, Van Sickle said. The kind of fella who gets on a plane just after choking away the lead at the Masters and tells his buddy, the guy who won, to put on the green jacket because he wants to take a picture. That he tweets with the message:  Flying to Malaysia with charl! Glad one of us has a green jacket on!!! Or the kind of lad who goes to Haiti the week before the U.S. Open, finding a little life perspective to help his golf game. McIlroy's success is no fluke, said Shane O'Donoghue, host of CNN's ""Living Golf."" His talent was obvious from the day McIlroy first picked up a club. Which was when he was 2. And he hit the ball 40 yards. It was his desire to be a great golfer that prompted his devoted parents, Gerry and Rosie, to get behind their prodigious child. They worked night shifts and two and three extra jobs to fund his ambitions. His dad often bartended at the Holywood Golf Club in County Down, where Rory would practice. To this day, McIlroy never takes this support for granted, O'Donoghue said. McIlroy has always been keen to point out that he was never pushed by his parents, that it was indeed him doing all the pushing, all the dreaming and, crucially, all the practice. His father is a good golfer, too, and with uncles who are also low handicappers, there has always been a competitive arena among the McIlroy clan since the earliest days at Holywood. That's where Rory's sporting passion was fostered. These days, McIlroy still often has family and friends nearby when he competes. They won't have too far to travel when the British Open, the third major of the year, tees off Thursday in Kent, England, with McIlroy likely to be the betting and fan favorite. ""He's going to have the crowd behind him like they were for Tiger when he was winning everything,"" Van Sickle said. ""It'll be a 'home game' for him. He's used to playing in that kind of weather, and he's going to have a big comfort zone. He'll be the favorite in the British Open for the next 10 years."" The Royal St. George's course is ""quirky,"" Van Sickle said. It's where a brisk wind can take a shot that starts in the center of the fairway and push it into rough terrain or worse -- deep bunkers. If McIlroy wins again, no doubt his popularity among fans in Europe and the United States will take off exponentially. The question then becomes: Will he continue to play mostly on his home continent, or will he come to America, where the tournament paydays are much larger? While it would disappoint PGA Tour officials, McIlroy will probably continue to play overseas, Van Sickle guessed. He can still play in eight to 10 tournaments in the U.S. (three majors and another handful of top-level tournaments) and still be a player whom advertisers will seek out. He already reportedly makes millions each year in endorsements and appearance fees. But the injured Woods missed the U.S. Open and will also sit out the British. He also missed a good portion of 2010 because of his infidelity scandal. Golf's popularity has suffered with the absence of the player who was a strong favorite to win every tournament he played. As Charley Hoffman told Alan Shipnuck of Sports Illustrated: ""But for casual fans, I think they need a dominant player to focus on. They need to know what the story line is."" If you were a wagering person, Van Sickle said, the smart money would be on a 22-year-old kid from Northern Ireland with a poodle-like fro and a big smile. And a man who learned a very big lesson on a miserable day in April.","Rory McIlroy, 22, hails from Northern Ireland, where he rose through the junior golf ranks .

"(CNN) -- When Eman al-Obeidy approached journalists last week at Tripoli's Rixos Hotel, she did more than accuse Moammar Gadhafi's men of rape. She also became the face of the anti-Gadhafi movement. Since the highly publicized incident, which ended with a hysterical al-Obeidy being whisked away by government minders, the 29-year-old lawyer from Tobruk has been celebrated as a symbol of Libyan defiance. ""Many Libyans I know online on social media are holding up Eman al-Obeidy as a hero,"" said Mona Eltahawy, an Egyptian-born journalist who writes columns on Arab and Muslim issues. ""And many people across the region -- Egyptians, Syrians -- (are) demanding to know where she is and fearing for her life."" A day after al-Obeidy was taken into custody, a spokesman for the Libyan government said she had been released. He also said her report -- that she was kidnapped and gang-raped by 15 of Gadhafi's men -- would be investigated. But nobody close to al-Obeidy, including her family, has heard from her since her reported release. Even if she is soon confirmed to be safe and sound, one could say the damage has already been done to Gadhafi's regime. Al-Obeidy's capture and detention added fuel to the Libyan opposition by garnering global sympathy for its cause. Facebook pages and Twitter feeds from around the world have continually paid tribute to al-Obeidy and made her a rallying cry for revolution. ""Everyone can see the expression, almost in real time, of the face of this woman being yanked by Gadhafi's security and alleging rape, which is very powerful,"" said Jamal Dajani, vice president of Middle East and North Africa for the Internews Network. ""And they can relate to how brave she was to ... put her story forward."" Al-Obeidy might be the latest symbol of Arab unrest, but she is far from the first. Iconic figures have also emerged in other countries: . -- In Egypt, Wael Ghonim helped mobilize Egypt's youth and force out President Hosni Mubarak, who had led the country since 1981. Ghonim, a 30-year-old Google executive, played a key role in organizing the anti-government protests in January. He was detained for 10 days by the government, but when he was released he became even more vocal, sitting down for media interviews and addressing thousands of demonstrators at Cairo's Tahrir Square. -- Before Ghonim in Egypt, there was fruit vendor Mohammed Bouazizi in Tunisia. Bouazizi, 26, kick-started the entire Arab upheaval after he lit himself on fire, protesting his humiliating treatment at the hands of the local government. Less than two weeks after his death, Tunisian President Zine el Abedine Ben Ali had resigned in the wake of massive public protests. ""Everyone tells me when I go there, 'If there were no Muhammed Bouazizi, none of this would have happened,' "" Dajani said. -- And even before the recent wave of unrest, there were the 2009 protests of the Iranian election. Neda Agha-Soltan, 26, became the rallying point of the protesters' struggle when she was fatally shot during the government's crackdown. Her death was captured on video and aired worldwide. ""When we look back, we tend to associate specific causes and struggles with individuals and particular moments,"" said Nader Hashemi, an assistant professor at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver. ""In the case of Egypt, for example, Wael Ghomin represents ... the core of the Egyptian democratic revolution that toppled Mubarak. When we think of him, details are not required. His name tells the story of an entire people and political cause."" The importance of having a 'face' The mass media and new technologies have played a tremendous role in creating these icons, Dajani said, and their influence cannot be overstated. ""If this would have happened 20 years ago, when we did not have satellite TV, when we did not have Facebook, when we did not have Twitter -- when we were dependent on the government-controlled media to report on the story -- then Mohammed Bouazizi would have died in vain and hardly anyone would have heard about him,"" he said. Dajani said that when he first started working in journalism, there were fewer than 100 satellite television stations in the Arab world. ""Now there are 750,"" he said. ""Three years ago, there were 400. So the governments ... they've lost control [of the message] pretty much all over the Middle East."" The exception to that might be in countries that heavily restrict foreign media, such as Iran and Syria. The death of Neda Agha-Soltan wasn't caught on television cameras -- it was captured by a cell phone. And despite the impact of her death in inspiring protest, the Iranian government was eventually able to quell the dissent. Nick Roberts, an assistant professor of history at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, said ""having someone as a face of a revolution is nothing new."" He pointed to historic figures such as Maximilien Robespierre in France, Vladimir Lenin in Russia and Che Guevara in Cuba. ""But the importance of having an immediate face for the revolution seems to be increasing in an age of 24-7 internet and television media coverage,"" he said. It also helps mobilize the public quickly and efficiently, Hashemi said. ""Successful revolutions require some form of mass mobilization to challenge established power,"" he said. ""These stories and individuals can inspire millions of people to sacrifice themselves and to take the necessary risks that are needed to push forward a political cause. ""Authoritarian regimes remain in power due to fear and political apathy. If this can be overcome, change becomes possible."" The power of one story cannot be underestimated, said John Robertson, a professor of Middle Eastern history at Central Michigan University. He experienced it himself when he was a student protesting the Vietnam War. ""I remember that one of the things that got us even more loudly into the streets was what we really saw as the martyrdom for Kent State students who were shot down in 1970,"" Robertson said. ""I remember so many of us walking around just infuriated and determined to work even harder to oppose (President) Nixon. ... In our minds, (these protesters) became sort of symbols for us of the need to be willing, if need be, to sacrifice yourself for a greater cause."" Robertson has been paying close attention to the ""Arab spring,"" discussing the latest developments on his blog and analyzing the politics in play. With civil unrest festering in countries such as Bahrain, Syria and Yemen, he expects more new faces to come to the forefront. ""It's going to be a very, very different era about to open up,"" he said. ""And there may be, as part of that, new heroes who are going to be emerging. ""People need heroes, and people often seize upon very unlikely heroes like Mohammed Bouazizi. You never know who it's going to be next.""","Alleged rape victim Eman al-Obeidy has become the public face of Libyan defiance .

"Madrid (CNN) -- A 24-year-old Australian man was gored in the thigh Friday, the second day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. At least three other runners went to hospital with injuries, officials said. The Australian man was gored in the bullring at the end of the course. One bull became separated from the pack and came last, and alone, to the bull ring. Television images showed the man coming up behind the lone bull, which then turned on the man, who suddenly slipped and fell to the ground. He was then gored in the thigh. He was immediately tended to the bullring medical staff. A hospital report on all the injured is due later. Four runners went to the hospital with injuries Thursday on the first day of the running of the bulls. Commentators on Spanish state television TVE considered it a relatively safe start to the dangerous annual tradition in Pamplona, which has tallied thousands of injuries and 15 deaths since record-keeping began in 1924, including the fatal goring of a Spanish man in 2009. The run in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s in his book ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title ""Fiesta."" It is now broadcast live across Spain by state television TVE, which pays Pamplona for exclusive rights, and positions some 20 cameras along the course. The daily run continues for eight days, through July 14, at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET). It is the highlight of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona that attracts hundreds of thousands to the nonstop fiesta.","The Australian man is gored in the bullring at the end of the course .

"(EW.com) -- If show business were high school (and isn't it, really?), Beyoncé would be a front-runner for valedictorian. She's a class act on and off the charts, a can-do girl who shares her gifts with everyone while keeping her beyond-fabulous life -- the Obamas on speed dial, Jay-Z at the dinner table -- largely to herself. Over the course of her three previous records, she's matured from Destiny's Child-hood into a formidable solo hitmaker with two of pop music's most transcendent chart-toppers, ''Crazy in Love'' and ''Single Ladies,'' tucked in the pocket of her Deréon jeans. So why does it feel like Beyoncé is struggling so hard to prove herself on ""4?"" The album is an every-song-for-itself welter of conflicting ambitions: It wants to be cutting-edge but familiar, accessible but artistic, hot-blooded but strictly impersonal. Those tensions hurt most in its lumbering first half, a defiant bird flipped at anyone expecting out-of-the-box radio killers. Instead, we get a sleepy recital of ballads, kicked off by the arid Prince-ipality of ''1+1'' and ''I Miss You,'' in which Bey pants and sweats and grunts (except, you know, sexy-like), her voice climbing ever higher in search of an octave big enough to hold it. ""I don't know much about guns/But I, I've been shot by you,'' she yelps on ''1+1,'' as if the love bullet were actually breaking skin. Vocally, she's never sounded better -- throaty and precise -- but the songs here just aren't her equal. While those efforts at least aim high, a few of ""4""'s lesser tracks feel like they were unsuccessfully bred in studio captivity for mass consumption. The familiar lite-FM bombast of ''Best Thing I Never Had'' proves her 2006 hit ''Irreplaceable'' is just that. ''I Was Here,'' co-written by Diane Warren, reaches Lifetime-movie levels of schmaltz, while the promisingly named ''Party,'' featuring Kanye and Andre 3000, turns out to be a slow-jam invitation to an after-work mixer with light refreshments. And when the 29 year old mimics Luther Vandross and Diana Ross on the charmingly goofy one-two of ''Love on Top'' and ''Rather Die Young,'' she gets lost in her idols' polyester-swathed shadows. Unsurprisingly, Beyoncé is at her best when she sounds like no one but herself. She takes her trusty freakum dress out of mothballs for the marching-band funk of ''Countdown,'' which includes such joy-inducing non-lyrics as ''Me and my boof, and my boof boof riding.'' On ''Run the World (Girls),'' the first single off the disc, she turns cheesy postfeminism into a martial foot-stomper that crackles like a burst of pirate-radio agitpop. (It bombed accordingly on the mainstream charts.) And the terrific ''End of Time'' seethes with off-balance harmonies, MJ-style ""Off the Wall"" horns and a bionic Bo Diddley beat, all while Bey howls her eternal love to everyone and no one in particular. It's exactly the kind of genre-busting risk that few other current pop stars would even attempt, let alone pull off flawlessly with a no-big-thing shrug. With more moments like that, ""4"" might have been an album fully worthy of her talent. As it is, though, even star students get the occasional B. See the original article on EW.com.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek lawmakers Wednesday approved a package of austerity measures demanded by international lenders, despite protests outside Parliament as they were voting, in a move that should clear the way for an emergency loan to Athens. Greek riot police fired round after round of tear gas to keep small crowds of protesters away from Parliament in the run-up to the vote and as lawmakers one by one said ""Yes"" or ""No."" The vote was 155 to 138 in the 300-seat house, with five voting ""present"" and two abstaining. Crowds outside Parliament swelled as the vote took place, but both sides showed some restraint, with police and demonstrators eyeing each other warily rather than wading into the melee. Before the vote, small numbers of demonstrators hurled stones at police, chanted, waved Greek flags and set small fires to protest the austerity measures, which include new taxes and job cuts. At least 19 police officers were injured Wednesday, police said. Dozens of people have gone to hospitals with breathing problems, police said. Andreas Lourandos, the president of the Pharmacists' Association of Athens, called on police to ""stop using chemicals before we mourn any victims."" A second key vote is due in the Greek Parliament Thursday on how the five-year austerity package will be implemented. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Wednesday's passage of the austerity measures ""really good news,"" German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said on Twitter. Euro group chairman Jean-Claude Juncker also welcomed the news, saying the ""way is now clear"" for Athens to receive the fifth instalment of a huge bailout loan from European Union countries and the International Monetary Fund. Greece has debt payments coming due in mid-July and needs the $17 billion in emergency funds to be able to pay them -- but lenders, including the IMF and EU, had demanded that it approve the austerity measures in order to get the loan. European and international lenders agreed last year to give Greece a $156 billion bailout package as its deficit soared, but were threatening to hold up an installment of $17 billion due soon. A default by Greece would send shock waves through the European banking sector and potentially dent global economic confidence. Juncker said in a statement from Brussels: ""I'm very happy and relieved that the Greek Parliament followed the government and voted in favour of a new program of structural reforms and budgetary adjustment."" Unions oppose the austerity package, but its backers say it is essential to the stability of the Greek economy, the euro, and the global financial system. Riot police clashed with stone-throwing demonstrators Tuesday ahead of the vote, firing tear gas to disperse protesters during riots that left 30 police officers and one demonstrator injured. The two-day general strike is continuing on Wednesday, with members of three major unions planning to march on Parliament after the vote. The 48-hour general strike kicked off early Tuesday, hobbling most of Greece's transportation systems but freeing workers to participate in demonstrations. Transportation disruptions took place on land, on sea and in the air. Air traffic controllers periodically stopped work and flight traffic, according to their union. Stoppages also disrupted sea travel in the maritime nation, which encompasses many islands. The Greek government hopes for a second bailout package to stay afloat, but that, too, depended on its passing the austerity measures before Parliament on Wednesday. Protesters lament that the cuts are being carried out on the backs of those who can afford it least. CNN's Elinda Labropoulou, Diana Magnay, Frederik Pleitgen and Eve Parish contributed to this report.","NEW:  The EU's Juncker says the way is now clear for Athens to get an emergency loan .

"(CNN) -- A New York couple and their two daughters found dead in a suburban Baltimore, Maryland, hotel room died in what police believe was a murder-suicide, authorities said Tuesday. Stephanie Parente, 19, was found dead along with her sister and parents in a Baltimore hotel Monday. The bodies, found Monday at a Sheraton Hotel in Towson, Maryland, were identified as being those of William Parente, 59; his wife Betty Parente, 58; and their daughters Stephanie, 19, and Catherine, 11, said Baltimore County Police spokesman Cpl. Michael Hill. The family was from Garden City, New York, Hill said. William Parente was an attorney, he said, and Stephanie Parente was a student at Loyola College in Baltimore. Beyond saying the incident is believed to be a murder-suicide, Hill would release little additional information pending the completion of autopsies to be conducted Tuesday at the medical examiner's office in Baltimore. Detectives believe they know what occurred, he said, but are awaiting forensic evidence and autopsy results to back up their hypothesis before commenting publicly, Hill said. ""We don't have a motive for why that occurred,"" he told reporters. ""It's all very, very unfortunate."" He said the family frequently traveled to Baltimore to visit Stephanie Parente at school. As for a timeline for the deaths, Hill said police believe the family was together Sunday morning for breakfast, and they know what time the card key was last used to unlock the room. He would not give details regarding what, if anything, was found in the room. The bodies were found Monday after a housekeeper told hotel management about 3 p.m. that the door to the room was locked and there had been no response from inside, county police spokesman Bill Toohey said Monday. In an e-mail, the Rev. Brian Linnane, president of Loyola College, acknowledged the death of Stephanie Parente. ""This is a moment of unimaginable sorrow for the entire Loyola family,"" he said in the e-mail, addressed to members of the Loyola community. ""The loss of young lives -- particularly under such circumstances -- defies understanding. ... A tragedy such as this reminds us of the mystery and destructive power of evil in our world."" He urged members of the Loyola community to take advantage of grief counseling and support services, and said he would officiate at a special Mass Tuesday night for the Parente family. College spokeswoman Courtney Jolley told CNN that Stephanie Parente was a sophomore majoring in speech-language pathology with a natural-sciences minor. She was a former member of the women's crew team and coxswain for the men's crew team, Jolley said, and volunteered through the college's Center for Community Service and Justice. She had planned to study abroad in Newcastle, England, next year, Jolley said.","Four were found dead Monday in a Sheraton Hotel room in Towson, Maryland .

"(CNN) -- Unexpected space debris came flying close to the International Space Station on Tuesday, prompting its six astronauts to take shelter inside two Soyuz capsules, NASA said. Russia's Interfax news agency said preliminary data on ""the dangerous approach"" shows that the ""trash"" came within about 250 meters (820 feet) of the station. NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries said it was not immediately known how close the debris came, but that 820 feet was the closest it could have come, according to NASA's projections.

"(CNN Student News) -- January 31, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Egypt • Georgia • Los Angeles, California . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It is the very last day of January, but the very first day of a new week of CNN Student News! I'm Carl Azuz. If you took a look at the news at all this weekend, you probably know what our top story today is. First Up: Egypt in Crisis . AZUZ: Egypt. The world is watching as a political crisis engulfs the north African nation. Protesters have been marching through the streets for days. They're speaking out against the Egyptian government, and specifically against long-time President Hosni Mubarak. The protesters say they have two demands. One: They want President Mubarak to leave office and to be put on trial. Two: They want to change the country's constitution. The government has been trying different ways to get these protests under control. It's established a curfew; it's sent out fighter jets and thousands of security troops. As you can see, it doesn't seem to be making any difference. The protests lasted through Sunday night and looked like they could keep going for a while. In different cities around the world, other people are holding rallies in support of Egypt's protesters. Businesses and governments that have offices in Egypt are working to evacuate their citizens and clients from the country. President Mubarak went on TV over the weekend to talk to the people of Egypt. He said he understands why they're upset, including their concerns over alleged government corruption and desire for better living conditions. Mubarak asked his government ministers to resign, but said he plans to say in power. But that's not enough for the man you see here: Mohamed ElBaradei, a prominent Egyptian and holder of a Nobel Peace Prize. He's a leader of the largest group that's against President Mubarak. And on Sunday, he urged the Egyptian president to ""leave today and save the country."" ElBaradei says the push for Mubarak to step down is ""non-negotiable."" Egypt Breakdown . AZUZ: All right, we're gonna talk about some of the major players in all of this in today's Breakdown. First off, Egypt's leader, Hosni Mubarak. He's been the country's president since 1981. Egypt's president serves six-year terms with no term limits, which is why he's been in power so long. The country is a republic, with the president chosen by popular vote. But here's the kicker: Until 2005, Mubarak was the only candidate on the ballot! In 2005, Mubarak beat out a couple other candidates when he got almost 90 percent of the vote. Another election is scheduled for later this year. The country Mubarak leads has 80 million people; it is the largest population in the Arab world. And that's put a strain on the government because many of the people feel it's unable to meet their demands. 20 percent of Egypt's population lives below the poverty line. And one more point, here: the Muslim Brotherhood. This is a group that's been very vocal in encouraging people to protest. And it's technically illegal! Egypt's constitution does not allow religion-based political parties. But the Muslim Brotherhood has been somewhat tolerated by President Mubarak. I say ""somewhat"" because members are allowed to run in local elections, but they're not allowed to have seats in the country's government. Now, I'm gonna turn it over to Don Lothian to show you why what happens in Egypt is so important to the United States, as well as countries near Egypt in the Middle East. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAN LOTHIAN, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: As tensions rise in Egypt, the White House is ramping up its response. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: When President Mubarak addressed the Egyptian people, he pledged a better democracy and greater economic opportunity. I just spoke to him after his speech, and I told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words, to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise. LOTHIAN: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed in too, voicing concerns over the violence directed at protestors by police and security forces. U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: We urge the Egyptian authorities to allow peaceful protests and to reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications. LOTHIAN: The Obama administration has been pushing President Hosni Mubarak privately and publicly to implement reforms. A delicate dance as cables released by Wikileaks revealed. In a 2009 dispatch over concerns about human rights abuses, U.S. Ambassador Margaret Scobey is reported to have written, ""Mubarak takes this issue personally and it makes him seethe when we raise it, particularly in public."" U.S. officials have also resisted calling for regime change. JON ALTERMAN, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: I think the administration is going to try to appeal to the best instincts, and ultimately will work with whoever is in power in Egypt. PROTESTERS: Hey Hey! Ho Ho! Mubarak has to go! LOTHIAN: Even so, outside the White House, pressure from protesters looking for change. Egypt has been a key U.S. ally for years, working to bring Israelis and Palestinians together, being a stable partner in the region, and supporting the international effort to reign in Iran's nuclear ambitions. ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: And that's important, but there is a responsibility that is had by the government of Egypt, regardless of the role that they have played internationally or regionally, over the course of any number of years. They also have to address the grievances that have built up for those same number of years within the country of Egypt. LOTHIAN: Officials here at the White House are also discussing the assistance that the U.S. gives to Egypt, including more than a billion dollars each year. They'll be reviewing over the next few days how the government deals with unrest on the ground and how that might impact that aid. Dan Lothian, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Barnes' and Mrs. Rumbarger's STEM classes at Petal High School in Petal, Mississippi! What U.S. government program provides money to retired workers? Is it: A) HUD, B) Social Security, C) CDC or D) Peace Corps? You've got three seconds -- GO! The Social Security program gives money to Americans who are retired, disabled or in need. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Social Security . AZUZ: It was 71 years ago today that the first Social Security check was issued! The person who got it? Her name was Ida Fuller; she received a check from the government for $22.54. During the two years before that, Fuller had paid money into the system. That's how Social Security was designed to work: People who are working pay money in; people who are retired get money out. If any of you have jobs, you're part of this, too. There's a line on your paycheck for how much money is taken out for Social Security. But there's a lot of debate around Social Security and concerns that this fund might run out some day, and maybe in the not-too-distant future. People are living longer than they used to, so they're getting more money from Social Security. And by the time people who are currently putting money into the system are old enough to take money out, there might not be anything left for them. Cursive Debate . AZUZ: And something else that might disappear? This: cursive writing. It's pretty, but is it useful? There are 41 states that use English standards that don't require students to learn cursive. Georgia, in fact, is getting ready to debate this issue soon. And some people are worried that the writing may be on the wall for cursive. The argument against learning cursive is that it takes up time and isn't as useful as learning how to type. But some parents and teachers say script should stay. They feel that learning proper handwriting helps students learn better in general. And that without it, you won't be able to understand some historic documents that are written in cursive. The Constitution is one example that comes to my mind. Blog Promo . AZUZ: Now personally, I write in cursive when I'm taking notes, because that's what I learned in school. But I also know how to type, too, and I learned that as well. What we're asking on today's blog is: Do you think it's important to preserve the old-school cursive, or should schools focus on skills you'll need later in life, like typing? You know where to go to talk to us: CNNStudentNews.com! Before We Go . AZUZ: And finally, we're right on time for today's Before We Go segment. It may look like a normal cuckoo clock, until you realize that the cuckoo coming out's a person! This thing actually is the world's largest cuckoo clock. At least, that's what the creators were aiming for. They unveiled this 66-foot tall, 28-foot wide clock this weekend. Every hour, the bells brought out an actor who gave a performance. Goodbye . AZUZ: Some people may think it sounds a little... you know. But you're welcome to chime in with your own thoughts. And we are just about out of time. To help us sign off, of course, we have today's sign-off line from Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews. Today's sign-off line comes from Nick: He says anything unrelated to elephants is irrelephant.

"(CNN) -- The governing body of Mexican football has banned five players from its national team after they failed drugs tests taken in late May before the start of an international tournament. Decio de Maria, Secretary General of the Mexican Federation of Football, announced the suspensions of national team members Guillermo Ochoa, Francisco Javier Rodriguez, Edgar Duenas, Antonio Naelson ""Sinha"" and Christian Bermudez at a Thursday news conference. De Maria blamed the failed drug tests on bad meat eaten by the players. The five tested positive for clenbuterol, a banned anabolic agent that can be found in meats. Mexican football officials contend the five players ingested the substance accidentally. The suspensions could be devastating to Mexico's chances at the Gold Cup, an international tournament currently under way that includes nations from North America, Central America and the Caribbean. Mexico is the tournament's returning champion. Samples of red meat have been collected from a restaurant the players had frequented and will be tested, according to the federation. The federation stated that a final decision on the players' status is pending the results of the tests.","The players test positive for clenbuterol, a banned substance .

"(CNN)  -- Defending champions Germany were sent tumbling to a stunning 1-0 extra-time defeat by outsiders Japan in the women's World Cup Saturday. Japan had never beaten a European team and went into the quarterfinal in Wolfsburg as long-odds outsiders. But the hosts, roared on by a capacity and partisan crowd, could not press home their territorial advantage and grew increasingly frustrated. The winning goal came in the 108th minute as Japan captain Homare Sawa sent away substitute Karina Maruyama who scored with a brilliantly angled shot past Germany goalkeeper Nadine Angerer. The home side strained every sinew for an equalizer to force penalties, but came up short. It was the two-time defending champions first defeat in the competition since 1999, having won 14 of their previous 15 matches. Japan will now face either Australia or Sweden, who meet on Sunday, for a place in the final. Earlier, France won a dramatic penalty shootout against England to reach the semifinals of the global competition for the first time. The talented French team will play either Brazil or the United States in the semifinals. The match in Leverkusen ended 1-1 after extra-time but the French were deserved winners after dominating the latter stages of the match with superior technique and passing ability. Jill Scott put England ahead just before the hour mark and they looked headed for the last four until the excellent Elise Bussaglia scored the equalizer for France two minutes from the end of regulation play. England had the early advantage in the penalties decider as Karen Bardsley saved the first French effort from Camille Abily. But Claire Rafferty's weak effort saw the French restore parity and when Faye White blasted her effort onto the crossbar it was the end of England's campaign, losing the shootout 4-3. ""To get to penalties we did well. It was just unfortunate we missed two,"" England coach Hope Powell told BBC Sport. ""It was just tired legs. At the end we were dead on our feet. Unfortunately when it came down to penalties you have to applaud France."" Her side were boosted when Everton midfielder Scott blasted her second goal of the tournament, but her Paris St.Germain counterpart Bussaglia leveled as her shot curled in off the post. England, sporadically dangerous on the break, had the best chance in extra time, but Ellen White shot into the side netting from a a good position.","NEW: Hosts Germany stunned by Japan in Women's World Cup .

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- Oil-rich Southern Sudan will review international contracts when it becomes independent, its minister of investment told CNN Sunday, focusing particular attention on the French company Total. ""We will review the contracts that have been signed, look at them critically, make sure that we remain happy,"" Investment Minister Oyay Deng Ajak said. Total is not developing an enormous oil field it has held since the 1970s despite recent entreaties from Southern Sudan to do so, Ajak said. ""After the war we asked them to come in. They have not yet come in,"" he said, suggesting that the newly independent country would break up the block Total holds and auction parts off to other companies. ""The block that was given to them is the whole of Jonglei state, the largest state here,"" he said. ""We are going to look at it. We are going to divide the block into two or three or four ... there is no reason why we can allow one company to monopolize our resources."" Southern Sudan is due to become independent July 9 after fighting a war against the north and then voting peacefully for independence. It needs huge levels of foreign investment to develop an infrastructure. In addition to Total, China and Malaysia are big investors in Southern Sudan's oil fields.","The oil-rich land is on the verge of independence from the north .

"(CNN) -- It was once the polluted hotbed of the Industrial Revolution in London, a large area of land that became badly contaminated with toxic waste after centuries of abuse. But the hope of the local Olympic organizers is that, what was once a wasteland site in Stratford, will soon bloom with fauna and wildlife as the green heart of the 2012 Games' site. The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) is planning to convert the area into Britain's first new public park in London for over a century once the sporting event is over and -- in order to create the intended environmental legacy -- the work of planting, cultivating and remodeling the new landscape is already underway. The Olympic Park will not only provide a public space for people to enjoy both during and after the Games, the aim is to generate a variety of habitats for wildlife with 2,000 trees and 350,000 wetland plants. ""There are all kinds of different habitats here and there are target species,"" John Hopkins, a project sponsor for the parklands and public realm at the authority, told CNN. ""We have things like the frog ponds, which hold water and have loggeries in them. ""We also have over 700 wildlife installations. We have wet woodland, which is a very rare habitat that feeds off the river to keep it wet."" Wetland areas have been central to the regeneration of the area, specifically along the banks of the River Thames, which runs from the UK's east coast and through the heart of the British capital. ""This is part of a huge vision for restoring working landscapes in the whole of the Thames gateway, which is great for bio-diversity and great for people,"" Hopkins said. ""Parks like this create those places where people want to live, work and play."" Turning the former industrial area into a suitable home for plants and animals has not been a straightforward process. Factories had been located on the site in the 18th and 19th centuries, which left the soil in need of special treatment. ""This site was one of the crucibles of the Industrial Revolution in London,"" Hopkins said. ""Some of the land was heavily contaminated after centuries of abuse. ""We had what we called 'soil hospitals.' They were treating all of the materials to make sure that it was suitable for re-use on the site."" Paul de Zylva, head of international environmental organization Friends of the Earth has been working on the issue of the Games coming to London since 2003, two years prior to the city being awarded the Olympics. He told CNN he was generally supportive of the work being done by the ODA. ""The plan they have come up with is about trying to create some of the old London habitat that used to exist there,"" said Da Zylva. ""Grasslands, meadows, woodland and waterways as well, and I think that's been done well. ""They are putting in a long-term management plan for the area. There's a 10-year management plan for the park, which is a good start. ""They are trying to manage the land to be of high conservation value, to the point where some parts of it would be on the way to being designated as a site of special scientific interest, which is the highest possible designation in this country. So that's a good ambition."" De Zylva also praised the honesty of London's organizers with regards to making information about the Games available. ""We said to them that we do want you to be open and transparent about what the impact of putting on the Games would be, and they published that. ""We were very pleased they did. We think it's important, if you're going to learn lessons from staging the Games, that you have a baseline of information about what it actually takes to host the Olympics. ""This is the first time it has been done, London has been good in that respect."" London has held the Summer Olympics on two previous occasions, in 1908 and 1948 -- next year's event will begin with the opening ceremony on July 27 and conclude on August 12.","London's Olympic Park has been designed to accommodate both people and local wildlife .

"(CNN) -- English champions Manchester United agreed a deal to sign highly-rated young goalkeeper David de Gea from Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. The 20-year-old, who helped Spain's under-21 team to win the European Championship title last weekend, passed a medical at Old Trafford on Monday and will join on a five-year contract. He follows England winger Ashley Young and under-21 defender Phil Jones in moving to the UEFA Champions League finalists in post-season transfers. De Gea, who had long been linked with United as a replacement for the retired Edwin van der Sar, is likely to miss the start of the club's pre-season tour of the U.S. as he has been given an immediate vacation by boss Alex Ferguson. ""The manager said that I should enjoy the holiday I've been afforded now, but of course I'm more excited about getting started in training and meeting my future teammates,"" De Gea told the club's television channel. ""Edwin has been the best goalkeeper in the world while here at United. I hope to emulate him and spend a great number of years here. Hopefully I will equal or even surpass the performance and contribution he made to the club."" Villas-Boas eyes immediate success at Chelsea . De Gea is the second new goalkeeper brought in by Ferguson, with Denmark international Anders Lindegaard signing in the January transfer window. Their arrival casts some doubt on the United future of Poland international Tomasz Kuszczak, who was Dutchman van der Sar's understudy. ""I am young but I'm coming here on the back of two full seasons in La Liga in Spain so I think I've got enough experience to contribute to such a big club,"" De Gea said. ""When a club the size of Manchester United comes in for you, it obviously makes you very happy. I saw their interest as an extra motivation to work even harder to show off my ability."" Spain's reign continues as under-21s win European crown . De Gea's international teammate Thiago Alcantara, who scored Spain's second goal in the final against Switzerland, has signed a new two-year contract with European champions Barcelona. The 20-year-old is now tied to the Spanish league winners until mid-2015. Spanish club Racing Santander have appointed Hector Cuper as coach to replace Marcelino Garcia Toral, who left to join Sevilla last month. The 55-year-old Argentine has previously coached Valencia, guiding the La Liga club to Champions League finals in 2001 and 2001, and Italy's Inter Milan. United's Premier League rivals Sunderland have signed England under-21 international striker Connor Wickham from second division club Ipswich for $12.8 million in a deal that could potentially be worth $19 million. Wickham, 18, has agreed a four-year contract after being linked with moves to bigger clubs such as Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham. French champions Lille have signed defender David Rozehnal after the Czech Republic international impressed on loan from German side Hamburg last season. Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama has also joined on a three-year deal from Israeli club Hapoel Tel Aviv. Lille had already brought in strikers Dimitri Payet and Ronny Rodelin plus defender Marko Basa since winning a domestic double. Ivory Coast international center-back Abdoulaye Meite has joined promoted French club Dijon on a three-year contract after leaving English side West Brom. On a busy day for French clubs, Toulouse signed Turkey international striker Umut Bulut on a three-year deal from Turkish club Trabzonspor, while Sochaux loaned defender Steven Mouyokolo from England's Wolverhampton. Italian club Fiorentina announced on Wednesday that Brazilian defender Romulo Caldeira will join once the 24-year-old has passed a medical, while Serbia under-21 defender Matija Nastasic is also expected to sign.","Spain under-21 goalkeeper David De Gea to sign five-year contract at Manchester United .

"(CNN) -- World champion Thor Hushovd is the new leader of the Tour de France after his Garmin-Cervelo team won Sunday's second stage team time-trial. The 33-year-old Norwegian, a winner of eight Tour stages, as well as twice taking the green points jersey for best sprinter, leads British teammate David Millar in the overall classification after the pair helped Garmin win the 23km stage around Les Essarts in a time of 24 minutes, 48 seconds. BMC Racing, Team Sky and Team Leopard finished second, third and fourth respectively, just four seconds behind Garmin, with HTC-Highroad another second behind in fifth place. Tour champion Contador deserves respect . Philippe Gilbert, who wore yellow after winning Saturday's opening stage, has dropped down to 30th in the standings after his Omega Pharma-Lotto team finished 39 seconds behind in 10th place. Hushovd takes yellow courtesy of finishing above Millar in Saturday's opening stage, where he came home six seconds behind Gilbert in third place. Australian Cadel Evans, twice a runner-up in the Tour, lies third overall, just a second behind the Garmin duo, with Briton Geraint Thomas leading a host of riders who are four seconds adrift. Hushovd, who has worn the yellow jersey three times previously, told reporters: ""It was a big dream of mine to pull on the yellow jersey as world champion, so you can imagine how happy I feel. ""We trained hard for this event and spoke beforehand of about what we had to do, and what to avoid,"" he added. However, it proved another disastrous day for defending champion Alberto Contador, who is already playing catch-up as he attempts to win the race for a fourth time. The 28-year-old Spaniard, who is trying to become the first rider since Marco Pantani in 1998 to win the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France in the same year, lost over a minute on Saturday after getting held up by a crash late in the stage. And that deficit increased still further after his Saxo Bank team finished 28 seconds behind in eighth place. Contador is now trailing in 75th position in the general classification, one minute and 42 seconds behind Hushovd. However, Crucially, he is now 1:41 and 1:38 behind Evans and Andy Schleck, who share the past four runners-up places in the race.","Thor Hushovd wears the yellow jersey in the Tour de France after stage two .

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of Vice, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York.VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by Vice, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Vincent Fournier's photography captures a longing for the space age that lives somewhere between the recently made-possible and the science fiction of the '70s and '80s. Inspired by trips to the Paris museum of science, Vincent has been fascinated by the machine world since his youth and incorporates it into most of his work. His first project, ""Tour Operator,"" presented a global vision of domesticated landscapes where humans appear slightly out of step with the environment they created. In ""The Man Machine,"" he gained access to robotics laboratories and staged a series candid portraits featuring the latest in artificial intelligence going about ""their daily lives,"" such as responding to e-mails or taking a trip to the water cooler. In his ""Space Project,"" Vincent pays homage to the world's great centers of space exploration and study: Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Russia, Mars Desert Research Station in Utah, various observatories and antenna arrays, and, most recently, the Ariane Space Center in French Guiana. Just this past month, Vincent finally got permission to shoot in NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, home of the soon-to-be-closed space shuttle program, and Vincent's holy grail. Vincent (with us tailing him) was graciously afforded an almost all-access behind the scenes tour of Kennedy Space Center -- mission control was a no-go, unsurprisingly -- which included a pilgrimage to launchpad 39A, site of the impending STS-135 mission, NASA's last in the Space Transportation System (STS, or Space Shuttle) era. He also got a peek at the NASA engine shop, shuttle landing facility and control tower, vehicle assembly building, and mobile launch platforms, as well as several other difficult-to-remember locales. See the rest of Picture Perfect: Vincent Fournier at VBS.TV . Throughout our visit, Vincent kept asking the kind NASA public affairs officers if there were ""clean rooms"" or ""white rooms"" he could photograph in, and they were generous enough to let him navigate his way through a handful. At one point, we entered an enormous three-chambered room full of men and women working on towering rocket engines. It was akin to stumbling on to the set of Micro Machines: the Movie but with the people in miniature. Vincent snapped a few photos but pressed forward quickly, as he was more interested in the adjacent airlock room with its almost fully white aesthetic. Here he had a little more more freedom to let his cinematic imagination take hold, as well as the option of positioning a worker in a clean room suit (aka ""bunny suit""). The images are reminiscent of some he took at Ariane in French Guiana, with their stark empty spaces broken up by vivid lines and colors. While the trip represented a longtime goal for Vincent, there was an overwhelming sense of nostalgia to almost everything we saw. It was bittersweet to visit NASA while workers were getting their layoff notices and the shuttle program, with all its attendant promise and tragedy, was in its final days. Viewing the Atlantis orbiter perched on the launch pad and protected by the service structure made it seem very fragile, even though it was made to travel over 100 times the speed of sound.

"(CNN)  -- Defending world champion Jorge Lorenzo of Spain claimed victory in Sunday's Italian MotoGP at Mugello to close the gap on Casey Stoner in the overall title standings. Australian Stoner began the race in pole position and led for the opening 17 of the 23-lap race. But Lorenzo took the lead with a superb overtaking move on a steep, downhill chicane and steadily pulled away for an impressive victory, with Stoner having to contend with finishing in third position after also being overtaken by Honda teammate Andrea Dovizioso on the final lap. American Ben Spies, the winner in Assen last weekend, finished fourth with Marco Simoncelli fifith and Italian legend Valentino Rossi -- racing in front of his home fans for the first time since joining Ducati -- finishing sixth. Talking to BBC TV, Lorenzo said: """"I'm so happy with the win. Casey was so quick but little by little, lap by lap I managed to catch him. ""I finally saw the opportunity to overtake Casey on the downhill section and was able to take it,"" he added. Stoner blamed a problem with his tires for the defeat, adding: ""I did everything I could but the tire pressure went up too high and I lost all grip in the rear. ""I tried to keep a consistent pace but I was just too slow at the end,"" Stoner continued. The result leaves 2007 world champion Stoner with a 19-point advantage in the current championship standings. Stoner lies on 152 points after eight of the 18 races, with Yamaha rider Lorenzo lying second on 133 points. Dovizioso (119) and Rossi (91) lie third and fourth in the standings with Nicky Hayden (77 points) rounding out the top five. `","Jorge Lorenzo claims victory in Sunday's Italian MotoGP at Mugello .

"Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- Eyewitnesses in the embattled Libyan city of Misrata reported especially intense shelling by Moammar Gadhafi's forces overnight -- the heavy fire picking up at about the same time reports came out that one of the leader's son was killed in a NATO airstrike. ""There's been continuous and heavy shelling for three hours straight,"" said one man, talking to CNN from about three miles from Misrata's city center Sunday. ""There have been a lot of explosions."" Heavy gun and artillery fire could also be heard early Sunday throughout Benghazi, which is the hub for rebel forces and their transitional government. The eyewitness in Misrata, the country's third-largest city, speculated that the intensified attacks were tied directly to reports that Saif al-Arab Gadhafi, the sixth of Moammar's eight children, died in an attack on his Tripoli home. He said there was significant damage and some casualties, though there were only rebel forces and none aligned with Gadhafi in the city itself. Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said that several of the Libyan leader's grandchildren also died in the attack, though Moammar Gadhafi and his wife -- both of whom were in the residence when it was hit -- are unhurt. ""It's going to be like revenge,"" said the witness in Misrata, who supports the opposition, of the intensified attacks. These stepped-up, continuous attacks were reported early Sunday, about a full day after Moammar Gadhafi's latest diatribe that called for a negotiated end to NATO airstrikes and included threats to Italy. During his rambling 45-minute speech, he urged NATO to negotiate an end to airstrikes, accusing the international coalition of killing civilians and destroying the nation's infrastructure in a bid to take over its oil production. ""Come and negotiate with us. You are the ones attacking us. You are the ones terrifying our kids and destroying our infrastructure. You American, French and British come and negotiate with us,"" Gadhafi said on Libyan state TV. The Libyan leader remained defiant, as he sharply criticized those behind the attacks and questioned their intent. ""What are you trying to do? Trying to take the oil?"" he said. ""The Libyan people will not allow you ... The oil is under control of the Libyan government and for the people."" He called on the United Nations to review the NATO attacks, saying his country agreed to a cease-fire. ""We are the first ones who wanted and agreed on a cease-fire. But the NATO crusader airstrike did not cease,"" he said. ""It cannot be a cease-fire from one side."" Hours later but before reports of Saif al-Arab Gadhafi's death, the head of NATO rebuffed the Libyan leader's comments, insisting that the mission to target his forces will continue as long as civilians remain under fire. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen ""reject(ed) any threat against Italy or any other ally,"" while vowing that the coalition would continue to pursue its mission. ""The Gadhafi regime continues to cause widespread suffering through its attacks on the Libyan population. Quite simply, this must stop,"" Rasmussen said in a statement. ""NATO remains firm -- we will continue our operation until the threat to the civilian population of Libya is removed."" The airstrikes started after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians demanding the ouster of the ruler, who has been in power for nearly 42 years. From the time NATO began its operation on March 31, the organization had conducted 4,398 sorties, of which 1,821 were strike sorties, according to an update issued Saturday. Facilities in or around Tripoli, Zintan, al-Brega and Sirte were targeted on Friday, it said. Shortly after Gadhafi's speech, a NATO spokeswoman called for actions, not words, in expressing skepticism the Libyan leader could be trusted to follow through on his pledges. ""The regime has announced cease-fires several times before and continued attacking cities and civilians,"" NATO deputy spokeswoman Carmen Romero said in a statement. ""Just hours before Col. Gadhafi spoke of a truce, his forces indiscriminately shelled Misrata, killing many people, including children. His forces tried to mine the port to block the access of humanitarian aid to the beleaguered civilians of Misrata. All this has to stop, and it has to stop now."" A spokesman for the Libyan opposition accused Gadhafi of lying and trying to play both sides. ""He's playing both parts. He's buying time at the same time projecting himself as somebody who's trying to find a solution to this problem, while the reality on the ground is he is the one who's seeking to kill and carry out all kind of crimes against the Libyan people,"" said Jalal al Gallal. ""The man has no credibility anymore,"" he added. This back-and-forth came as eyewitnesses reported difficult conditions in Misrata, amid intense shelling and blockage of any assistance. Ibrahim said no ships can ""dock at the port without being inspected by the Libyan government,"" saying any aid must go through designated land routes. The Libyan governmentthreatened to sink any ship approaching the besieged port city of Misrata. The declaration essentially threatens NATO patrols and humanitarian aid ships that have been bringing in food and medical supplies, and ferrying out refugees and the wounded. This threat came shortly after NATO said it intercepted government forces laying mines in Misrata's harbor, which has been a lifeline for humanitarian aid. At least nine people were killed and 30 more wounded in Friday's attacks in Misrata, said a doctor, who is a member of the medical committee in the city. ""There is an indiscriminate shelling now in Misrata,"" said the doctor, who asked not to be identified because he feared retribution by Gadhafi's forces. CNN's Greg Botelho, Frederik Pleitgen, Kareem Khadder and Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","NEW: Witnesses report heavy fire from Gadhafi forces in Misrata and Benghazi .

"(CNN) -- A man grabbed French President Nicolas Sarkozy by his shoulder and pulled him up against a barricade Thursday before being tackled by security officers. The incident came as Sarkozy visited the town of Brax in southwest France. Television footage showed the man being wrestled to the ground by four bodyguards. The suspect, who is 32 and works at a local music school, was taken into custody and questioned by police who were already present for security reasons, a police spokesman said. He is now being held at Agen police station, the spokesman added. Sarkozy appeared to have been seized by the shoulder of his jacket as he shook hands with members of the public lined up behind a metal security barrier in the town, near Agen. The president was due to attend a meeting of local mayors during his visit to the Lot-et-Garonne region, according to local media reports. Earlier, he was to tour a local factory.

"(CNN) -- Last week's tornado outbreak was the largest in U.S. history, according to the National Weather Service. At least 178 tornadoes tore across communities in 14 states and caused 327 deaths. Among the communities affected by the storms was Ringgold, a small town in northwest Georgia. Half of the town's businesses were damaged, and many homes were reduced to rubble. Ringgold, population 2,800, had limited resources to deal with the emergency until 2008 CNN Hero Tad Agoglia and his First Response Team rolled into town. With more than $1 million worth of specialized equipment, Agoglia's mobile response team has the tools and the experience to help communities recover in their darkest hours. CNN spoke to Agoglia about his group's recent efforts in Ringgold. CNN: Where were you when you heard about the storms, and why did you decide to come to Ringgold? Tad Agoglia: (We) had been in North Carolina for the past two weeks. We responded to a terrible tornado there that ripped through most of the state. All of a sudden, we're watching on TV one of the worst (tornado outbreaks) form in United States history, possibly. We knew there was going to be a tremendous amount of suffering, and we knew we had to respond. We decided to come to Ringgold, Georgia, because it's a small community, and most likely they didn't have resources they would need to deal with this type of storm. CNN: What kind of resources do you bring with you? Agoglia: When a disaster strikes, you don't really know what you're going to need, so you have to bring everything. That's why we've packaged up four tractor-trailers loaded with just about every type of tool and gear and piece of equipment. We have huge lighting systems and rubble cameras for search and rescue. We've got cranes and trucks to remove the debris from the road. We've got the (generators) to power up emergency rooms, nursing homes, shelters. We've got just about every type of cutting tool known to mankind -- plasmas cutters, concrete saws, metal saws, wood saws -- anything that you need to get through an area to get to the people that need help. We have seen just about every type and size of disaster imaginable. We can create a lot of progress really quickly in a lot of communities just by the experience we have and the equipment we have. CNN: What have you been doing since you arrived in Ringgold? Agoglia: We were able to get the church powered up and utilize it as a shelter. After that, we quickly moved in gear to start clearing roadways. Clearing roads is really important, because people can't get out if the roads aren't cleared. Ambulances and fire trucks need to get to home sites to perform search and rescue, so we help with that. This debris is really tricky stuff to deal with. When you look at a road and it's covered with houses and trees and cars -- just about anything you can imagine -- it's a little challenging to figure out how to clear that path. But we've got the equipment to be able to do that. So we just began to clear one road after the other. CNN: You've also been clearing home sites. How do you decide who to help? Agoglia: It was a little difficult to figure out where to start. It's just home after home, hundreds of them for miles and miles throughout this county and city. And so we decided to start helping families who lost loved ones in the storm. I literally just started walking up the streets. I started asking questions. ""Do you know anybody that's in need? Do you know any families that have lost loved ones?"" And the local community led me to Melba (Weese, whose father was killed). Not only were we able to go through the home site (where Weese's father lived) and find some of their precious belongings and clear the site, but we were also able to prepare the burial grounds for her and her family. CNN: This work is so physically and emotionally grueling. What keeps you going? Agoglia: This is part of being human. A lot of people think the government is supposed to help us or FEMA's supposed to help us, the White House in Washington will help us. But when we see people who are really suffering and struggling, it's our responsibility to come and to help. I'll come into a city, and I'll meet absolute strangers. And within days, they're kind of like friends and family. And it's hard when you look into their faces and you see the sadness and the loss, the shock and confusion. And all I can hope is that what we did makes a difference in their lives ... and hopefully others will also rise to the occasion, see the needs and do something about it.

"(CNN) -- Colombia are through to the quarterfinals of the Copa America after beating Bolivia 2-0 in Sante Fe on Sunday to finish top of Group A with seven points. In-demand Porto striker Radamel Falcao put Colombia ahead in the 14th minute after running onto a long through-ball. And Falcao, who is rumored to be interesting Chelsea who are now managed by his former Porto coach Andre Villas-Boas, doubled the lead by netting from the penalty spot 12 minutes later. Has Argentine football reached crisis point? Adrian Ramos, Freddy Guarin and Dayro Moreno all went close for Colombia in the first half, although they took their foot off the gas after the break. The result cranks up the pressure on host nation Argentina ahead of their Group A finale against Costa Rica on Monday. Argentina need to win that match to qualify alongside Colombia, while a draw or Costa Rica win will send them crashing out. Bolivia's defeat means they are out of the competition after collecting just one point from their three matches.","Colombia defeat Bolivia 2-0 to secure place in Copa America quarters .

"New York (CNN) -- Larisa Antypa was ready for her cruise in the Caribbean when news of the economic crisis in Greece, her home country, began to worsen. Antypa, a program coordinator for the Greek Cultural Center in Astoria, Queens, canceled her trip and decided that she would instead spend her vacation money in Greece. Like a growing number of her fellow expatriates, Antypa hopes to bolster the teetering Greek economy -- roiled again on Tuesday by a wave of violent protests and a countrywide strike against proposed austerity measures -- through tourism. It accounts for 15% of the country's jobs and 18% of its GDP, according to the Greek Ministry of Culture and Tourism. ""I want to support Greece by spending my money there; it's very important when your country's in trouble to do whatever you can,"" Antypa said. ""I ask people why they're going back, why they don't go somewhere else, and they say, 'Now, Greece needs us.' "" Antypa said that more members of her community, largely motivated by pride of country, are vacationing in Greece than ever before. This perception was corroborated by Ted Spyropoulos, president of the U.S. chapter of the World Council of Hellenes Abroad, who said the number of Greek-Americans visiting home has surged and is expected to increase anywhere from 20% to 30% in 2011 from 2010. ""(Greeks) have an obligation to go because Greece needs the help right now,"" said Spyropoulos, who added his organization has launched a campaign to encourage Greek-Americans to travel there. ""There's been a call from outside that Greece needs help."" This year's 10% increase in income from American tourists, who spend three times more than the average traveler, was huge for Greece's economic development, said Chris Petsilas, the director of the U.S. office of the Greek National Tourism Organization. Despite Greece's debt crisis and crippling unemployment, Pestilas said tourism is booming. ""In crises, other tourists postpone their trips to our country; this year, the Greek-Americans will come and they will bring all their friends,"" Pestilas said. Pestilas added that the Greek government had encouraged tourism from Americans by loosening regulations on cruise ships, eliminating taxes for airlines and cutting fees for hotels. Still, for many Greek-Americans, attempts to visit Greece have been hamstrung by high airfare prices and a sputtering economy at home. ""It's depressing and sad watching our country, which is dependent on tourists,"" said George Kouvaras, owner of Piros custom furniture, who is not returning to Greece for the first time in several years. ""But there's no money to go (and) the tickets are expensive, the euro is expensive, the hotels are expensive."" Paul Collaros, a member of the Pan-Icarian Brotherhood, agreed, saying he had to postpone his trip from Dyer, Indiana, to Greece. ""Everything's become so expensive due to what's going on, it's making it even harder for Greek-Americans to make the trip,"" Collaros said. But even if they cannot return to visit, Greek-Americans say that their country never travels far from their thoughts. ""It's scary; it's frightening; it's hurtful to wake up every day and watch and see the coverage of everything that's going on in Greece. ... We can't help but feel bad that our brothers and sisters have to go through this,"" said Antonis Diamataris, editor and publisher of a Greek newspaper, The National Herald. Like The Greek News, the Herald is urging its readership to visit Greece this summer. ""We cannot save the Greek economy, raise 100 billion dollars, and give it to them, so what we can do is spend our money in Greece -- and hope and pray things will improve.""","Greece's economy has been in economic crisis; protests have roiled the nation .

"(CNN) -- Holders Brazil were knocked out of the Copa America Sunday, after a woeful penalty shoot-out display against Paraguay in Argentina. The star-studded Brazilians missed all four of their spot-kicks as Paraguay went on to win 2-0 and earn a place in the last four of the competition. A disappointing match ended goal-less, as both sides finished with 10 men on the pitch after Brazilian midfielder Lucas Leiva and Uruguay's Antolin Alcaraz were dismissed following an altercation in extra time. Brazil dominated much of the possession but lacked a cutting edge, despite fielding an attack-minded line-up led by Robinho, Alexandre Pato, and Neymar. Neymar was particularly profligate in front of goal, twice missing golden opportunities in the first half. The first chance came on seven minutes when his volley from close range dipped over the bar; while the second saw him blaze wide on the half-hour mark, after Ganso's pass found him unmarked on the right-hand side of goal. Paraguay goalkeeper Justo Villar was also in inspired form, showing particularly good reflexes late on to deny Milan's Pato as he raced through one-on-one. After the match Paraguay coach Gerardo Martino admitted his side, which last won the competition in 1979, were fortunate to beat the much-fancied Brazilians. ""Brazil should probably have won it over the 90 minutes,"" he told reporters, in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse. His goalkeeper Villar agreed. ""It really took it out of us playing Brazil -- they dominated almost the whole match. But the team kept its shape and kept its concentration and those factors took us through."" Meanwhile Brazil's coach Mano Menezes was keen to look ahead to his team's future challenges. ""When you lose you know you made some mistakes,"" he told AFP. ""But this happens in football and we have to live with it. The object has always been to get a strong team together for the World Cup in 2014."" The shocks continued in the second quarterfinal played Sunday as Venezuela beat Chile 2-1. Oswaldo Vizcarrondo put Venezuela ahead on 34 minutes, but Humberto Suazo equalized for Chile midway through the second half. Chile pushed for victory, but as extra time loomed it was Gabriel Cichero who gave Venezuela a semifinal clash with Paraguay.","Star-studded Brazil missed all four of their spot-kicks as Paraguay went on to win 2-0 .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan announced Tuesday it is banning all shipments of cattle raised in the Fukushima Prefecture amid fears that the meat may have been contaminated from radiation at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano made the announcement. Last week, a Japanese health official downplayed the dangers after cesium contaminated meat from Fukushima cows was delivered to Japanese markets and probably ingested. ""If we were to eat the meat everyday, then it would probably be dangerous,"" Goshi Hosono, state minister in charge of consumer affairs and food-safety, said at a news conference on July 12. ""But if it is consumed only in small portions, I don't think it would have any long-lasting effects on the human body."" When the Fukushima Prefectural Government investigated the farm that was the source of the meat, it found cesium in cattle feed such as hay, with radiation levels as much as 57 times higher than the ceiling set by the Japanese government. Up until now, cattle in Fukushima were only subject to a screening test, to inspect for radioactive particles adhering to the skin, and farmers were ordered to self-report how it the cattle feed was being stocked. Yutaka Kashimura, Fukushima Prefecture's officer in charge of the livestock division, told CNN that the farmer may have given the cows hay that had been exposed to soil containing high levels of radiation. The farm is situated about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant. Four months after Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami on March 11, operators at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant are still grappling with the crisis the disaster unleashed but say they are making slow progress. The March 11 quake led to meltdowns at Fukushima Daiichi's three operating reactors when the tsunami knocked out their coolant systems, causing the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. CNN's Kyung Lah and Nicolas Ito contributed to this report.","Health officials downplayed the danger last week .

"(CNN) -- Somalia, Myanmar and Afghanistan have the lowest scores on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, which measures how people in 178 countries and territories view corruption in their public sectors. On a scale of 0-10, with 10 being ""very clean"" and 0 being ""highly corrupt,"" all three countries score below 1.5. Somalia is the lowest at 1.1, while Myanmar and Afghanistan are tied for second at 1.4. At the other end of the list are Denmark, New Zealand and Singapore, which score the highest at 9.3. The United States, with a score of 7.1, is among the countries viewed as least corrupt. It's tied for 22nd overall with Belgium. But while the U.S. is well ahead of neighbor Mexico (3.1), it seems to have some work to do to catch Canada (8.9). The latest scores were drawn from 13 surveys and assessments published between January 2009 and September 2010 by ""independent and reputable institutions,"" according to Transparency International. It defines corruption as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. Transparency International is a nongovernmental organization headquartered in Berlin. It acknowledges that corruption, by nature, is often hidden and therefore difficult to quantify, but it says it has found people's perceptions to be a reliable estimate over the long term. Some other noteworthy scores from the index: . ** Because of activist Anna Hazare and his recent hunger strike, corruption has been brought to the forefront in India. The country scored a 3.3 on the most recent index, putting it among the countries viewed as most corrupt. ** Libya (2.2) and Syria (2.5), were also near the top of the perceived corruption list, something that might not be a surprise considering the recent unrest there. Yemen also scored a 2.2. Egypt (3.1) and Tunisia (4.3) scored better, but not by much. Again, it's important to point out that these surveys were conducted well before these two countries' longtime leaders were ousted. More comparisons: Which country has the smallest gender gap? Where is the Internet most popular? Where are the undernourished? Where do people live the longest? Which countries have the most vacation days? Who requires the most education? Who's got the highest (and lowest) unemployment rates?","Transparency International ranks countries by their perceived levels of corruption .

"(CNN) -- A prosecutor in the Casey Anthony trial said Wednesday that jurors might have acquitted her even if she had opened herself up to a tough cross-examination by taking the stand. ""From what I am understanding from those few hints we've gotten from the jury ... it sounds like their decision was based simply on the state's case. I don't know if she would have said anything that would have changed that,"" assistant state attorney Jeff Ashton said on HLN's ""Dr. Drew."" Casey Anthony's lawyer, meanwhile, said that her acquittal signified justice for little Caylee Anthony, 2, who prosecutors unsuccessfully argued died at the hands of her mother. ""Caylee would never have wanted her mother to suffer this way,"" defense attorney Jose Baez told Barbara Walters of ABC News. ""Caylee certainly never wanted her mother to die."" After less than 11 hours of deliberation, a jury Tuesday found Casey Anthony not guilty of first-degree murder and the other most serious charges. But the jury convicted her on four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to law enforcement officers. She will be sentenced Thursday. Juror Jennifer Ford told ABC News that she and the other jurors cried and were ""sick to our stomachs"" after voting to acquit Anthony. ""I did not say she was innocent,"" said Ford, who had previously only been identified as juror number 3. ""I just said there was not enough evidence. If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot determine what the punishment should be."" An unidentified male juror told the St. Petersburg Times there wasn't enough evidence. ""I wish we had more evidence to put her away,"" the juror said. ""I truly do..."" Ashton told Dr. Drew Pinsky he saw a juror in tears at the time the verdict was read. ""I have to believe that they honestly thought they were doing the right thing based on the law and evidence as they saw it."" The prosecutor also likened juries to a ""dice game. You never know. You throw the dice."" Ashton said that three pieces of duct tape found on Caylee's skull were crucial to the state meeting the burden of proof. ""If it didn't tell the jury the same story it told me, so be it,"" he said. In an interview earlier Wednesday, Ashton recalled his shock at the verdict. ""When I heard the 'not guilty' on the child abuse, I knew that was it,"" he said. ""I remember mouthing 'wow' four or five times to myself."" Ashton, speaking with InSession's Beth Karas, said he is convinced there was no evidence that Caylee died accidentally in 2008. Prosecutors alleged Casey Anthony used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious and then duct-taped her mouth and nose to suffocate her. They said that she put the child's body in the trunk of her car for a few days before disposing of it. Caylee's skeletal remains were discovered December 11, 2008, by former Orange County meter reader Roy Kronk. Defense attorneys maintained the child drowned in the Anthony's above-ground pool on June 16, and that Casey Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. George Anthony denied that in his testimony. Ashton told InSession that Casey Anthony showed premeditation by ""her leaving with Caylee and her never being seen again."" The prosecutor acknowledged no expert determination of a cause of death was significant. Still, Ashton said, he would like to know how duct tape came to be found on Caylee's skull. Ashton also spoke of confrontations at pre-trial hearings and during the trial with Baez. ""For Jose, everybody that was on the other side was the enemy and was lying and was this and that,"" Ashton said. ""We went through a lot of accusations and there were times when I responded to them. We fought hard and I fight hard with most people I went to trial with."" There will be no legal restrictions on Casey Anthony profiting on the details of this case, cashing in on deals for movies, books or interviews, analysts say. Prosecutors on Wednesday filed a motion seeking reimbursement by Anthony, based on her convictions, for special costs related to investigation and prosecution. Much was made of Casey Anthony's behavior, included partying, after Caylee disappeared. ""We judge people pretty harshly. We judge them as if we know how we would react in their shoes,"" Baez told ABC. ""We are not in their shoes. We have not lived the life they have lived."" ""People respond to trauma in various ways,"" Baez said, adding he is concerned about Anthony's personal security. After 30 years, Ashton is retiring. He put that off to help handle the Anthony case. ""This case was the most fascinating, complex, the most challenging case that I could possibly hope for,"" he said. ""Everything after this would just be boring.""

"(CNN) -- Spain's footballing dominance continues as the country's under-21 team emulated their senior counterparts by winning the European Championship title on Saturday. With Spain having also won the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and top club side Barcelona claiming the 2011 UEFA Champions League, it gives the Iberian nation a full collection of major crowns. Ander Herrera and Thiago Alcantara were on target as the U21s defeated Switzerland 2-0 in the final in Denmark to give Spain a third triumph in the two-yearly age-group tournament -- and first since 1998. Midfielder Herrera headed the opening goal four minutes before halftime in Aarhus as he stole in at the near post to connect with a cross by left-back Didac Vila. It was the Athletic Bilbao player's second goal of the tournament, having also scored in the 1-1 group-stage draw with England. It was the first the Swiss had conceded, having marched into the final for the first time with four successive victories. Thiago, part of Barcelona's double-winning squad last season, sealed Spain's victory with a moment of genius as he caught goalkeeper Yann Sommer off his line with a 40-meter free-kick. Meanwhile, Belarus qualified for the Olympic Games for the first time after beating the Czech Republic 1-0 in Saturday's third-place playoff match in Aalborg. Defender Yegor Filipenko volleyed an 88th-minute winner to earn entry to London 2012 after the Czechs had Lukas Vacha sent off with 15 minutes to play for a second yellow card. Belarus had lost 3-1 to Spain in the semifinals, while Switzerland won 1-0 against the Czechs in a match that also went to extra-time.","Spain's under-21 team beat Switzerland 2-0 in European Championship final .
