"The mystery man who inspired Boston by shoveling snow from the marathon finish line on Tuesday has been identified following a social media hunt. Chris Laudani, a 25-year-old bartender, said he had been clearing snow from outside Back Bay Social Club, where he works, when he decided to head to the finish line to shovel there too. 'The finish line is my favorite spot in the whole city so I wanted to go down there and dig it out because I don't think it deserves to be covered in snow,' he told the Today show on Thursday. 'Obviously it holds a special place in everybody in Boston's heart but for me it was more about the spirit of the Boston Marathon and the incredible amount of encouragement and positivity that surrounds the event and how much people, including myself, just love the race.' Scroll down for video . Kind-hearted: Chris Laudani was identified as the man pictured shoveling the snow from the Boston marathon finishing line, where three people were killed in the bombing in April 2013 . Three people, including a six-year-old boy, died at the finish line while watching the marathon on Boylston Street when the city was bombed on April 15, 2013. On Tuesday afternoon, Philip Hillman was working in a nearby hotel room overlooking the street, when he snapped a photo of Laudani shoveling the snow and posted it to Twitter. 'I thought it was a powerful image when I looked at it,' Hillman told Today. 'I've been a resident of Massachusetts my whole life. For us, that finish line has become sacred ground.' Boston Police then released photographs on their social media of the mystery man and called for help identifying him using the hashtag #WhoShoveledTheFinishLine. Back Bay Social Club, which is located about two blocks away from the finish line, identified the shoveler as Laudani. Dig it: Photos taken by Philip Hillman, who was working in a hotel nearby, were shared around social media, making it onto the Twitter of the Boston Police Department, who helped spread the word . ID please: The mystery man who shoveled off the marathon finish line on Boylston street during Juno was identified as local bartender Chris Laudani . Laudani, who was initially unaware of the search to find him because he does not have a Twitter account, said he was shocked by the attention and doesn't want to be hailed as a hero. He told GMA he simply 'wanted to do a good deed for the community because I love Boston'. He added that he also loved the marathon, which he ran in 201 . After falling under more than two feet of snow that knocked out power in some areas, New England is bracing for a second round of heavy snowfall. Forecasts predict that up to 12 inches of snow is on the way for Friday, and Sunday and Monday will bring down a wintry mix of snow and rain. Hardest hit in the storm were the towns of Marshfield and Scituate, just south of Massachusetts Bay, where storm surge breached an eight-foot flood wall at high tide - coating houses with icy seawater from below - as frost and snow blanketed them from above. The flooding sank parked car and flooded roads - forcing the National Guard to evacuate some residents before high tide caused even more flooding again early this morning. Buried: Residents spent Wednesday digging out cars and sidewalks in Boston, after the storm dumped more than two feet in some areas . Frosted over: These coastal homes in Scituate, Massachusetts, on the South Bay, were coated in ice from sea spray and flooding caused by a massive storm sturge . Some 36 inches of snow fell in Lunenberg and Auburn, Massachusetts. Elsewhere, blasts of wind topped 75mph. In Boston, Juno dumped 26 inches on many streets, with 30mph overnight winds. The total is two inches shy of the all-time record. The storm punched a gaping hole in a seawall and swamped a vacant home in Marshfield, Massachusetts, and flipped a 110-foot replica of a Revolutionary War ship in Newport, Rhode Island, snapping its mast and puncturing its hull. Burrillville, Rhode Island, got 26.5 inches. More than 20 inches piled up in Portland, Maine, and 33.5 inches in Thompson, Connecticut. Orient, on the eastern end of Long Island, got about 30 inches. Two deaths, both on Long Island, were tied to the storm by police: a 17-year-old who crashed into a light pole while snow-tubing down a street and an 83-year-old man with dementia who was found dead in his backyard. Lived to tell the tale: Tim Mannix was gashed in the face when a wave shattered a window of his house in Marshfield, and he had to be rescued by front-end loader and then Humvee . Getting around: This morning commuter needed skis to navigate the waterfront in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Boston skyline can be seen in the background . The Pilgrim nuclear plant in Plymouth, Massachusetts, was shut down after two transmission lines were damaged in the storm - though the plant remained safe, the Boston Globe reports. 'I had to jump out the window because the door only opens one way,' Chuck Beliveau said in the hard-hit central Massachusetts town of Westborough. 'I felt like a kid again. When I was a kid, we'd burrow through snow drifts like moles.' New York City was spared the brunt of the storm - despite forecasters predicting so much doom and gloom at the governor shut down the subway system, the first time ever for snow, and the mayor closed all roads on Monday night and Tuesday morning. However, just a few inches of snow fell in the city. Bitter cold in New England threatens to complicate efforts to clear clogged streets and restore power to more than 15,000 customers shivering in the dark, including the entire island of Nantucket. A 78 mph wind gust was reported there, and a 72 mph one on neighboring Martha's Vineyard. The low in Boston on Wednesday was expected to be 10 degrees, with a wind chill of minus 5. Forecasters warned that it won't get above freezing for a week. Several inches more snow is slated to fall on New England on Friday and high winds return to much of the Northeastern US .

The Quincy Patriot-Ledger reports that it could take days for power to be restored to everyone in the South Bay. The cold temperatures ensure that little snow will melt and digging out will be time consuming and arduous. 't’s a lot of snowfall, and residents are encouraged to be patient. It’s going to take a couple days to clean this up properly,' Quincy spokesman Chris Walker told the newspaper. Despite the inconvenience of the storm, it brought little actual damage to New England. Save for a few homes that flooded in the seawall burst, most of the region was unscathed Wednesday. About five homes have been condemned due to the flooding. There were no deaths in Massachusetts and less than 30,000 homeowners lost power during the storm. About 200 people stayed in storm shelters - far fewer than predicted, the Globe reports. 'If you’re the one dealing with power outages, you don’t really care that the number is a lot less than expected. But the fact that we are dealing with 25,000 power outages and not 250,000, I think, is a little bit of a blessing in all of this,' Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker told the newspaper. In Portland, Maine, Phil Curran uses a snow blower to dig out from the storm. Up to a foot more is expected for the area on Friday . All that remained of the blizzard-that-wasn't in New York on Wednesday was snow piles on sidewalks and at intersections . Deluged: Although Winter Storm Juno failed to live up to its hype in New York City, it was a very different story in many parts of New England.

"A grieving mother has been asked to tear down a shrine to her stillborn baby daughter after council officials ruled it was not 'in keeping' with the rural graveyard where it is situated. Jade Beadle, 24, covered daughter Tanya's grave in pink stones, put up a border fence and decorated it with children's toys after the baby died following a 39-week pregnancy last August. Miss Beadle said the feeling of doing something for her lost child helps to comfort her and partner Sanbeep Bidla, 29, but they have now been ordered to tear it down. Jade Beadle, 24, has been asked to remove this shrine to her stillborn daughter from a graveyard in Kindlington, Oxfordshire, by council chiefs who say it breaches regulations . The grave, which is inscribed with neon pink writing, features matching neon pink gravel, flowers, a series of children's toys, and a photograph of her stillborn daughter wearing a pink onesie. Council chiefs in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, have warned that she has until Saturday to comply otherwise they will call in a team to do it themselves. A letter from Kidlington Parish Council said that 'trinkets and lights' placed on the grave violated rules at the council-owned cemetery. Miss Beadle, a supermarket assistant, said: 'It's not got any lanterns so there's no light bothering anyone, it's not got wind chimes so there's no noise bothering anyone. 'As far as I am aware there have been no complaints from anyone about it. 'It's just a pink little grave for a little girl and I think they need to remember it was a little baby girl and her room was prepared full of her teddies and had pink walls and pink curtains. 'We just tried to make her grave as much like her room would have been as we could. 'They want to take it off her grave to make the mower's job easier, well I want to have that stuff on the grave because it's not even been six months since I lost my daughter. 'That's how me and my partner cope, it's going down there and doing stuff for her garden. It makes us feel like she still needs us, she still needs us to do stuff for her. 'If that's taken away it's like she's being taken away from us all over again, because then she doesn't need me anymore. Councillors wrote to Miss Beadle and partner Sanbeep Bidla telling them that the 'trinkets and lights' around the grave are not in keeping with the cemetry's appearance, and giving them until Saturday to remove them . Miss Beadle has refused to clear the tribute away, and has now got together a petition of 3,000 signatures asking for her to be allowed to keep the shrine in place . 'They haven't handled it at all sensitively, and I feel angry about that because i just feel that if they had done their jobs properly and informed me about the rules in the first place then I wouldn't have had to go through all this heartache. 'The support has been amazing and I think a lot of the people are thinking that if they lost a child they would want to feel that they would be able to do whatever helps them to mourn.' Instead of complying with the council's request, Miss Beadle and her friend, Charlotte Nichols, have drawn up a petition signed by 3,000 people asking councillors to back down. Miss Nichols said: 'When you lose someone you love it leaves a huge well of pain and hurt inside of you. Sometimes having a grave for them gives you something to do to keep busy; something to focus on. 'Simple things like erecting a border filled with stones and putting ornaments down can make you feel like you are actively doing something for them. 'Your signature might mean that Jade can have the beautiful garden she has created for her daughter.' Jade said she chose the council-run Kidlington Cemetery because the village's other cemetery, at St Mary's Church, did not have any room. Explaining the council's decision, chairman David Betts said: 'We have a whole range of people buried there, they could be children, elderly people or parents. 'We have a set of rules that were drawn up in order that we could provide some commonality at all places, sensitivity, and a private place where the majority of people can visit in quiet tranquility.' He said that he 'did not anticipate' the council changing its rules and added: 'If we changed the rules it means there could be a big debate about what is allowed and what isn't, we could have a list of things.'","Jade Beadle, 24, made shrine in memory of stillborn daughter Tanya .

"By AMANDA LILLIU FOR THE DAILY MAIL . Amanda Lilliu (pictured) has four children, the youngest of which, Natalia, has just turned 13 . Most busy mothers yearn for that moment in the evening when they can grab some precious time to themselves and, certainly, I’m no different. But a few weeks ago as I sat down to enjoy the peace and quiet, an emotion inside me shifted and I suddenly found myself sobbing hot, stinging tears. It was the silence that did it. There was nobody home and in that moment, I saw my future flash before my eyes. Quite simply, I felt overwhelmed with the heartbreaking loneliness of life as a mum of older children. Not that I’m an ‘empty-nester’ — far from it. My nest is still very full. It’s just that the youngest of my brood of four has turned 13, two are now in their 20s and none of them wants much to do with me any more. Not so long ago Saturday evenings were a different story. We’d all watch TV together with the children sprawled out on sofas and rugs. Now, when I look back on it, those were wonderful nights. One of them would usually fall asleep curled up on my lap and I would carry them up to bed, breathing in the delicious smell of their warm, milky skin. Now, I’m redundant, obsolete: a service for providing clean jeans, food and cash, to be utilised only when necessary. I find myself with all the time in the world, and the great irony is — I don’t want it. Indeed, I feel utterly bereft and would give anything to go back to those chaotic days, before the teenage years, when I was the centre of my children’s universe — when I couldn’t even take a trip to the bathroom unaccompanied. I’m not saying that having four young children was easy. Mornings in our house were particularly stressful — making sure everyone ate breakfast, brushed their teeth and had all the kit they needed to get out of the door on time. Then I’d spend hours after school ferrying them to activities — horse-riding, gymnastics, swimming, Irish dancing — they only had to show a passing interest and I was there, with cheque book and carefully researched itinerary memorised and marked on the calendar. I used to dread supermarket shopping on Saturday mornings, when we resembled a travelling circus. I’d turn my back for a minute to read the ingredients on a packet and all four children would be running up and down the aisles, leaving me desperate for some peace and calm. Scroll down for video . Amanda with husband, Graziano, on their wedding day in 1993. Amanda feels like her children barely notice she's around anymore . But, exhausting though it was, I knew exactly what my role entailed and I felt fulfilled performing it. In fact, I would go back to those days in a heartbeat. Now, aged 53, I don’t know what to do with myself. I put my career ambitions on hold after having my eldest, son Jordan, now 24, when I was 29, and my children have been my priority ever since. Today, Jordan, lives with his girlfriend a few miles away in Leeds. Daniella, 21, who’s a hairdresser, and Natalia, 13, still live at home while Giorgia, 18, started a business studies degree at Manchester University last October and comes home every weekend and during the holidays. My husband of 22 years, Graziano, 51, is an accountant who works long hours and often at weekends to cover the bills and mortgage repayments on our four-bedroom modern detached house in North Yorkshire. I suppose I should be grateful that our three girls get on famously well when they’re home. They spend hours in one another’s rooms, gossiping, laughing and swapping clothes, leaving me on the periphery — uninvited. They barely notice I’m around. And who can blame them? As a middle-aged woman, I’m just not on their wavelength any more. Probably, all mothers bemoan the same thing. But it’s as if, since they entered their teens, they’ve moved to a different planet. When they were little, I knew all the names of their favourite TV characters, and the words to their nursery rhyme songs. Naively, I expected that I’d always be able to share in their interests. And I do try, but I get the distinct feeling they don’t want my input, and find my attempts mildly embarrassing. As Natalia is my last child, I’ve tried to hold onto her as much as I can. But she has always looked up to her big sisters and the pull to look and act like them is far greater than any desire to listen to what her old mum says. So now Natalia has well and truly cut the apron strings, too, and, like her sisters, has an amazing social life. She plays women’s rugby twice a week and she and her friends go to the cinema, ice-skating and horse-riding. My social life, by contrast, was put on the back burner to raise my family and, as a result, it could take years to reignite it. I still cook a big dinner every night — lasagne, risotto, pasta with a homemade sauce, the foods they adored as little ones. But unlike when they were younger and we all sat down together at 6.30 pm, and chatted about our days, I can’t remember the last time we had a family meal. Three of Amanda's children are pictured here Daniella, Georgia and Jordan. Amanda recognises that it is not just her children that aren't keen to spend time with their parents, it's a regular occurrence in children their age . On the rare occasions we manage it, our conversations are interrupted by the beeps and pings from their smartphones. But mostly I end up heating up the food, one plate at a time, as and when my family deigns to come home. At other times they come in and go straight to their rooms to watch TV, unless they have something to say like: ‘Can you wash my sports kit?’ or ‘Would you book those concert tickets for me?’ It’s such a far cry from the days, not so long ago, when I would look for their little faces as they came out of primary school and they would scan the crowds of waiting parents looking for mine, and I’d see them light up with delight. I could kick myself now as I remember pushing them on swings in the park and feeling on edge because there were so many other things I thought I should have been doing. I’d give anything to be able to go back in time and enjoy one of those days, one more time. I realise now, with great nostalgia, that it was the loveliest time of my life. Having spoken to friends, I don’t think my children are any less keen on hanging around with their parents than others their age. Our eldest daughter, Daniella, is on holiday in Thailand and, before she went, I overheard Natalia comment: ‘I don’t know what I’ll do without you. I’ll be so bored stuck here with Mum and Dad.’ Her words stung, but I told myself to swallow my pride and take advantage of the situation, so I invited Natalia to join me for a weekend at a beautiful spa hotel on the North Yorkshire coast. She turned me down flat: apparently, she’d already made weekend plans with her friends. To fill the void, I have started over-eating. Sitting alone, I will think ‘I’ll open that box of chocolates’ and then, because there’s no one there to share them, I’ll finish the lot. What’s isolating about the loneliness of being a mum of older children is that I don’t deserve sympathy because my children are doing the most natural thing in the world: growing up. I left home in my late teens and, ironically, I remember pulling away from my own parents, becoming selfish and distant. But, once I became a mother myself, I grew close to them again. We shared an interest as they indulged me when I pored over each baby’s milestone, their first smiles, words, teeth and steps. I hope I don’t have to wait until I’m a grandmother to get my own brood back, but at least I can be confident that, by staying close and remaining supportive, it will happen one day.

Police say that Jacob Hughes set the plan in motion by inviting Ferrell out for drinks at a bar and food at a Waffle House on Saturday before offering to take him to the house to see his children. Murdered: John Michael Ferrell, 51, left, was allegedly beaten across the head and body with a hammer and shot multiple times after he went to the home of his estranged wife, Jane Hughes, 33, right, on Saturday . Ferrell had previously written on his Facebook page how rarely he saw his children. He was able to see them in November after being apart from them for a year, he said. They left the Waffle House at 11.23pm and headed towards to the house. Not long after arriving at the home, Ferrell was struck in the head with a hammer, police said. He tried to climb through a six-foot high kitchen window but either his pants got caught on a nail or people inside pulled them down trying to prevent him from escaping, police said. 'He was hindered by his pants that were down around his ankles, preventing him from fleeing, in addition to the trauma from being struck in the head multiple times with the hammer,' said Keith Grounsell, police chief in Simpsonville, a suburb of about 20,000 people just south of Greenville. John Hughes then took aim and fired at Ferrell, who was found dead 12 feet from the kitchen window in the front yard, Grounsell said. Arrested: Her brother Jacob, left, met Ferrell for a drink before taking him back to the house by offering to let him see his kids. Once there, the man was attacked by her family and boyfriend, Andrew Martin, right . Family plot: Her father John Hughes, 57, left, shot Ferrell as he escaped the home but claimed it was because the man was breaking in. His wife Margaret Hughes, 55, right, was also arrested by authorities . He had been shot five times with a .45-caliber handgun and had been assaulted in the head and body with a hammer, authorities said. The Greenville County Coroner said that Ferrell suffered from blunt force trauma to the body as well as multiple gunshot wounds, and the death was ruled as a homicide. Before his arrest, John Hughes told WYFF-TV that Ferrell was trying to break in through the window and that he feared for their lives so he shot him. 'I killed my son-in-law,' he said. 'That's horrible enough. But the fact I have to somehow tell my grandchildren that I killed their father - that might be more than I can take.' Grounsell said forensic investigators found evidence of blood throughout the kitchen that was cleaned before police arrived Saturday night, and no one in the family mentioned any fight in that room. Together: Ferrell is pictured with Jane, with whom he was locked in a custody battle at the time of his death . Heartbreaking: Ferrell posted this message beside a photo of him with his daughter in November last year, expressing his sadness over the time he had lost with his children . Loving: On Facebook, the father had written of his sadness that he did not get to see his children more often . Court records show that Jane Hughes and Ferrell were going through a contentious divorce and child custody dispute, WHNS-TV reported. Ferrell told officials that John Hughes told him taking his granddaughter would be the last thing he ever did. John Hughes told the court his son-in-law abused the children. A judge had issued a restraining order against the Hughes and Ferrell, according to WHNS-TV. The deceased man's family paid tribute to him on Facebook and shared photos of him with his young children. 'Never know if you'll get another chance to talk to someone. RIP Dad,' his grown son, Brad, wrote. He added: 'Really appreciate the quick and efficient work by the Simpsonville police department. It means a lot.'

"A family who saved vouchers so they could go on a £10 holiday have been hit with a £350 fine for taking their children out of school. Simon and Karen Richardson could not afford an expensive break with their four children - three of whom are school-age - so collected vouchers in a national newspaper to save money. But they returned from the five-day trip to Perranporth, Cornwall to discover they had been fined £369 for taking Jodie-Ann, 9, Aiden, 6, and Alex, 7, out of school. The Richardson family from Bideford, Devon saved vouchers for a £10 holiday - but were hit with a £369 fine for taking their children out of school . Mrs Richardson, 35, said they took the risk of going on the trip during term time as they believed the maximum fine they would receive would be £60 and a similar trip during holidays would have cost in excess of £400. But instead both parents have been charged for each of their three children that all attend East-the-Water Community Primary School in Bideford, Devon. The costly break has left Mrs Richardson - who also took her two-year-old son Liam with her - upset and angry. She said: 'I think it is appalling. The school has got it so wrong. We are both working parents and we don't get much family time and we simply can't afford to go away during the school holidays. 'If we had known it was going to cost us this much, we would never have gone.' The family have been told the fine must be paid within 28 days or it will be doubled. If that is not paid they could face a fine up to £2,500 and three months in prison. Mrs Richardson, from Bideford, said: 'I am concerned that we won't be able to pay the fine and worried that any court action could jeopardise my husband's job as an electrician visiting local schools.' She said she did write to the school to make the request to take the time off but Devon County Council say it stands by its decision and claims its procedures were followed correctly. Its policy states that leaves of absence during term time can only be granted by the head teacher and is only allowed in exceptional circumstances - which do not include trying to avoid expensive holidays. A spokesman said: 'If the school refuses your request and the child is taken out of school, this will be recorded as an unauthorised absence and this may make you liable to a penalty notice for each child, payable by each parent or carer.' The school have yet to comment on the row. The family took a five-day trip to Perranporth, Cornwall - but returned home to a shocking bill from the school .","Devon family couldn't afford full-price getaway in the school holidays .

"A mother whose cancer has returned for the third time has turned her back on modern medicine - and says she will try to overcome the disease through healthy living and alternative therapies. Anne Pharo, 41, has been treated for breast cancer twice since 2010. During this time, she has undergone two mastectomies, six rounds of chemotherapy and four weeks of radiotherapy. After beating the disease twice, Ms Pharo found a lump on her rib cage in October 2014 and doctors confirmed the cancer had returned for a third time. Despite being told the disease will kill her if she doesn't embark on more chemotherapy, she has opted out of further treatment. Instead, she and has decided to beat cancer on her own, by eating healthily, running marathons and using alternative therapies. Anne Pharo, 41, beat breast cancer twice before, undergoing two mastectomies, chemotherapy and radiotherapy (she is pictured, left, after a mastectomy). Now the cancer has returned, she has decided to try and overcome it on her own by eating healthily, running marathons (right) and seeking alternative treatments . After being diagnosed with cancer in 2010, Ms Pharo, who is a sible parent to James, 16, and Jessica, 13, continued going to work - only taking time off for hospital appointments - as she feared the family wouldn't survive financially if she wasn't working . Ms Pharo, a customer services manager who lives in Portsmouth with her two children James, 16, and Jessica, 13, said: 'In my opinion, chemotherapy and radiotherapy don't cure cancer. 'That kind of treatment is just a temporary thing and the cancer does come back a few years later. 'It nearly killed me and was tough for my kids, so I decided I'd never put my body through it again. 'Instead I took up running. 'I've also drastically altered my diet, I go for oxygen therapy every week and see a homeopath. I'm determined to get better this way.' At her latest hospital appointment this month, Ms Pharo was told the tumour has grown since October. Yet she is still refusing any help from the NHS, except for examinations every three months. She also disagrees with claims by doctors that is she allowing herself to die. Consultant oncologist Professor Karol Sikora said there is no evidence a healthy diet, exercise and alternative therapies will cure Ms Pharo’s cancer. However, her treatment is her own choice and doctors must respect that, he added. He told MailOnline: ‘The patient is always in the driving seat; their treatment is up to them. ‘I would try and persuade her to have two cycles of chemotherapy, as I’m sure her doctor is doing. ‘There’s no evidence that diet alone will help without the chemotherapy. ‘With the chemotherapy, a healthy diet and exercise is beneficial. ‘But it’s not a cure, you need conventional treatment too. ‘Different people react to cancer in different ways and one has to respect that. ‘Oxygen therapy and homeopathy, these alternative therapies offer false hope. ‘There’s no evidence they work. A lot of people believe they work and that is the problem. ‘Alternative therapists will have great stories of people who have benefitted from their therapy, but they won’t give you the real statistics, because the facts show it doesn’t work. ‘I would recommend having conventional treatment, and then by all means, have  alternative therapies as well if you really like, but don’t replace the former with the latter.’ She said: 'I don't want to put my body through any more trauma. I want to try and treat this with natural methods. 'My oncologist isn't very happy, but it's my body after all. I am not in denial or giving up - I've even registered for a half marathon on Gothenburg this summer. 'But I have lost faith in NHS. I wish they would consider working together with natural treatment, but instead I'm having to go it alone.' Her first diagnosis came in January 2010, after she noticed her left breast had become misshapen. She said: 'It was a huge blow. My ex-husband is no longer around and I was terrified at the thought of leaving the kids behind if something were to happen to me. 'I was desperate to get better for their sakes. 'The tumour was quite large, about 7cm long, so I said yes to everything my doctor suggested. 'I had chemotherapy from February until June, then a mastectomy, followed by radiotherapy for two months.' She had finished her treatment by September 2010, but describes those months as 'such a struggle'. She said: 'I'd been very honest with the kids about what was happening to me, so it was a horrible time for all three of us. 'It didn't help that I had to work throughout the whole ordeal, while feeling sick and exhausted, . 'I was an office manager at the time and didn't feel we could cope financially if I left my job, so I stayed at work and only took time off for hospital appointments. 'I put a post on Facebook asking for advice, sort of a cry for help. 'An old friend got in touch who had beaten cancer himself and it all started from there. He gave me a few tips to gradually change my lifestyle. 'It was a step-by-step way to get back to normal after cancer. 'My new diet was mainly based on alkaline foods. Lots of greens, avoiding anything with sugar and wheat, avoiding most meats. Ms Pharo began chemotherapy in January, and says the treatment was a 'struggle'. Her body suffered further the following January, when, during breast reconstruction surgery, her lung was punctured. She is pictured during chemotherapy . In October 2014, she was told her cancer had returned, but she refused surgery or chemotherapy. 'I decided it was all too invasive. I started researching other ways to treat cancer and found out about the oxygen chambers, which I now go to twice a week,' she said. She is pictured with her family during earlier treatment . 'Dairy produce has been linked to breast cancer too, so that was a major thing I cut out.' She also started exercising carefully. Initially, a ten minute walk would leave her exhausted. But she became fitter, building up how far she could walk, until she could jog and run. Finally, she signed up for the London Marathon to keep herself motivated. She said: 'Running the marathon in April 2012 was a huge achievement. I felt so much better, as though I was finally getting back to myself.' But a subsequent medical appointment in January 2014 led to doctors picking up on a second tumour. Ms Pharo was told in January her tumour had grown. But she is determined to keep refusing NHS treatment, and is undergoing oxygen therapy . Ms Pharo said: 'I think a lot of things cause cancer and one of the main things is stress. I'd been made redundant the year before, we'd packed up and moved miles from our home, plus I'm originally from Sweden so none of my family were close by to support me.' Initially, she thought doctors had made a mistake. 'I was in complete denial,' she said. 'I thought they couldn't possibly be right as I was on my new diet and I was still training. 'But obviously they were right. It was alarming - the tumour was so big. There was a big lump as well as a spotted tumour all over the breast.' She underwent a second mastectomy in March 2014 but she refused another 'damaging' bout of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Instead, she maintained her fitness despite the diagnosis, having signed up to run the Frankfurt Marathon in October 2014 and a week before running the marathon, a doctor discovered cancer cells next to a scar on her right breast. She said: 'Doctors wanted me to have a CT scan right away but I refused, as the rays are 200 times more powerful than an X-ray. 'They then scheduled surgery to remove the cancerous cells, but at the last minute I cancelled the operation. 'I decided it was all too invasive. I started researching other ways to treat cancer and found out about the oxygen chambers, which I now go to twice a week. 'I have drops prescribed by a homeopath and I take shots of bicarbonate soda with lemon juice. 'I've also been in touch with a woman who runs a treatment centre in Bulgaria. 'She beat cancer using natural methods, so she's going to help me raise money for treatment. The first step is having my mercury fillings removed.'

"The heart-wrenching exchange between a father whose son died in a car crash and the teenage drunk driver who was behind the wheel left witnesses in a Wyoming courtroom in tears on Monday. Takunda Mavima, 18, had just finished high school and was driving home from a graduation party on May 20 when he crashed into another car full of his classmates at Wyoming Park High School. Tim See, 17, and Krysta Howell, 15, died in the crash and now Mavima, who was also 17 at the time of the crash, will spend the next two-and-a-half to fifteen years in jail as a result. Forgiveness: Drunk driver Takuna Mavima, center, is embraced by Tim See, the father of one of the two teenagers that Mavima killed in a car accident shortly after his high school graduation in May . The local ABC affiliate WZZM 13 reports that at the time of the crash, Mavima had a 0.10 blood alcohol level, well over the legal limit of 0.08. Mavima had attended a party at his friend Shane Harlan's house before the accident and Michigan Live reports that Harlan was subsequently sentenced to probation and ordered to spend five days in a court-ordered program. Mavima's remorse was obvious as he attempted to hold back tears during his address to the courtroom filled with relatives of his victims. 'I’m so sorry that I took two bright, intelligent, wonderful people out of this world …. I wish … I’m so sorry,' he said, stopping intermittently for tears. Victims: Tim See, 17, and Krysta Howell, 15, were in a car with other students that was hit by Mavima in May but they were the only two who died . Remorseful: Mavima had to fight back tears as he apologized to the families of the victims . In tears: Former Wyoming Park student Takunda Mavima weeps as he stands with his attorney David Dodge during his sentencing on Monday . His sorrow did not fall on deaf ears, as . both the sister and the father of victim Tim See spoke on behalf of .

'I am begging you to let Takunda make something of himself in the real world-- don't send him to prison and get hard and bitter, that boy has learned his lesson a thousand times over and he'll never make the same mistake again,' Lauren See said in court. 'I promised myself one thing that day. I promised myself I would not get angry.' Forgiveness was seen throughout the ordeal, as the victim's father, whose name is also Tim, hugged Mavima as he walked out of court after the sentencing. Tears: Angel Howell (left), the mother of victim Krysta, and Tim and Denise See (center and right), father of the second victim, were all present during Mavima's sentencing . Emotional: The courtroom was filled with relatives of the two victims and the drunk driver, as well as their friends since all three went to the same high school . 'It was a perfect storm, everything that happened,' Mr See said. Relatives of Krysta were also present and her mother Angel said that in light of the accident she is determined to raise awareness about drinking and driving. While there is a range, the sentence is considered to be on the lighter side of the state's mandatory sentencing guidelines.","Takunda Mavima was 17 when he was driving home drunk from a high school graduation party in Grand Rapids, Wyoming .

"Moscow's ambassador to Britain was summoned to the Foreign Office last night after two Russian bombers flew over the English Channel. In scenes reminiscent of the Cold War, the diplomat was asked to account for the incursion of the military aircraft, which caused civil flights to be diverted or delayed on Wednesday. The long-range Tu-95 'Bear' bombers flew within 25 miles of the coast – through an area busy with passenger aircraft – forcing the RAF to scramble Typhoon jets. Scroll down for video . Off you go: A Russian Bear is escorted by an RAF jet during an alert in September. (File picture) The fly-by is the most daring yet by the Russian military and comes amid worsening relations between Westminster and the Kremlin – highlighted this week by the opening of the inquiry into the murder of former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko. The Foreign Office said Wednesday's incident was part of an 'increasing pattern of out-of-area operations by Russian aircraft'. A spokesman added: 'While the Russian planes did not enter sovereign UK airspace and were escorted by RAF Typhoons throughout the time they were in the UK area of interest, the Russian planes caused disruption to civil aviation. 'That is why we summoned the Russian ambassador today to account for the incident.' Experts said Vladimir Putin's move to send planes capable of carrying nuclear missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression. They said the manoeuvre in the English Channel could have been designed to probe the RAF's speed of reaction. Closely watched: RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled in October to track this Russian Tu-95 Bear H bomber, one of two which flew close to Britain without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers . But Defence Secretary Michael Fallon last month warned that Russia's aggressive incursions could accidentally down a passenger jet and accused president Vladimir Putin of playing a 'provocative and dangerous' game. RAF jets were scrambled more than 100 times last year to escort Russian bombers away from British airspace. In Wednesday's incursion, the Bears travelled right round the British Isles and were detected by long-range radars before being escorted away by RAF fighter jets based in Scotland and Lincolnshire. Although the aircraft were travelling in international airspace, they were deviating from a standard route, triggering a 'quick reaction alert'. An RAF spokesman said: 'The operations room was both calm and focused. We constantly train for these scenarios so that we are well-rehearsed and ready to maintain the integrity of our airspace.' Russian defence officials defended the incursion as part of a 19-hour 'air patrolling mission task' through the Barents and Norwegian Seas and Atlantic Ocean. A spokesman revealed that Norwegian and French aircraft also followed the bombers, which carried out two aerial refuelling manoeuvres.","Russian bombers flew over Channel in scenes reminiscent of Cold War .

"From March nurses from the European Union will have their language skills checked before working for the NHS (file picture) Nurses from the European Union will for the first time have their language skills checked before working for the NHS, ministers will announce today. From March, applicants from the EU will have to sit a language test if they cannot prove to medical regulators that they have adequate skills to communicate with doctors and patients. It will finally overturn a loophole in the law which saw Brussels block the move, claiming it would infringe strict EU rules on the freedom of movement of workers. While the rules were changed to allow language tests for EU doctors last year, they have now been extended to cover nurses, midwives, dentists, pharmacists as well as other dental professionals and technicians, from the EU. The tests for nurses and midwives will be carried out by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, as they already are for applicants from outside the EU, before foreign staff are allowed to register. It was not clear last night what form the English assessment would take, such as whether it would be an oral test or a written one. Hospitals are not allowed to employ staff unless they are signed up with the NMC – meaning that failure to pass the language tests will ban them from NHS work. EU dentists will have to prove their language skills to the General Dental Council, while pharmacists will have to do the same for the General Pharmaceutical Council. Regulations will be laid before Parliament today, paving the way for a Commons vote on the move over the next few weeks. With cross-party support, it is hoped the law will be changed by March. Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said the move was a major step forward for patient safety. There are concerns foreign nurses with poor English would be unable to understand instructions or even the words for numbers, so they can make up correct drug doses. Frail patients also find it harder to explain to staff who cannot speak English well that they need food, water or help to go to the toilet – or even that they are in pain. Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said the move was a major step forward for patient safety (file picture) Dr Poulter said: ‘These new powers will make it easier for regulatory bodies to carry out checks to ensure healthcare professionals have the necessary knowledge of English.’ Hospitals recruited doctors from 27 countries last year including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Qatar and Australia. Most were used to plug desperate shortages on wards, X-ray units and in A&E. Figures obtained by the Guardian show 32 out of 160 trusts recruited 321 doctors from abroad last year. The true number is likely to be far higher. Separately, 2,957 doctors who trained overseas joined the General Medical Council last year. It is not possible to say how many went on to the NHS. Dr David Rosser, of University Hospitals Birmingham, said it would take ten years to train up enough British doctors to fill the shortage. The Department of Health said: ‘In the past five years we have seen a rise in British staff in the NHS from 88.9 per cent to 89.1 per cent.’ The number of nurses hired from abroad has soared in recent years as the number of British-trained nurses has failed to keep up with hospitals’ needs. As many as 20,000 full-time posts – one in 20 – are vacant. As a result, many trusts are going overseas and hiring up to 60 at a time. Last year no fewer than 5,778 nurses were hired by the NHS – a four-fold rise on the previous year. A Mail investigation in November found hospitals are hiring hundreds of nurses from the EU without properly checking their English. Healthcare regulators are already allowed to carry out language tests on staff trained outside the EU – but have been prevented from doing the same for those from the continent because of EU rules. The Department of Health said: ‘Regulatory bodies such as the Nursing and Midwifery Council already carry out rigorous language testing of foreign healthcare professionals from outside the EU, so it makes sense to allow regulatory bodies to check applicants from inside the EU also.’","Nursing applicants from EU will have to sit language test from March .
Midwives, dentists and pharmacists will also have to pass test .

"The gleam in Leeza Gibbons' eyes these days isn't only because she's managed to make the cut on Celebrity Apprentice along with seven of the original 16 contestants. Leeza, who launched one line of jewelry last year, is about to introduce her second line of jewelry. Since she was a young girl growing up in Irmo, South Carolina, the 57-year-old former Entertainment Tonight host has had a thing for bling, insisting everything looks better with a little sparkle and shine. Her father Carlos, a school superintendent turned antique shop owner, shared his love of fabulous finds with his daughter. 'I've always loved jewelry,' Gibbons tells Daily Mail Online in an exclusive interview. 'And I could get lost in the rows of pearls and broaches Daddy displayed at his shop.' 'My sister and I used to joke that we had to hide any pieces of our own that w  truly loved, because Dad was likely to slap a price tag on it, put it in a display case and offer it up to customers.' Scroll down for video . Sparkle: Leeza Gibbons has managed to make the cut on Celebrity Apprentice along with seven of the original 16 contestants. And now she's ready to launch a new jewelry line. Arms of love: Leeza's inspiration was actually a picture she had of her mom after she was diagnosed. Says Leeza. 'In the photo I had my arms wrapped around mom and I was telling her I would always protect her' Shop 'til they drop: Leeza and her father Carlos still search flea markets for funky costume jewelry as well as more pricey estate baubles . Leeza says she could get lost in the rows of pearls and broaches her father displayed at his shop . Leeza and her dad still search flea markets for funky costume jewelry as well as more pricey estate type baubles. She admits that she became an even more avid collector once she launched her TV career. And she says that since the 1970s, she's amassed a huge collection of costume jewelry. 'I am not kidding, I have entire closets devoted to my jewelry collection,' the glamorous mother of three reveals. Now, however, the Emmy Award-winning Gibbons, who co-hosted Entertainment Tonight from 1984 to 2000, is turning her passion into a business venture and has launched not one, but two, jewelry lines. The first, Arms of Love, was inspired by love for her late mother Gloria Jean who died in 2008  of Alzheimer's disease . 'My inspiration was actually a picture I had of my mother and I together after she was diagnosed,' says Leeza. 'In the photo I had my arms wrapped around mom and I was telling her I would always protect her. 'Of course I couldn't do anything to stop the progression of that life-changing illness, but I could let her know that she would be wrapped in my love always and forever no matter what. 'In fact, to this day whenever I write a card, note or email to one of my three children, I always sign it AFNMW - always and forever, no matter what. And if you turn over each piece in my Arms of Love Jewelry line, you will see those very initials engraved on the back.' 'Brandi and I bonded during production of Celebrity Apprentice because of our love for our kids,' says Leeza. She gave her these necklaces as a gift . The Celebrity Apprentice star considers Olivia Newton-John (left) her mentor . The Arms of Love collection features pieces in 10 Karat gold and sterling silver with most containing a small diamond. Prices start as $200 and go up to $320. Gibbon's newest line – Wishes & Dreams – is due out in February and will be available at Kohl's stores and online. She says it's a real opportunity for her to share her message with the viewers and listeners who have grown up with her. 'I am a strong believer in making your dreams come true,' says Gibbons. 'A wish is a really powerful thing and when you fuel it with your intentions and believe in it with all your heart, your dreams can become reality. So for this line, we designed pieces that signify all types of wishes and dreams.' AFNMW  - always and forever, no matter what  - is engraved on the back of each piece in Leeza's Arms of Love Jewelry line . Leeza says she has had a lot of fun gifting her close friends with early pieces from her collections. 'One of the first pieces I gave away from Arms of Love, was to my dear friend Olivia Newton John,' says Gibbons. 'I consider her my mentor and when I was younger I wanted to have just a fraction of her goodness and likability. 'In 2008 Olivia and I became close friends when we walked the Great Wall of China together to raise money for her cancer and wellness center. That's when I met her new husband for the first time. I was so encouraged by the way she found love for a second time, that I allowed myself to open my heart and trust again even though I had not been able to make marriage work before. 'That was the energy shift I needed because I found my current husband Steven and we couldn't be happier.' Leeza recently surprised her friend Brandi Glanville with a piece from her line Wishes & Dreams. 'Brandi and I bonded during production of Celebrity Apprentice because of our love for our kids. We both wished the world for them and that all their dreams would come true, so I wanted her to have a necklace from my Wishes & Dreams collection.' Let's get serious: Leeza and Brandi made a wicked team on one episode of Celebrity Apprentice . 'Working with Donald Trump has been a real learning experience,' says Leeza. Season seven of Celebrity Apprentice began production with 16 contestants and  is now down to a cast of eight. So far Gibbons has outlasted such favorites as Lorenzo Lamas, Keisha Knight Pulliam, Gilbert Gottfried, Kate Gosselin and Kevin Jonas. 'It's been a blast working with all these great people and working with Donald Trump has been a real learning experience,' says Leeza. 'There has been a whole lot of craziness going on this season as well as a whole lot of toxicity! But come on folks, the toxicity is what makes it so good!' While Leeza loves her own creations, these days some of her favorite pieces are gifts from her husband of nearly four years, NY Times best selling author, Steven Fenton, 45. True love: Leeza says she opened her heart and learned to trust again with husband Steven Fenton even though she had not been able to make marriage work before . 'Every year, Steven gives me a special locket of some kind on Valentine's Day that contains a photo of us together taken the previous New Years' Eve. Some of the lockets are simple gold, some have diamonds and some are vintage pieces, but they are all treasures. 'I love the idea that my jewelry is a celebration of moments between lovers, family and friends,' says Leeza. 'I try and design the sort of pieces men love to give, and women love to receive, and it's a great feeling to know that in some way I am helping others build the same kind of memories Steven and I have built. 'A piece of jewelry is an intimate exchange of an expression,' she adds. 'It represents something precious and private that we share and that makes the giving and receiving of jewelry so special.'

"Climate change appeared to be out of control in Arizona according to a Fox 10 News weather map this week, which showed temperatures of thousands of degrees in some parts of the state. Clearly it was a glitch, but presenter Cory McCloskey refused to get hot and bothered about it, calmly telling his viewers to ‘get out while you can’. The map showed wildly inaccurate temperatures for several areas of the state, including 2960 farenheit for Cave Creek. Scroll down for video . Climate change appeared to be out of control in Arizona according to a Fox 10 News weather map this week . McCloskey exclaimed, as the news reporters laughed in the background, that 'steel boils at around that temperature, doesn't it?' He added: 'There's probably nothing left up there. So don't even bother looting. It's not going to be worth it.’ He continued: ‘Wow, 750 degrees in Gila Bend right now. And 1270 in Awatukee. I'm not authorised to evacuate Ahwatukee but this temperature seems pretty high. ‘Frankly, Wickenburg is a total loss. You might as well get out. Surprise is starting to heat up as well. The safe spots seem to be Chandler and Mesa. But you're surrounded by some pretty intense heat. I'm not your dad, but I would get out. While you still can.' Weatherman Cory McCloskey was praised for making light of the map temperature errors . A clip of the report was uploaded to YouTube and his coolness under pressure won him many admirers. Archlorddestin10 said: ‘Good job. Took the error and made it entertaining so people wouldn't get angry.’ Maria Clark, meanwhile, wrote ‘thought he played it off well’ and Antuan Rzenesepa described him as a ‘true professional'. The hilarious computer error follows a Fox News gaffe of a human nature. Last November news host Megyn Kelly managed to slip up while introducing Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. Kelly managed to pronounce his name correctly the first time around, but when it came to reading out the title of his show - named after himself - she blurted out 'F***abee' instead. As she made the gaffe, former Republican presidential candidate Mr Huckabee appeared to crack a smile before Mrs Kelly corrected herself.","Cory McCloskey was confronted by a wildly inaccurate weather map .

"The 55-year-old, was sentenced last week to 200 years in prison for impregnating his granddaughter and sexually abusing her younger sister . An 11-year-old girl from Montana has opened up about how her 55-year-old pedophile grandfather got her pregnant and then tried to cover up the incest by spinning a web of lies. The man was sentenced last week to 200 years in prison for impregnating his granddaughter and sexually abusing her younger sister. The Stevensville man was arrested in June after the victim was found to be 32 weeks pregnant after a doctor’s visit. He was the legal guardian of the 11-year-old and her 9-year-old sister. Investigators said the grandfather, who had a history of predatory conduct targeting young women dating back to the early 1980s, molested both girls in his care. Speaking to The Missoulian, the 11-year-old victim said she had no idea she was pregnant until she went the doctor in June complaining of stomach cramps. 'I didn't know what pregnant felt like, so I didn't know,' the unnamed girl said. The 11-year-old delivered a baby in August. During an interview with the head of a children’s advocacy organization, the little girl said when she would reject her grandfather’s sexual advances, he would 'lie on the couch and pout.' 'He’d wait to see if I could come out and look at him and feel sorry for him, but I wouldn’t,’ she said. To cover up the incestuous sex crime, the 11-year-old said her grandfather concocted a story for her to tell the children’s advocate about a 14-year-old boy who had gotten her pregnant at the county fair the summer before. However, medical staff noted that the term of the pregnancy and girl's suggested date of conception were out by three months. The girl later confirmed that her grandfather was the father of her baby. ‘Instead of him doing the wrong thing, he would come in and tell me what to say,’ the girl said in August. ‘He didn’t want to get caught.’ The girl's younger sister has revealed that on several occasions, she awakened on her bunk bed and watched through a hole as her grandfather molested her big sister. On July 1 last year, the nine-year-old girl told her biological mother that she witnessed the pedophile come into the girl's bedroom and assault her sister with his hands and mouth. During a forensic interview, she gave a detailed account of the oral sex, The Missoulian reported. Judge Jeffrey Langton sentenced the grandfather to 200 years in prison for sexually abusing his young granddaughters at Ravalli County District court (pictured) The younger girl also told investigators that he had sexually assaulted her by 'kissing her privates', then telling her it was a secret she had to keep. During the sentencing hearing Wednesday, Judge Jeffrey Langton said the convicted pedophile would be a menace to children if he remained free. ‘You seem to lack any semblance of a conscience,’ Langton said. When given the chance to speak, he muttered: ' I'm so sorry.' His two 100-year sentences will run consecutively. He will become eligible for parole only at the age of 105 and will be required to register as a Level 3 sex offender. The convicted pedophile had been charged two decades ago with lewd conduct with a minor and forced sexual penetration in a different state. The sheriff's office is still investigating claims that the pedophile, who is married according to public records, sexually assaulted other girls, one as young as three.","The 55-year-old, from Stevensville, Montana, was sentenced to 100 years each on two counts of incest .

"A 31-year-old man has spoken of his attraction for women several decades older than he is - and how he hasn't dated anyone under 60 in the past five years. Kyle Jones, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, also reveals that his oldest girlfriend was 91 as he shares his story on tonight's episode of TLC's My Strange Addiction. 'I love everything about older women. I love the smell, I love the feel, I love the mentality,' he says enthusiastically in a preview of the show. Scroll down for video . Unusual type: Kyle Jones, 31, admits that he's only attracted to women several decades older than he is on tonight's episode of My Strange Addiction; he's also seen going on a first date with a woman named Karen (pictured) Up close and personal: Kyle and Karen, who met online, share a steamy kiss during their first date . He adds: 'I love dentures. Women can be self-conscious about dentures. Ladies, I promise you, telling your man that you have dentures will not turn him off. 'It'll put a smile on his face. It'll put a smile on his pants.' Kyle points out that there are a myriad of terms for sexy older women, such as 'milf' and 'cougar'. But the one he prefers is 'silver fox', because he finds platinum hair a huge turn-on. He first became aware of his penchant for older women when he was in sixth grade. 'There was a really sexy teacher, and she was probably about 65. She had the platinum hair, she was top heavy and she was just gorgeous,' he recalls. First impression: 'She absolutely has the look that I'm attracted to. She has the platinum hair, she has a great smile,' Kyle says upon seeing Karen . Great date: 'You looked great online, but you look incredible in person,' Kyle tells Karen over dinner . By the time he was 18, he was dating a 50-year-old. Kyle is seen emailing a woman named Karen who catches his eye on a dating site, and proclaims her 'gorgeous'. 'She absolutely has the look that I'm attracted to. She has the platinum hair, she has a great smile. She looks very pretty and very adventurous,' he observes. Kyle and Karen meet for dinner at a restaurant and he immediately deems her 'sexy as hell'. 'You looked great online, but you look incredible in person,' he tells her. Positive review: 'The date with Karen was incredible. She was 100per cent my type,' Kyle says afterward . Mutual appreciation: Karen also says she had a 'wonderful time' on her date with Kyle . When Kyle asks why Karen agreed to meet him, she says: 'I look at all of these celebrity women that are going out with younger men and I thought maybe I should try it.' She adds: 'You seem to be intelligent - though I'm not going to say I necessarily agreed to come out with you because of your mind.' Karen admits that she is nervous because Kyle is so much younger, but she's excited to have a 'brand new' experience. When she notes that she's old enough to be Kyle's mother - or even grandmother - he assures her: 'You're pretty enough to take home though.' Dating history: Kyle, seen with a former girlfriend, first became aware of his penchant for older women when he was in sixth grade . The pair head back to Kyle's place, where they dance with each other and even share a steamy kiss. 'The date with Karen was incredible. She was 100per cent my type,' Kyle says afterward. Karen also says she had a 'wonderful time' with Kyle. Tonight's episode of My Strange Addiction also features a 30-year-old man named Adam, who has spent more than $175,000 on cosmetic procedures and costumes in order to look more like Madonna. Adam started his transformation into the Material Girl more than a dozen years ago. Age is just a number: Kyle's oldest girlfriend was 91-year-old Marjorie McCool (pictured), whom he was in a casual relationship with as of last June . 'Looking like Madonna is not easy,' he insists. 'I try to emulate each look of hers. I go down to the hair, the clothing, the stitching, the jewelry.' He has already spent about $100,000 on costumes alone, including pieces Madonna wore during her famed Blonde Ambition tour in 1990. 'It started when I was 15. I remember going through my mom's music collection and I came across her first album. I listened to it and fell in love with it. It spoke to my soul,' he says. His mother, Annette, adds: He would defend Madonna constantly, like if she was a girlfriend or a boyfriend, and I couldn't understand his love.' When Adam shows up dressed in drag while Annette has friends over, she is forced to explain her son's bizarre obsession to her guests. 'This addiction to Madonna strains our relationship,' she reveals. 'He doesn't know when to draw the line.'

"With visits to New York and the Netherlands already under her belt this month, Spain's Queen Letizia racked up yet more air miles with a trip to Vienna. Although without husband King Felipe, the 42-year-old  looked relaxed and happy as she arrived at the Hofburg Palace in the Austrian capital, to be met by President Heinz Fischer and his wife, Margit. Dressed in a chic tweed skirt suit and a simple white top, Letizia was every inch the royal style icon as she posed for photos with the presidential couple, ahead of a visit to the Kunsthistorisches Museum. Nice to meet you: Queen Letizia is greeted by Austrian president Heinz Fischer and his wife, Margit . Launch: Queen Letizia was in Vienna for the launch of an exhibition dedicated to artist, Diego Velázquez . There, joined once more by President Fischer and his wife, she officially opened the museum's new Velázquez exhibition, which is dedicated to the work of one of Spain's most famous painters. Diego Velázquez, who was born in 1599, is best known for his 1656 work, Las Meninas, which is usually housed in Madrid's Prado Museum. The painting, which shows Infanta Margarita Teresa surrounded by her maids of honour and servants, was commissioned by Felipe IV - an ancestor of the current King Felipe. Las Meninas also has an Austrian connection as Infanta Margarita went on to become the Holy Roman Empress and wife of Leopold I who oversaw the running of his lands from the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. All smiles: Letizia looked relaxed and at ease, despite being without husband King Felipe . Striking: Diego Velázquez' most famous painting is Las Meninas, which was created for King Felipe VI . Patron: Since her reign began in June, Letizia has devoted herself to promoting Spanish culture abroad . Highlights: Other paintings in the exhibition include 1635's Infante Baltasar Carlos on Horseback . It was also at the Hofburg that Margarita died in 1673 aged just 21, although not before she gave her husband four children, all of whom - Maria Antonia, Electress of Bavaria notwithstanding - died in childhood. Despite the tragic story behind Las Meninas, it remains one of Velázquez' most famous paintings, if not the only one he did of Infanta Margarita. Among the works set to go on display at the Kunsthistorisches Museum is another of the doomed princess, this time alone and as a pretty four-year-old. Other works included in the exhibition are Infante Baltasar Carlos with a dwarf (1631) and Venus at her toilet (1648). Letizia, although not famous for her love of art, has made  supporting her native culture a key part of her role, and, last week, joined King Felipe for the launch of a new Spanish language dictionary. Much of her time has also been spent travelling, with successful visits to the UN in New York and to King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima in the Hague among her most recent trips. Tragic: Infanta Margarita Theresa, who died aged just 21 in Vienna, also features in another painting . Missing out: King Felipe, pictured visiting the village of Boal on Saturday, chose to remain in Madrid . Hola! During the visit to Boal, the royal couple were shown around the picturesque village and met the locals .","The Spanish queen, 42, was in Vienna for the launch of a new art exhibition .

"To keep a marriage secret for six days in the world of celebrity is no mean feat, but to keep it secret for six years is something else altogether. But that's exactly what Russian businessman Roman Abramovich, 48, and his magazine editor wife Dasha Zhukova, 33, managed to do as it was only revealed yesterday that the pair wed many years ago. Indeed, it was only in a recent article in The Wall Street Journal that the detail of their relationship was let slip. Scroll down for video . The Wall Street Journal revealed that Roman Abramovich has been married to his 'girlfriend' Dasha Zhukova . The publication referred to the couple saying that they, 'met in 2005 and were married a few years later.' It has been reported that Russian-American Dasha gave her permission for the article to run the details but did not give any more information about when exactly she and the Chelsea FC owner  wed. So who is the woman who managed to tame one of the world's richest businessmen? Born in Moscow,  to an scientist mother and oil trader father, Darya or 'Dasha' moved to US with her mother at the age of 10 when her parents split up. No trophy wife, Dasha attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, and graduated with honours with degrees in Slavic Studies and Literature.

Dasha met Roman in 2005 when he was married to his second wife Irina Vyacheslavovna Malandina, reportedly at a New Year party organised by her oil magnate father. She was dating former Russian tennis star Marat Safin at the time. The power couple became officially linked in 2007 after Roman had divorced. In February 2009 Dasha, who previously owned her own fashion label Kova & T, was made editor of avant garde fashion magazine, POP. However, she got everyone talking when she sensationally quit after just three issues. Dasha is a regularly at fashion shows pictured here looking glamorous at a Dior show in 2012 . A tanned looking Dasha and Roman attended an event at the Venice Biennale art festival together in 2009 . Then in 2014 she caused uproar by posing for a photograph, in which the chair she sat in was formed from a black female mannequin, in online fashion publication Buro 24/7. Both Dasha and the publication were accused of racism and she later released a statement saying: 'This photograph, which has been published completely out of context, is of an art work intended specifically as a commentary on gender and racial politics. 'I utterly abhor racism and would like to apologize to those offended by my participation in this shoot.' A popular socialite, Dasha has regularly been seen out and about with some of society and fashion's finest. She now runs her own magazine Garage - as well as an arts centre in Russia - which is part-funded by her husband. Dasha is also mother to two children by Abramovich, a son named Aaron and a daughter named Leah. The couple own homes in London, Moscow, Colorado, the Caribbean and the South of France and Roman also owns some of the world's biggest yachts. Dasha isn't Roman's first wife, in fact the owner of Chelsea Football club has actually been married twice before and has seven children... Wife number 1: Olga Yurevna Lysova (1987-1990) Little is known about Roman's first wife Olga. The couple married in 1987 but were divorced just three years later in 1990. They did not have any children together. In 1988 the couple set up a market stall selling dolls  - a business which she described has having bought the couple success almost immediately. And it was a wedding present from Olga's parents that would help him to make his first investment. They gifted the newlyweds 2,000 rubles - around £1,000 at the time - which he invested and managed to double and then triple the cash within a year. Roman and his second wife Irina married in 1991 and split in  2007  amid reports that he was dating Dasha . Wife number 2: Irina Vyacheslavovna Malandina (1991-2007) Just a year after his divorce from Olga, Roman married air-stewardess Irina Vyacheslavovna Malandina in 1991. The couple had five children: Arkadiy, Ilya, Arina, Sofia and Anna but subsequently divorced in 2007 as it was reported in 2006 that Roman already had a close friendship with Dasha, who was then  25. Much speculation followed as to how much their divorce settlement would be worth with it eventually being reported that Irina had been awarded £155million - the largest settlement in the world.","It was revealed today that the couple married six years ago .

"A staggering 11 billion of them are sold every year in the UK alone – and they have been cited as one of the best reasons for visiting an Ikea store. And now the furniture giant is planning a twist to its famous Kottbullar meatballs by introducing a vegan version from April. The decision came about after heavy lobbying from animal rights activists PETA, which successfully convinced the Swedish home giants to add a meatless version to its restaurant menu. IKEA sells 11 billion of its famous Kottbullar meatballs (pictured) in the UK alone. The furniture chain is planning to introduce vegan meatballs to its restaurant menus in April this year . 'PETA hears every day from shoppers calling for animal-friendly on-the-go options', said PETA Director Mimi Bekhechi. 'Vegan snacks spare animals suffering and benefit human health, which earns IKEA a round of applause from PETA.' IKEA was caught up in the international food fraud scandal in 2013 when it emerged that its famous meatballs, made with beef and pork, actually contained a significant amount of horse meat. Tens of millions of the meatballs were removed from sale in store restaurants and shops across Europe, including in the UK. PETA's petition alone snagged 25,000 signatures, GrubStreet reported, and the outcry was enough for Ikea to confirm that the new meatballs will be available in their restaurants from Spring. The website revealed that an Ikea representative told animal-rights group Viva! that the 'the veggie ball does not have any animal content and is therefore also suitable for vegans'. Frozen bags for takeaway are being planned for later this year. Louise Bangee, IKEA UK Food Manager, said, 'At IKEA we want to offer healthy food choices that are delicious, sustainable and affordable for the many people, based on our Swedish identity. 'We are currently developing our food range to provide options that meet the different preferences of our customers. 'One of the exciting new products is a Veggie ball which will be launched in our stores from April and onwards. The veggie ball does not have any animal content in the ingredients. We will share more information about our new veggie balls nearer the time of the launch.' The chain was caught up in the international food fraud scandal in 2013 when it emerged that its meatballs contained a significant amount of horse . Last spring MailOnline reported that the store decided to tinker with the family favourite by creating a green and vegetarian option. Joanna Yarrow, head of sustainability for Ikea, said the company's meatballs were the most carbon-intensive dish on its menu. This is in part because of the beef and pork content but also because of the sheer volume it sells. Miss Yarrow was reported to have told a sustainability conference: 'We are looking at all our food products from a sustainability perspective but specifically meatballs.' Ikea's stores feature restaurants and also sell typical Swedish food, including the so-called Kottbullar meat balls. Ikea estimates it has sold 11.6 billion Swedish meatballs and 1.2 billion hotdogs to its British customers since it opened in the UK in 1987.","Talks to introduce the vegan meatballs began in spring 2014 .

"Two seats will be contested at the General Election where the majority of voters were born overseas. A record four million people born abroad will be able to vote in May after a decade of mass immigration, a study predicted yesterday. The figure – up 500,000 since the last election – represents one-tenth of the electorate. In a historic development, more than half of those eligible to vote in London’s East Ham and Brent North seats were born overseas. In two seats - East Ham and Brent North - more than half of voters were born outside the UK . In 10 areas outside the capital at least a quarter of voters are foreign born, according to the study . Such voters will make up a third of the electorate in another 25 seats, and at least a quarter in a further 50 constituencies, according to experts at Manchester University. Their report says those born abroad are likely to hold the balance of power in 20 key constituencies – including 12 Labour marginals, six Tory seats and two held by the Lib Dems. The country that provides the most foreign-born voters in England and Wales is India, followed by Pakistan, the Republic of Ireland and Bangladesh. The figures, compiled for the Migrants’ Rights Network, include up to two million immigrants granted British citizenship since 2000. About 200,000 applications are now approved every year – or one every two-and-a-half minutes. Large numbers arrived when New Labour was operating an ‘open-door’ immigration policy – a strategy designed, according to Labour adviser Andrew Neather, to ‘rub the Right’s nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date’. The 3.98million voters born overseas includes up to a million from the Commonwealth who do not have British citizenship. Former Labour minister Barry Gardiner is the MP in Brent North while shadow minister Stephen Timms is MP for East Ham . Recent analysis by MigrationWatch UK, based on the 2011 census, showed there are 960,000 who have the right to vote in England and Wales. Under arcane rules, citizens of 54 independent sovereign states can register on the electoral roll as long as they have an address in Britain. In many cases, the arrangements are not reciprocal. Britons are not allowed to vote in Canada, Australia or the three most populous countries in the Commonwealth – India, Pakistan and Nigeria. In 2008, a report commissioned by the then prime minister Gordon Brown called for changes in the rules to prevent Commonwealth nationals without UK citizenship from voting in general elections. The report was never acted upon by the Labour Government – nor has the issue been addressed by the Coalition. MigrationWatch has suggested that ‘one possible reason’ why Labour ignored the report was that minority voters are more likely to support the party. The Runnymede Trust, an anti-racism organisation, found that 68 per cent of these voters backed Labour in the 2010 election. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats received just 16 per cent and 14 per cent of their votes respectively. The authors of yesterday’s report said that although migrants will not vote as a bloc, patterns suggest they are likely to prefer parties viewed as ‘positive’ about race equality and immigration. They added that the growing significance of the ‘migrant vote’ is being largely ignored by the main parties. Co-author Robert Ford told The Guardian: ‘Migrant voters are almost as numerous as current Ukip supporters, but they are widely overlooked and risk being increasingly disaffected by mainstream politics and the fierce rhetoric around immigration caused partly by the rise of Ukip. ‘Britain is more than ever an outward-facing, globalised country with a huge, hardworking, mobile electorate born overseas. However, the political debate fails to reflect that contemporary reality in any meaningful way. Ukip have made all the running with the immigration debate in the past few years and we have seen all of the parties looking to offer a harder line on migrants. ‘But there is another side to this debate – millions of hardworking British citizens who came to this country from abroad who find this kind of rhetoric profoundly alienating. ‘If the parties do not respond to that then they face lasting damage as this electorate is only going to become more significant.’ EU citizens are permitted to vote in local elections but not Parliamentary contests. This week, Ukip’s Nigel Farage said they should also be barred from any future referendum on EU membership. Last night MigrationWatch chairman Lord Green of Deddington said: ‘This report underlines the absurdity of giving the vote in Britain to foreign citizens from Commonwealth countries which do not give the vote to British residents in their own countries. ‘This is an issue which has been ducked for too long. It is not a question of hostility. It is a question of honesty and common sense.'","In East Ham and Brent North more than 50% of voters are foreign born .

"When a Mississippi man's wife of more than 60 years passed away, he, naturally, received words of comfort from family and friends. But, along with the condolences from loved ones, came words from his wife herself.

"A single mother of eight who receives benefits of £2,000 a month claims she is being forced to find her first job because of the new cap on welfare handouts. Marie Buchan, of Selly Oak in Birmingham, receives benefits of £26,000 a year but claims the decision to cap handouts at £23,000 will leave her and her young family struggling to survive. The 33-year-old fears the cap will leave many families in financial difficulty and could cause similar problems to the bedroom tax. Scroll down for video . Marie Buchan (centre), of Selly Oak, Birmingham, pictured with her children (from left)  Joshua, eight; Mikayla, four; Tia, 12; ten-month-old Olivia; Leah, 11;  Latoya nine; Amelia, two and Alisha, six, claims proposals to cap benefits at £23,000 will leave her young family on the breadline and force her into work . Her concerns come in spite of her being told that if she works for 16 hours a week she will still be eligible to get the full £23,000 maximum pay out. 'This benefits cap is getting out of control,' she said. 'I am being forced into work. You're going to get similar cases as to what happened with the bedroom tax - people taking their own lives due to the financial pressures they are feeling. It will hit people that hard.' Miss Buchan had her first appointment at the Jobcentre this week. She added: 'I was very shocked when I heard David Cameron's plans for capping. It was bad enough when the benefits were capped last time. 'I have eight children who need to be fed and clothed and properly looked after, but it's so difficult to do that when money is so tight. I think most are struggling to pay rent under the current cap - I know I am. 'It is a constant struggle.' Miss Buchan is pictured with White Dee (left), star of reality TV show Benefits Street, and outside her home . Marie Buchan says she will be around £58 a week worse off if the new cap comes in and is concerned . She has been told if she works 16 hours a week she will still receive child tax credit and child benefit and up to £350 in childcare. Miss Buchan added: 'I went to a work focus interview and was told if I work for 16 hours a week I would get my full rent paid. 'I would be so much better off as I would still be entitled to child tax credit and child benefit, and then also up to £350 childcare. It appears going back to work may be the only option for me. Ms Buchan said the benefits cap could force many families like her own to struggle to cope financially . Ms Buchan (left) and pictured with five of her offspring (right) said the first benefits cap left her struggling . 'I know I will be the better person for working but it will be tough with eight children to look after. I did attempt to start work and had it all in place to do a 16-hour cleaning job but the kids didn't want to get ready in the morning, so I could leave in time. It's going to be so tough.' David Cameron has announced plans to reduce the benefits cap from £26,000 to £23,000 a year. The maximum loss - on top of the effects of the existing cap - would be £60 a week, with an average weekly loss of around £40 or £25 for those newly capped. It would apply to combined income from; Jobseeker’s allowance, income support, employment support allowance, housing benefit, child benefit, child tax credit, industrial injuries and disablement benefit. In 2013 the initial £26,000 cap was introduced. Mr Cameron said the new measures would be introduced within the first few days of a new Government being formed. He said the savings generated would provide another £135 million towards funding three million apprenticeships by 2020. The Prime Minister rejected claims the new cap would plunge more families into poverty and said some complained it was higher than what some working people are earning. Miss Buchan claims her children, all of whom are under 13, leave her working up to 21 hours a day. The single mother receives £2,227 a month in benefits. Her relationship with her partner and father of all of her offspring ended in 2013 because he could not handle having so many children. She cares for Tia, 12, Leah, 11, Latoya, nine, Joshua, eight, Alisha, six, Mikayla, four, Amelia, two, and Olivia, one, on her own with their father seeing them at weekends. The mother-of-eight, who lives in a four bedroom council house, has been receiving benefits since she had her first child at 19. She previously complained after David Cameron capped current benefits at £26,000 - the average household weekly wage - saying the cap would leave her on the breadline. Mr Cameron announced the new cap and said he was responding to claims that the current limit is too high. He said money saved from the proposed post-general election cuts would be used to fund new apprentice schemes. However critics have warned the consequences of the cap would bear most heavily on children. Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: 'Lets be absolutely clear - the benefit cap is at least nine times more likely to affect children than adults, and the majority of adults it hits are lone parents, many of whom have children so young even the Government recognises they should not be required to work. 'Britain is facing a looming child poverty crisis. Lowering the benefit cap would bring it several steps closer. It would pile on the misery for working and non-working families already struggling to pay for absolute basics.'

"Meet The Undateables of the animal world - who have all found happiness thanks to one kind-hearted dog-lover. These adorable pups were taken in by rescue worker Jennifer Clayton, from Salt Lake City, Utah, after they were abandoned because of their special needs. The 38-year-old is currently proud 'mum' to four dogs she has adopted as her own, as well as two foster dogs. She has also fostered many more whom she has helped find permanent homes. Scroll down for video . Ms Clayton has adopted four dogs including her pit bull mix Ruby, who was born with cleft palate and abandoned with pneumonia . Thirty-eight-year-old Jennifer Clayton of Salt Lake City works at a rescue center and helps animals with special needs find homes. Pictured above, her dog Ruby . The Facebook page, titled For the Love of Ruby, has more than 37,000 likes and also features Ms Clayton's other dogs . Ms Clayton adopted her first dog 15 years ago, an Australian shepherd mix Chester, followed by blind chihuahua Chino, paralysed chihuahua Gideon and Ruby, who was born with a cleft lip and palate. She's also taken in foster dogs Zee, a pit bull mix with one eye, chihuahua Jimmy and Cupid, a beagle-terrier cross who suffers from a neurological condition which makes it difficult for her to walk. The Utah Animal Advocacy Foundation worker said: 'I have always loved animals. When I was 19, I was working as a dog trainer and visited a local shelter for the first time. 'I was shocked to learn that the majority of the animals there would not make it out alive and I was determined to do something about it. I've been working in rescue ever since. (From left to right) Zee, a pit bull mix with one eye, beagle-terrier cross Cupid and Ruby all take a bath at Ms Clayton's house . Ms Clayton acts as a foster parent to numerous other dogs as she look to find them new, loving places to live . The rescue worker says that 'people aren't sure what will be involved in caring for a special needs pet' and shy away from adopting them . The dog-lover maintains that she is able to see past the canines' disabilities. 'Every animal has something unique that makes you fall a little in love with them,' Ms Clayton said. 'It's incredibly humbling to have an animal show you love and trust - especially when they have experienced the worst humanity has to offer. Ms Clayton says many of the animals were unwanted because potential owners are unsure about the work required. Ms Clayton set up a Facebook page for Ruby that helped fund the dog's treatment . 'I think the main reason disabled animals are sometimes not adopted is simply because people are afraid of the unknown. People aren't sure what will be involved in caring for a special needs pet.' She regularly takes her dogs to veterinarian appointments and shares photos of their progress after previous lives of neglect. 'We do occasionally come across someone who feels our efforts are being wasted on these special-needs animals, and that we should focus our efforts on animals who are 'normal' and healthy. 'At an adoption event a man once referred to Chino as a 'freak of nature' - and I decided then and there that he needed to stay with me forever, that was 12 years ago. 'I feel strongly that every animal deserves a chance - and they can do so well if they are given a chance.' Ms Clayton is an advocate for the rehabilitation of dogs with special needs and set up a Facebook page, which now has more than 37,000 likes, after adopting Ruby when she was just a few days old. The pit bull pup - now one - was born with a cleft lip and palate and three veterinarians recommended euthanising the animal, who had pneuomonia when she was abandoned and was not expected to survive her first night in shelter. However, thanks to Ms Clayton's devoted care she has come  leaps and bounds. She said: 'When I started Ruby's Facebook page, I had absolutely no idea that it would be as popular as it is now.' 'I have loved sharing her - and the other rescued animals - with people around the world and have been so very appreciate of the support we've received in return.' Ruby was born with cleft palate and was only able to feed from a tube for the first four months of her life . After four months only able to be tube-fed, the puppy was taken to a University of Pennsylvania surgeon and can now eat regular food. 'Ruby's followers have helped us raise necessary funds for surgery and medical procedures, and helped to find homes for some of the special needs animals in our care,' Ms Clayton said. She sees a slow change in attitudes towards puppies with disabilities. 'We are often contacted by the parents of children with cleft palates and other physical differences, who say their children have identified with Ruby and enjoy seeing how well she is doing, . 'Ruby and the other special-needs dogs featured on her page are famous and loved because of their differences, and I think there's a really important message in that.' The rescue worker has set up giving pages to help contribute to medical needs for several dogs. After an operation from a University of Pennsylvania surgeon, Ruby was able to eat food normally and is now healthy .","Jennifer Clayton, 38, from Salt Lake City adopts dogs with disabilities .

"Like many an expectant mother, Rachel Gibson went for her 12-week pregnancy scan full of excitement at seeing her unborn baby. And despite the scan and a subsequent blood test revealing the baby had a one in 90 chance of having Down’s syndrome, she refused to become despondent. She says she was offered the prospect of an abortion if another test confirmed doctors’ fears – but instead trusted in her ‘instinct’ that the baby would be fine. Scroll down for video . Rachel Gibson says she was offered an abortion by doctors who warned she her unborn baby was at high risk of being born with Down's syndrome . But despite the odds, she and her partner refused and welcomed their healthy baby son, Zane, last June . Yesterday the mother-of-three posed proudly with healthy baby Zane as she urged other women to ‘trust in their own instincts’, and told how she would have had the baby whether or not her unborn son had been diagnosed with Down’s syndrome. Mrs Gibson, 33, of Stoke, said: ‘It was a very worrying time when we were told Zane was at high risk of being born with Down’s syndrome but it goes to show that sometimes doctors can be wrong. ‘We had a one in 90 chance of having a Down’s syndrome baby, which is high risk, but ... tests in pregnancy aren’t always right.’ Research suggests a woman her age would normally have a one in 1,000 chance of having a Down’s syndrome baby. She said that following Zane’s birth last June doctors confirmed he did not have Down’s syndrome, and added: ‘In my mind I knew he was going to be healthy because he was moving all the time (in the womb) and I just had an instinct he would be fine.’ Doctors first became concerned for the Mrs Gibson when she was diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum, the extreme form of morning sickness suffered by the Duchess of Cambridge in both of her pregnancies. A fortnight later, she was in hospital for six days when the condition, which is characterised by extreme sickness and nausea, worsened. At the 12-week scan doctors detected excess fluid on the back of the baby’s neck, which can suggest a possible case of Down’s syndrome. Blood tests were ordered and the results also suggested a risk of Down’s, as high as one in 90. The teaching assistant and her partner Darren, 34, an HGV driver, were offered the option of an amniocentesis - a procedure used to obtain a small sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the foetus during pregnancy. Although the procedure can diagnose Down’s syndrome, it increases the risk of miscarriage to 1 in 100, while the risk of developing a serious infection is put at 1 in 1,000. Early amniocentesis - before the 14th week of pregnancy - has also been linked to increased risk of the baby developing club foot. Ms Gibson urged other pregnant women to trust their instincts, claiming she knew Zane would be ok . Mrs Gibson said she was told an abortion would be an option if she had the test and it came back positive for Down’s. She added: ‘I had a number of phone calls from staff at the hospital about taking the test. I got the impression they were pushing for me to have it but I refused every time. ‘They said the procedure would create an increased risk of miscarriage so we decided against it. ‘The combination of my illness and the risk of the baby having the disease was why they mentioned an abortion at that stage. ‘The doctors said both myself and the baby were at risk but termination was never an option for us.’ Mrs Gibson, who also has daughters Naomi, 13, and seven-year-old Amelia from a previous relationship, gave birth naturally to 8lb 9oz Zane at Royal Stoke University Hospital in Staffordshire. She said the traumatic pregnancy has ‘made me love Zane even more’. Dr Michelle Mohajer, a consultant in obstetrics and foetal medicine at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust, said it would be ‘most unusual’ for a hospital to advise or offer a termination after only a scan and blood test. The NHS operates a foetal anomaly screening programme which is open to all expectant mothers in England. Its policy is to offer an abortion only after a diagnosis for the condition is confirmed by the amniocentesis test. Dr Anne Mackie, director of programmes for the NHS Screening Programmes, said: ‘The NHS Foetal Anomaly Screening Programme provides all pregnant women in England with high quality information and support so they can make an informed choice about screening for Down’s Syndrome and a number of physical abnormalities in their unborn baby. ‘Women are encouraged to carefully consider the benefits and possible harms of screening in light of their own values before making a decision.’","Rachel Gibson went for her 12-week pregnancy scan full of excitement .

"Brazen prisoners are boasting about their cash, drugs and weapons stashes on Instagram, an investigation has found. The inmates were caught flaunting their hauls on social media despite the cannabis, £50 notes and knives - not to mention mobile phones - being banned. Hundreds of photos by prisoners were found in a probe by Channel 4 News, which comes amid claims Britain's jails are becoming more dangerous because of a shortage of staff. Scroll down for video . Dangerous: Prisoners are openly flaunting possession of drugs and knives on the photo app Instagram . Mountain of evidence: One image contained a copy of the Sun newspaper from November 21 with a prisoner ID card, £10 notes, extra-long rolling papers for joints and buds of cannabis wrapped in green kitchen bags . Most of the images were posted on the social media site Instagram, popular with teenagers, celebrities and lovers of fashion and food. Some of the accounts were set to private, meaning only an approved network of friends - including other prisoners - could view them. Others were viewable by anyone on the internet. In a smartphone video posted on Instagram, one inmate asks another to pay him back - to which the prisoner responds by peeling off a 'pinky' (a £50 note) from a wad of cash. With his cell TV blaring behind him the prisoner puts the rest of the money in his pocket, joking: 'I can buy food with this'. Contraband: Some of the profiles were publicly available, while others we part of a private network . One photo obtained in the investigation shows an inmate preparing a cannabis joint next to a deadly lock knife at least two inches long. Another shows a large kitchen bag full of cannabis buds lined up next to rolling papers, £10 notes, a copy of the Sun newspaper from November 2014 and even a prisoner ID card. Cash and mobile phones are banned in prisons, as are illegal items such as weapons and drugs. In 2013 the number of phones confiscated in jails was 7,451 - despite prisoners who are found with smartphones having up to two years added to their sentences. The number of drug seizures has risen by a fifth in just three years amid concerns there are no longer enough prison officers to keep inmates in check. There were 3,700 drug seizures in 2010-11 but almost 4,500 in 2013-14, according to the Ministry of Justice. Prison Officers' Association chairman Peter McFarlin told Channel 4 News security has become 'impossible' due to lack of staff: . 'It's extremely disheartening for professional prison staff, but they need resources to be able to combat that sort of activity,' he said. 'Since 2010, 7,500 frontline operational prison staff have left the service, 3,500 in one calendar year to 2014 - that means... basic searching is not taking place.' He added proactive investigations based on tip-offs or covert information would have to be ditched. One former prisoner, however, said corruption was to blame. The recently-released inmate, who blogs under the name Alex Cavendish, wrote: 'The main way that [drugs] come into prisons is through staff. Wad: One photo obtained by Channel 4 as part of its investigation appeared to show a wad of £20 notes . 'The amount that prisoners or visitors can smuggle in is minute compared to the amount that is available on the prison wing.' A Ministry of Justice spokesman told Channel 4 News: 'We will never tolerate the use of contraband in prisons and will continue to clamp down on the use of any illicit items or substances. 'Prisons already use a comprehensive range of robust searching and security measures to detect items of contraband with intelligence-led searches, body searches, use of x-ray machines, metal detectors and CCTV surveillance cameras, as well as body orifice scanners all helping to tackle the use of mobile phones. 'Any prisoner who is caught or suspected for smuggling prohibited items will face tough consequences, which could include prosecution and a further sentence, closed visits, up to 42 days added to their time in prison or confinement to their cell for up to 21 days with no association time.' The full investigation airs on Channel 4 News at 7pm.","Incriminating images are posted on the photo-sharing app Instagram .

"A strange masked couple, thought to be armed, have handed themselves into police after terrifying local residents. A man and a woman wearing white hockey masks stalked parkland areas in the city of Auckland, New Zealand, for up to three weeks according to reports. Police responded with armed officers after they received a number of calls about the pair carrying what looked like firearms. One witness was conveniently a film student at Auckland SAE Institute. He wrote in a blog post, shared on Live Leak, that he spotted them while filming a skit and initially thought they were ‘playing a prank’. He then allegedly noticed ‘the male cocked his pistol as he started to approach’. A strange masked couple were spotted in a parkland area in the city of Auckland . ‘We were filming at Parnell Railway Station, and after we were done, discussing the footage, I looked past my friends into the bush on the opposite side of the railway to us, to see two masked figures stand up from behind the taller grass and shrubs,’ the student wrote. ‘We were all a bit confused, nervous, and we laughed, but found ourselves backing away, intimidated. Once they emerged and started to follow us we picked up the pace, splitting up and making our way back towards the main road,’ he said. Fellow film student Jayden O'Neill told Stuff.co.nz the encounter 'was funny at first'. 'But they (the masked pair) wouldn't say anything and just stared. We were half entertained and half scared because we had no idea what they were doing,' she said. The film school's manager Leyland Bottomley told the website: 'It's not a hoax.' Police believed them to be armed and put out a warning telling the pair to come forwards . After weeks of being spotted the pair handed themselves into police after terrifying local residents . But a spokesperson for Auckland SAE Institute told Daily Mail Australia: 'We won't be making any comment on this.' The student filmed his encounter with the scary masked couple and posted the footage online. Explaining the video, he wrote: ‘The last shot is while we were divided, me and the voice you can hear were looking for the guy from the first video clip, who had taken before us, and we realised they were following him directly.’ He later returned to the scene with friends to find a police helicopter circling the area. ‘We called the police, met up with them, and gave our report. They didn't say much but they went and looked armed with an M4 and kevlar vests. Auckland Police wrote in a Facebook updated that they had deployed armed officers . Officers were seen arriving near Parnell Train Station in Auckland by a film school student . The film school has denied their students have anything to do with the two masked people . ‘If you look closely in the video you can see that the female is armed. Whether the weapon is real or not, I just don't know. But someone else had already called the cops before we had a chance,’ he added. Auckland Police added three photos of the masked pair on their Facebook page, writing: ‘We strongly encourage the people in these pics to make contact with us so we can have a chat about their recent activities around Parnell and in the Domain.’ Police warned ‘it appears these two people are carrying firearms of some sort which, aside from being incredibly scary for people who encounter them, is incredibly dangerous for the masked individuals themselves.’ ‘When police are notified of people carrying and displaying weapons in public, we respond with armed officers,’ they wrote. Adding: ‘We have no way of knowing until we seize a “weapon” whether it’s real or imitation so we always treat it as real. ‘Wise up. Drop the masked act and come and chat with us about how to play safely.’ In an update on Thursday, they revealed the masked park pair are ‘currently speaking with our officers at Auckland Central after having made contact with Police mid afternoon. ‘Thanks to you all for sharing our story and helping to make sure they learn the errors of their ways’. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Auckland Police for comment.","A man and a woman handed themselves into Auckland Police on Thursday .

"Six-year-old Ellie Mae Wile is celebrating a huge milestone after entering remission from her cancer. The primary school student, from Horsham, has spent a physically and emotionally draining past couple of years battling leukaemia. While fighting the deadly disease, Ellie Mae also succumbed to E.coli and pneumonia, and she had to learn to walk again after the cancer treatment severely damaged her bones. Ellie Mae, six, from Horsham, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 2013. She also battled with E.coli and pneumonia and had to learn to walk again after cancer treatment damaged her bones . It is a miracle that Ellie Mae is has made such a full recovery as her cancer was missed several times by doctors before she was finally diagnosed. She first showed signs of illness aged four, when her concerned parents took her to the local GP surgery after she started suffering from lethargy and a string of other ailments. Over the course of a few months, they made repeated visits to the doctors and nearby hospital but were usually sent home with antibiotics. Speaking to FEMAIL about discovering the real reason Ellie Mae was always pale, tired and had aching legs, her mother Nikki Wile, said: 'We were on a family holiday in Plymouth and began to worry because she complained about lethargy and aching legs and wanted to use a pushchair. 'She was starting school soon and I thought ""this can't be right"" but we had been back and forth to the doctors and no one had picked up on anything.' Ellie Mae was always pale, tired and had aching legs. But her mother Nikki Wile really began to worry when her daughter complained about lethargy and aching legs and wanted to use a pushchair at the age of four . The chemotherapy drugs that were saving Ellie Mae's life were also suppressing her immune system. She withdrew into herself, unable to understand why everyone was 'hurting' her but her parents remained as positive as they could by trying to make hospital stays 'fun' with arts and crafts . It wasn't until one of Ellie Mae's aunts,who worked as a  receptionist at the local hospital, recognised the telltale signs for leukaemia and advised Nikki to take her daughter for a blood test. Nikki said: 'She noticed some tell-tale signs such as tiny red spots around her eyes and on her nose, she also noticed how easily her skin bruised after wearing a helmet while she was on a scooter.' The aunt advised Nikki and her partner Jim to take Ellie Mae straight to hospital and demand a blood test. She was admitted within the hour. Nikki said: 'We presumed they might say she had an iron deficiency but nothing prepared us for the news we received.' Nikki and Jim were taken into a private room and told their little girl had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Speaking about receiving the news, Nikki said: 'Never in a million years did we expect to hear that. 'That day we had been running around a farm looking at the animals and now we were frantically trying to find a bed for our little girl in a cancer ward.' Jim added: 'Nothing can prepare you for that moment. Shock, dread, fear, anguish and desperation were just some of the words that hit us and lived with us over the next months. 'We felt like we were being driven in a car we had no control over. 'Things were explained to us but we found it so hard to take in among the tears and anxiety. 'We went through hopeless bouts of self-doubt, questioning ""Why our daughter?"".' Ellie Mae was finally able to start school in May, although she had to use a wheelchair and frame as she re-learned to walk. Three days into the summer holidays she broke her left leg, due to a calcium deficiency caused by the effects of the chemotherapy and steroids . Ellie Mae was transferred to Bristol Children’s Hospital and given the first of many chemotherapy drugs before being transferred to the Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton. But there was worse to come. The chemotherapy drugs that were saving Ellie Mae’s life were also suppressing her immune system. Ellie Mae also withdrew into herself, unable to understand why everyone was 'hurting' her. Her speech dropped away and the steroids she was taking brought on mood swings and tantrums. Her leg muscles were also affected, making it difficult to walk. After 10 days in hospital, they were allowed to take Ellie home. For the next six weeks, they were in and out of hospital with a series of infections and also for her chemotherapy treatment. Then one November morning, her temperature spiked and she had to be admitted to Worthing Hospital, where her condition began to deteriorate rapidly. She was rushed back to the Royal Marsden where she was diagnosed with E.coli and pneumonia and very low potassium levels. Speaking about Ellie Mae's response to the ordeal, Nikki said: 'While she will never now how close to death she was, it suddenly clicked that Ellie Mae was going to get better and things became more positive' (Ellie Mae pictured before her diagnosis) Jim said: 'Over the next three weeks, Ellie Mae drifted in and out of consciousness. She lost any appetite she had and withdrew further into herself. She appeared to be losing the fight.' But after four weeks Ellie Mae was allowed home with a feed pump and spent another 57 days in isolation because of her suppressed immune system. Speaking about the 'intense' months that followed, Nikki said: 'She couldn't walk and was in and out of hospital constantly. For eight weeks, she was in home isolation to minimise infection risk due to her low immune system. 'Her medicine was making her ill and she struggled to understand why this was happening. She rejected her father and grandparents and only wanted me, it was extremely tough.' Jim added: 'This raised our stress levels because inside we were crying too.' Ellie Mae was finally able to start school in May, although she had to use a wheelchair and frame as she re-learned to walk. Three days into the summer holidays she broke her left leg, caused by the weakening effects of the chemotherapy and steroids and she has also broken her arm twice since. Donna Air, Sara Cox and Rochelle Humes join six year old Ellie Mae Wile Dunne at Downing Street to launch Cancer Research UK Kids & Teens, a new campaign to accelerate research and find cures and kinder treatments to beat childhood cancers sooner . Fortunately, Ellie Mae's schoolmates were extremely supportive though, taking it in turns to care for her and never questioning why she had no hair or used a frame to walk. Nikki said: 'While she will never know how close to death she was, Ellie Mae has fully appreciated her illness. Nikki said: 'About four months in, she accepted what was happening, and was able to deal with it and that helped things became more positive.' Nikki and Jim also employed positive tactics to keep all of their spirits up. 'It's amazing how many decorations you can make out of sick bowls,' laughed Nikki. The trio attended an event hosted by Samantha Cameron, right, on Tuesday at Downing Street for the launch of Cancer Research's new campaign. Rochelle Humes, pictured with Beau Apsley, also attended . They also turned to several charities for support, including the Rainbow Trust, who would come and sit with Ellie Mae so that they could grab a coffee and recharge their batteries. Nikki also says the value of Facebook support groups, where she forged many great virtual friendships with families who were going through the same as theirs, were crucial. She said: 'We won't know for five more years whether she is cured but we take each day as it comes.' Jim added: 'Some people might say we were unfortunate in what has happened to our daughter and what we have gone through but I believe we were lucky. 'The prognosis could have been worse and the fallout more severe.' Ellie Mae and Nikki attended an event hosted by Samantha Cameron last week at Downing Street for the launch of Cancer Research's new campaign ‘Cancer Research UK Kids & Teens’. The campaign aims to accelerate research and find kinder treatments and cures to beat cancer in younger people. Twenty children and teenagers and their families travelled from across the UK to join celebrity supporters of the campaign including Peter Andre and his fiancée Emily MacDonagh, The Saturdays’ Rochelle Humes, as well as presenters Kirstie Allsopp, Charlotte Hawkins, Sara Cox and Donna Air. Speaking about the event, Nikki said: 'It was so fantastic and great to see the kids enjoying themselves. I will fondly cherish the image of Ellie Mae running down the corridors of 10 Downing Street, playing hide and seek with the other children.'

"Drew Rosenhaus has filed for divorce after just over a year of marriage. The NFL super-agent cited 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for his wish to split from Lisa Thomson, a Miami real estate agent who also appeared on The Amazing Race. This all comes just one week after Thomson called police to come to their house after the two had been in an argument, saying she feared for her safety because there were guns on the premises. Scroll down for video . Drew Rosenhaus cited 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for his wish to split from Lisa Thomson (above), a Miami real estate agent who he married in November 2013 . The NFL super-agent has repped players including Rob Gronkowski and Terrell Owens (above) Miami police left that evening without making an arrest. Now, Thomson is opening up about the incident to the Miami Herald, and placing the blame on the couple's strained relationship with Ronsenhaus' brother, Jason. 'If you’re looking for the real reason of the divorce, it might be because Jason’s always at the house,' says Thomson. 'They both work from there. There’s no privacy.' In her complaint to police, Thomson also said that her husband and his brother had been verbally abusing her after returning home from wathcing the NFL playoffs that day. Shortly after, Rosenhaus handed Thomson a plastic bag, telling her to get her things and get out of the house. The pair were married in November 2013, and the home is owned by Rosenhaus and his brother. Thomson also points out another problem the two face is their age difference. 'I’m 29 and I like to go out,' explained Thomson. 'I’m a Realtor. I’m always out with clients. Drew doesn’t like me to have my own life.' She went on to say her 48-year-old husband did nothing wrong on the evening in question. Thomson blames their problems on Rosenhaus' brother Jason (above) Thomson appeared on The Amazing Race with her sister (above) back in 2012 . Despite all of this however, Thomson thinks the pair may still be able to work things out. 'It’s a tough time of year for him,' said Thomson. 'He’s always busy and gone. We’ll probably sit down and talk after the Super Bowl.'

"It's less than a week since Prince Charles was last in Saudi Arabia and just under three months since Prince Harry last visited the Middle East. Now Clarence House has announced that the Prince of Wales is to set out on a whirlwind solo tour of the region early next month, with the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Kuwait on the itinerary. However, the trip could prove controversial thanks to the presence of Qatar and Saudi Arabia on the schedule. New tour: Charles, pictured here arriving in Riyadh last week, is to tour the Middle East next month . Regular visitor: Prince Charles arrives in Riyadh for the funeral of King Abdullah last weekend . Last week, as Prince Charles flew to the Middle East for the funeral of King Abdullah, protests were sparked by the House of Saud's record on human rights. The dynasty has also been criticised for its strict interpretation of the Qu'ran which sees women banned from driving and have very few rights. Critics have also pointed to the Saudi embrace of the death penalty; highlighted by a harrowing video that emerged last week of a woman running from an executioner who then took two attempts to behead her. Qatar, meanwhile, has been mired in controversy following allegations of corruption and bribery related to its successful 2022 World Cup bid. The emirate has also been criticised for allegedly funding terrorist organisations, as well as hosting the headquarters of the Afghan Taliban in its capital Doha. Request: Charles, seen here with David Cameron in Riyadh, is travelling at the request of the Government . Return: One country that Charles will return to is Jordan, which he visited with Camilla last year (pictured) Culture: Last year's visit to Jordan also included a visit to the ancient Roman ruins at Jaresh . Charles' tour, which is at the request of the Government, comes less than a year after he last toured the region, on that occasion with the Duchess of Cornwall. During the 2014 tour, the couple had an almost identical itinerary with a single exception - Oman, which was on last year's tour, has been swapped for the UAE and Kuwait. A statement released by Clarence House said Charles' early return to the region emphasises the 'importance' that the Government places on having close ties with the Middle East. 'The Prince of Wales's return to the region, only one year after his last tour, demonstrates the importance Her Majesty's Government places on its association with key partners in the area,' read the statement. Entertaining: Charles and Camilla also travelled to Oman (Nizwah Fort pictured) but won't return this year . Controversial: Charles, pictured last year, will also visit Qatar - a destination likely to prove controversial . Meeting: Camilla with Queen Rania of Jordan (left) and teacher Amna Mahmoud at a Jeddah primary school . 'These connections are underpinned by the long-standing and respectful relationships which exist between the Royal Family and the ruling families in the Gulf.' Charles will certainly have time to meet many of those, with each of his stops set to be hosted by the local royal dynasties. Among them are King Abdullah II of Jordan, whose capital Amman is the first stop, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, emir of Kuwait, and Qatari ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. In the UAE, Charles will meet Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahayyan, the crown prince and deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces. All smiles: Prince Harry jokes with Geri Halliwell during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in November . Shopping: Harry's two-day visit to Oman also included a visit to the Muttrah Souq in central Muscat . Royal welcome: He was met by local ladies selling handmade crafts at the Nizwa Fort .","Charles will travel to the Middle East at the beginning of next month .

"Jason Deller is likely to be questioned further by police over the violent behaviour towards his two young children while at a suburban cafe in Queensland . An aspiring Queensland politician caught on camera pouring a jug of cold water over his baby son before slapping another child in the head, may not get off scot free after all, with police confirming to Daily Mail Australia that the incident was 'definitely under review'. And just moments after the police revelation, an emotional Jason Deller announced he would withdraw from the election. The violent and bizarre behaviour by the former Independent candidate, took place inside a cafe in the suburb of Buddina, in full view of other patrons. But, despite reports to the contrary earlier, it was confirmed on Friday afternoon by the Child Protection Investigation Unit that even though the issue 'is quite political at the moment, it is definitely under review'. The confronting CCTV footage shows Mr Deller pouring water from a jug over his baby boy's head and then slap his toddler son across the front of the head, before pulling the baby out of the high chair and storming out of the eatery on Sunday morning. Following the shocking incident, there was a backlash against the aspiring politician social media; including comments like 'QLD Police have some serious explaining to do as to why he wasn't charged? This is clear child abuse' and 'Yeah, people do smack their kids, I know it's seen as wrong these days .. but over the head?! Look how young his son is..' The father-of-four and award-winning engineer succumbed to the intense public pressure and announced he would withdraw from Saturday's ballot, saying 'I am completely devastated about how the event has been presented in public'. Scroll down for videos . The father-of-four is caught on camera pouring cold water from a jug on his baby son's head at a cafe last Sunday morning. The incident is 'definitely under review' according to police . The one-time Queensland Independent candidate then raises his hand to slap his toddler son across the head . The child is smacked so hard that the stunned youngster slides down off the table . Australia's leading child protection advocate, Hetty Johnston, told the Daily Mail that Mr Deller should 'do the right thing and withdraw'. 'It's disgraceful – I think every voter in the electorate in which he represents should be very aware of whether or not they want to vote for someone with the capacity to treat children in that manner,' she added. 'We don't need people like that representing us in parliament, leave him off the ballot, it's not acceptable. 'He's done this in public and probably thought he wouldn't be caught. 'Any right-minded thinking person should not vote for him.' Mr Deller stood down on Friday afternoon, reading from a written statement, he said: 'Last Sunday whilst having breakfast with my wife and family at a café in Buddina on the Sunshine Coast, a series of very challenging events led me to become frustrated and upset with the behaviour of my three year old son.' 'Unfortunately I reacted inappropriately and gave him a clip over his ear. I sincerely apologise to my son, and wife and to those who witnessed this incident. 'The incident was part of a series of a very challenging events which we had to deal with on Sunday morning, not unlike any other day with a child who has behavioural issues. 'As many parents know, it is sometimes very hard to discuss these issues outside of friends and existing support services that we confidentially engage to support me and our family. 'As a father, I work hard to provide the love and support that young people need to grow up as happy and healthy adults.' Mr Deller's wife (pictured on the right) is seated at the table throughout the entire incident . The engineer's wife finishes her meal before picking up their toddler and follows her husband out of the cafe . He continued, saying: 'I am completely devastated by how this event has been presented in public but fully understand my responsibilities as a male and father to ensure the safety and care of my family and children. We will continue to work with our family and support services.' 'I entered this campaign to make a difference in the community, however out of respect for the community perception and well-being of my family, I intend to withdraw my candidacy as an Independent for Kawana at the election tomorrow. 'I will devote my time to continuing to nurture my beautiful family and regain our strength as a family and will help the community wherever possible.' He had posted on his Facebook page, earlier this week, praising all election candidates who are also juggling parenthood.'My hat off to all politicians running for election who have children,' the post said. On Mr Deller's website, he attributed his decision to run in the Queensland state election to his 'amazing wife and four beautiful children' who are his 'greatest delight in life'. But the surveillance video shows the Engineering Your Life founder can be seen casually walking over to his infant son sitting in a high chair and pouring cold water from the jug all over the small baby. While Mr Deller walks away to put the jug back - his toddler son, who is standing on his chair, begins to climb on the table before pouring out his drink from a cup onto the floor. His father witnesses the behaviour and walks over to the young boy and swiftly smacks him across the head, so hard that the stunned youngster slides down off the table. Mr Deller pulls then proceeds to pull his baby son out of the high chair and walk out of the cafe. His wife, who is seated at the table throughout the entire incident, finishes her meal before picking up her toddler son to follow her husband out of the cafe, much to the astonishment of the other diners. A diner recognised the aspiring politician and called the police who spoke with Mr Deller but, as yet, no charges have been laid. The incident comes as Mr Deller praised all election candidates who are also parents on his Facebook page . On Mr Deller's website, he attributed his decision to run in the Queensland state election to his 'amazing wife and four beautiful children' who are his 'greatest delight in life'. He has now stood down from the ballot . Queensland treasurer Tim Nicholls said police had investigated the incident. 'Of course any action such as that that is reported is unbecoming and it's unlawful,' he said. Mr Deller had previously said such incidents could be seen in parks daily and he wouldn't be surprised if it occurred in most family homes but added that he did not condone such behaviour . 'The matter is a delicate issue, but there is nothing more to follow up – that's the end of it,' he had told The Courier Mail. 'Things get reported differently to the way they actually happened. This has completely been taken out of context.' Mr Deller said at the time police were taking no further action but a note would be placed on his record. Authorities have since revealed that the incident is under review. 'My wife's very upset and said that if this is what being in public life's like, then perhaps I shouldn't pursue it.' Mr Deller was planning to take on Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie in the seat of Kawana in this Saturday's Queensland state election.

"It's enough to get your knickers in a serious knot - with the price of your favourite underwear and t-shirts set to soar for the first time in several years because of the rapidly descending Australian dollar. With the local currency crashing to five-year lows, even dipping below the 80 US cent mark, the fear is the prices of cheap imports will soon head in the opposite direction. Most of the major department stores stock their shelves with garments produced in Asia, via wholesalers; including China, Thailand and Bangladesh. And even the bargains usually available at market stalls will inevitably be hit. Underwear is likely to rise significantly in cost for the first time in several years as a result of the falling Australian dollar . Retailers are facing increased costs, as their wholesalers importing normally cheaper priced items, struggle to cope with the dipping Aussie currency . Favourites for consumers like cheaper imported underwear and t-shirts could soar to their highest levels in more than five years because of the dipping currency. 'I have no doubt that a lot of retailers, ourselves included, will inevitably have to put prices up because the dollar is devalued,' Eric Morris, the chief executive of PAS Group, told The Age newspaper's Business Day. PAS Group boasts several of its own labels but also produces brands for larger retailers, among their clients are the likes of Myer, Target and BIG W. Mr Morris admitted that he couldn't be sure how much prices would go up as 'it will differ brand by brand'. The Australian dollar has had 17 per cent of value against the American Greenback wiped from it in the past eight months . Department stores could increase the price of some clothing by up to six per cent if the weaker Australian dollar continues its slide . The Australian dollar slid to 79.35 US cents on Thursday . Some analysts warn that if wholesalers ratchet up the costs, the increase at the department store could be upwards of five to six per cent. 'The industry in the past hasn't handled price increases well, it's going to be a challenge for ­suppliers and retailers to maintain those price increases,' Credit Suisse analyst Grant Saligari told The Age. 'Volume falls and then they wind up giving some or all of it back in promotions and specials,' he said. The Australian dollar has been weighed down by falling iron ore and oil prices. On Thursday, the local unit was trading at 79.35 US cents, down from 80 cents on Wednesday. Westpac senior market strategist Imre Speizer said concerns about the policies of the new Greek government and the possibility of an interest rate cut here are putting downward pressure on the Australian dollar. 'Commodities continued to slump, the CRB (Commodity Research Bureau) index down 1.3 per cent to a six-year low,' he said. The recent fall is decisive as 80 US cents is considered psychologically significant, a mark which the Aussie dollar has been flirting with since the European Central Bank announced its massive stimulus package. With the rising cost of imports caused by a weaker Australian dollar, underwear shopping could become a whole lot dearer in 2015 . Some analysts say some imported underwear will have to increase in cost, perhaps to their highest level in several years, because of the weakening Australian dollar . LTG GoldRock director Andrew Barnett said 'there’s a huge support level at US80c for the Aussie dollar, but if the Aussie closes under that for a day or two, with a bit of weakness we could see US75c in the next six or eight weeks'. Mr Barnett is confident the Australian dollar will keep falling, which will stop the Reserve Bank of Australia from cutting the cash rate. 'Glenn Stevens doesn’t want to put interest rates down, he’d prefer not to and if the Aussie dollar is going under US80c, drifting towards US75c I think the RBA will hold fire,' he said.","Suppliers warn dipping Aussie dollar means higher prices .

"A surge in digital payments has seen more parents opting to digitally transfer pocket-money to their children. But a new study from Commonwealth Bank has revealed less than one in ten parents feel their child fully understands the value of digital money. The research found a further one in three children doesn't understand where digital money comes from, while one third of parents agree that digital purchases make it harder to teach children the value of money. It also revealed the amount of pocket money being given to children  per week has risen since 2013 , with the average child now receiving $10.36, up from $10.17. A new study from Commonwealth Bank has revealed less than one in ten parents feel their child fully understands the value of digital money . Holly Clarke (left) said it's important her daughter Beatrix (right) experiences the physical transaction of the money she giver her for her allowance . Holly Clarke, a mother of three from north Sydney, told Daily Mail Australia she started giving her six-year-old daughter Beatrix an allowance last year. 'I started a Commonwealth Bank Dollarmite account and we give her three dollars a week. She deposits it into an account through a banking program at Roseville school,' said Ms Clarke. 'I think it's very important for kids to experience the physical transaction of money. I don't see the point in digitally transferring them an allowance- there is no learning that way.' 'Kids don't understand if they want you to buy an app it costs money. They don't understand that digital money is finite,' she said. Ms Clarke said she doesn't see the point in digitally transferring children an allowance since they will not learn the value of the money . Her mother Holly said Beatrix doe snot see digital currency as a finite resource and rather that it is specific to online transactions . Mrs Clarke said Beatrix still has little awareness of digital currency, and that is why she has chosen to give her allowance in hard currency. 'She still doesn't fully realise its money in her bank account. Most kids her age don't see digital money as hard currency. They think it's specific to online transactions.' Veronica Howarth, Head of School Banking and Youth at Commonwealth Bank, said there is a growth in parents opting to digitally transfer their children's allowance. 'There are now around 14 per cent of parents are now paying their parents through online transfer,' she said. Head of School Banking  at Commonwealth Bank Veronica Howarth (pictured) said more parents are transferring their kids allowance online . 'Our study found that sitting with children while transferring them pocket money can be a good way to communicate the value of money, but the research suggest it will limit their understanding. 'There is still a requirement from kids to teach them the traditional forms of currency,' she said. In a bid to teach children the value of money, Commonwealth Bank will invest $50 million over three years to expand financial education programs. The bank has launched an initiative to double the reach of StartSmart, their financial education workshops which were launched eight years ago, by 2016. Commonwealth Bank CEO Ian Narev, said 'just as technology is changing our business, it is changing the way children can, and need to, learn about money.'","New study finds more parents are digitally transferring money to their kids .

"A Hawaiian Airlines plane was forced to come to an abrupt halt as it zoomed along a runway after the captain became concerned about an unreliable airspeed indicator in the cockpit. There were a few frightening moments on board flight 445 – which was scheduled to travel from Honolulu, Hawaii to Auckland, New Zealand – when the captain hit the brakes moments before take-off. The Airbus A330’s tyres burst as it came to a stop on the runway on the southern coast of Oahu. The Airbus A330's tyres burst when the plane came to a sudden stop at Honolulu's airport . Passenger Craig Mitchell told television station KHON2 there were ‘quite a few white faces on the plane’ but everyone remained calm and staff did an excellent job of handling the situation. Mr Mitchell said: ‘I would say we were probably two seconds from lift-off when the captain slammed on the brakes and then he stopped right at the end of the runway and left off the runway.’ The plane was carrying 201 passengers and 12 crew when the flight crew aborted take-off. Passengers said the plane was surrounded by fire trucks after the captain hit the brakes just before take-off . Passenger Rosie Savaiinaea told stuff.co.nz: 'The pilot said ""If you smell a smoky smell, don't worry. It's only... um... smoke"".' As a result of the disruption the travellers were given a food voucher, but were denied free wifi access inside the airport, she said. Passengers disembarked on the runway and boarded buses to return to the terminal, where they waited nearly eight hours before they boarded a replacement plane. The journey from Hawaii to New Zealand is approximately eight hours, but due to the time difference passengers are scheduled to arrive at Auckland at 6:30am local time tomorrow. The Hawaiian Airlines aircraft was moved off the runway once its tyres were replaced.","Flight 445 was departing Honolulu, Hawaii for Auckland, New Zealand .

"Guests at a theme park hotel in Japan will be checked in and have their luggage delivered to their room by robots as well as use their faces to access their rooms. Henn-na Hotel at the  Huis Ten Bosch theme park is situated just outside Nagasaki, and will be offering cutting edge technology that could set a precedent for the future. Interestingly, the Japanese word 'henn' translates into English as change. Robots, or androids, will check in guests at the Henn-na theme park hotel in Japan . It is believed 10 robot staff will be sourced for jobs within the hotel, ranging from check-in to room cleaning. The hotel will offer guests the choice between using traditional hotel keys or face recognition to open their rooms. The robots are from the company that licenses Hello Kitty. The Japan Times reported company president Hideo Sawada as saying: 'We will make the most efficient hotel in the world. 'In the future, we'd like to have more than 90 percent of hotel services operated by robots.' And surprisingly the chance to see a whole new world of hotel service comes at a reasonable price. With lower staff costs due to using robots, rooms will become more affordable at the theme park hotel . The robots will also be used to clean guests' rooms as well as deliver up their luggage . A single room will cost around £40 (7,000 Japanese Yen) while a twin room will come in at £50 (9,000 Japanese Yen). However, with the expected interest, especially in peak season, set to book out the hotel, guests will be invited to 'bid' for a spot in the venue. But bidding for a single room will be capped at around £80 (14,000 Japanese Yen). There is expected to be a great deal of interest in rooms at the tech-savvy hotel, so guests will have to bid for a place especially in peak season . Due to the operating costs being lower, prices in the Henn-na Hotel will be lower than the other hotels there . That's still some way behind the prices of the other hotels in the theme park, but this has been offset against the use of solar panels, lower staff rates and other power-saving equipment. July has been pencilled in as to when the first building containing 72 rooms will be opening, with plans for a second wing already being discussed. The theme park is modelled in typical Dutch style in terms of its architecture and framework giving visitors a taste of the Netherlands.","Henn-na Hotel is at the Dutch-inspired Huis Ten Bosch theme park, Japan .

"A measles outbreak that began at Disneyland last month has now spread to at least 95 people across the US. Health officials in Arizona are monitoring 1,000 people to try and stop the spread of the highly contagious virus, including nearly 200 children who could have been exposed at a Phoenix medical center last week. Those who haven't been vaccinated have been warned to stay at home for 21 days or, if they must go out in public, to wear a mask. Healthy officials are monitoring 1,000 people after the outbreak of measles at Disneyland in California (pictured) Arizona is second only to California in the number of cases traced back to the Disney theme park last month with measles confirmed in five other states- Utah, Washington, Colorado, Oregon and Nebraska - as well as Mexico. 'To stay in your house for 21 days is hard,' said Arizona State Health Services director Will Humble. 'But we need people to follow those recommendations, because all it takes is a quick trip to the Costco before you're ill and, 'bam,' you've just exposed a few hundred people. 'We're at a real critical juncture with the outbreak.' Mr Humble said it's possible but unlikely that the number of cases can be contained at seven. Those who haven't had the mumps-measles-rubella, or MMR vaccine (pictured) are being told to stay home for 21 days or wear masks if they have to go out in public . Health officials do not yet know  how many of the children were vaccinated, or their age ranges but say they are working to notify the families who visited the Phoenix Children's East Valley Center between January 20-21. Children under a year old cannot receive the vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella but can get an immunity booster. An Arizona woman, whose case was confirmed on Tuesday in Maricopa County, had come into contact with a family from Pinal County who had recently traveled to Disneyland. She contracted the virus but was not exhibiting the tell-tale symptoms like a rash when she visited the Phoenix Children's East Valley Center. Maricopa County health director Bob England declined to say whether the woman had been vaccinated- which isn't 100 percent effective in stemming the spread of the disease. 'Unfortunately, she came down with the disease and by the time it was recognized had already exposed a large number of children at the facility,' he said. Most of those infected were not vaccinated leading to criticism of a small but vocal movement among parents to opt out of vaccinations for their children. Health experts have urged people to get the mumps-measles-rubella, or MMR vaccine shot. Mr England said health officials will check in with the families of the children following the 21-day incubation period, which ends on February 12. He added that most parents understood the importance of keeping their children home. Phoenix Children's spokeswoman Debra Stevens asked  anyone who suspects they might have measles  to call ahead to allow staff to take the necessary precautions to help keep measles from spreading, including bringing masks to incoming patients. People who haven't been vaccinated against measles, including children too young to be immunized, were warned last week to avoid the theme park . 'If someone has chosen not to vaccinate their children or for some reason cannot vaccinate their children, they face a higher responsibility now to let their health care provider know in advance,' she said. Meanwhile, masks are being placed outside health care facilities and signs went up outside a handful of places in the town of Kearny, in Arizona, warning customers and employees that they could have been exposed to measles. A man who is recovering from measles also came into contact with the Pinal County family that visited Disneyland. Gila County health officials say they are tracking 17 people who were at a hospital in Globe in the same time frame as a person confirmed to have measles. The US experienced a record number of measles cases last year, with 644 infections from 27 states despite being largely eliminated in 2000.","There have been 95 measles cases across five US states and Mexico .

"Ed Miliband's grandfather Dawid Kozak who died in 1945 in the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald . Ed Miliband has revealed that he is finally ready to visit the Nazi concentration camp where his grandfather was murdered. The Labour leader said he was considering a pilgrimage to the infamous Buchenwald death camp in Germany to keep the memory of his maternal grandfather alive. Mr Miliband knew from an early age that Dawid Kozak had died in an extermination camp, but only learned the full horror of his death six months ago after visiting Israel where he discovered the only known picture of his Polish relative. The Labour leader, who has now released the poignant photograph, discovered that Dawid, a Polish Jew, was worked to death by Nazi guards aged just 36. He is among 60 of Mr Miliband’s relatives on both sides of his family to have been murdered by the Nazis. Mr Miliband, 45, said: ‘It has taken us almost 70 years to find out the truth. ‘But it's still very hard to take in. We had thought he died in Auschwitz, but he died building a Nazi airstrip in a camp called Harzungen.’ This was part of the Buchenwald death camp in Germany. ‘Justine and I discussed what we would tell the boys,’ he said. ‘We told them their great-grandfather died in the war. They are too young now for more than that.’ Dawid had arrived at Harzungen late in the war and he died only three months before the camp was liberated by US soldiers in 1945. Asked if he was now ready to visit the camp where his grandfather died, the Labour leader told the Mirror: ‘I’m thinking about it, yes.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband revealed the recent discovery of his grandfather's murder in an interview with BBC Five Live at their studios in Salford this morning . Ed Miliband’s mother Marion grew up in the Jewish quarter of Czestochowa in southern Poland. Marion, born Dobra Jenta Kozak, was saved from the Nazis as a six year old girl by a Catholic family called the Sitkowskas, who risked their lives hiding her and her family. In April, on his trip to Israel, Ed was reunited with his long-lost 84-year-old Aunt Sarah Ben Zvi - his mother's cousin, also sheltered by the Sitkowskas. Ed's dad Ralph was born in Belgium in 1924, the son of a Polish leather craftsman. In 1940 as the Nazis occupied Belgium, 16-year-old Ralph and his dad Samuel walked the 70 miles to Ostend and escaped on one of the last boats to Dover. Samuel fought the Nazis by joining the Russian Red Army, Ralph joined the Royal Navy. His family had been too upset by the tragedy of losing so many relatives to feel ready to visit Auschwitz. ‘I want to keep his memory alive,’ he said. ‘As the survivors of the Holocaust die off we have to keep the memory alive to stop it happening ever again.’ Earlier this week Mr Miliband admitted the Holocaust Memorial Day commemorations were 'really emotional' for him and other Jewish families affected by the genocide. He said his family had not talked much about the Holocaust growing up. Mr Miliband said: 'It's 70 years since my grandfather died in one of the camps and I marked that about ten days ago. 'And you know, it's really hard this, because I talked to my mum about this: it's not the kind of thing you talked about very much when you're growing up in a household affected by these things, but it sort of marks you and it's so important that we remember. 'I think the theme of Holocaust Memorial Day this year is keep the memory alive. And as you say, Nicky, when there's prejudice around the world, when we see the rise of anti-Semitism, it's incredibly important that we keep that memory alive.' He explained how he had only just found out about the circumstances surrounding his grandfather's death. 'I know this sounds almost unbelievable, but it's only about six months ago that we discovered the full circumstances of what happened to my grandfather. 'He ended up in Germany in a labour camp, which is where he eventually died according to the records. I went to Yad Vashem, the place in Israel where they have records on the Holocaust, and that's where we discovered more information about what had happened to him.' The former Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz-Birkenau in in the town of Oswiecim, Poland . Sixty members of Mr Miliband's family were killed during the Holocaust and he yesterday visited the Yad Vashem Museum, which remembers those who lost their lives in the atrocity . Ed Miliband spoke emotionally about explaining to his children what had happened in the war. He revealed how he had to explain to his son Daniel why he was lighting a candle for his grandfather who had been murdered in a Nazi extermination camp. He said: 'I lit the candle and my kids, my eldest son Daniel said to me ""what's that for?"" and he's five so it's hard to explain. 'I explained it was my grandfather who I didn't meet and who died at a very young age.' Mr Miliband said the experience of his family had made him realise both the horror and hope in people's treatment of Jews. 'It's awful and it makes me feel incredibly lucky. There's horror and there's hope, because it's also the case that many members of my family were saved because they were Jews who were hidden by decent people. [There's another story, which is that there were 17 members of my family who were sheltered in a Belgian village – that's on my father's side – and it was only because of the decent people in that village who helped them. 'So I think this year and at all times, it's right to remember the horror, but it's also right to remember the hope and sense of optimism of what decent people did to save Jews.' Mr Miliband's remarks come as about 300 Auschwitz survivors gathered at the site of the former Nazi death camp to mark the 70th anniversary of its liberation. The commemoration will be held at the site in southern Poland where 1.1 million people, the vast majority Jews, were killed between 1940 and 1945. It is expected to be the last major anniversary event that survivors are able to attend in considerable numbers. Heads of state and representatives from wartime Allies will also be present. Events include the laying of a wreath, a church service, and the lighting of candles at a memorial in the former death camp of Birkenau, which was part of the Auschwitz complex. Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated by the Red Army of the Soviet Union on 27 January 1945. It opened as a museum in 1947. Read more: .

"Vanished: Peter Chadwick missed court on Wednesday and cannot be found by police . A millionaire Southern California real estate executive charged with murdering his wife has vanished two years after posting $1million bail. Peter Chadwick failed to report to a court hearing in Orange County on Wednesday - his first missed appointment since he was released on bail in December 2012. The 50-year-old father-of-three is accused of strangling his wife Quee 'QC' Chadwick to death at their $2.5million Newport Beach mansion and then dumping her body in a trash bin in San Diego County in October 2012. He claims his wife was killed by an unknown assailant and that he was forced by her killer to drive her body to the US-Mexico border. KTLA-TV reports that Chadwick had made every previous court appearance since being released on bail. When he didn't show on Wednesday, an Orange County judge issued a warrant for his arrest. 'We’re not sure where he is and he really should turn himself in,' Susan Kang Schroeder told KTLA. Chadwick's lawyer declined to comment on when he last heard from his client. Chadwick faced up to 25 years in prison if convicted of murder. The search for Quee Chadwick began after neighbors called police when she didn't pick up her children from school. Detectives found blood and a sign of a struggle when they entered the couple's mansion. Peter Chadwick was arrested near the US-Mexico border after allegedly dumping his wife's body.

"Super Bowl Sunday is the nation's annual excuse to overload on football, friends and food. So much so that the average American consumes an incredible 2,400 calories during the four to five hours of the NFL's climatic final. That's equal to a slice of pizza, four cans of beer, one serving of BBQ wings, one serving of fried chicken, a portion of Nachos with, a slice of cheese cake, a milkshake and fries. Overall, it is estimated the US eats 1.25 billion chicken wings on the day of the game, enough to stretch from century link field in Seattle to the Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts 55 times . This is according to Atlanta-based Calorie Control Council, who made the estimate from a list of popular food items purchased for game day. They then combined this with statistics from food industry groups, according to a report in ABC News. And it's easy to see how these calories add up. Eating just two slices of pepperoni pizza and drinking a few beers crosses the 1000 calorie threshold, according to calculations from the USDA nutrition database. A previous study has found that America's favorite game day food is chips and dip - with 61 per cent of U.S. Super bowl fans reaching for the fried potato crisps come kick-off. 2,400 calories is roughly equal to one serving of fried chicken, a portion of Nachos with, a slice of cheese cake, a milkshake and fries.

The study discovered that the second worst week to splurge on food is the week before Super Bowl when people purchase closer to 5,500 calories per serving. They found the week of the Super Bowl is also the week people spend the most on average at the supermarket - nearly $150. 'The higher number represents the fact that the household was buying foods that give more calories each time they eat a recommended serving,' Professor David Just, who led the study, told the Washington Post.

"Samsung and Apple are in a dead heat for the smartphone wars - but Apple has taken the lead in the lucrative Chinese market, new figures have revealed. According to the latest research from Strategy Analytics, global smartphone shipments grew 31 percent annually to reach a record 380 million units in the fourth quarter of 2014 - and Apple tied with Samsung to become the world's largest smartphone maker with sales of 74.5 million handsets. However, Samsung revealed that overall its October-December profit sank, with an improvement in its semiconductor business insufficient to mask its mobile problems. Scroll down for video . A man uses an Apple iPhone near the advertisement of Samsung Electronics' micro SD cards at a Samsung shop in Seoul. Samsung lost the battle of the big phones last quarter as Apple's large iPhone lured buyers in the crucial Chinese market. Apple tied with Samsung to become the world's largest smartphone vendor for the first time since Q4 2011. Samsung shipped 74.5 million smartphones worldwide and captured 20 percent marketshare in Q4 2013, dipping from 30 percent in Q4 2013. Linda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics, said, 'Global smartphone shipments grew 31 percent annually from 290.2 million units in Q4 2013 to a record 380.1 million in Q4 2014. 'An impressive 1.3 billion smartphones were shipped worldwide in 2014, with very strong growth seen last year in emerging markets such as China, India and Africa.' Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, 'Apple shipped 74.5 million smartphones worldwide and captured a record 20 percent marketshare in Q4 2014, increasing from 18 percent a year earlier. 'Apple's new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models are proving wildly popular in China, United States and Europe.' It was in China, the world's largest market for smartphones, where Samsung's dramatic decline was most evident. Its weakness there is a key reason why Samsung's share of global smartphone sales dropped to about one quarter last year from a one-third share in 2013. Apple contributed to Samsung's latest reversal in fortune, launching iPhones with bigger screens that robbed Samsung's Galaxy phones of a key selling point. Samsung was already battling competition in low-end phones from upstart manufacturers such as China's Xiaomi. Samsung is struggling in countries such as China because 'they're sort of being eaten from the bottom up by regional players' including Huawei and Xiaomi, said Ben Bajaran, an analyst at Silicon Valley research firm Creative Strategies. 'And now with Apple being competitive in larger phones, you're seeing Samsung losing any edge they had at the high end,' he said. An advertisement poster shows Apple's iPhone 6 Plus, top,  and Samsung Electronics' Galaxy NOTE 4 at a mobile phone shop in Seoul, South Korea. In the second quarter last year, Xiaomi overtook Samsung to become the biggest selling smartphone maker in China. Samsung now ranks third in that market, after Apple raced to the top in the fourth quarter, according to research company Canalys. Thanks to its bigger iPhones, Apple sold a record 74.5 million iPhones last quarter, which along with high prices helped make it the world's most profitable company. According to Strategy Analytics, Apple tied Samsung in global smartphone sales, the first time Samsung has not had a big lead since late 2011. The research firm said Apple's new iPhones were 'wildly popular' in China as well as the United States and Europe. Counterpoint, another market research firm, put Apple narrowly ahead of Samsung. A third firm, International Data Corp., estimated Apple came just short of a tie with Samsung. It's not unusual for research firms to produce slightly different estimates. But IDC said Apple's sales were especially 'impressive' because the new iPhone models are selling at a higher average price than older models, at a time when Samsung and other rivals are competing to offer phones at significantly lower prices. Apple shares gained 1.5 percent Thursday and are up more than 7 percent since it announced iPhone sales figures for the December quarter. Samsung, in contrast, reported its fourth straight drop in quarterly earnings. Profit sank 27 percent to 5.3 trillion won ($4.9 billion). Samsung has not given a precise figure but estimated it sold between 72.2 million and 75.1 million smartphones. Until September, Apple lacked one thing that Samsung and other phone-makers had: a supersized smartphone screen. Apple's older iPhone 5 had a screen that measured 4 inches diagonally, while screens of 5 inches or larger have been the standard in Asia for more than a year. The new iPhone 6 measures 4.7 inches and the 6 Plus is 5.5 inches. And that's made a huge difference. Banners advertising Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Note 4 are displayed at a Samsung Electronics shop in Seoul. Meanwhile, Samsung's flagship Galaxy S5 smartphone was criticized for a cheap looking design. Samsung replaced parts of the design with metallic features in subsequent models after the criticism. Strategy Analytics, a market research firm, said Samsung and Apple were tied  each shipped 74.5 million smartphones in the final quarter, making it the first quarter since 2011 . Samsung's fourth quarter profit was a moderate improvement from the previous quarter's 4.2 trillion won and higher than analysts' forecasts of 4.4 trillion won, according to financial data provider FactSet. Sales fell 11 percent from a year earlier to 52.7 trillion won while operating profit slumped 36 percent to 5.3 trillion won, in line with Samsung's preview earlier this month. The company's fourth-quarter net income beat forecasts mainly thanks to the solid performance of its component businesses, such as memory chips and display panels. The semiconductor division was a key cash cow generating about half of Samsung's quarterly operating income. Samsung didn't give clear guidance of how its mobile business would perform during the current quarter. Instead, to appease investors the company announced a 40 percent increase in its annual dividends for 2014. Its share price fell 1.3 percent in Seoul. Repeating its previous statements, the company said it will try to differentiate its smartphones with new materials and designs and will reduce the number of smartphone models to streamline its business. Samsung has introduced the Galaxy Note Edge, the big-size smartphone with a curved side display, but it remained a niche product. Output of curved screens remains limited until a new production line goes into operation later this year. The company is expected to unveil an update to its flagship Galaxy S smartphone in the spring.","Global smartphone shipments grew 31% to reach record 380 million units .

"Vandals have decapitated a one-meter tall statue of Mary during an early morning attack on a Catholic church, sparking a police investigation. The Maronite Catholic Church in Punchbowl, in Sydney’s west was targeted at around 5am on Thursday. Vandals attacked glass casing outside the Saint Charbel’s Church on Highclere Avenue, broke the head off the statue of Mary and shattered pieces of a statue of Saint Charbel. It is the second reported attack on the church in the past six months. Vandals have decapitated a one-meter tall statue of Mary (right) at the Saint Charbel’s Church in Sydney . Rev Fr. Joseph Sleiman, Superior of Saint Charbel’s Monastery, was alerted to the vandalism by a parishioner who was in tears . Last October, vandals attempted to break into the church and damage the lights on the grounds. Rev Fr. Joseph Sleiman, Superior of Saint Charbel’s Monastery, was alerted to the vandalism in the early hours of the morning after a parishioner knocked on the monastery doors in tears. ‘The shrine is a symbol of our Christianity, like the crucifix. The space that was damaged is a popular place for private prayer and reflection,’ he said. CCTV footage around the shrine seen by Daily Mail Australia shows what appears to be a man in his twenties or early thirties behaving suspiciously on the church grounds between 4.47am and 5.07am. The suspect appears to stroll around outside of the church, even using the church toilets before making his way to the side of the church where the grotto is situated. CCTV footage shows what appears to be a man in his twenties or early thirties behaving suspiciously on the church grounds between 4.47am and 5.07am . Rev Fr. Sleiman believes the attack was intentional and was committed by an outsider. According to the last Australian census Saint Charbel’s parish consists of over 40,000 Australian Catholic members of Lebanese descent. ‘I do not suspect anyone from our community. We strongly condemn any behavior of this nature to our church and any place of worship. Our Church is a place of worship and prayer that should be respected by all. Our community has been deeply affected and shocked by the attack,’ said Fr. Sleiman. Bishop of Maronite Diocese of Australia, Father Antoine Charbel Tarabay, said that Saint Charbel’s Church has not seen an attack like this since 1973 when the church was first built. Smashed glass was left around the shrine outside the church in Punchbowl in Sydney . ‘The shrine is a symbol of our Christianity, like the crucifix,'Rev Fr. Slemiman told Daily Mail Australia . ‘It’s sad to see that people have the mentality to do this. I’m worried about our Australian values and our freedom of religion,’ he said. Member for Blaxland, Mr David Coleman, was also present during the police investigation told Daily Mail that, ‘any event of vandalism is a real concern and it’s important that it’s fully investigated by the police.’ Rev Fr. Joseph Sleiman said security around the church would be heightened and assures his community that there is no call for anxiety or fear. ‘The authorities are diligently and seriously addressing the matter, and steps have been taken to ensure security of all who use our church.’ A New South Wales Police Force spokesman said the agency is ‘investigating the incident and urges anyone with information that can assist to contact Police.’","Maronite Catholic Church in  Sydney's west, has been vandalised .

"It has long been thought that, broadly speaking, there are two types of planet in the universe - terrestrial, rocky worlds like Earth, and gas giants like Neptune. But now remarkable research has, for the first time, suggested that some gas giants can transform into rocky worlds later in their lives - and it may even be possible for them to become habitable. If true, it would suggest our theories of habitable planet formation may need to be rewritten, and life may have even more of a chance of forming in the universe than we thought. Researchers at the University of Washington studied mini-Neptunes. They say some of the planets can migrate closer to their host star and become habitable (illustration shown). Moving closer would subject them to more X-rays and radiation, in turn ejecting their gaseous atmosphere into space . The research was carried out by University of Washington doctoral student Rodrigo Luger and research assistant professor Dr Rory Barnes. They focused on a particular type of gas giant known as a mini-Neptune, similar to other gas giants but only about 10 times Earth's mass. In particular, they considered those around M Dwarfs - stars which are smaller and dimmer than the sun, with close-in habitable zones. Earlier this week scientists revealed a solar system with five Earth-sized planets has been discovered, which is so ancient it was born not long after the dawn of time. The system's parent star, named Kepler-444, is 117 light years from Earth and 11.2 billion years old. When the sun-like star was formed out of a primordial cloud of gas and dust, the universe was just a fifth of its current age. Astronomers have shown that it hosts five planets with diameters ranging between those of Mercury and Venus. That makes them roughly the same size, or slightly smaller than Earth. ‘We now know that Earth-sized planets have formed throughout most of the universe's 13.8 billion year history, which could provide scope for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy,’ said Dr Tiago Campante, from the University of Birmingham's School of Physics and Astronomy. Astronomers expect to find many Earth-like and 'super-Earth' planets in the habitable zones of these stars in coming years, so it’s important to know if they might indeed support life. In these systems, mini-Neptunes often form far from their host star, with ice molecules joining with hydrogen and helium gases in great quantities to form icy, rocky cores surrounded by massive gaseous atmospheres. 'They are initially freezing cold, inhospitable worlds,' Mr Luger said. 'But planets need not always remain in place.' The researchers say that tidal forces from the planet's star could cause the planet to migrate closer to the centre of its planetary system. In the process, this can bring mini-Neptunes into their host star's habitable zone, where they are exposed to much higher levels of X-ray and ultraviolet radiation. What follows is a rapid loss of the atmospheric gases to space, possibly leaving behind a hydrogen-free, rocky world. The co-authors call such planets 'habitable evaporated cores.' 'Such a planet is likely to have abundant surface water, since its core is rich in water ice,' Mr Luger said. He added that 'once in the habitable zone, this ice can melt and form oceans,' perhaps leading to the formation of life. Shown here is an illustration of the gas giants in the solar system. They are all thought to have a core of rock and ice at their centres. If the surrounding atmosphere was ejected, like in the mini-Neptune scenario described in this latest research, it could leave behind a terrestrial, habitable world . The research focused on a particular type of gas giant known as a mini-Neptune, a type of planet that is similar to other gas giants but only about 10 times Earth's mass. It's unknown if the resultant planet would be like Earth, left, or a super-Earth, illustrated right . Dr Barnes and Mr Luger note that many other conditions would have to be met for such planets to be habitable. One is the development of an atmosphere right for creating and recycling nutrients globally. Another is simple timing. If hydrogen and helium loss is too slow while a planet is forming, a gaseous envelope would prevail and a rocky, terrestrial world may not form. If the world loses hydrogen too quickly, a runaway greenhouse state could result, with all water lost to space. 'The bottom line is that this process - the transformation of a mini-Neptune into an Earthlike world - could be a pathway to the formation of habitable worlds around M dwarf stars,' Mr Luger said. Will they truly be habitable? That remains for future research to learn, Mr Luger added. Most of the planets outside our solar system discovered to data have been found by Nasa's Kepler telescope, illustrated here. It was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets, and was recently repurposed for the new 'K2' mission after one of its reaction wheels failed .","Researchers at the University of Washington studied mini-Neptunes .

"Screen legend Leslie Phillips pictured after his marriage to Zara Carr (nee) in December 2013 . Screen legend Leslie Phillips was today rushed to hospital after he turned 'black and blue' during a seizure. The 90-year-old star of 150 films, who is already slowly recovering from a life-threatening stroke, suffered the health scare at his west London home. His third wife Zara, who he married 13 months ago, gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before an ambulance crew took him to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington. He then underwent a series of tests there before he was discharged and tonight remains resting at his home in Maida Vale, west London. 'The seizure was minor fortunately,' she said. The actor suffered a stroke on a London bus six months ago. It comes as he continues his recovery from a stroke during a shopping trip to London's Oxford Street in August last year. Mrs Phillips, 55, said at the time: 'Leslie suddenly started leaning on me and was unable to put a ticket in his coat pocket. 'He had terrible pains in his left arm so I stopped the bus and called an ambulance which took him to University College Hospital in Euston. 'From there, he was then transferred to a top neurosurgery hospital in the capital.' His Turkish-born wife has been a constant companion since the 2011 suicide of the actor's second wife, the former Bond girl Angela Scoular. The Tottenham-born film legend was still working before the stroke, voicing the Sorting Hat of the Harry Potter films and acting in several British TV dramas including the Ruth Rendell Mysteries, Revolver and Agatha Christie's Marple. He was born on April 20, 1924, into a working class family and made his first film appearances as a child in the 1930s. He is believed to be the only actor still alive who performed at Pinewood Studios in its first week after opening in 1936. During the Second World War, he was commissioned in 1943 as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, and transferred to the Durham Light Infantry in 1944. Leslie Phillips was famed for his role in the Carry On films. Here he is pictured left in the 1960 film Carry On Constable . Leslie Phillips pictured as character Jack Bell, chats to nurses in the 1959 film Carry On Nurse . Phillips, pictured at his Maida Vale home, was discharged from St Mary's Hospital in Paddington today after being admitted when he had a seizure . But he later left after being declared unfit for service with a neurological condition that caused partial paralysis. Phillips returned to the stage and screen and became a household name as a star in the Carry On films and the Doctor comedy series in the 1960s onwards. He was a friend of the late Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees and the late actor Peter O'Toole, and recently helped fund the memorial to the Bomber Command in Green Park. His trademark rounded vowels came after his mother sent him to stage school to lose his Cockney accent - but he has never lost sight of his roots and has often been paraded around White Hart Lane as a celebrity football fan. He was made an OBE in 1998 and a CBE in 2008 for services to drama.","Actor Leslie Phillips, 90, today suffered a seizure at his west London home .

"Jim Brisbane of the Crown Prosecution Service commuted from his home in Wales to London . A senior Crown Prosecution Service official who commuted from his Welsh home to stay in a taxpayer-funded flat in London received £88,000 in expenses to cover the cost of his long-distance journey. Jim Brisbane, Chief Operations Officer of the CPS has an annual salary of £120,000, but he received more than £3,000-a-month to cover the costs of his journey from his five-bedroom home in Llanelli to London and his accommodation while staying in the capital. Civil service rules state that pay packages should be limited to £142,500, although, once Mr Brisbane's travel and accommodation were considered, his deal exceeded this figure. An audit by accountants inside the CPS discovered the problem and officials had to secure special permission from Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander for the additional payments. According to The Sun's Brian Flynn, Mr Brisbane insisted that he had not done anything wrong. He told the paper: 'The rules are that if you are required to move for your job then they would have had to buy me a house. I thought that would be inappropriate for me to do that.' He said that he needed to live in London to do the job and properties in the capital are expensive. Mr Brisbane has more than 35 years' experience in the legal profession, practicing as a solicitor in England and Wales after graduating from Glasgow University. He moved to Scotland in 1988, where he joined the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. In January 2008, be was appointed Chief Crown Prosecutor for Dyfed Powys in January 2008. He was then appointed to his current position as Chief Operations Officer of the CPS. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, pictured, had to authorise the additional spending . A CPS spokesperson said: 'The post holder was one of the candidates encouraged to apply for this critical role in order to ensure there was the strongest possible field of candidates - even though he had made it clear he could not move full time to London - because of his impeccable track record and colossal wealth of experience. 'At interview he was clearly the outstanding candidate, and so relocation support was agreed to allow him to work in London during the week, which has been fully approved and is within Civil Service rules. 'Since taking the role he has helped to lead the CPS through an unprecedented period of change, also bringing some real improvements in performance. But the Taxpayers' Alliance has questioned the CPS's use of resources claiming that 'throwing away money like this rubs salt into the wounds'.","Jim Brisbane of the CPS commuted from his Welsh home to London .

"Arnetta Welch, 42, pleaded guilty to hindering apprehension in two vicious gang killings in Camden, New Jersey . A mother has admitted that her home was the site of a gang-related double slaying and she helped two of her children conceal evidence after the killings. Arnetta Welch, 42, of Camden, New Jersey, pleaded guilty in Superior Court on Wednesday to hindering apprehension  in the deaths of Burlington County couple Michael Hawkins, 23, and Muriah Huff, 18. The pair's bodies were buried in shallow graves behind Welch's house after the couple was tortured, beaten, gagged, stabbed and shot for hours at the home in February 2010, the South Jersey Times reported. Welch is thought to have purchased cleaning supplies and removed evidence of the brutal killings. She is expected to get a two-year probation term when she's sentenced in March. Her children Shatara Carter, 19, and Dennis Welch, 24, were among 10 defendants, believed to be members of the Bloods gang, who are serving 297 years in prison for various counts in the double murder. Carter, who was 14 at the time of the killing, was prosecuted as an adult and pleaded guilty last year to aggravated manslaughter and is serving 22 years in the death of Ms Huff. The young Welch pleaded guilty to the same charge in 2013 and is serving 25 years in the death of Mr Hawkins. The young man was beaten and stabbed before being shot. Arnetta Welch helped clean up after her children Shatara Carter (left) and Dennis Welch (right) were involved in a gang-related killing . Ms Huff was said to be beaten with a chair until it broke apart and choked before dying when she had a plastic bag put over her head, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Carter said at trial that her mother had tried to step between then-25-year-old gang leader Kuasheim Powell and Ms Huff during her beating. The younger Welch told police that he stayed with his mother in a nearby room for an hour and listened to music after saying that she didn't need to be involved in the incident. Gang members said they covered Mrs Welch's eyes as she left the room. The killers ranged in age from 14 to their mid-twenties. Muriah Huff, 18, was tortured before being killed along with boyfriend Michael Hawkins, 23, at Arnetta Welch's home in Camden, New Jersey . The bodies of Mr Hawkins, thought to be involved with the rival Crips gang, and Ms Huff weren't discovered for three days. Mr Hawkins, from Mount Holly, New Jersey, was killed over a gang dispute and a stolen bottle of liquor, authorities say. Ms Huff, from Cinnaminson, New Jersey, had accompanied Hawkins to the home and was killed to prevent her from identifying the attackers, they say. Camden routinely ranks high on lists of the most dangerous cities in America, though its murder rate has fallen in recent years.","New Jersey's Arnetta Welch, 42, pleaded guilty to hindering apprehension .

"WHY WE MAKE THINGS AND WHY IT MATTERS . by Peter Korn . (Square Peg, £15) When my family and I moved from London to the heart of the Herefordshire countryside 13 years ago, one of our new neighbours (insofar as a man living six fields away can be called a neighbour) told us that, if we ever needed him, even in the middle of the night, all we had to do was to pick up the phone. He was an electrician, this chap, but also had a passable knowledge of plumbing and carpentry, making him a wonderfully-competent, all-round handyman. I remember feeling inadequate, for my own skills are creative, but not practical. As a writer, I could hardly reciprocate his kindness. What would I say? ‘And likewise, should you ever need a perfectly formed sentence at 3am . . .’ Korn writes seductively about the fulfilment he gets from making furniture (picture posed by model) This exquisitely-produced little book had a similar, humbling effect on me. Korn makes beautiful, bespoke furniture; at his celebrated school in Maine, in the far north-east of America, he teaches others how to do it, too. This is not a how-to manual, though — it is a philosophical treatise about the process and the emotional rewards of creating something tangible, useful, long-lasting and attractive to look at. My branch of creativity seems rather feeble by comparison. Korn writes seductively about the fulfilment he gets from making furniture. While the book didn’t quite make me want to go and bevel an edge, it did help me understand how a lovingly handcrafted chair or desk might be considered a counterblast to what Korn describes as modern society’s ‘rampant consumerism’. As he asserts, handmade furniture ‘speaks of durability at a time when most goods are disposable. It speaks of integrity of process in a culture where surface impressions are often all that matter’. Which is true enough, but Ikea on a Saturday afternoon is full of people who might well prefer to be buying handmade furniture — if only they could afford it. I don’t think Korn means that they are doing the wrong thing, just that they — we — should take more time to appreciate proper craftsmanship. That he thinks as deeply as he does about furniture-making clearly has something to do with two serious bouts of cancer, once in his 20s and again in his 40s. Brushes with death do tend to make a chap more introspective and the book, taking the form of a memoir, details other convulsions in his life, such as financial hardship, romantic heartache and divorce. But through all his tribulations, the dovetail joint has held firm. I know devoted cricketers and golfers who will tell you, without the slightest irony, that their sports are metaphors for life, and Korn, without ever quite being pretentious enough to say so, seems to believe the same of fashioning tables and chairs. ‘In furniture-making, beginnings are critical,’ he says. And a little later: ‘Throughout the entire process, the quality achievable at each stage is utterly dependent on the care with which the craftsman has accomplished every previous step.’ Well, what is that if not a guideline on how we should all get the most out of our lives?","Peter Korn makes bespoke furniture at his school in Maine .

"President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama are set to make their first joint appearance together next week at an event in Washington. Organizers of the National Prayer Breakfast told Time that the Tibetan spiritual leader will attend, but he will not give a speech. The White House said Wednesday that it was not yet sure of Obama's plans. The president's spokesman said he 'would be surprised' if he didn't go to the Feb. 5 affair, however. Obama appeared at the gathering every year since taking office. Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama delivers a speech on January 13, 2015 in Kolkata, India. He and President Barack Obama are set to make their first joint appearance together next week at an event in Washington . While the president and the Dalai Lama have never shared a public stage together before, Obama has hosted him at the White House during three previous visits. On every occasion, the U.S. government has been careful not to extend to the exiled leader the same courtesies it does heads of state lest it offend the Chinese government, which contends that the Dalai Lama is a 'wolf in sheep's clothing.' Typically, the presidents meets with foreign leaders in the Oval Office. When the Dalai Lama visits, the Obama takes him in the less prestigious Map Room. No U.S. president has ever held talks with His Holiness in the Oval, the White House has said. After a 2010 meeting the Dalai Lama was infamously photographed by reporters as he was escorted out a side door of the White House past bags of trash that hadn't yet been retrieved due to a snowstorm. The Chinese government routinely punishes heads of state who appear too cozy with the Dalai Lama, who has been living in exile in India since 1959. The country suspended high-level diplomatic ties with Great Britain in 2012 after England's prime minister and deputy prime minister visited with His Holiness during a London visit. China gave Germany the cold shoulder in 2007 after the country's chancellor, Angela Merkel, gave the Dalai Lama an audience. In 2008 China cancelled a European Union summit after France's president, also the head of the EU at the time, held court with the Nobel laureate. Norwegian officials avoided the Dalai Lama when he came to the country earlier this year to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his Nobel Prize award. President Barack Obama is pictured here meeting with the Dalai Lama in the Map Room of the White House on Feb. 21, 2014. While the president and His Holiness have never shared a public stage together before, Obama has hosted him at the White House on three previous occassions . Exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, left, walks out the doors of the Palm Room of the White House by trash bags waiting to be picked up due to delays from the snow storms in this February 18, 2010 photo after meeting with Obama.  The U.S. government has been careful not to extend to the exiled leader the same courtesies it does heads of state lest it offend the Chinese government . The U.S. has not experienced the same backlash as its European allies for repeatedly accommodating the spiritual leader. It has been on the receiving end of sharp rebukes from the country's government for the 'gross interference in China's internal affairs,' however, and what China has called 'a serious violation of the norms of international relations.' 'The Dalai is definitely not a pure religious figure. He is using the cloak of religion to engage in long-term activities to separate China. He is a political exile,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement before a February 2014 meeting between he and Obama. The spiritual icon contends that he is not seeking independence for his native region, and is not a threat to China's sovereignty. The White House said after his most recent sit-down with the president that he expressed hope 'that dialogue between his representatives and the Chinese government will resume.' Obama, like his predecessors, has routinely made it clear that the U.S. believes its up to China and the people of Tibet to resolve their differences. 'We are not in favor of independence for Tibet,' he said at a joint press conference in Beijing with Chinese President Xi Jinping in November. Obama said he did 'encourage Chinese authorities to take steps to preserve the unique cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people,' during the talks, though.","White House said Wednesday it was not yet sure of Obama's plans but it 'would be surprised' if he didn't go to the Feb. 5 affair .

"Out: McDonald's CEO Don Thompson has said he will retire from the fast food giant on March 1 . McDonald's CEO Don Thompson is stepping down from the world's biggest hamburger chain as it fights to hold onto customers and transform its image. Thompson is one of a handful of black Fortune 500 CEOs and has worked at McDonalds for nearly 25 years. The company said Thompson, 51, who has been CEO for two-and-a-half years, will be replaced by 47-year-old chief brand officer Steve Easterbrook on March 1. Previously, Easterbrook served as president of McDonald's Europe and led efforts related to marketing and menus. Shares in the world's biggest fast-food chain, which have been underperforming major markets and several peers, jumped 3.2 percent in extended trading following the news. McDonald's Corp., which has more than 35,000 locations around the world, has been struggling amid intensifying competition and changing attitudes to food. Earlier this month, the company reported falling earnings and sales and said it was making major changes this year to bring back customers and save money. It said it would slow down new restaurant openings in some markets. It's also making menu changes. Among the challenges British-born Easterbrook will inherit as the chief executive are: the image that fast-food is junk food; the growing number of  convenience stores selling cheap, ready-to-eat food and the surging popularity of companies selling higher-quality food, such as Chipotle. Mixed tenure in charge: Don Thompson, president and chief executive officer of McDonald's Corp., talks with staff at McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois . McDonald's says it's already working to address some of those issues, including launching a campaign designed to dispel common myths about its food. Thompson, the 51-year-old former president of McDonald's USA who took the global helm in July 2012, came in at a time when the company had racked up nearly nine years of sales gains at its established restaurants. But the following September, McDonald's reported a decline in same-store sales as it fought to hold on to customers with changing tastes and amid external pressures ranging political and economic turmoil in Europe to food safety scares in China. 'I don't think it was too much of a surprise. Maybe in the timing but not the action,' Sanford Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said. 'This has been something that people have been talking about for a while.' In his role as chief brand officer, Easterbrook led McDonald's digital initiatives and efforts to boost menu innovation, according to a statement from the company. Industry watchers also said his track record includes turning around the company's business in the United Kingdom. New British CEO: Don Thompson, who has been CEO for two-and-a-half years, will be replaced by Steve Easterbrook (pictured), a company veteran who rejoined McDonald's as its chief brand officer in 2013- after previously working for the firm in the UK . Here's a look at the challenges Easterbrook, 47, will inherit as McDonald's new CEO, and the changes that are already under way. FAST FOOD IS JUNK FOOD . McDonald's is trying to shake perceptions that fast-food is cheap, greasy and made with mysterious ingredients. To dispel myths about its food, the company recently launched a campaign inviting people to ask frank, sometimes squeamish questions about its menu offerings, such as 'Does McDonald's beef contain worms?' and 'Do McDonald's buns contain the same chemicals used to make yoga mats?' Part of the problem for McDonald's and other traditional fast-food chains is that people are gravitating toward food they feel is more wholesome or made with higher quality ingredients. And newer places like Chipotle and Panera are positioning their food as just that. Presidential seal of approval: Despite his hygiene faux-pas at the counter, Barack Obama is a known fan of Chipotle and their easy to understand, healthier, custom options . Mike Andres, president of McDonald's USA, said last month that the company is looking at shrinking the number of ingredients it uses and employing different cooking procedures to enhance the appeal of its food. 'Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?' Andres asked. 'We probably don't.' BLOATED MENU, CLUMSY SERVICE . McDonald's has conceded its menu in the U.S. has gotten bloated. In just the past decade, the company has said it added 100 items to its menu. That slows down service because it takes customers longer to figure out what they want, while also complicating kitchen operations. It also increases the chances that orders will be wrong. As such, McDonald's has said it's looking at a simplified menu that reduces the number of Value Meals, and trims items that may be repetitive, such as variations of the Quarter Pounder with different toppings. PICKIER CUSTOMERS . The ability to customize orders is gaining popularity. At Chipotle, for instance, people like that they can walk down a line and dictate exactly what goes into their bowls and burritos. In hopes of giving customers more flexibility in adjusting their burgers, McDonald's rolled out new prep tables that can hold more condiments and toppings. It also has more dramatic plans in the works. Same old: A customer walks away from a counter at McDonald's in Los Angeles. The layout and menu of the fast food giant has been criticized for being inflexible, boring and out of date . McDonald's says it will roll out an option that lets people build their own burgers at 2,000 of its more than 14,000 U.S. locations later this year. The food takes a bit longer to prepare, but the company is hoping customers will think it's worth the wait. PRICES TOO HIGH . A major attraction of McDonald's is that the food is supposed to be affordable. But prices have gotten a bit high for some people. The popular Dollar Menu is one reason for the skewed prices. To offset the deals on that menu, McDonald's has admitted that other parts of the menu got too expensive. In turn, the company has said that prompted people to 'trade down' to the Dollar Menu. And that left many customers associating the McDonald's brand with its cheapest items. Affordable food is also more widely available elsewhere, with convenience stores and supermarkets expanding their prepared food and coffee offerings. According to a 2008 story in the Guardian, that business was stalling in the early 2000s, but it had a strong run under Easterbrook, who took over as CEO in 2006 and refocused on the core business of selling hamburgers. 'The UK has been a good market for them for a long time, but it wasn't always,' Senatore said. 'He played a role in the turnaround.' The question is can he turn around the company's brand, particularly in the United States where it is losing share to rivals such as Five Guys Burgers and Fries, Chipotle Mexican Grill and other smaller, regional food outlets which are seen as offering fresher and higher quality products. Easterbrook has experience leading other restaurant chains. In 2011, he left McDonald's and ran two UK-based restaurant chains, PizzaExpress LTD, a British chain which markets itself on quality and freshness, and later, Wagamama Ltd, a pan-Asian restaurant chain modeled on Japanese ramen bars. He returned to McDonald's in 2013. Christopher Rowane, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, which owns roughly a million shares of McDonald's, said Easterbrook is a logical choice for the job. 'I think that it's very fitting that they've selected the chief brand officer,' he said. 'This is really where we're seeing a little bit of a vacancy in McDonald's. They're trying to really find their brand to be able to drive same store sales growth.' McDonald's warned last week that business would be weak in the first half of 2015 and said it would cut its annual construction budget to the lowest in more than five years as it opens fewer restaurants in struggling markets.","Don Thompson, 51, will retire from McDonald's on March 1 after 25 years .

"It's the honey-stone pile that glowers out across Danish capital Copenhagen and is home to the country's Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary. But Frederik VIII's Palace, which sits within the Amalienborg Palace complex, isn't only popular with the crowds of tourists who flock there in hopes of catching a glimpse of a royal. According to Danish sources, another fan of the palace is none other than the Duchess of Cambridge herself who was given a personal tour during her 2011 visit to Copenhagen. Scroll down for video . Colourful: Frederik VIII's Palace in Copenhagen reportedly left the Duchess of Cambridge inspired . So enamoured of the palace was the Duchess during her 2011 visit to the Danish capital, which was on behalf of UNICEF, she reportedly asked Australia-born Mary for decorating tips. 'Mary showed them around their apartment at Amalienborg Palace and they loved the way they had combined their collection of modern art with antique furniture,' a Royal Court source revealed to Royalista.com. 'Kate was truly inspired and wants to use some similar ideas in some of the rooms at Kensington Palace.' The Duchess of Cambridge, who is almost seven months pregnant with her second child, recently moved into a palatial new home in Norfolk called Anmer Hall. Tour: Kate was given a tour by Crown Princess Mary (far right) during the Cambridge's 2011 visit . Striking: Renovations on the 4,800sqm property were completed in 2010 and include some modern touches . Renovations at the Grade I listed home reportedly cost £1.5m, including £500,000 for replacing the roof tiles and another £500,000 on landscaping the lawn. The property has also had a new kitchen put in after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who are currently on holiday in Mustique with Prince George, decided the existing £175,000 kitchen wasn't to their taste. Frederik VIII's Palace, which was built betweenn 1750 and 1760 for Baron Joachim Brockdorff, also underwent expensive renovations before its current occupants moved in. Home to current monarch Queen Margrethe's Swedish mother Ingrid until her death in 2000, the palace lay empty for 10 years, with the present royals moving in in 2010.

Stylish: Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary also have light sculptures by Olafur Eliasson . Before they did, the 250-year-old 4,800sqm palace was completely redecorated over five years at a cost to the Danish taxpayer of 220m Danish Krone (£22m). Along with enormous crystal chandeliers and tasteful beige walls, the palace is also home to a series of murals and artworks created by Danish contemporary artists, among them the Icelandic-Danish sculptor, Olafur Eliasson. Another, by artist John Kørner, is themed around Afghanistan and shows camels, stately palm trees and soldiers silhouetted against a colourful Afghan sunset. Speaking to CNN shortly after moving in, Crown Prince Frederik revealed that some thought his choice of murals, in particular the Afghan artwork, was a brave one. Inspired: The palace cost a total of £22m to renovate and was briefly opened to the Danish public . Minimalist: Apart from the mural, the kitchen is strikingly minimalist and includes pared-back pine units . 'People were amazed that we had dared to do this,' he said. 'We took a chance, but we didn’t do it like gambling on a roulette or poker. It was calculated, but it was also a calculated risk from our hearts.' Other rooms are more traditional, including the beautiful Sun Room, which boasts a series of beautifully worked tapestries and delicate apple-green walls. Equally striking is the kitchen which, along with having classically Scandinavian minimalist fittings, includes one wall completely covered by a mural featuring wildlife and flowers painted by Danish artist, Kathrine Artebjerg.

LK Bennett Autumn Winter 2011 Ami Coat . Click to head to L.K.Bennett . Visit site . The Duchess of Cambridge has one of the most coveted wardrobes around, spilling with designer dresses and sophisticated courts. But her style isn't just about high-end pieces, she's known just as much for wearing high-street too from Whistles to REISS, ZARA and L.K.Bennett. And coincidentally, she is wearing L.K.Bennett here. Pictured here she was showing her royal support for Armistice Day in regal red - how appropriate. This elegant wool coat from the  Autumn Winter 2011 collection featured a high collar, epaulets and a clinching waist belt that showed off her slender figure. She looked super sophisticated in the pick that she teamed with her suede knee boots. We've seen this winning combination on her quite a few times and that's just one of the things we love about her - her fashion recycling. Sadly, the 'Ami' coat is quite old so it's now sold out, but maybe we can tempt you with one of the royally red coats below instead? Tahari Izzy wool blend coat at Macy's (now $159.99) Visit site .

"The police are giving the public tips on how to spot a potential terrorist in a drive to encourage people to report suspicious behaviour. Leaflets given to commuters by officers this morning include six things which should set alarm bells ringing, including someone with a lot of mobile phones, vague travel plans or taking a keen interest in CCTV cameras. It comes after ministers urged the public to be ‘vigilant’ and warned Britain is at 'very significant risk' from a terror attack by extremists inspired by ISIS jihadists in the wake of the atrocities in Paris. Leaflets given to commuters by police today include six things which should set alarm bells ringing and urge them to report anything suspicious to specialist counter-terror officers . Commuters arriving at Waterloo station this morning were handed the flyers promoting the confidential anti-terrorist hotline, which advise the public: ‘Don’t rely on others. If you suspect it, report it.’ It makes clear that specialist counter-terror officers should decide whether something suspicious is important and could help to prevent an attack. The leaflet adds: ‘Everyone has a role to play in helping to prevent terrorism. You can do this by remaining vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity to the police.’ It sets out six types of suspicious activity to report to police, including: . The Metropolitan Police said the leaflets being handed out today were part of ongoing measures to educate the public and not a change in approach. Britain's threat level was raised from 'substantial' to 'severe' in August last year following the gains made by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. It means an attack is 'highly likely', one level below 'critical' which means an attack is considered imminent. In the hours after the terror attack on the Paris offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, extra armed police were deployed across London, including in Westminster and at St Pancras train station. The flyers were handed out to commuters arriving at Waterloo station this morning as part of ongoing measures to increase vigilance . Police and security agencies have warned it is ‘almost inevitable’ that an attack will be launched in the UK by fanatics radicalised by ISIS. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned last week that ISIS, also known as Isil and Islamic State, poses ‘probably the greatest single immediate threat to Britain's national security’. Speaking at a counter-terror conference in London, he said: ‘There's a very significant risk of an Isil-inspired attack being planned and, if we are not successful in intercepting it, executed by Isil sympathisers who live in the UK but are inspired by what is going on in Iraq and Syria. 'Of course, our security and intelligence agencies, our police forces are working tirelessly around the clock to monitor, to identify, to intercept and to disrupt plots of this nature, and we've been very successful in doing so, but we mustn't be complacent. 'We know there are people out there who wish us harm and we have to be vigilant and we have to work extremely hard to make sure we identify and disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack.' In the wake of the terror attacks in Paris earlier this month, armed police were deployed to sites across London including St Pancras station . The leaflets distributed today strike a more low key note than a campaign launched in November last year telling commuters what to do in the event of a Mumbai-style terrorist attack at one of Britain's busy terminals. After government warnings that the threat to Britain from Islamist fanatics is 'greater than ever', officers handed out leaflets telling the public to 'run, hide and tell' if they are caught up in an attack. The flyer, which has been attacked as 'scaremongering' by critics, shows images of worried-looking people running down flights of stairs, cowering in the dark and anxiously talking on their mobile phones.","Police officers hand out leaflets to commuters in central London .

"A Yazidi girl who was kidnapped and repeatedly raped by Islamic State militants has told of her terrifying ordeal and escape. Besma (a pseudonym) was used as a sex slave by extremists - and agreed to speak on the condition her identity was not revealed. The 15-year-old, was kept in a village near the spot she had been taken from and repeatedly raped, but one day, took her chance to flee along with another captive. Scroll down for video . Besma, speaking under a pseudonym, has told of her terrifying ordeal at the hands of Islamic State before she manged to flee. Pictured, Yazidi refugees at the Hanke camp near Dohuk, Iraq . Refugees gathered as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Special Envoy Angelina Jolie gave a speech during a visit to the Hanke Refugee camp, built by the UN for Yazidi refugees, yesterday . She, along with two others, has been taken in by a family, in Dohuk, Iraq. Erivan Mehdi, whose family is caring for the girls, told Al-monitor.com: 'They cry a lot, and they are often lost in their own thoughts.' Besma had been in Sinjar when ISIS overran the area in August last year - and shot dead one of her brothers. Her father had disappeared on the road to Mosul nine years earlier in the midst of war in Irag. During the attack, she said her family had pleaded with their Sunni Arab neighbours for help, but were turned over to ISIS. The militants took Besma, her mother and surviving brother along with around 500 other Yazidi residents in the area. They were loaded onto buses and taken to Tal Afar, where they were kept for two days and fed eggs, cucumbers and tomatoes. At that point, she added they were not mistreated. But then, Yazidi men were separated from the group - and Besma, her mother and brother were taken to a prison, which one woman identified as Badush, located northwest of Mosul. She recalled breakfast at 9am, followed by lunch, which was usually cucumbers and tomatoes. Captives were given dinner of bread and grapes after midnight. One night, as airstrikes targeted the area near the prison, she said: 'Everyone was crying and asking God to finish us off at once, rather than endure the terror,' she said. Two Yazidi boys, suffering from several infections, wait with their mother inside a bus before being driven to the Kurdish city of Dohuk, in Alton Kupri, outside Kirkuk, Iraq . An elderly Yazidi woman who was released by Islamic militants waits inside a bus last week before being driven to the Kurdish city of Dohuk . Young, pretty girls were taken from their mothers by the militants. The rest were forced to convert to Islam and pray. Besma was taken to Mosul, where she was eventually separated from her mother and brother and moved to the town of Baaj, near the Syrian border. She was with around 100 other girls, who had been picked out by ISIS members. Along with five others, she was then taken to the village of Rambusi, near Sinjar. At night in the village, members took turns 'bringing the girls back to their residence' - Besma's euphemism for being raped. And she remembers the names of three members who systematically raped the girls: Abu Hussein, Abu Ali and Abu Abdullah (who was known as Abu Shadad). Two weeks after Besma arrived in Rambusi, 15 militants, including her captors, met in a house on the edge of the village. Besma and another girl, Berivan, decided to take their chance to escape. She said: 'We served them okra stew and rice, and all of them sat down to eat,' Besma . While the men ate, Besma and Berivan, 18, took a Samsung mobile phone that one of the fighters had left to charge and fled. An elderly disabled Yazidi man is carried to a bus that will take him to Dohuk after being released by Islamic militants . Berivan called her brother to ask for his help and over the next two days, Berivan's brother and other Yazidi fighters guided the two to safety. She remembers one ISIS member Abu Sarhan, who had repeatedly raped Berivan, calling the phone the girls had stolen - and warning them they would soon be caught. Terrified, they switched the phone off and carried on. The pair kept going until they reached Mount Sinjar, where several Yazidi fighters received them. One of the men, Khero, told Al-Monitor, of the moment he saw the two exhausted girls walking up the mountain in September last year. Although now safe, Besma and Berivan continue to live in fear - with Besma's mother and brother still captive. Besma spends her days watching videos released by ISIS and crying looking at photographs of her two missing brothers. Another Yazidi girl, Ibtisam, was taken from Tel Qasab, a village near Sinjar, along with her mother and three younger sisters, was freed after five months in captivity. The 15-year-old and 200 other Yazidi slaves - most of them elderly, sick or disabled - were freed last week but her mother and sisters remain captive. Islamic State released about 200 Yazidis held for five months in Iraq, mostly elderly, infirm captives, who likely slowed the extremists down, Kurdish military officials said on Sunday . Ibtisam and the others who were released are now in Lalish, site of the holiest shrine for Yazidis. When Islamic State militants ordered them onto buses early on Saturday, the Yazidis thought they were being led to their execution. Instead, they were dropped off at a bridge crossing into Kurdish-controlled territory. But asked why she thinks she was released while they were kept, the embarrassed girl said: 'They were more attractive'. ISIS consider the sect to be devil worshippers and unlike Christianity and Judaism, the Yazidi religion is not acknowledged in the Koran. The majority of the Yazidi community have been made homeless by ISIS, with hundreds massacred and thousands in captivity. Kurdish peshmerga forces drove back Islamic State militants in northwestern Iraq last month, breaking a long siege of Sinjar mountain where thousands of Yazidis had been stranded for months - but many Yazidi villages remain under IS control.","Besma, 15, was kept in a village and used as a sex slave by extremists .

"Amateur genealogists are spoilt for choice when it comes to researching their family history online, and now the latest tool at their disposal is their DNA. Three years after launching in the US, family history site Ancestry has extended its AncestryDNA service - a home testing kit that unlocks the secrets of a person’s genetic ethnicity - to the UK. It is part of a rising trend for these kits, but Ancestry’s service sets itself apart because results can be cross-checked with millions of family trees to help people discover unknown relatives. Ancestry has launched its AncestryDNA service in the UK. It is the latest in home testing kits that unlock the secrets of a person’s genetic ethnicity. It follows a rising trend in home testing kits, but Ancestry’s service sets itself apart from others because results can be cross-checked with family trees (process pictured) Since it was released in 2012, AncestryDNA has been used by around 700,000 people. All of these results have been stored on a secure, encrypted database, and each set of results is linked to a person’s individual Ancestry account and subsequent family tree. The test uses microarray-based autosomal DNA testing, which looks at person’s entire genome at more than 700,000 locations via a sample of saliva. Analysis of the DNA data provides a prediction of the locations of ancestors from 26 separate populations including Great Britain and Ireland, Europe, Scandinavia, Asia and South and North Africa. The test uses microarray-based autosomal DNA testing, which looks at person’s entire genome at more than 700,000 locations via a sample of saliva. Analysis of the DNA data provides a prediction of the locations of ancestors from 26 separate populations (pictured) AncestryDNA can also help people identify relationships with unknown relatives through a list of possible DNA member matches (example pictured). These results can then be combined with Ancestry’s existing database of 15 billion records and 60 million family trees to trace more lineages . In contrast to Y-chromosome or mitochondrial DNA tests, which only test one line of a person's family and provides information about ancestry several thousand years ago, the AncestryDNA autosomal test targets the last few hundred or thousand years. This makes it easier for people to learn more about their more immediate family history. AncestryDNA can also help people identify relationships with unknown relatives through a list of possible DNA member matches. These results can then be combined with Ancestry’s existing database of 15 billion records and 60 million family trees to trace more lineages.

Mitochondrial DNA is a smaller than the Y chromosome, containing fewer letters, so these markers account for all known mtDNA lineages. Elsewhere, the All my Ancestry test uses more than 250,000 autosomal markers to discover a person’s recent ancestral mix. It can reveal if someone has a Native American ancestry, or how far a genome spreads across Europe. It compares the data to a set of reference samples of known ancestry, including 4,000 individuals from 200 populations from all over the world. This test shows which population a person is closest to, genetically, and what proportions of their ancestry are from each of seven continental level groups. Other tests include discovering the genetics of a person’s eye colour, and whether a person carries a red-head variant gene – even if they don’t have red hair. Catherine Ball, vice president, genomics and bioinformatics at Ancestry, said: ‘While family history research is most often focused on discovering more about the past, the AncestryDNA test uses the best modern technology to help users find out more than ever before about who they are and where they came from. ‘When used in conjunction with existing Ancestry services, it also provides an exciting opportunity to discover and connect with new relatives - in fact the vast majority of customers from the UK and Ireland can expect to connect with 3rd or 4th cousins in the US immediately.

"Could your toothpaste be harming your health? That’s the very real concern of a growing group of dentists who believe that far from being an essential part of our daily regimes, many commercial toothpastes contain substances detrimental to our health. These chemicals have been linked to possible oral and breast cancers, neural and cardiac ailments, as well as mouth irritations, gum damage and environmental pollution. Mr Toby Talbot is a specialist in restorative dentistry and a member of the Royal College Of Surgeons. After more than 35 years in the profession, he believes the products we find on supermarket shelves are often grounded in industrial chemistry rather than medicine. There is a very real concern of a growing group of dentists who believe that far from being an essential part of our daily regimes, many commercial toothpastes contain substances detrimental to our health . ‘The public are smart, but they need to see past the marketing and be well-informed about what they are buying,’ he says. ‘Some products use a slogan indicating that they are “the leading products used by dentists”, but that’s because they send free products to every dentist in the country.’ Here are the ingredients that most concern Mr Talbot... DETERGENT THAT CAUSES MOUTH ULCERS . Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS), causes Mr Talbot much concern. ‘It’s in 85 per cent of toothpastes and is used as a wetting agent (something that allows the paste to spread more easily) that helps the peppermint oil used for flavouring mix with the water contained in the product. Without SLS, these elements would separate in the tube. ‘The problem with SLS is that it opens up the gaps between the mucosal — skin — cells in the mouth, which allows toxins or carcinogens to get in [these can come from all manner of sources including tobacco smoke]. ‘Oral mucosa is one of the most delicate tissues in our body and SLS is effectively a detergent,’ says Mr Talbot. This harsh detergent can cause irritation and abrasions or breaches in the skin inside of the mouth, which cause chronic mouth ulcers. ‘If I see a patient suffering with recurrent mouth ulcers, one of the first things I do is prescribe the use of a non-SLS toothpaste,’ he says. Dr Uchenna Okoye (pictured) says ‘You need to know what strength of bleaching gels we are talking about. If the concentration is too high, it will cause problems.’ WHITENING AGENTS CAN ATTACK YOUR GUMS . ‘Whitening uses peroxides and hydrogen peroxide to bleach the teeth,’ says Mr Talbot. ‘They are known to be toxic and irritant to all soft tissues. ‘They damage the mucous membranes in the mouth and can only cause harm to the surface cells of your gums.’ And at the levels and concentrations that are available from over-the-counter products, they often cannot whiten the teeth effectively. THE TINY BITS OF PLASTIC IN YOUR TOOTHPASTE . ‘Microbeads are tiny pieces of plastic in some toothpastes that are so small you can’t see them even with a microscope,’ says Mr Talbot. ‘They act as an abrasive to remove stains from your teeth. ‘But they also run through our water treatment centres, get into our water systems and are now finding their way into the food chain. These beads are found inside oysters, mussels, lobsters and fish in the North Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic. Their effect is similar to that of plastic carrier bags that find their way into the sea and clog up the eco-system.’ Despite all these potentially hazardous chemicals, Mr Talbot doesn’t advocate binning our toothpastes — mostly because the fluoride they contain has transformed the state of our teeth. ‘A little addition of fluoride has made significant inroads to improve dental health and help reduce tooth decay,’ he says. And his sentiments are echoed in the advice from the British Dental Association (BDA). ‘Use a toothpaste you are comfortable with from a reputable brand that contains fluoride,’ says Damien Walmsley, scientific adviser for the BDA. ‘We know fluoride works well. But once you get into the other ingredients contained within the products, you’re into finer scientific points. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for dentists — let alone consumers — to assess toothpastes. Dr Uchenna Okoye, clinical director of London Smiling and official dentist of Channel 4’s Ten Years Younger, takes issue with Dr Talbot’s criticism of bleaching agents, saying: ‘You need to know what strength of bleaching gels we are talking about. If the concentration is too high, it will cause problems.’ And, while she agrees with his views on triclosan, she has fewer concerns about SLS. ‘There’s absolutely no credible research so far that shows SLS is linked to mouth cancers, but it is known and has been shown to be linked to mouth ulcers in some people,’ she says.

"Britain faces another five years of ultra-low interest rates in a blow to millions of savers, the Bank of England hinted yesterday. Andy Haldane, the Bank’s chief economist, said officials are in ‘no rush’ to raise rates having pegged them at a record low of 0.5 per cent since the depths of the recession in March 2009. He said that when rates do start to rise – which investors do not think will happen until mid-2016 – it could be by just half a percentage point a year ‘for several years’. Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, said there is 'no rush' to raise interest rates, adding that the new norm will be '2 or 4 per cent' compared to 5 per cent pre-recession . This means interest rates may not reach 2.5 per cent until early 2020 – half the average of 5 per cent seen in the decade before the financial crisis. The eurozone is caught in a debt trap that could lead to another ‘lost decade’ for the region’s economy, Mark Carney warned last night. The Governor of the Bank of England said ‘now is not the time for half measures’ as he accused leaders in the currency bloc of being too ‘timid’ when dealing with the region’s problems. He called on the eurozone to ease austerity and urged fiscal union to transfer taxes from rich to poor countries. ‘We are in no rush to raise rates, the recovery is taking hold nicely, the last thing we want to do is knock the stuffing out of that,’ said Mr Haldane. The ‘new normal’ for rates in the coming years will be around 2 to 4 per cent, he added. More cautious projections by investors suggest interest rates will not even reach 1.5 per cent before 2020. This would prolong the misery of low returns for Britain’s savers, but would be welcomed by over-stretched borrowers struggling with mortgage repayments. Bank of England governor Mark Carney admitted last week that low interest rates help borrowers ‘at the expense of savers’. For much of last year, it was predicted that rates would rise to 0.75 per cent by early 2015 as the economy recovered. Further hikes were then expected. But record low inflation – dragged down by the falling price of food and fuel – and signs of further trouble in the eurozone mean they are now expected to remain fixed until July next year. Economist predict that interest rates could still be as low as 1.5 per cent by 2020, causing pain for the nation's savers, but proving a boost to borrowers . Speaking to the Welsh newspaper Daily Post, Mr Haldane said interest rates will be unlikely to return to the sort of levels seen before the financial crisis in the near future. ‘People might be fearful that we could go back to the sorts of levels we saw in the 80s or 90s which were 4, 5, 6 or 7 per cent rates,’ he said. ‘We are clear that even when we are through this adjustment and rates are starting to rise, we don’t really see rates getting back to those levels.’","Andy Haldane said 'new norm' for rates could be between 2 and 4 per cent .

"A former Oklahoma teacher has been charged with rape for allegedly having sex with at least two of her students last year. Laura Cowan, 35, of Frederick, was charged last Wednesday with three counts of second degree rape. The same charges were filed against the former Tipton Public Schools educator last July, but in early December a judge threw out the case against Cowan after key witnesses could not be found by the prosecution. Bad teacher: Laura Cowan, 35, a former Oklahoma high school teacher and mother of one, has been charged with three counts of rape for allegedly having sex with two students . Cowan, who has a Master's degree in education from Southwestern Oklahoma State University, started her teaching career in 2010 at Davidson Public Schools. In 2012, she was hired by Tipton Public Schools, where she remained for two years until her resignation last April, reported NewsOK. Investigators say Cowan, the mother of a college-age daughter, admitted to repeatedly having sex with two of her students in various locations, including in her classroom at Tipton High School. Law enforcement officials first learned of the rape allegations against Laura Cowan in April when Tipton Public Schools Superintendent Shane Boothe contacted police and the Tillman County Sheriff's Office about a possible 'inappropriate relationship' between the teacher and one of her students. Workplace tryst: The education allegedly admitted to repeatedly having sex with minors in various locations, including in her classroom at Tipton High School . According to an affidavit prepared in July and obtained by the Frederick Press-Leader, during an interview with police Cowan described having sex with a student in her car during Spring Break 2014. The court document stated that the former teacher also admitted to sleeping with another teenager last January in a Frederick hotel and in her vehicle. She turned herself in to the sheriff's office July 23, 2014, and immediately posted $150,000 bond. During a preliminary hearing in December, key witnesses failed to show up in court to testify against Cowan, prompting the presiding judge to dismiss the case. However, prosecutors were given the option to refile the charges against the ex-teacher, which they chose to exercise last week.","Laura Cowan, 35, charged with three counts of rape .

"A devoted cat owner claims her beloved moggies saved her life by alerting her to the fact she had cancer. Stephanie Doody, 55, had no symptoms of the disease - but says her three feline friends repeatedly nudged her stomach. Her doctor later discovered a tumour on her appendix – a rare cancer usually has no symptoms and normally goes undiagnosed until it is too late. Stephanie Doody, 55, claims her cats followed her around, lying on her stomach and poking at her abdomen in an effort to alert her to a tumour on her appendix. Mrs Doody is pictured with her cat Jaffy . Mrs Doody credits her cat Jaffy (pictured) and her other two moggies Dinky and Rennie for helping alert her to a tumour on her appendix, which is usually symptomless and normally goes undiagnosed until it is too late . Mrs Doody from Tamworth, Staffordshire, who has now had surgery and is recovering, said: 'They have saved my life. 'I adored them in the first place, but this just made my love for them even stronger.' Cats Rennie, Dinky and Jaffy first noticed something was wrong in February 2014. Mrs Doody claims they constantly followed her around and sat on her lap poking at her abdomen. In July, six months after the cats first indicated a problem, she found a small lump after losing some weight and headed to her doctor. It was originally thought she had an ovarian cyst, but this was later dismissed, as were ovarian cancer and bowel cancer as possible causes. As doctors were baffled about what type of cancer she had, Mrs Doody needed the support of her husband Jonathan Ball, 65,  one of her step-daughters Kaity - a dermatologist who works with skin cancer sufferers - as well as her beloved cats. After listening to her pets' intuition, and losing some weight, Mrs Doody found a lump on her stomach which turned out to be cancerous. She  underwent a complex 12 hour operation to remove part of a section of her bowel along with her appendix, spleen, gall bladder and cervix (pictured) They started researching the symptomless condition and Mrs Doody was eventually diagnosed with pseudomyxoma peritonei. This is a rare cancer of the appendix, and she began treatment at Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital in September. In October she underwent a life-saving 12-hour operation at George Elliot Hospital, all thanks to her three pets. The incredibly complex and invasive operation was carried out by two teams of surgeons who removed a section of her bowel along with her appendix, spleen, gall bladder and cervix. Dogs can be trained to smell cancer in its early stages, according to charity Medical Detection Dogs. The organisation now has 12 dogs who live with host families and come to work from Monday to Friday at the charity's headquarters near Milton Keynes, detecting traces of cancer from urine and breath samples. They are trained by sniffing urine samples of people with cancer and rewarded when they single out these samples from other urine from non-cancer sufferers. Malignant cells produce changes in volatile organic compounds, and it's these compounds which dogs are believed to detect in urine. Dogs can detect odours at concentrations as low as one part per trillion, identifying scents which the human nose could never detect. Humans have five million sensor receptors dedicated to smell - dogs have 300 million, the charity says. The procedure also involved a full hysterectomy and left her with a huge scar, which her grandchildren have nicknamed 'Nana's zipper'. But Mrs Doody says she has her cats to thank for saving her life. She said: 'I absolutely believe the cats knew. 'The cancer is a molecular change in your body so you give off a different smell that they pick up on and they just try to get your attention. 'For a while my cats had been following me around but that's normal - they're cats and that's what they do. 'But it got more and more intense and for months they stayed with me everywhere I went. 'If wasn't until the day I got back from the doctors that they disappeared into their normal spots. 'It was as if they were saying, ""finally, you've discovered it"". It was unbelievable. 'The surgery was horrendous and I was in intensive care for a couple of days on morphine but I would have died without it. 'Even thinking was hard work, I couldn't talk properly or move without becoming exhausted. 'I was overwhelmed by the goodwill and wishes of not just family, but friends and people from work. 'It was unbelievable, they were seriously concerned and upset, not only that I had cancer but that I had to go through all of that. 'I absolutely believe the cats knew,' Mrs Doody says.

"The mother of a 17-year-old girl who was shot and killed by Colorado police earlier this week is calling for an independent autopsy because she doesn't trust the official investigation . Laura Sonya Rosales Hernandez made the demand after her daughter Jessica was shot on Monday - the fourth time in seven months a Denver officer fired at a vehicle after perceiving it as a threat. The request came yesterday as the Denver Police Department and an independent city official who monitors the agency disclosed that separate investigations were underway into policies regarding officers shooting at moving vehicles. Scroll down for video . Laura Sonya Rosales Hernandez (right) is asking for a second autopsy to be conducted on her daughter (left) 17-year-old Jessica Hernandez (pictured) was shot and killed on Monday by two Denver police officers . Denver police say Jessica drove a stolen car at two of the department's officers, hitting one of them in the leg . Mrs Hernandez said: 'I want another autopsy on my daughter so we can know how much damage they did.' 'I want to know, how did this happen? I want to know everything.' She also has five other children, including a four-year-old son, to worry about. Police have said the two officers involved in the shooting, Daniel Greene, a 16-year-veteran, and Gabriel Jordan, a nine-year-veteran of the force, fired after Hernandez drove a stolen car into one of them. Jordan suffered a fractured leg. A passenger in the car disputed that account, saying police opened fire before the vehicle struck the officer. Police have admitted no one in the car, which contained five people, was armed. Greene and Jordan have been placed on routine administrative leave pending the investigation. Hernandez's mother said her daughter made a mistake by 'grabbing' a car that did not belong to her but didn't deserve to pay with her life. She said: 'How much do they need to investigate?' 'It's all done. They did it. They killed her. All I want is justice.' A passenger in the car, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, said Hernandez lost control of the vehicle because she was unconscious after being shot. The passenger said officers came up to the car from behind and fired four times into the driver's side window as they stood on the side of the car, narrowly missing others inside. Mrs Hernandez criticized the way police handled her daughter after she was shot. She said: 'They dragged her on the floor and threw her down like a piece of garbage,' Mrs Hernandez held her four-year-old son Kevin while she talked with reporters in her home in Thornton . A shrine in remembrance of Jessica's life was set up at her family's home. She leaves behind five siblings . A passenger in the car said Jessica (pictured left and right) lost control of the vehicle  after being shot . The shooting occurred amid a national debate about police use of force fueled by racially-charged episodes in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City. Investigators in the Denver case will be relying on witnesses and police accounts because the department has only just started to buy body cameras for its officers and Jordan and Greene were not yet outfitted. Denver does not use in-car dashboard cameras. Prosecutors promised a thorough probe of the shooting as a group of angry protesters demanded swift answers and called for a special prosecutor to investigate the death earlier this week. A vigil in the alleyway in which the teenager was shot dead was also held. Protester Bruce Young waves a sign before a meeting with officials from the Denver District Attorney's office . Doug Jackson (center) and Lamar Sims (right), senior chief deputy district attorneys with the office of the Denver District Attorney, talked to Jose Castaneda (left) and other activists on Tuesday . The U.S. Supreme Court has held that officers may not use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect unless the person is believed to pose significant physical harm. Policies vary and some departments have banned or discouraged the practice. The police department and independent monitor Nicholas Mitchell are both looking at how national standards compare to Denver's policy. The city currently allows officers to fire at moving cars if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury. Denver's policy urges officers to try to move out of the way rather than fire. It states: 'An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall, if feasible, move out of the way rather than discharging a firearm.' Experts say shooting and disabling a driver can send a car out of control. Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said: 'If you were to shoot at the driver you would have an unguided missile, basically.' Candles and bouquets were left near the scene of the fatal police shooting in an alleyway in northeast Denver . Flowers were put out, candles were lit and a rosary was draped over a portrait of Jessica at her home .","Police shot and killed Jessica Hernandez early on Monday morning .

"Ofsted is unfairly targeting Jewish schools because of a 'hodge-podge of Left-wing ideals', one of its inspectors has claimed. Rabbi Nessanel Lieberman said the watchdog had an agenda to criticise the faith schools because they did not conform to its ideology. The inspector, registered with Ofsted since 2009, said Jewish schools were increasingly falling foul of new rules on British values. Ofsted is unfairly targeting Jewish schools because of a 'hodge-podge of Left-wing ideals', one of its inspectors has claimed . It comes after two Christian schools were downgraded after inspectors branded children intolerant for failing to give the right answers to questions about lesbians and Muslims. In October, the Jewish Beis Yaakov secondary school for girls in Salford was also downgraded from good to inadequate and placed in special measures. The school's management complained that pupils felt bullied by inspectors' questions about homosexuality and whether they had friends from other faiths. A growing number of faith schools believe they are falling victim to the Government's drive for British values, devised to combat extremism. Since the Trojan Horse row last year, in which Islamic extremists were accused of infiltrating schools, all have been required to teach tolerance of other faiths and lifestyles. In October, the Jewish Beis Yaakov secondary school for girls in Salford (pictured) was downgraded from good to inadequate and placed in special measures . Rabbi Lieberman said Ofsted was unwilling to send Jewish inspectors to Jewish schools, even though they might understand the ethos better. He added the watchdog had 'an agenda to knock down our schools' and described its aims as a 'hodge-podge of Left-wing ideals' designed to clamp down on institutions 'that don't conform to their ideology'. He told the National Jewish Education Conference for Primary School Teachers in London that Kodesh studies, covering Jewish life, were largely ignored in reports. He added: 'Non-Jewish inspectors go into Jewish schools with an interpreter. They write a report that doesn't reflect Kodesh studies, even though they may take up to 50 per cent of the school day.' His comments, reported in the Jewish Chronicle, came as delegates questioned the British values drive at a conference held by Brighton College in London yesterday. Historian David Starkey (pictured): 'Ofsted is being asked to do things it simply shouldn't be asked to do' Historian David Starkey said: 'We shouldn't be using inspections to correct political cowardice or political misjudgement. 'Ofsted is being asked to do things it simply shouldn't be asked to do. The politicians are franchising out their errors of policy.' Dr Shuja Shafi, general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: 'We have muddied the water when it comes to British values and have landed ourselves in a mess.' He added that the country was in 'dangerous times' when society 'turns in on itself, suspicious of others and constantly paranoid'. He said: 'We must be firm in tackling extremism and terrorism, but this is not the way to go about it.' An Ofsted spokesman said the watchdog 'is not systematically targeting Jewish faith schools', adding: 'Maintained schools and academies with a religious character are inspected under the same framework, criteria and timeframe as all other maintained schools and academies. 'Ofsted inspectors cannot comment on the content of religious worship or on denominational religious education in maintained schools and academies with a religious character. 'However, they can comment on the contribution of assemblies and teaching (in any subject with the exception of RE) to pupils' personal and spiritual, moral, social and cultural development, and their behaviour and safety.'","Rabbi Lieberman said the watchdog had agenda against faith schools .

"An 11-year-old Texas girl is facing possible blindness as a consequence of a brain disorder that appeared soon after another child threw a football at her face. Gwendolyn Quarles, whose parents say they had repeatedly complained to the school about their daughter being picked on, was sent to see the nurse after the incident at The Founder's Classic Academy in Austin last October. Later that same day her parents took her to a nearyby emergency room where she was diagnosed with intracranial hypertension. It is a neurological disorder where pressure inside the skull chokes off the optic nerve from the brain. Scroll down for video . Gwendolyn Quarles, 11, was diagnosed with intracranial hypertension, a rare brain disorder, soon after another child threw a football at her face at The Founder's Classic Academy in Austin, Texas . Gwendolyn was diagnosed with intracranial hypertension - a neurological disorder where pressure inside the skull chokes off the optic nerve from the brain . Symptoms include headaches, nausea and vomiting, as well as tinnitus and double vision. In extreme cases the patient can go blind. Doctors cannot definitively confirm that Gwendolyn's disorder is a result of her school injury, but the condition is commonly brought on by severe head injuries. The girl's parents believe the bullying incident was to blame for their daughter's condition. 'On the day of the injury, Gwendolyn was in gym class and the coaches left the children alone,' her father Patrick Quarles told ABC News. 'There seems to have been an argument and then she remembers a ball flying at her.' It's unclear whether Quarles will completely recover from the injury and her parents fear she may go blind even if she undergoes risky and expensive surgery. Doctors cannot definitively confirm  disorder is a result of Gwendolyn's school injury, but the condition is commonly brought on by severe head injuries . The family has already amassed substantial medical bills as the condition isn't completely covered by their insurance. A GoFundMe.com campaign has raised over $5,000 to help cover the costs, which Quarles said are piling up quickly. The family said they sent at least 23 emails to Gwendolyn's school, in which they expressed their concerns that their daughter was being bullied a group of other girls. The school, which Quarles' said did make attempts to remedy the situation, would neither confirm nor deny the incident occurred. Quarles said he doesn't intend to sue to the school.

"Fans attending Sunday's Super Bowl in Arizona will face tight restrictions on what they can take into the stadium as a huge security operation swings into action to protect the biggest annual U.S. sports event. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson met top local law enforcement officials in Phoenix on Wednesday and will visit the University of Phoenix stadium in nearby Glendale, where the Seattle Seahawks will play the New England Patriots for the National Football League championship. Ticket-holders are being told to get there early for a rigorous security screening procedure that will involve metal detectors and a pat-down search. Big wait: Ticket-holders are being told to get there early for a rigorous security screening procedure that will involve metal detectors and a pat-down search . Federal security officials have said U.S. agencies are unaware of any specific or credible terrorist threat against the Super Bowl, where the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks will play against one another . Deadly shootings in Paris and the recent arrest of suspects in Belgium, Greece and Germany have heightened fears of more attacks around the world, and social media accounts linked to Middle East militant groups have carried a number of threats to attack high-profile U.S. events. Federal security officials have said U.S. agencies are unaware of any specific or credible terrorist threat against the Super Bowl. Johnson echoed that on Wednesday. At a news conference, NFL Chief Security Officer Jeffrey Miller said: 'Most items cannot be carried into the stadium.' Only clear plastic, vinyl or PVC bags measuring 12 inches by 6 inches by 12 inches, or 1-gallon freezer bags, will be permitted, as well as small clutch bags 'approximately the size of a hand,' he said. Coolers, backpacks, computer and camera bags, and all other kinds of luggage are prohibited, as are bottles and beverages including alcohol, camcorders, food, fireworks, Frisbees and umbrellas, according to an NFL list. Exceptions will made for medically necessary items, after an inspection at a specially designated stadium gate. 'While the level of security is high, there should only be a moderate inconvenience for our fans: a very small price to pay,' Miller said. Debora Black, chief of the Glendale Police Department, said that while most people viewed the Super Bowl as an exciting finale to the football season, others saw the event as a target. 'We are confident that we are prepared to identify and protect against any threat,' Black said. 'While the world is focused on the (Phoenix-area) Valley for this week, we have been focused on this week for over a year.' Super Bowl security officials acknowledge the NFL championship game represents a high profile target on a world stage but are unaware of any specific credible threats against Sunday's showcase . Over 4,000 private security personnel will be deployed and the almost 3,000 member Phoenix police force will be on Super Bowl duty . Super Bowl security officials acknowledge the NFL championship game represents a high profile target on a world stage but are unaware of any specific credible threats against Sunday's showcase. 'There is no specific credible threat,' said Johnson, who has appointed a 'federal coordination team' to work with local, state and federal agencies to ensure safety of fans, players and other workers associated with the Super Bowl. 'I'm confident we will have a safe and secure and successful event.' Sunday's game has been given a Special Event Assessment Rating (SEAR) 1 rating, the same as in previous years, except for the year after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, when a higher level was declared. But security will be tight and visible around Super Bowl-related events as well as during the game itself. All fans will pass through metal detectors and pat downs. Over 4,000 private security personnel will be deployed and the almost 3,000 member Phoenix police force will be on Super Bowl duty. Nuclear device sniffing teams will be deployed and a network of Bio-Watch detectors will be set up to provide a warning in the event of a biological attack. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a press release it had held special cyber-security and anti-sniper training sessions. A U.S. official said the Transportation Security Administration, which is responsible for screening airline passengers, will add screeners and checkpoint lanes at airports. Federal air marshals, 'behavior detection officers' and dog teams will help to secure transportation systems in the area. 'We will be ramping it (security) up on Sunday, there is no doubt about that,' said Federal Coordinator Matthew Allen, the DHS point of contact for planning and support. 'I have every confidence the public safety agencies that represented in the planning process are going to have their best and brightest out there this weekend and we will have a very safe Super Bowl.'","Fans attending Sunday's Super Bowl in Arizona will face tight restrictions on what they can take into the stadium .

"They are considered to be one of man's best friends. But one dog was not shown the hand of human kindness by his vicious owner who allegedly threw him off the third-floor balcony of an apartment building in Kansas City, Missouri. Roadrunner the dog needed to have his eyes removed because of the alleged abuse meted out to him by his former owner Kimberly Anderson, 36. Scroll down for video .

Most of those interviewed initially said they were not too bothered about data privacy and felt secure when using their phones. But that quickly changed when they began to read some of the terms and conditions they had agreed to. One, who simply couldn't believe she had given an app permission to read her text messages and modify contacts, said: 'I feel like I'm giving over my life to an app.' Another was equally surprised to learn he had given his phone permission to use his precise location for undisclosed purposes. He said: 'That's not something I think anyone else needs to know.' The interviews were carried out by Silent Circle and Blackphone, two groups set up protect individuals' privacy, to mark Data Privacy Day on January 28. Recent high profile hacking scandals at the likes of Sony have demonstrated how employees personal mobile phones are often the entry point for data breaches. Stunned: Two more of the people interviewed read through the terms and conditions of popular apps . Another phone owner can't hide is disgust as he reads. The interviews were conducted to mark Data Privacy Day on January 28 . Silent Circle and Blackphone co-founder Phil Zimmerman Phil Zimmerman has written an open-letter to global CEO's urging them to focus on privacy, rather than merely looking at it as a 'security' issue'. He said: 'When I see what happened to Sony recently -- the data stored on their servers leaked to the world -- my mind goes to that difference between privacy and security. 'I'm sure Sony had firewalls and VPNs, intrusion detection and antivirus, policies and procedures -- all the usual artifacts of corporate information security. Those things securely delivered a mountain of information to Sony's servers, where it was lost all at once. 'When it was lost, the privacy of Sony's partners and employees went with it. That's what corporate privacy is -- the privacy of the people in and around the corporation. 'If we focus on their privacy rather than the corporation's security maybe we can make better choices. Many kinds of information don't need to be stored for long, or at all. If only participants keep a copy of their correspondence the company can't lose it.' Facebook's popular Android app, which has been downloaded by over 500 million users, is a particular source of concern for those worried about data privacy. According to Google Play, the app has access to find accounts on the device, read contacts, access the user’s, as well as edit, read and receive text messages. Other permissions give Facebook the ability to directly call phone numbers, modify or delete files on USB storage, take pictures and videos, record audio, download files without notification, control vibration and change network connectivity. This has led to user’s complaining the app violates their privacy. Responding to an internet discussion last year Facebook Android engineer Franci Penov attempted to explain why their app needed such a high level of control over users' phones. He said: ‘We require [access to text messages] so we can automatically intercept login approval SMS messages for people that have turned two-factor authentication on for their accounts, or for phone confirmation messages when you add a phone number to your Facebook account. Incredibly some apps demand users give them permission to snoop through personal data including text messages, send emails automatically and even record audio without permission . 'Unfortunately, the Android permissions system does not allow us to specify that we would like to be able to read only SMS messages from a specific number.' 'It's also worth noting that we would love to be able to ask only for the permissions we need for the specific features particular users uses. 'However, Android does not allow permission requests on demand; we have to request all permissions that cover each feature at install time, and the users can only grant or deny all of them and have no control over individual permissions.' However it is not just the big name apps that have people worried. Even seemingly innocuous programs such as games or even flashlight apps are demanding users' permission to access their information. One game  - Happy Fish, developer HappyElements - is programmed  so it can collect a precise location,  access  photos, read your text messages and even tell which Wi-Fi network you're using. Recent high profile hacking scandals at the likes of Sony demonstrated how employees personal mobile phones are often the entry point for data breaches . Likewise many flashlight apps which allow a device to be used as a torch also secretly record the most sensitive personal information. This may include the location of the phone, details of its owner and their contacts, and even the content of text messages. The data is then transmitted to market research companies and advertising agencies to track user’s shopping habits, experts claim. But it is also suspected that criminal gangs, hackers and identity thieves have developed torch apps of their own to obtain personal data about consumers which could give them access to their bank accounts.","Interviews were carried out to mark Data Privacy Day on January 28 .

"A mother of three was shot in the head and killed Tuesday when a stray bullet fired from a passing car struck her in broad daylight in front of her San Francisco home. Maria Lourdes Soza, 32, had just picked her son, 9, and 3-year-old daughter up from school when her life was taken with absolutely no warning. Police believe the Nicaragua-born mother was an innocent bystander. They are now investigating whether a another shooting that culminated with a blood-covered woman limping into a nearby seafood restaurant minutes later was related to Soza's untimely death. Tragic: Maria Lourdes Soza, 32, had just picked her son, 9, and 3-year-old daughter up from school when her life was taken with absolutely no warning. Her 13-year-old daughter also witnessed the tragedy . Soza's boyfriend also bore witness to the shooting around 4pm Tuesday in front of her home in the Bayview neighborhood. He rushed to her aid while they waited for paramedics. Soza's eldest daughter watched her mother die, as well, and spoke to the SFGate.com on Wednesday. 'My brother was crying. My sister was crying. And I was crying a lot,' the distraught 13-year-old said while mourners gathered at a streetside memorial. 'I can’t do anything without her. I miss her so much. I’ve been crying since yesterday until I fell asleep.' As Soza's shell-shocked family begins to mourn, San Francisco police are trying to determine if the nearly simultaneous nearby shooting is related. Soza, a Nicaragua native, was believed to have been an innocent bystander, though police are unsure who fired towards her home in the Bayview neighborhood of San Francisco in broad daylight Tuesday . 'My brother was crying. My sister was crying. And I was crying a lot,' the distraught 13-year-old said while mourners gathered at a streetside memorial. 'I can’t do anything without her. I miss her so much. I’ve been crying since yesterday until I fell asleep' Police learned ten minutes after Soza was shot that an unidentified woman had entered the Clam House restaurant shot and covered in blood. She directed an employee to a dead body that lay outside the restaurant in a bullet riddled Audi. That man, 38-year-old Donte Glenn, had previously survived a shooting in which he was shot in the buttock at age 19. Police have made no arrests in either case and are, at least for now, treating them as separate homicides. The unnamed woman in the Clam House was expected to recover. A blood-soaked shooting victim hobbled into this San Francisco restaurant around ten minutes after Soza's shooting. She pointed an employee to a dead man in a bullet riddled Acura outside. Police are now investigating whether the shootings were related .","Maria Lourdes Soza, 32, was killed with no warning outside her Bayview neighborhood home around 4pm Tuesday .

"There were incredible scenes on Dutch TV tonight after a teenage gunman stormed the studios of the national broadcaster and demanded to be put on air. NOS went off air for an hour after the smartly dressed suspect, who was carrying a silenced pistol, seized control of the studio. But cameras continued to roll, recording the moment police rushed into to disarm him. According to a reporter from the broadcaster who spoke to the the gunman, who is thought to be a 19-year-old student, he had claimed to be a member of a hacker's collective working for Dutch intelligence. After the man's arrest ended the hostage crisis at the NOS studios in Hilversum, 12 miles east of Amsterdam, footage of the dramatic arrest was then broadcast to the nation. No-one was hurt and no shots were fired during the incident, which interrupted the NOS evening news broadcast. Police said in a statement that the man demanded airtime and threatened that bombs would go off at several locations around the Netherlands if his demand was not met. Wearing a black suit and tie, the man entered the studio after threatening a guard with a pistol, witnesses said. It was unclear how he passed through security, which was increased after the attacks in Paris earlier this month. Reality TV: These were the images seen by Dutch television viewers which showed the man who had stormed the studios of the national broadcaster shortly after he was arrested and the channel went back on air . Secret agent: The gunman's pistol, visible in the bottom right corner, appears to have a suppressor attached to the muzzle. He claimed to be a member of a hackers' collective linked to Dutch intelligence . Bungled: The teenage gunman had apparently intended to speak to the country on the most popular evening news broadcast, but was led to an empty studio by a quick-thinking security guard . Surrender: 'Drop it! Drop it! And get on your knees!' armed officers shouted as they rushed into the studio. The gunman surrendered immediately and allowed himself to be handcuffed without a struggle . Footage aired on Dutch TV showed the man pacing in the studio with a black pistol behind his back. He had intended to speak to the country on the most popular evening news broadcast, but was led to an empty studio by a quick-thinking security guard. Nevertheless, cameras were recording as he paced back and forth in front of them. Speaking to a man off camera, the suspect said: 'The things that are going to be said (pause) those are very large world affairs. We were hired by the security service.' He begins to grow impatient, complaining 'This is taking too long'. But shortly after, police arrived with their guns drawn. 'Drop it! Drop it! And get on your knees!' armed officers shouted. At least five police officers then ordered him to turn around and lie down, which he did and he was arrested without a struggle. Take down: Armed police storm into the studios at Dutch broadcaster NOS to tackle the gunman . Arrested: The suspect did not resist the police commando team and immediately surrendered his weapon . Questioning: Police said they are investigating the gunman's claims to have accomplices around Holland . The teenager - who has been named in Dutch media as Tarik Zahzah - lives in the central Dutch town of Pijnacker, near the university town Delft, officials said, declining to provide details. They refused to comment on media reports that he was a student whose parents had recently died and that he was not on a watchlist of Islamist militants. He was being questioned and could be charged with kidnapping, possession of a firearm and threatening people with a weapon, prosecutor Johan Bac said at a press conference. No one was hurt, but NOS cancelled its two main nightly news broadcasts. Police special forces swept the building for explosives and found nothing, police spokesman Christine Scholts said. 'We are currently investigating who this man is and what he wants,' she said. The police were looking into claims that he had accomplices around the country with explosives. 'He took the security guard hostage and said he wanted air time. If they didn't give it to him, he said there would be bombs in different places in the Netherlands that would explode if he didn't get time on TV,' Ms Scholts said. 'Please wait': The image shown earlier to Dutch TV viewers after a gunman stormed the studio of the national broadcaster and demanded time in front of the cameras . The threats were reportedly also contained in a letter that the man took to the studio, a purported copy of which was aired by the RTL news channel. 'Realise that I am not on my own,' it said. 'Furthermore, eight high explosives have been planted that contain radioactive material. 'If you don't take me to studio 8 to make my broadcast, we will be forced to step into action.' The authenticity of the letter could not be confirmed. NOS reported on its website that the man had a silencer on the pistol and threatened a security guard, forcing him to take him upstairs to the editorial offices. It reported that he appeared to be a student who had recently lost both parents. It also said he did not figure on security services' lists of suspected Islamist militants. NOS produces the most widely watched television newscast in the Netherlands and is based in the main national broadcast park in Hilversum. Aftermath: Dutch police chief Andre Wielandt, Hilversum mayor Pieter Broertjes and Chief Prosecutor Johan Bac during a press conference in Hilversum following the incident at the NOS studios . Alert: Security forces are seen outside the Media Park in Hilversum, Netherlands, after a gunman entered the headquarters of Dutch national broadcaster NOS and demanded time on television . After the alarm was raised police quickly surrounded the building in Hilversum and evacuated staff, according to media reports. There were no reports of any shots being fired in the building. NOS director Jan de Jong told the broadcaster that the headquarters had beefed up security in the aftermath of the attack on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris in which 12 people were killed. He said it was unclear how the man got through tight security in the building in the central Dutch town of Hilversum, and into the editorial offices. The media park in Hilversum, home to many Dutch broadcasters, has been tightly guarded for years, since populist Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn was gunned down in a car park there in 2002. While the broadcaster was off air, a screen on the NOS1 channel read 'Please be patient' in Dutch. Its main news channel main displayed a message that read, 'In connection with circumstances, no broadcast is available at this time.' All staff were evacuated from the building as the situation unfolded and remained outside nearly two hours later as police searched the building. NOS resumed broadcasting from a studio in The Hague.","Cameras rolled as armed police stormed the studio to arrest the suspect .

"Wellington's boots, Napoleon's cloak, and a blood-stained saw used to amputate an aristocrat's leg are among the extraordinary artefacts from the Battle of Waterloo which have gone on display to mark the its 200th anniversary. The historic objects are among 200 digital images which are being posted on a website intended to give the public new insight into the 1815 conflict in Belgium. Others include a breastplate with a huge hole where a British cannonball smashed through it, killing the unlucky soldier, and dentures made from the teeth of troops who'd fallen in the battle. Historic: Wellington's boots, left, and Napoleon's cloak, right, are among the artefacts in a new online exhibition on the Battle of Waterloo . Destroyed: This cuirass was worn by a French soldier who was killed by a cannonball on the battlefield . Gruesome: A blood-stained glove and saw used by a field surgeon to amputate the leg of the Earl of Uxbridge . The collection was assembled from the holdings of the National Army Museum in London, and supplemented with loans from other museums and private collections. The first 100 objects in the collection, which is known as 'Waterloo200', are currently available to view on the project's website, and the others will be added in the run-up to the actual anniversary date on June 18. A pair of boots worn by the Duke of Wellington were designed by the British general himself to be suitable both on the battlefield and at high-society parties. They took off on London's social scene after he led Britain to victory, and to this day rubber boots are still known as 'Wellingtons' in his honour. Napoleon's cloak, also featured in the online exhibition, is decorated with Arabic designs, reflecting his fascination with the Middle East, and was worn by the French leader on the night before Waterloo. Artefacts: A coin which stopped a bullet and saved a soldier's life is pictured left, while on the right is part of the spine of a less lucky soldier . Opponents: On the left is a medal given to every British soldier who fought at Waterloo, and right is a French standard captured at the battle . The Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 stopped the advance of Napoleon across Europe and sent the great French emperor into exile for a second and final time. France's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition, led by the British army under the command of the Duke of Wellington. The armies amassed near the town of Waterloo in modern-day Belgium, not far from the border with France, and it was the French who made the first move around 11am. The two sides clashed for 10 hours, with the British fending off repeated attacks from the French, until Marshal Blücher arrived at the head of a Prussian army. This was the decisive intervention which finished Napoleon off, allowing Wellington to counter-attack and forcing the Frenchman to surrender. The battle forced Napoleon from the throne of France, leading to his exile on St Helena - but Wellington later admitted it was 'the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life'. Despite the popular image of Waterloo as a heroic endeavour, it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed, with the French bearing the brunt of the losses. Many of the objects featured, however, relate not to the great generals but to the ordinary soldiers who bore the brunt of the slaughter in the battle. One is a British penny which apparently prevented the death of an infantryman by stopping a bullet - it now bears a deep indentation where the projectile struck it. Waterloo was the first battle in which every British serviceman was recognised for his contribution by a special medal, and one of the medals is featured in the exhibition. Alwyn Collinson, of Waterloo 200, said: 'The Battle of Waterloo is significant because it was the first to recognise the bravery of both the famous general and the unknown private by giving every man who took a part a medal, something which had never happened before 1815.' Some of the objects in the archive are notably macabre - one is a piece of spine extracted from the body of a British soldier and given to his widow as a memento. A blood-stained saw and glove used by a field surgeon to amputate the Earl of Uxbridge's leg after he was injured at Waterloo is also featured, as is the wooden artificial leg worn by the peer after his injury. It is said that when Uxbridge was shot on the battlefield he turned to Wellington saying, 'By God, sir, I’ve lost my leg!', and the general replied, 'By God, sir, so you have!' A French cuirass worn as body armour by a soldier is punctured by a huge hole apparently caused by a cannonball which easily penetrated the breastplate and killed its wearer. Another unlucky participant was Corporal John Shaw, a well-known boxer before he was called up to Waterloo and killed - the virtual exhibition features a plaster cast of his skull made shortly after his death . The battle turned Wellington, later to become Prime Minister, into a national hero, and the effect it had on his fame is shown by a sign he was forced to put up at his country house in Hampshire. The sign reads: 'Those desirous of seeing the interior of the house are requested to ring at the door of entrance and to express their desire. It is wished that the practice of stopping on the paved walk to look in at the windows should be discontinued.' As well as photographs of the 200 artefacts, the Waterloo200 website will host details of every event around Britain being held to celebrate the battle's bicentenary. Janice Murray, director-general of the National Army Museum, said: 'The museum is really excited to see some of its most unique and fascinating objects featured in the online gallery alongside such a broad range of other collections. 'Each item featured tells an interesting story transporting viewers back to 1815 and give them a real feel for the moments before, during and after the battle.' Another exhibition - this one physical rather than online - is being hosted by Windsor Castle, where George IV dedicated a whole room to portraits of those who fought at Waterloo. Exhibition: Another display of artefacts marking the battle's 200th anniversary is opening soon at Windsor Castle . Memorial: The castle's Waterloo Chamber was built by George IV to commemorate those who led the British army to victory .","Online archive shows digital images of 200 different artefacts such as clothing worn by the two main generals .

"Convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby has been spotted out partying with friends in Bali despite being on strict parole. The 37-year-old Australian can  be seen enjoying her new Bali lifestyle in the photos with her sister Mercedes and a group of friends who are drinking alcoholic beverages and dancing. Corby was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison in February 2014 after serving nine years in jail for couriering 4.2 kilograms of marijuana into Indonesia. Scroll down for video . Convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby (pictured in the front in a black top) has been spotted out partying with friends in Bali despite being on strict parole . She is expected to stay with Mercedes and her husband under her tight parole conditions and has been warned to stay away from drugs and crime during the remainder of her time in Bali. Corby has been told by Indonesian authorities that she must stay in the country until mid-2017. Pictured at Sky Garden in popular clubbing spot Kuta just before Christmas, Schapelle is surrounded by a big group of friends and her sister Mercedes, who are all clearly languishing in Bali's party atmosphere. Dressed in a black frilly t-shirt and short black mini skirt, Schapelle is front and centre in the revealing photos, smiling from ear-to ear as strobe lights and lasers fill the background . The 37-year-old ( far left  in white) can  be seen enjoying her new Bali lifestyle in the photos with her sister Mercedes (far right) and a group of friends who are drinking alcoholic beverages and dancing. Schapelle has surrounded herself with a tight group of partying friends in Kuta . Schapelle and Mercedes are pictured here with a group of seven female friends. Just before Christmas they were spotted out in Sky Garden Kuta . Another image from the same night shows disgraced former NRL star Todd Carney, who had been pictured in July partying with Schapelle and her sister. The image went viral, with many people questioning why the two Australians were living it up in Bali. In the old snap, the sacked Cronulla Sharks player has his tattooed arms draped over the sisters' shoulders and a big smile on his face. In the new picture, Carney is standing beside a DJ friend, who is also pictured in other numerous other photos with Schapelle. 29-year-old Carney escaped Australia after his 'bubbling' scandal, which showed the sportsman urinating into his own mouth in a lewd photograph taken in a hotel toilet. The 'bubbling' photo was and leaked on social media and led to him being sacked from his team. Deciding to exclude herself from this photo, Schapelle's sister Mercedes poses with her friends . Until 2017, Corby is required to stay in Bali, and report monthly to the Bali corrections board, dress respectfully for the officials and not use or distribute drugs in Bali . Schapelle is pictured here with her mother Rosleigh and her sister Mercedes in a restaurant . Corby was sentenced to 20 years behind bars in 2005 but was later granted a five-year sentence reduction. While imprisoned, Corby claimed she suffered from extreme depression and shared with a psychiatrist her thoughts on suicide. She now lives with her sister, Mercedes, in the tourist area of Kuta and appears to have slipped nicely into a tight group of partying friends. In August 2014 Schapelle told her parole officer that she was spending her outside prison time reading and on the beach rather than searching for work. However, judging from these candid photos, she has now branched out and has added clubbing to her post-prison routine. Schapelle's group of friends are made up of DJs and family members, with some photos even showing her celebrating her mother's birthday in Badung. The happy family are sitting at a table surrounded by beers  and appear to be drinking champagne . Schapelle was at the restaurant to celebrate her mother's birthday . Another image from the same night shows disgraced former NRL star Todd Carney, who had been pictured in July partying with Schapelle and her sister . Todd Carney was pictured with the Corby sisters in July after he was disgraced . Obviously delighted to be spending her first birthday with her daughter in nearly ten years, Rosleigh cuddles up to Schapelle in the photos taken at a Bali restaurant, as she blows out candles on a birthday cake. In another photo of the happy family, a group of nine family members sit around a table adorned with beers and stubby holders. The Sydney Morning Herald previously cited a parole document signed by Schapelle Corby that  'If I [Corby] cannot fulfil those requirements, I'm ready to be sent back to prison to undergo the rest of the sentence.' Until 2017, Corby is required to stay in Bali, and report monthly to the Bali corrections board, dress respectfully for the officials and not use or distribute drugs in Bali. The approved parole application also highlights Corby's ambitions to design bikinis for her brother-in-law's Kuta surf shop. A month after her release in February, Corby's parole was on the line, following her sister's controversial interview with Seven Network program, Sunday Night. Corby was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison in February 2014 after serving nine years in jail for couriering 4.2 kilograms of marijuana into Indonesia . Schapelle Corby (left), seen here with Panangian in the town of Kuta, was released from a Bali jail in February . Panangian's wardrobe (left) where drugs were found and Corby (right) reporting for parole in Bali . Pressure for Schapelle's re-arrest mounted, as Indonesian media networks criticised the Corby family over the interview which speculated that the 4.1 kilograms of marijuana in Schapelle's boogie board bag 'could have been from Indonesia'. Just three months after being released from jail she has been spending time with her Indonesian ex- . boyfriend Ben Panangian, who supported her while she was locked-up. The two are believed to now be no more than friends. He was  caught with marijuana after he was searched on a Bali street on August 20 and police later found more in his wardrobe. The 32-year-old was sentenced in December to 10 months in prison for possessing 8.2g of marijuana in three packages. The shocking pictures of Schapelle come just after the families of Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan, 31, and Myarun Sukumaran, 33,  made a desperate plea to Indonesia's president to reconsider the pair's executions in light of the work they have done to improve the lives of fellow inmates.

It is believed they will only be given 72 hours notice before they will be executed by gunfire. Last Thursday, Chan's last ditch attempt at a clemency bid was rejected by President Widodo, following Sukumaran's rejected bid in December, officially exhausting the  legal appeals against their death sentence for attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia. Chan and Sukumaran, along with seven others, tried to traffic 8.3 kilograms of heroin out of Bali but were intercepted by Indonesian police. The relatives of Chan and Sukumaran said they were devastated to hear the decision about the clemency bids, and pleaded for the president to visit the pair in Kerobokan Jail.

"Prominent Catholic leaders across the U.S. have threatened to turn voters against President Obama over his controversial plans to offer free birth control. The fight is over a provision of the health reform law announced on January 20 that would require health insurance plans -- including those offered by institutions such as Catholic-affiliated hospitals and universities -- to offer free birth control including sterilization. According to estimates, there are some 70 million Catholic voters – and many could be posed to vote against the president in the crucial upcoming election. Speaking out: Archbishop Timothy Dolan, right, is one of many Catholic . leaders who has spoken out against the health reform law that requires . Catholic hospitals and universities to provide free birth control . Catholic League head Bill Donohue said: ‘Never before, unprecedented in American history, for the federal government to line up against the Roman Catholic Church,’ CBS New York reported. 'This is going to be fought out with lawsuits, with court decisions and, dare I say it, maybe even in the streets.' Archbishop Timothy Dolan, who was promoted to the status of a Cardinal just weeks ago, spoke out about the issue. 'It’s not about contraception. It’s about the right of conscience,' he told reporters. 'The government doesn’t have the right to butt into the internal governance and teachings of the church,” he said. 'This is not a Catholic issue, it’s an American issue. We’re strong on this issue of conscience, and that’s what’s at stake here.' Catholic clergy on Sunday called on the faithful to write Congress to protest new birth control rules from President Barack Obama's administration, stepping up a campaign that began a week ago with denunciations from the pulpit at Masses across the country. Conservative columnist Peggy Noonan . wrote in the Wall Street Journal this week that the contraception ruling . could lose Mr Obama the election because the Catholic vote is . concentrated in battleground states. Condemned: The Catholic Church has traditionally condemned all forms of birth control, though 98 per cent of U.S. Catholics admit to using some form of it . The White House defended the policy, saying that only institutions such as hospitals that service a large non-Catholic community would have to offer free birth control. The administration also said the availability of birth control would reduce the number of abortions.

Considering the timing of the issue, there will likely be political fall out for Mr Obama who is hoping to get re-elected in November. Mr Obama in 2008 won the votes of a 54 . per cent of Catholics, reversing a Republican majority of the Catholic . vote won by George W. Bush in 2004. While polls show a large majority of . U.S. Catholics ignore church teaching against contraceptives - according . to the Guttmacher Institute, 98 per cent of Catholics already use some . form of birth control - Catholic clergy were outraged by the Obama . ruling, viewing it as forcing Catholic hospitals and other services to . skirt church doctrine. Mr Obama in 2008 won the votes of a 54 per cent of Catholics, reversing a Republican majority of the Catholic vote won by George W. Bush in 2004. Catholics are about a quarter of the U.S. populations, with large blocs in such battleground states as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all won by Obama in 2008. On the website of the U.S. Conference . of Catholic Bishops, an 'Urgent Action Alert' was posted calling on . Catholics to write to Congress protesting the rule. At . Immaculate Conception Catholic church in the Philadelphia suburb of . Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, Monsignor David E. Diamond read the . congregation on Sunday a letter from Philadelphia Archbishop Charles J. Chaput calling on parishioners to write to Congress in protest. 'Write . them, call them, visit them - and help them understand the deep . resistance of Pennsylvania Catholics to this dangerous ruling,' the . letter said. After Mass, John Fruncillo, 65, said he agreed with the clergy. 'I told my wife on the way out (of church) that it's about time the church started taking a stand on some of these issues.' said Mr Fruncillo, adding that he did not vote for Obama in 2008 and probably would not in 2012. In Wisconsin, Barbara Schrawk said she voted for Obama in 2008 but was 'on the fence' this year. 'This should not be a political issue,' Ms Schrawk, 68, said of the birth control ruling as she entered St. Alphonsus Catholic church in the Milwaukee suburb of Greendale, Wisconsin. In the battleground state of Ohio, Donald and Katherine Miller, holding their 5-month-old daughter Anne, compared the Obama administration ruling to forcing a Jewish kosher restaurant to serve pork. Accused: Some say Obama has backtracked from his promise at the 2009 Notre Dame commencement speech . 'This is basically forcing Catholics to do something that is against their beliefs -- puts them in a place where they have to choose between violating God or violating the laws of the country,' said Donald Miller outside a Catholic church in Cleveland. He said Catholics should defy the law. But some Catholics said the birth control dispute would not affect their support for Mr Obama this year. Wally Brunelli, 70, said that while he opposes the use of contraceptives he would support Obama in 2012 as he did four years ago. 'Personally I feel as if this is something that the person themselves ... should decide,' Mr Brunelli said after church in the Milwaukee suburb.","Reform law demands free birth control to be provided at Catholic hospitals and universities .

"Students at Dartmouth College will be banned from drinking or possessing hard alcohol on campus, regardless of their age, as part of new reforms by the school's president. President Philip Hanlon, who has led the Ivy League school since mid-2013, created a 'Moving Dartmouth Forward' steering committee last April to study problems he said were 'hijacking' its promise: high-risk drinking, sexual assault and a lack of inclusion. The New Hampshire school is currently one of 95 schools under federal investigation for its handling of sexual harassment and violence and has received national attention for allegations relating to fraternity hazing. It is part of a negative reputation the school has built in recent years, beginning with the release of Animal House in 1978, which was based on the drunken behavior of of Dartmouth’s Alpha Delta fraternity. The plan Hanlon outlined Thursday includes banning hard alcohol - drinks with 30 proof or higher - for students on campus; implementing a mandatory, four-year sexual violence prevention program; ending pledge or probationary periods for all student groups; and creating new residential communities. Strict new guidelines: Students at Dartmouth College (pictured) have been banned from drinking or possessing hard alcohol on campus because officials believe it is 'hijacking' the school's promise . Reputation: The 1978 film Animal House starring (from left to right) Bruce McGill, Tim Matheson, Peter Riegert, John Belushi and James Widdoes, was based on the based on the drunken behavior of Dartmouth’s Alpha Delta fraternity . During the announcement he said one of the main problems was 'pre-gaming' - or loading up on alcohol before a night out. 'Our aspirations will never be realized if we fail to address a vital component: the environment in which our students live and learn,' he said in a speech to students, faculty and staff. 'We must recognize a moment in time when change is necessary in order to reach our potential, and now is such a moment.' Students protested at Hanlon's office last spring with a long list of demands aimed at creating a more inclusive, diverse campus. 'Colleges and universities across the country face the issues I've detailed today,' Hanlon said. 'We are not alone in facing them, but we will take the lead in saying, ""No more"".' Sexual assault on college campuses has been in the spotlight as students and the federal government demand stricter policies and stronger enforcement. Seeking change: The policy at the New Hampshire school is part of a new set of reforms which include measures against sexual violence prevention . Dartmouth recently overhauled its policies to include harsher sanctions and a trained external expert to investigate allegations. It will expand on that work with the new mandatory program, an online 'consent manual' to reduce ambiguity about acceptable behavior and a smartphone app to allow students to easily seek help if they feel threatened, Hanlon said. In addition to prohibiting the possession or consumption of hard alcohol by students on campus, the new policy will include increased penalties for violators, and hard alcohol will no longer be served at public events, including alumni events and fraternity parties. Though some have suggested eliminating fraternities and sororities, the steering committee's comparison of other schools found that levels of extreme behavior don't correlate with the intensity of the Greek scene. Spotlight: President Philip Hanlon, who has led the Ivy League school since mid-2013, told staff and students they will say 'No more' to the issues colleges and universities are facing across the country . But Greek organizations will be held to much higher standards going forward, Hanlon said. For example, they and all student organizations will undergo annual reviews to ensure they are upholding Dartmouth's mission, including being inclusive and diversifying their membership. No student organization will be allowed to engage in pledging or putting new members on probationary status — a move fraternities and sororities already made this fall. 'Hazing is already outlawed on our campus, but it's hard to imagine why you'd have a pledge-type status unless it has something to do with some sort of hazing, so what's being eliminated is the pledge term. Once you join, you're a full member,' Hanlon said in an interview. Of all the changes, Hanlon believes the most transformational will be the creation of new housing communities designed to give students more options for both social interaction and learning outside the classroom. Starting with the class of 2019, incoming students will be placed into one of six communities that will include a cluster of residence halls that will serve as a home base even for those who live elsewhere. Each community will have a faculty adviser and graduate students in residence and will host social and academic programs.","Ivy League school's president Philp Hanlon outlined the plans Thursday .

"London schoolgirl Hanni Blaskey has given the BBC’s Children In Need appeal a £30,000 head start - by quizzing the rich and famous on the secret of happiness. Her book, featuring the words of more than 100 celebrities, among them the Duchess of York and David Cameron, was snapped up by Sainsbury’s and has already topped their sales chart. But the simple pleasures revealed in What Makes Me Happy aren't quite as lavish as you might expect, with children, dogs, food and scenery all favourites. Sunshine and fairies: The Duchess of York cited both - and magic - in her response to Hanni Blaskey . Family man: David Cameron, pictured with his wife Samantha, said that his family made him the happiest . Comedian Michael McIntyre cites 'children in the morning when they haven’t woken up to misbehave' while BBC presenter Gaby Roslin plumps for 'my kids, my husband and a hot bath'. Ed Miliband and David Cameron also cited spending time with their children as the secret of happiness and so, in what is possibly the first time he has agreed with either party leader, did UKIP's Nigel Farage. Among the dog lovers is Andy Murray, who admits he badly misses his when away on the circuit because '…they don’t care whether I win or lose. They make me smile every day I spend with them.' 'Walking my dog makes me happy,' adds Gary Lineker. 'His utter joy at the word ""walkies"" never diminishes. Such enthusiasm for something so simple is strangely satisfying.’ And Imelda Staunton writes: 'Walking very early in the mornings during the summer with my little dog – either on the Heath or by the sea…heaven.' Naughty: Comedian Michael McIntyre said his children... but only when they're asleep and not misbehaving . Dog fans: Both Andy Murray and John Bishop spoke of how their pet dogs made them happy . Unusual: Nicole Scherzinger  presented her happiness as a flow chart which unexpectedly included yodelling . But not everyone chose children - or dogs - as the inspiration for their happiest moments. Rocker Rod Stewart revealed that a cup of tea makes him 'uncontrollably happy', while Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger chose, rather unexpectedly, yodelling. The Duchess of York told the schoolgirl that her idea of happiness involved sunny mornings before, rather bizarrely, going on to add: 'I do believe in fairies. 'I do believe in magic and when you blow on a dandelion, you will see the light of the enchanted spreading their wings and disappearing off on their own journeys, just like you have today when you opened your eyes. 'Don't let the day go by without looking for fairies and magic.' Strictly Come Dancing judge Len Goodman says that for him it’s: 'Eating a bacon sandwich. Sleeping in the chair. Being nice on Strictly. Getting out of bed and nothing falls off.' Contribution: Rod Stewart spoke of his love for tea while Gary Barlow opted out of writing and sent doodles . Music: Both Dizzee Rascal and Cerys Matthews cited music - albeit of wildly different kinds . Richard Madeley, who has a home in Cornwall, wrote back to 13-year-old Hanni: ‘Being up early enough to see the sun rise over Talland Bay in Cornwall. Nearest thing to paradise on earth.’ Some celebrities strayed from their brief to try and define how the feeling comes over them, with Maureen Lipman writing that 'happiness is released like a kind of gas from a rock.' Meanwhile there were some, like Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps, who weren't quite embrace the theme. ‘The rare occasion when I check my diary and there’s nothing in it for the next hour,’ he replied. Hanni, from Hampstead, North London, got her idea after watching a harrowing Children In Need documentary about a young girl caring for her bedbound mother. ‘I just wondered aloud what would make her happy,’ she said. ‘I thought I’d ask famous people because everyone identifies with them. It was an amazing response.’ Family: Like David Cameron, Ed Miliband agreed that family was the thing that made him happiest . Agreed: And in a rare instance of Nigel Farage agreeing with Cameron and Miliband, he also said family . Choices: Martin Clunes chose horses while Simon Mayo chose weather. Katherine Jenkins chose everything . Popular options: Like Clare Balding and Will Carling, most of those asked opted for either their dogs or families . 'She got the idea when Rick, her dad, suggested she raise money for Children In Need herself rather than just grab his credit card,' explained her delighted mother Simone. 'We’re very proud of her. It was a lot of hard work.’ And Hanni’s personal recipe for happiness? 'It makes me very happy to see my book on sale,’ she said. 'But also when my dad’s football team Sheffield Wednesday avoids losing. Things are pretty glum around our house otherwise.' Contribution: Sir Paul McCartney told Hanni that his family - grandchildren in particular - were most important . DAVID CAMERON . 'On a personal level, my own happiness index is very easy to explain: it is all about my family. Whether it is the everyday routines I go through with Samantha and the children; taking my youngest daughter Florence to nursery; helping Nancy complete her homework; or watching Elwen play football and rugby, I am happiest when I am with those I love the most and enjoying quality time with them.' THE DUCHESS OF YORK . 'Your eyes open and the life is a fresh, new day, the sunlight nudges through the curtains. I do believe in fairies. I do believe in magic and when you blow on a dandelion, you will see the light of the enchanted spreading their wings and disappearing off on their own journeys, just like you have today when you opened your eyes. Don't let the day go by without looking for fairies and magic. That makes me happy, as every day is, therefore, a day of exploration and adventure.' SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH . 'The sun rising in the mountains makes me happy.' DIZZEE RASCAL . 'Bass! Lots of bass!!!' ANDY MURRAY . 'Spending time at home with my girlfriend and our two dogs! I travel six months every year and miss being with my dogs a lot. So much so that I have travelled with them to some tournaments! They don't care whether I win or lose. They make me smile every day I spend with them.' ED MILIBAND . 'My family is the most important thing in the world to me so spending time with my wife Justine and my boys Daniel and Sam is what always makes me happy.' NIGEL FARAGE . 'Being with my four healthy children and thinking about how lucky we all are compared to many. This is a time to think about others less fortunate than ourselves.' CLARE BALDING . 'Walking my dog Archie every day. Whatever the weather, he makes me smile and we explore the world together.' PALOMA FAITH . 'What makes me happy is the kindness of strangers.' BORIS JOHNSON . 'Sitting in the sun and trying to paint the view, or possibly, a person.' ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER . 'My family, good wine, good musicals and my Turkish Van cats.' SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY . 'What makes me happy is to have a weekend off from my travels and my concerts and spend it with my family. I love to hear the noises in the kitchen as the meal is prepared and then my little grandson climbs on my knee and requests a bite for every bite that I take. There's nothing better to enjoy than having my wife, kids and grandkids around on a lazy weekend.'","The quotes appear in a charity book penned by schoolgirl Hanni Blaskey .

Bridgett Szychulski pleaded guilty on Tuesday to charges of statutory sexual assault and aggravated indecent assault on a minor . Szychulski is accused of having sex with the 14-year-old boy ‘at least’ three times - once in her vehicle and twice at the middle school, including her office and a storage room near the band room - and sending him lewd text messages. Prosecutors say she could receive two to three years in prison when she is sentenced in about 90 days. A judge deferred sentencing to allow an evaluation of whether she should be considered a sexually violent predator. The mother-of-two will remain free on bail while awaiting sentencing. The investigation began in September after a tip to a child-abuse hotline. Szychulski, who was pregnant at the time of her arrest, was suspended from her teaching duties in the Central Bucks district.

"HITLER'S FIRST VICTIMS AND ONE MAN'S RACE FOR JUSTICE . by Timothy W. Ryback . (Bodley Head £16.99) One sunny April morning in 1933, while most people were getting ready for the Easter weekend, two men drove through the Bavarian countryside, towards the pretty little town of Dachau. One was Josef Hartinger, a 39-year-old veteran of World War I, a serious, conservative, religious man, who worked as a deputy prosecutor in Munich. The other was Moritz Flamm, the district’s forensic examiner, another war veteran and a similarly quiet, serious man. They were on their way to investigate the deaths of four men, who had been found shot on the dreary moorland outside Dachau. It might sound like the premise for a Sunday-night crime drama but, as Ryback shows in this frighteningly compelling book, the murders marked the beginning of the darkest chapter in human history. On the morning that Hartinger and Flamm set off from Munich, the Nazis had been in power for barely two-and-a-half months. Yet since Adolf Hitler’s appointment as Germany’s Chancellor on January 30, he had wasted barely a minute. Almost immediately, the Nazis began taking over every institution they could lay their hands on, from the police and the judiciary to universities and football clubs. This photo from the early 1930s shows the Commandant of Dachau concentration camp inspecting newly arrived inmates . After an arson attack on the Reichstag in February, Hitler forced through emergency legislation scrapping civil liberties and, a month later, he secured an Enabling Act allowing him to rule by decree. Already, Germany was becoming a dictatorship — in Ryback’s words, the Nazis ‘were no longer intruders in the system; they were becoming the system’. As the men drove through the April sunshine, few could have imagined the depths to which the new regime would sink. Hartinger himself was no bleeding-hearted liberal: in the aftermath of World War I, he had briefly served in the Right-wing Freikorps, fighting revolutionaries in the streets of Munich. But when he got to the scene of the shootings, just outside Dachau’s new concentration camp for political prisoners (supposedly in ‘protective custody’), he knew at once that something was terribly wrong. The four bodies belonged to camp inmates, who had supposedly been shot from a distance while trying to escape. They had been unceremoniously dumped in a shed, ‘like slain game’, instead of being treated with the respect due to the dead. Further, when Dr Flamm knelt to examine the bodies, he could see at once that they had actually been shot from close range. There was, Hartinger wrote many years later, an atmosphere of intolerable dread in the camp, a former munitions factory. On his way out, he recalled: ‘A terrified young man pressed through the crowd. He was sobbing and told me that he was afraid he was going to be murdered.’ Hartinger tried to calm him down. No one was going to be killed, he said. Then, he and Flamm drove back to Munich. On the way, the prosecutor told his colleague he had been shocked by the attitude of the camp commandant, a boorish SS man. He had also noticed something that worried him. All of the four men were Jews. Today, when the Nazis’ crimes have become part of the world’s moral inheritance, it takes a bit of effort to reconstruct the atmosphere of early 1933, when many still hoped that — given time — Hitler’s regime would evolve towards moderate respectability. Hartinger and Flamm were very far from being natural rebels. Yet, in the next few weeks, as more reports of mysterious deaths and ‘suicides’ crossed the prosecutor’s desk, he began to realise he was dealing with something genuinely monstrous. These were not accidents or aberrations: they were the inevitable result of a regime that had elevated violent brutality into a governing ideology. To take one horrifying example from the end of May 1933: Hartinger was notified about the death of a Munich salesman, Sebastian Nefzger, who had apparently killed himself in his cell. However, when Dr Flamm conducted his own forensic examination, he reported to Hartinger that he had found poor Nefzger lying in a pool of his blood. Far from having killed himself, Nefzger had almost certainly been whipped and strangled by the SS, who’d then slashed his wrists with a bread knife to make it look like suicide. For Hartinger, there could scarcely have been a better example of the Nazis’ bestiality. The great strength of Ryback’s book is that, although the story of the Third Reich is now almost mind-numbingly familiar, his single-minded focus on Hartinger’s investigation of Dachau gives it the feel and pace of a courtroom thriller. As it approaches its climax, you almost believe this dogged, decent man is going to win through and bring the camp commanders to justice. But though Hartinger managed to get the authorities to dismiss the commandant and impose a new, more media-friendly regime at the camp, the momentum towards bloodshed was unstoppable. History, unfortunately, is not a John Grisham novel. One brave man, acting almost alone, could do little against the apparatus of the Nazi state. It is true that there was no direct link between the killings at Dachau, which probably resulted from casual cruelty and bullying rather than a deliberate policy of extermination, and the industrialised horrors of the Holocaust. Even so this superbly researched and tautly written little book is a chilling reminder that, from small crimes, far bigger ones can grow. It is also a moving tribute to the courage of a decent man who, motivated by his basic faith in law and order, tried to stand up and say ‘No’. Happily, Hartinger survived the Third Reich and died in 1984 at the splendid age of 91. His friend and colleague Dr Flamm was not so lucky. Having been transferred to another post, he died in 1934 in mysterious circumstances. Hartinger heard rumours that the SS had somehow been involved. ‘By then,’ writes Ryback, ‘there was no one left with the courage or determination to investigate.’","In 1933, four men were murdered in Dachau, Germany .

"A 35-year-old man was shot and killed by authorities in Northern California after he struck a police dog with a claw hammer and then swung it at an officer. Police were responding to a family disturbance call that an intoxicated man was destroying the residence with a hammer when they found Matautu Nuu outside wielding the tool. After Nuu refused officers requests to drop the weapon, shouting 'shoot me, shoot me', they deployed a Stockton police K9 named Nitro to take him down. Nuu then struck the canine's nose and cut him on the snout, said police spokesman Joe Silva. Matautu Nu, 35, was shot by two Stockton police officers after hitting police K9 dog Nitro (pictured) on the nose with a hammer . Officers John Griffin and Jason Schaffer fired their tasers at Nuu but it had no effect, Mr Silva told News10 ABC. Nuu was about to strike Nitro's handler, who had rushed in to save the dog, when the officers shot him down. First aid was immediately administered on the scene before Nuu was taken to a hospital where he later died of his wounds, Mr Silva said. The three-year-old Dutch Shepherd was taken to an emergency veterinarian and has been reunited with his owner. Nuu's family witnessed the incident and said the shooting was unnecessary, they told Fox40. They said the outcome would have been different if the police had let them talk to Nuu. 'What do we do right now? We lost a loved one, you know?' Karisamasi Nuu, Matautu's sister, said. She said Nuu's brother wanted to speak to him because 'he's the only one who could calm him down,' but the officers refused. 'Why did they not give us that choice?' she asked. As Nuu was about to strike the dog's handlers the officers shot him down outside his family's home on Martinique Court in Stockton, California (pictured) One  witness who asked to remain unidentified told Fox40 the family was screaming at police that 'he just has a hammer' and was begging Nuu to put the tool down. Mr Silva described the incident as dangerous because Nuu was 'vandalizing a house, which actually elevates the danger even a little bit more for people inside the residence'. He said things turned 'real violent' after Nuu attacked Nitro and 'got ready to attack' his handler. The officers have been placed on three-day administrative leave and there will be a multiagency investigation of the incident. Mr Silva said both actions are standard procedure for any shooting that involves officers. Nuu had been arrested twice for public intoxication in 2014, as well as for battery on an officer and resisting arrest in 2008. This week protesters called for the resignation of the chief of the Stockton Police Department after a number of recent officer-involved shootings.","Matautu Nuu was 'destroying' his family's home in Stockton, California when police were called .

"A love-rat groom has been banned from contacting his new wife - after he had a fling with his wedding hairdresser. Harry McNeil, 23, from Brecon in Mid Wales, married his childhood sweetheart Bronwen Phillips in November last year but split a fortnight after tying the knot when she discovered the romance. But after the affair with stylist Alexandra Kotri turned sour, McNeil resorted to winning his wife, who he had been with for six years, back and began bombarding her with texts, a court heard. Harry McNeil, 23, (left) and his wife Bronwen Phillips (right) split two weeks after marrying when she discovered his affair . Harry McNeil, 23, (right) began having an affair with his wedding hairdresser, Alexandra Kotri (left) but when the relationship turned sour he tried bombarding his wife with texts and calls in a bid to win her back . The estate agent had been warned not to contact Ms Phillips, 24, after her solicitor told him to stay away from her home in the Welsh town. Brecon Magistrates Court was told he sent dozens of texts and phone calls to Ms Philips before going to her house, banging on the letterbox and pushing the door last month. Prosecutor Julie Sullivan told the court: ‘Just before 1am on December 17th, police received a call to attend an address in Brecon as it was reported McNeil was outside harassing Bronwen Phillips. ‘The call was made by Ms Phillips’ mother who was on the phone to her daughter at the time. Bronwen Phillips, 24, found out about the affair two weeks after she married McNeil and then separated . ‘The defendant and Ms Phillips had married on November 1st following a six-year relationship but two weeks later had separated. ‘On November 16th the defendant sent texts to the victim pleading for her forgiveness and said he wanted her back and that he loved her. ‘She received approximately 14 messages and nine or 10 calls. The defendant was warned by the victim’s solicitor, who she had instructed in divorce proceedings, not to contact Ms Phillips. ‘On December 17th the defendant turned up at the victim’s house and began banging on the door, banging the letterbox and pushing the door in an attempt to get in. McNeil with the wedding hairdresser (left) Alexandra Kotri during their romance that lasted just two weeks . After the affair with stylist Alexandra Kotri (pictured) turned sour, McNeil attempted to win back his wife . ‘He shouted through the letterbox “I’ll stay here all night”. The victim didn’t answer and hid in the living room out of sight. ‘She could see he was taking photos through the letterbox as she could see the flash. She knew he had been drinking.' Ms Sullivan said that when police arrived McNeil was still outside the property and was taken away to be interviewed. ‘He said he’d been in a relationship with Bronwen Phillips and deeply regretted what had occurred and wanted to get back together and had sent between 20 to 30 messages. McNeil was given a restraining order after he bombarded his wife with texts and calls . ‘He said he’d left his wife for a brief relationship with the hairdresser at their wedding. He acknowledged he’d been given advice not to contact his wife. ‘He said soon after he’d entered the other relationship, he’d realised he’d made a mistake.’ The prosecutor said McNeil even texted his wife after his arrest: ‘The final message was sent while the defendant was in the back of the police car. 'He told her he’d been arrested, he loved her and wanted to talk to her.’ Magistrates heard he also used the WhatsApp messaging app to contact Ms Phillips, which meant he could see she had read his messages but was not answering them. McNeil, who represented himself at the hearing, told police he had been trying to take a photo through the letterbox to see if there was key in the lock. He was given a nine-month community order with six months supervision and a requirement he attend the respectful relationships course. The restraining order prevents McNeil from contacting Ms Phillips by any means or from attending at her home. He must also do 100 hours unpaid work and pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. Hairdresser Ms Kortri, who advertises on Facebook as 'Alexandra's Mobile Hairdressing', admitted the fling but said the relationship was over. ‘All I want to say it the relationship is over. It only lasted a couple of weeks.' she said.","Harry McNeil married childhood sweetheart Bronwen Phillips in November .

The sisters, who were visiting London from the United Arab Emirates, all suffered life-threatening injuries. Ohoud will never again have proper brain function or be able to walk or communicate. The 'murderous attack' was witnessed by Khulood's three children, one of whom was found cowering under the bedcovers as his aunt, Ohoud, lay next to him with massive head injuries. In November, Spence, of north-west London, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder with a minimum of 18 years to be served before he is eligible to apply for parole. Today his sentence was increased to 27 years. The case was referred to the Court of Appeal by the Solicitor-General, Robert Buckland, on the basis that the sentence was unduly lenient . The Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Globe and Mr Justice Knowles, said it was a 'shocking' case but not one where a whole-life order would be the right sentence. 'In our judgment, the minimum term should be one of 27 years. 'We wish however to emphasise that that is only a minimum term. 'It will be for the parole board in due course to consider whether this defendant, who is obviously highly dangerous, will, if ever, be released. 'It seems highly improbable that he will, after the expiry of 27 years, or indeed ever, be safe for release.' Lord Thomas said it was clear that the blows - 15 in all - were deliberately aimed at the head. He said this was the area most likely to cause death if smashed by a hammer. Scroll down for video . The hammer used in the attack. The sisters, who were visiting London from the United Arab Emirates, all suffered life-threatening injuries. Ohoud will never again have proper brain function or be able to walk . Victim: Fatima Al-Najjar, 31, appeared in court with a large bandage over the centre of her face, explaining she has ‘no bones’ in her nose . In court: Spence (in red) had admitted GBH and aggravated burglary, but had denied attempted murder . Spence used both sides of the hammer and continued to strike two of the women even after they were saturated with blood. He continued the assault on Ohoud after she became unconscious, which resulted in the destruction of the whole left side of the skull. The court heard her survival was regarded as miraculous. The judge said it was obvious that the effect of the attack on the whole family had been devastating. Calling for a whole-life order, the Solicitor General said that it was the very rare case where such an order was merited in the absence of a conviction for murder. 'In this case, the absence of a conviction for murder makes no difference to the heinousness of the offender's crimes. 'In terms of culpability, he did everything he could to commit three murders in circumstances of premeditated brutality. Caught on camera: CCTV footage captured Spence on a bus examining items he had stolen from the women . Haul: Spence is seen rummaging through the suitcase containing his stolen haul on the bus . Thief: Spence had crammed iPads, phones and precious jewellery into a suitcase he found in the room . 'In terms of the harm that he caused, the victim impact statements prove that he has inflicted pain on the Al-Najjar family that is equivalent to, or worse than, the pain that would have resulted from the death of Ohoud Al-Najjar or either of her sisters.' Lord Thomas emphasised that there may well be cases, exceptional though they may be, where, if there had not been an actual death, a life sentence might nonetheless be appropriate. 'We can indeed envisage in an exceptional case such a sentence being passed for a case of attempted murder, but this is not that case. 'However, we are firmly of the view that the minimum term imposed was unduly lenient. 'In our judgment, the judge failed to have proper regard to the fact that there was an intention to kill three persons and failed to attach sufficient weight to the gravity of the injuries suffered. 'He failed to take into account sufficiently the effect on the children and the premeditated nature of what occurred.' Spence, who has 37 previous convictions for 62 offences, including robbery and causing grievous bodily harm, was in court for the hearing, but showed no emotion at the ruling.","Philip Spence battered Ohoud Al-Najjar and sisters, Khulood and Fatima .

"Vladimir Putin's 'secret' daughter is an acrobatic rock 'n' roll-dancing businesswoman and scientist, according to a Moscow journalist. Ekaterina Tikhonova, 28, is claimed to be one of Putin's two daughters who until now has been mystery figures to Russians, who are not allowed to see pictures of or know about the personal lives of the President's children. It is claimed Putin's youngest daughter Ekaterina is using her mother's maiden name, Tikhonova, and has been put in charge of a £1.1billion expansion of Moscow State University. Scroll down for video . Mystery girl: A Russian journalist claims Ekaterina Tikhonova, 28, is Vladimir Putin's youngest daughter . Scientist Ekaterina Tikhonova, has been put in charge of a £1.1 billion mega-expansion of Moscow State University, the country's most famous higher education institution . Journalist Oleg Kashin  suggests that in reality that she has a number of faces - as befits the daughter of a former KGB spy - including the vice president of the world confederation of Acrobatic Rock 'n' Roll. A listing for dancer Yekaterina Tikhonova showed her birthday as 31 August 1986, the same date as Putin's younger daughter. Her middle name or patronymic is Vladimirovna, indicating her father's name is Vladmir. Tikhonova was also the Russian President's ex-wife Lyudmila's maiden name. Extraordinary footage has emerged of her enthusiastically high-kicking on the dance floor with male partner Ivan Klimov - but this is evidently not her only role, though it was sufficient to see the claims go viral. Keen dancer: It has been claimed that Tikhonova is the vice president of the world confederation of Acrobatic Rock 'n' Roll . More proof? A listing for dancer Yekaterina Tikhonova showed her birthday as 31 August 1986, the same date as Putin's younger daughter . As well as an uncanny likeness to the former Mrs Putin, left, Tikhonova was also the Lyudmila's maiden name . Tikhonova attended this month's World Economic Forum in Davos along with other members of Russia's golden youth, the offspring of influential figures, it was claimed. And she is in charge of the £1.1 billion expansion of Moscow State University (MSU), while serving as a member of the institution's scientific council. She appears in a number of university pictures at official ceremonies but has not been acknowledged as Putin's daughter though she appears strikingly similar in looks to Lyudmila. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted saying: 'I do not know who she is. I cannot deny it, because I do not know. 'Until now, many girls said that they were daughters of Vladimir Putin'. In a rare glimpse into his private life, Putin in November revealed both is adult daughters Maria and Yekaterina live in Russia - despite rumours they were domiciled abroad - but that he sees them only 'once or twice a month'. During his time in power, he has refused to reveal any details of their lives. Both are known to have attended a German international school in Moscow before quitting when he was appointed head of the FSB, the successor to the KGB. Koshin's theory was not confirmed by the Kremlin last night, and why the claims appeared now - as Russia is hit by severe economic woes caused in part by Western sanctions - is unclear. The journalist even suggested she could emerge as Putin's successor. 'After fifteen years of hiding his daughter, he suddenly discovered that she is his last hope. 'There's no one else, and, apparently, no matter how much she wanted to dance, her biography will develop now according to the interests of the state,' he wrote. Bloggers predicted Kashin would face a new attack, after already spending time in hospital after being beaten up several years ago.","Russian journalist claims he knows identity of Putin's youngest .

"A millionaire Manhattan investment banker was so keen to get out of paying a debt - that he preferred to expose the details of the sordid affair that ended his marriage instead. Hugh Levey, 65, owes $1.3million to a Virginia investment firm called Pensmore  after he lost the money in a bad investment. But instead of paying up Levey has engaged in a drawn-out court battle that made documents about his 12-year affair with business partner and TV talking head Claire Gruppo public. Affair: Documents about Hugh Levey's 12-year affair with business partner and TV talking head Claire Gruppo, pictured, have been made public . According to court papers obtained by The New York Post  Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Shirley Kornreich ruled that Levey must pay up what is owed. However, instead of stumping up the cash, he has used documents about his highly confidential net-worth statement, which was part of his divorce from his wife of 40 years Wendy Levy. The paperwork showed that while Levey, who has a Harvard MBA, is cash poor, with $500 in a checking account, $200 cash on hand and no savings, he was worth $29 million. His funds are invested in a $15 million Fifth Avenue apartment, a $5 million Greenwich home and millions in various trusts and personal items. Yet the millionaire 'deliberately keeps himself cash poor in order to avoid judgments, a trick he learned in a personal bankruptcy in the 1990s,' the Pensmore suit says. Meanwhile, despite being the co-founder of Gruppo, Levey & Co. he relies on his mistress, Gruppo, 61, to give him spending money. Pensmore is now suing Levey to force the sale of $2 million in antiques, art and jewelry listed on his net worth statement to pay off the debt.

"A British holidaymaker who went on a cruise while recuperating from throat cancer treatment says his trip was ruined after he was struck down with gastric illness. Robert Keywood, from Mexborough, South Yorkshire, was travelling on the Queen Elizabeth cruise ship with his wife, Verena, to get some rest and relaxation after undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy. But the 53-year-old said he was forced to remain in his cabin while experiencing stomach cramps, fever, diarrhoea, aches, lack of appetite and severe lethargy. Robert Keywood said he fell seriously ill on board the Cunard-owned Queen Elizabeth cruise ship . Mr Keywood experienced gastric illness symptoms during a ten-day cruise from Singapore to Dubai . Mr Keywood, a steel engineer, fell ill while sailing from Singapore to Dubai over ten days in April 2014 and has instructed solicitors from Irwin Mitchell to investigate his claims. He said: ‘This was meant to be a holiday where my wife and I could relax and take it easy. I had been having treatment for throat cancer and we just wanted to get away and enjoy ourselves.’ He claimed food was served lukewarm, fruit was not always fresh, the pool water was dirty looking, and public toilets wouldn’t flush properly aboard the Cunard Line vessel. Robert and Verena Keywood said conditions on board the ship were below the standards they expected . He said water was dripping from the ceilings in the dining rooms and buckets were used to catch the drops. Robert said: ‘We were very disappointed to see that the conditions were well below the standard we expected. ‘You just don’t expect to get ill when you’re booking a holiday. The cruise was only for ten days but I spent most of it being ill and feeling weak and was still not feeling right when we returned home.’ Robert said the ship’s captain announced that more than 80 passengers were ill on board the ship. Robert Keywood, a steel engineer, said he spent most of his time on the cruise 'being ill and feeling weak' In a statement, a spokesperson for Cunard Line said: 'Norovirus is the most common cause of stomach bugs in England and Wales and according to Public Heath England outbreaks are common in semi-enclosed environments such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools, restaurants and hotels. 'All our ships have stringent ongoing cleaning and hygiene policies in place as part of normal operations and if there is an occurrence of illness on board we then implement comprehensive disinfection protocols, developed in conjunction with UK and international health authorities. 'We confirm we have been contacted by Mr Keywood’s legal advisors and we have provided our response, but we cannot comment further on individual cases.' Clare Pearson, a specialist international personal injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which is representing Mr Keywood, said: ‘Although a number of passengers were reported to have suffered illness during the cruise on board the Queen Elizabeth, Cunard has denied liability for the illness experienced by Mr Keywood and claim that they followed the very strict health and safety guidelines set down for cruise operators to prevent the spread of illness. ‘The exact cause of the illness Mr Keywood suffered and whether it was contracted on board the ship has not yet been established and we are now supporting him in his quest for answers as to what caused him to fall ill. ‘As part of this investigation we will seek to determine whether more could and should have been done to prevent Mr Keywood from becoming ill.’","Robert Keywood, from Mexborough, was travelling with his wife, Verena .

"A husband brutally murdered his wife by stabbing her more than 40 times with a Bowie knife as she lay defenceless in bed, a court heard. Mazhar Hussain Nawab killed Anayat Bibi in a 'horrific' attack - just weeks after he was released from a six year prison sentence for firing a gun into a room of terrified wedding guests. Sheffield Crown Court heard the 43-year-old had flown into a frenzy after the pair argued and he murdered Mrs Bibi, his wife of 22 years and mother of his  children at their home in Firth Park, Sheffield, last August 10. Mrs Bibi was later discovered in a pool of blood in their marital bed covered by a duvet. Mazhar Hussain Nawab (left) 43, stabbed his wife Anayat Bibi (right)  more than 40 times with a Bowie knife after the pair argued last year . Imposing a mandatory life sentence, of which Nawab must serve a minimum of 18 years, Judge Michael Murphy QC said: 'This wasn't simply a frenzied attack with an intention to kill, but a sustained attack which continued even after the deceased could have put up no more resistance. 'It wasn't a kitchen knife you picked up. This was a dreadful weapon and you used that weapon to murderous effect. 'A woman is entitled to feel secure and safe in her own home and she was clearly very vulnerable lying in a situation in which she couldn't defend herself. She had stab wounds to her head, neck, face chest and arms. 'The sheer ferocity and savagery shows a level of quite horrific violence on this lady, in my judgement.' During the hearing it emerged Nawab was jailed for six years in 2012 after he fired a gun into a room full of terrified wedding guests at a Sheffield hotel. Shocked guests cowered beneath tables as Nawab fired the pistol three times at the Sheffield Park Hotel, Meadowhead, in March 2011. One bullet hit the ceiling, while two shot across the room, . Nawab was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 18 years behind bars for the attack at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) But he was released on licence last July - just a month before he murdered his wife. Prosector Jonathan Sharp said Nawab and Mrs Bibi were from Pakistan where they had had an arranged marriage in 1992. They moved to the UK in 1994 but the marriage was not a happy one in its latter stages and there was evidence Nawab had looked at dating sites on a laptop computer recovered from the house. Mrs Bibi moved out of the marital home and lived in Milton Keynes for a time before returning to her husband. Mazhar Hussain Nawab murdered his wife of 22 years at their home (pictured) in Firth Park, Sheffield, in August last year . On the day of the killing the emergency services were called by Nawab, who told the operator his wife had stabbed him and he had stabbed her back. He pleaded guilty to murdering her on the basis she came at him with the knife but his account was rejected by the judge. Mr Sharp said Mrs Bibi suffered more than 40 injuries and had been stabbed through the duvet. They included one to her neck which cut her carotid artery and jugular vein, another to her nose cut her septum, a 6cm wound penetrated her spine, while other stab wounds cut into her ribs, lung and liver. Mr Sharp said one injury was inflicted after her cardiovascular system had collapsed. He said Mrs Bibi's family were devastated by the death of a loving mother, daughter and sister and still had unanswered questions about what had happened. Nawaz refused to answer police questions or give evidence in court. Mr Sharp said Mrs Bibi 'cared passionately for the happiness of others' and was 'someone to who other members of the family could turn.' He said she had a lot to look forward to in life, including seeing her sons 'bloom into adulthood'. Her family had expected her as a woman in an arranged marriage, to be protected by her husband. Mr Sharp added: 'They wonder how something so terrible could happen to someone so kind.' Speaking after the hearing, Det Chf Insp Sean Middleton, who led the investigation, said: 'It was a sustained and vicious attack on a woman lying in her bed who was entitled to security and protection. 'It was a frenzied assault and he is clearly a dangerous man - that is reflected in the length of the sentence.'","Mazhar Hussain Nawab murdered his wife Anayat Bibi in their marital bed .

"No contest: Cody C. Smith from Logan, Utah, would allegedly take the teenagers out for ice cream or watch a gilm with them before forcing them to go upstairs and have sex . A former reserve police officer has pleaded no contest to forcing a 13-year-old girl to have sex with her four underage boyfriends on multiple occasions. Cody C. Smith from Logan, Utah, faces life in prison after refusing to dispute the charges of first-degree felony aggravated sexual abuse of a child. The 40-year-old was arrested in March 2014 after a girl, then 15, went to police saying Smith had been forcing her to have sex with boys since 2011, when she was 13. Logan's First District Court heard the teenage couples would go out for ice cream or watch films with Smith before he would apartment and force them to go upstairs and have sex. During the act, investigators said he would continuously shout instructions through the door. On one occasion he is said to have bought one of the boys a condom. He was also accused of touching the girl's buttock and choking her until she was unconscious on several occasions. According to an affidavit seen by the Salt Lake Tribune, he told one of the boyfriends he should get her pregnant. After taking the pair out for ice cream, he then took them back to his apartment. The boy told investigators he was 'LDS and naive' at the time, so Smith allegedly entered the room and gave him guidance. The teen girl told police that the same scenario happened with three other boyfriends between 2013 and 2014. Two of the boys, who were both 16 at the time, told the authorities they went to Smith's apartment with the girl to watch movies before Smith would send them upstairs. One of the boys reportedly had sex because it was 'late and a school night' and he felt it was the only way to get out of Smith's apartment . Suggesting the motivation behind the plea, Deputy Cache County Attorney Barbara Lachmar told the paper: 'I just think that the defense attorney saw the writing on the wall, that there was a substantial likelihood of conviction. 'It made a lot of sense that he would take a plea agreement. The victim is very young, and we were interested in protecting her.' Horrifying: Logan's First District Court heard Smith would stand outside of the bedroom and shout instructions while they had sex. He is also accused of telling one of the boys to get her pregnant . Defense attorney Susanne Gustin said: 'It is hard to overcome a case in which there is a parade of witnesses who do not know each other, all saying the same thing,. 'Cody did not want to put any more victims through the trauma of testifying. He made the right choice for himself and for the victims.' Smith was originally charged in Logan's 1st District Court with ten felony counts of rape, object rape, forcible sexual abuse and aggravated sexual assault. After his sentencing, Smith asked whether he could remain free so he could get his 'affairs in order', but was taken into custody on Tuesday and will be held until sentencing on March 11. He could get up to six years for each offence with prosecutors aiming to get him to serve them consecutively. However his defense team will aim to have them served concurrently.","Cody C Smith 40 from Logan, Utah, faces life in prison following the plea .

"British Airways has provoked fury by drastically slashing the number of air miles points it will award passengers buying its cheapest economy class tickets. Ordinary passengers who travel economy class will have the number of points they can earn slashed by 75 per cent while the points awarded to those in First and Business will be increased by up to 300 per cent. Customers who have spent years collecting reward points for BA's scheme – launched as Air Miles but now called Avios – described the changes which take effect from April 28 as 'disgusting' and a 'devaluation.' British Airways passengers are outraged following the announcement of a slashing of Avios points for economy passengers, beginning April 28 . Many customers took to Twitter to voice their concern, including Michael Bhaskar who contemplated switching airline allegiance . They took to social media to complain that it now rewards rich and expense-account travellers at the cost of families on tight budgets who use the scheme to make their holidays more affordable. BA is introducing different point pricing for reward flights 'depending on the time of the year, the cabin and zone.' It says that for two-thirds of the year customers will require fewer points to travel. But for the busiest third of the year they will need more. The airline - motto 'To Fly, To Serve' – defended the radical 'structural changes' by insisting the new system was fairer because 'those who pay more get more points.' Those who book into the economy cabin will now receive 75% fewer 'air miles' or Avios points . It also allowed 500,000 more seats to be made available under the loyalty system – taking the total to nine million a year. Avios is one of the world's biggest airmiles programmes used by 6.4 million travellers. The changes sparked an immediate backlash and accusations that the airline has 'gutted' the scheme. The controversial and at times complex changes creating winners and losers were outlined in a letter to BA's 7,000 executive club members . It sets out how points will be awarded more in line with the amount of money a passenger pays for their ticket, rather than just the 'class' of ticket they buy. Formerly called Air Miles, the Avios rewards points scheme will now be awarded based on the amount of money a passenger pays for their ticket . So an economy class passenger who buys a bargain-basement special offer ticket will earn far fewer points than the person sitting next to them who may have paid a lot more for a fully flexible economy ticket. Under the current scheme, an economy return flight from Heathrow to Vancouver earns 9,400 points – enough for a round-trip from London to Milan, subject to a £35 payment. But some economy passengers face a 75 per cent drop in the number of Avios points earned, which will see them collect just 2,350 points. By contrast, business-class and first-class passengers on the same plane will see a rise of 9,400-points - enough to provide a free flight to Italy. Another outraged customer claimed that the announcement is a 'worse deal for poor passengers' As this Twitter users points out, the new scheme will make it harder to collect points in economy . Also under the new scheme, a basic economy-class ticket from London to New York will from April 28 earn just 865 air-miles – rather than the 3,458 available now. Even 'Silver tier' executive club members – who include many middle-ranking managers and executives flying on business – will see their tier bonus slashed in half from 100 per cent to 50 per cent. This could affect their ability to continue qualifying for silver status, and for the perks they currently receive, such as use of the executive lounge at airports and priority boarding. British travellers who live outside London and use connecting flights from regional airports to fly to other destinations in Europe will be among the worst hit. Passengers in Scotland and northern . England travelling to mainland Europe will no longer be entitled to a free domestic connecting flight. This will 'bring the UK in line with the rest of the world'. 'Silver tier' club members will see their bonus slashed in half, which could affect their perks, such as the use of lounges in airports . Tweeter Craig Garland believes that British Airways 'have ruined the executive club' with this move . Those flying from Edinburgh to Heathrow and connecting to Geneva currently pay 9,000 Avios plus £35 per person for a return journey . From April, the number of points needed, and the cash supplement required, will double. By contrast, business and first-class passengers are the big winners. First class passengers will see their Avios points rise by as much as two-thirds. Transatlantic passengers from Heathrow to New York's JFK will earn 8,645 points on their one-way flight - up from 5,187. The changes will also hit passengers when they come to cash-in their points as British Airways introduces 'peak' and 'off peak' pricing for reward flights covering periods such as the school summer holidays, Christmas and Easter. So a single flight to Rome will cost 7,500 points in peak-season July compared to 6,500 points in less popular January. However, for those flying first class, passengers' Avios points may rise by as much as two-thirds . However, business travellers will see a rise in the number of Avios points they need for a flight. For example, a business class flight from London to Sydney currently costs 100,000 points, but this will rise to 125,000 at off-peak times and 150,000 at peak times. Travellers also have to pay taxes, fees and charges. BA Executive Club boss James Hillier said in his letter to points collectors: 'Our lowest priced tickets in Euro Traveller and World Traveller will award a minimum Avios of 25% per mile flown instead of 100%. 'In Club World/Club Europe and our First cabins the Avios you earn will either remain the same as it is now or increase up to 300% per mile flown depending on the cabin and type of ticket,' he added. But many passengers were unconvinced. Customer James Russell tweeted: 'Looks like British Airways just utterly gutted the Avios scheme for most flyers. Shame, it made a big difference to the overall cost.' Suzanne (@philatravelgirl) tweeted: 'Shame to see the British Airways Avios devalution.' She said Philadelphia to London had risen from 80,000 to 120,000 points 'plus exorbitant taxes/fees of $1,000.' Antonio Fersini tweeted: 'British Airways is disgusting the way you reward the richer with more.' BA defended its shake up and insisted that 'for two thirds of the year you will require fewer Avios than now to fly on reward seats.' A British Airways spokesman said: 'An off-peak economy return to New York will cost 26,000 Avios, down from 40,000 at present'. 'We're now guaranteeing there will be nine million redemption seats a year available – more than 500,000 more than before. For the first time, we guarantee that there will be a minimum of four seats in economy and two in business available for booking with Avios on every BA flight.'","Economy class passengers will have points they can earn slashed by 75% .

"Chinese scientists have created the world's first glow-in-the-dark pigs that emit a fluorescent green light. The piglets acquired their bizarre ability to glow under 'black' or UVA light after their embryos were injected with DNA from a jellyfish. Experts claim that the 10 young animals should live as long as any other pig and that the findings could help develop cheaper drugs for humans. Scroll down for video . The piglets were born earlier this year and acquired their bizarre ability to glow under 'black' light after their embryos were injected with the DNA of a jellyfish . Researchers in Hawaii and Turkey successfully created a litter of eight rabbits, including two kits that glow green when the lights are out, in August of this year. The rabbits, which look identical to their white siblings in daylight, were born at a research center in Turkey. Just like with the pigs, the fluorescent colouring is an indicator that genetic material injected into the embryos was incorporated into the rabbit's natural make up and it is hoped the experiment is a first step to producing medicine for genetic diseases. The experiment, which used fluorescent protein from jellyfish, furthers the research started in the 1980s when glow in the dark mice were created. Since then, scientists have recreated the experiment in kittens, puppies, monkeys and piglets. While most glow green in the dark, in 2007 South Korean scientists managed to develop cats that glowed red under ultraviolet light. The technique was developed by reproductive scientists at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa's John A. Burns School of Medicine. The same method was used to create the world's first glow-in-the-dark rabbits in Turkey earlier this year, where they are currently working to create a  glowing sheep. Dr Zhenfang Wu and Dr Zicong Li of the South China Agricultural University have detailed the research that produced the pigs in a study that will be published the journal Biology of Reproduction. In a video accompanying the research, the pigs grunt when the lights are turned off and after a short while begin to squeal, perhaps hinting that they are a little scared of the dark. The green tint indicates that the . fluorescent genetic material injected into the pig embryos has been . incorporated into the animal’s natural make-up. Under normal artificial light, the piglets look entirely normal (pictured). The technique was developed by reproductive scientists at the University of Hawaii and was used to create the world's first glow-in-the-dark rabbits in Turkey earlier this year . 'It’s just a marker to show that we can take a gene that was not originally present in the animal and now exists in it,' explained Dr Stefan Moisyadi, a bioscientist at the University of Hawaii's Institute for Biogenesis Research. Dr Moisyadi said the animals are not affected by the fluorescent protein and will have the same life span as other pigs. 'The green is only a marker to show that it’s working easily,' he said. Researchers in Hawaii and Turkey successfully created the litter of eight rabbits (pictured), which included two kits that glow green when the lights are out. The fluorescent colouring is an indicator that genetic material injected into the embryos was incorporated into the rabbit's natural make up . The ultimate goal of the research is to introduce beneficial genes into larger animals to create less costly and more efficient medicines. '[For] patients who suffer from haemophilia and need the blood-clotting enzymes in their blood, we can make those enzymes a lot cheaper in animals rather than a factory that will cost millions of dollars to build,' Dr Moisyadi explained. The Institute for Biogenesis Research at the John A. Burns School of Medicine focuses on reproductive research. Its aims to continue to improve human in vitro fertilization techniques.","Scientists at South China Agricultural University in Guangdong Province say that the 10 piglets could help them develop cheaper drugs for humans .

But senior minister Danny Alexander is pinning his hopes on a mythical beast to save his Inverness seat, using £2million in taxpayers' money. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury today announced the tourism cash to promote the home of the Loch Ness monster  in the latest example of money being funnelled towards his ultra-marginal constituency. With less than four months until the election, Danny Alexander has found £2million in public money to promote Loch Ness in his constiuency . Mr Alexander, the MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, has faced repeated claims he is shoring up votes in his Highlands seat with increased spending while imposing cutbacks elsewhere. In the past cash has been found for a tax break for ski-lifts, a bail-out for a sleeper train from London to Scotland and green levies scrapped for a tourist train in the Cairngorms. More money was also found to to fund exceptions to housing benefit than any other council. Earlier this year, a deal was also secured to hand a 5p petrol rebate to motorists in rural areas, including parts of constituencies represented by LibDem MPs Charles Kennedy, John Thurso, and Mr Alexander. Today Nick Clegg unveiled plans to funnel hundreds of millions of pounds under a 'city deal' for Inverness, where Mr Alexander is expected to face a major challenge from the SNP. The SNP last night questioned the timing of the announcement, which could be worth £300million for the region, warning against a 'desperate ploy' by the Lib Dems to reverse a catastrophic collapse in the polls. Danny Alexander, the MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, has faced repeated claims he is shoring up votes in his Highlands seat with increased spending . In the latest announcement which is sure to rouse suspicions of special treatment for Mr Alexander's constituency, he trumpeted extra cash to promote Loch Ness around the world. The Treasury issued a press notice declaring that the 'iconic landmark Loch Ness will benefit from an extra £2million government investment to boost inbound tourism'. The campaign promises 'extensive advertising, digital and business to business activity launched in key tourism markets featuring the famed Loch Ness monster until 2019'. Mr Alexander said: 'I'm delighted to provide £2m for a four year campaign to promote one of the most beautiful parts of the UK. 'The Loch is a jewel in the crown of the Highlands tourism industry, which creates and sustains many jobs in Scotland. 'Around the world, Loch Ness is one of the best known places in the UK, so it's right we place it the heart of our international tourism campaign.' The LibDems have an 8,765 majority in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, however the party's share of the vote is expected to collapse in May. Mr Clegg's comments come after plans were unveiled for a similar 'city deal' in Glasgow shortly before last year's independence referendum – which was dependent on a No vote. The Deputy Prime Minister told The Press and Journal newspaper: 'I'm not sure if we will definitely be able to confirm City Deals in Inverness and Aberdeen before the election, but I would really like us to do so. 'If we could, I would be very keen to do so. I don't think that because a city deal works for Sheffield, Leeds and Manchester, that they should be confined to those cities.' He added 'It's great that we managed to get one delivered for Glasgow, and they were very quick off the mark by the way, I was really impressed by the city leaders in Glasgow. 'I think it's a positive thing that others are now trying to follow suit.' The money could be used to help fund a new sports centre, a visitor attraction at Inverness Castle and a major cultural development. It has been claimed such a deal would be worth £300million to the area in new funding, borrowing powers and spin-off investment. Drew Hendry, Highland Council Leader and SNP Westminster candidate for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, said: 'Of course everyone will be pleased that the UK government is at long last apparently looking to invest in Inverness – the £300million city deal initiative is something that I have been calling for over a year - I have twice written to Danny Alexander about it, but I received no response. 'My concern of this announcement is in the timing so near to the General Election - efforts to make Inverness the great Highland capital it deserves to be must not be compromised by the LibDems in a desperate ploy to try and reverse their collapse in support.' But Danny Alexander said: 'Like the Deputy Prime Minister, I am a strong advocate of city deals. They are a great Liberal Democrat initiative for unleashing growth and opportunity. 'To be successful, a lot of people and organisations need to come together and it's really important that we get things right, so I'm delighted that early work is already underway and I'm pressing across government for swift progress.' A tourism campaign using the Loch Ness monster was launched in 2013, featuring Wallace and Gromit . A Highland Liberal Democrat spokesman added: 'Only the SNP could try to make the prospect of £300million of investment in Inverness a reason to be miserable. 'Danny has been working closely with Councillor Thomas Prag, who is driving the project forward for the Highland Council, and hopes to facilitate a meeting with the Cities Unit to progress the deal in the near future.' The announcement comes just days after coalition ministers were accused of effectively trying to bribe voters by showering cash on marginal seats. The claim came as they fanned out across the country to promote details of a new £36million investment in coastal areas. Of the 28 identifiable constituencies receiving money, almost two-thirds are in marginal constituencies. Some 23 of the 28 seats are held by coalition parties in areas such as Lancashire, Kent and Devon. Labour Cabinet Office spokesman Jon Ashworth said ministers appeared to be pursuing 'pork barrel politics' – a reference to the US practice of effectively bribing voters by pouring money into marginal seats.","Chief Secretary to the Secretary announces tourism cash for his own seat .

The former The Only Way Is Essex star has designed a capsule collection for Valentine's Day - and models it all herself, of course. Amy, 23, has given FEMAIL a sneak peak of her new figure-hugging range as she tells us her inspiration behind the collection, how she dropped a dress size and why she’s hoping she'll be swept off her feet this year. Amy Childs has unveiled a capsule fashion collection ahead of Valentine's Day - and every single piece is red . Speaking about the inspiration behind her all red collection of dresses that wouldn't look out of place on Victoria Beckham's catwalk, Amy said: ‘I love Valentine's. There aren’t many times a year you can really go for it and it's great for that. I think red is such a statement colour - it always makes me feel empowered.’ Amy has created her pieces, which cost around £50 each, to be worn on a date with someone special or on a night out with the girls. 'Every woman should look and feel fantastic,' she said. 'There aren’t many chances to go all out and Valentine's is the perfect time to take some risks with your fashion,' she said. 'All these pieces are designed to flatter with classic silhouettes that are guaranteed get you noticed for all the right reasons. I’m so excited to see the response.' Amy also offered advice for loved-up ladies this year. She said: ’I think my top tip would be to make the effort for you not just for your partner. Nothing is sexier than confidence.'

"Change of heart: Cypriot-British economist Sir Christopher Pissarides was once a passionate believer in the benefits of the single currency . One of the world’s leading economists will today admit he was wrong to back the creation of the euro – and call for it to be dismantled. Sir Christopher Pissarides, who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 2010, was once a passionate believer in the benefits of the single currency. But in an extraordinary change of heart, today he will warn the euro is creating a ‘lost generation’ of unemployed youngsters and is ‘dividing Europe’. The Cypriot-British economist will call for action to ‘restore the euro’s credibility in international markets’ and to ‘restore the trust that Europe’s nations once had in each other’. But, in a lecture at the London School of Economics, where he teaches, he will add: ‘Regretfully, I do not see either materialising.’ His comments come days after Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, dismissed claims that the crisis in the eurozone is over. She said: ‘Can a crisis really be over when 12 per cent of the labour force is without a job? When unemployment among the young is in very high double digits, reaching more than 50 per cent in Greece and Spain?’ Experts believe Europe will never be able to implement the policies required to boost growth and create jobs because of the huge differences between economies across the region. German taxpayers in particular will not tolerate spending vast sums to prop up failing economies such as Greece and Spain. Opinion: His comments come days after Christine Lagarde (pictured), head of the International Monetary Fund, dismissed claims that the crisis in the eurozone is over . Even France, the region’s second-biggest economy behind Germany, is in crisis with the country now labelled ‘the sick man of Europe’. But with no fiscal union, through which wealthy countries support poorer countries, and the European Central Bank limited in what it can do in a ‘one size fits all’ currency union, the outlook is bleak. Professor Pissarides, one of the most respected European economists of his generation, has lived in the UK since 1974 and was knighted in June. He will say that unless there is a dramatic change of policy the euro should be broken up. ‘The euro should either be dismantled in an orderly way or the leading members should do the necessary as fast as possible to make it growth and employment-friendly,’ he will say. ‘We will get nowhere plodding along with the current line of ad hoc decision-making and inconsistent debt-relief policies. Single currency: Professor Pissarides will say that unless there is a dramatic change of policy the euro should be broken up (file picture) 'The policies pursued now to steady the euro are costing Europe jobs and they are creating a lost generation of educated young people. This is not what the founding fathers promised.’ The eurozone economy grew by just 0.1 per cent in the third quarter of the year compared with 0.8 per cent in Britain and 0.9 per cent in the US. 'The euro should either be dismantled in an orderly way or the leading members should do the necessary as fast as possible to make it growth and employment-friendly' Sir Christopher Pissarides . Unemployment in the single currency region is at 12.1 per cent – meaning more than 19million people in the bloc are out of work . The 65-year-old was instrumental in getting his homeland of Cyprus to join the euro in 2008. ‘I was completely sold on the idea,’ he will say. ‘Back then, the euro looked like a great idea. But it has now backfired. It is holding back growth and job creation and it is dividing Europe. The present situation is untenable.’ Professor Pissarides is the regius professor of economics at the LSE and chairman of its new Centre for Macroeconomics. He is also European studies professor at the University of Cyprus and chairman of the Council of National Economy of the Republic of Cyprus, one of the eurozone’s most troubled countries.","Sir Christopher Pissarides once passionately believed in single currency .

"Watching your weight does not include eating large bowls of pasta. But if you thought such things were off the menu, you might want to think again. Makers of the spiralizer — a new kitchen gadget that is taking America by storm — claim you can create nutritious, very low-calorie, low-carb ‘pasta’, ‘noodles’ and ‘rice’ from everyday fruit and vegetables, in less time than it takes to peel a spud. According to U.S. food bloggers, this magic machine can spin a simple courgette into a generous bowl of ‘spaghetti’ in a flash. Spiralize a sweet potato and in minutes you’ll apparently get a filling portion of ‘rice’ with just half the calories and carbs of regular basmati. Scroll down for video . Kitchen magic: The spiralizer turns fruit and vegetables into noodles  in less time than it takes to peel a spud . So, of course, I was keen to try it, not least because with two children — Stanley, 12, and Florence, seven — I’m always looking for ways to add fruit and vegetables to their diet without any dinner-table histrionics. It seems that spiralizing still has some way to go before it catches on here, however. My local cookware shops in Surrey, and even the Lakeland website, drew a blank. I eventually found one — a Spiralite, by Spiralz — online, for £25 on Amazon, including free delivery. Three days later the lightweight, dishwasher-proof machine arrived, with three confusing-looking interchangeable blades. But six simple step-by-step instructions later, I was ready to crank the handle. To begin, I pressed the legs of the machine down firmly on a flat surface to allow the suction cups on to hold it in position. Next, I had to choose what to spiralize. Firm fruit and vegetables work best, which means that berries, citrus fruits and avocados are out. Carrot, sweet potato and pear are all good choices but courgette is a favourite, as it creates such delicious ‘pasta’. Oodles of noodles: Mandy's first attempt was courgette spaghetti . Simply impale your vegetable between the spiked disc and the slicing blade — pushing it forward with one hand while turning the handle at the back of the machine with the other — and you’ll be quickly rewarded with a neat tumble of veggie ‘spaghetti’. No chopping or coring is required. My first recipe attempt, then, was courgette spaghetti, a favourite on websites because of its low calorie content — a 125g portion of raw courgette spaghetti contains 21 calories and less than 4g of carbohydrate, compared with 346 calories and 64g of carbohydrate for normal spaghetti. One large peeled courgette, put through the spiralizer, makes enough for one person. After blanching the spirals for a minute or two in boiling water — you can salt them if you wish — I drained them and plopped on a generous dollop of our family’s home-made bolognese sauce. My children were nodding eagerly until, roughly five minutes after serving, their meals began to bleed. Courgettes, it seems, have an exceptionally high water content of roughly 95 per cent, and once they were sitting on a plate that moisture was released, turning dinner into more of a bolognese soup. Undeterred, my next challenge was a spiralized ‘noodle’ stir-fry — one large carrot, a medium courgette and half an onion per person, spiralized and stir-fried with four beaten eggs and a splash of soy sauce to make four 150-calorie meals. Although hungry, the children were now sceptical. But Florence was first to pronounce it a success: ‘Mum, this is gor-geous,’ she cooed, before they both cleared their plates. Just like the real thing? Dieticians says that carbs should not be competely cut from our diets . The next day I was practically aglow with ideas. I began with breakfast: ribbons of pear with a blob of Greek yoghurt, a sprinkle of walnuts and a dash of honey — around 170 calories in total. For lunch I tried something lighter — a raw salad of half a beetroot with a large raw carrot, half a courgette and half a cucumber ‘noodles’. In just under 15 minutes I had whizzed them through the blade, leaving the two beetroot until last as — be wary — they spatter slightly. I splashed on some balsamic dressing and it tasted fresh and zingy — and all with just 140 calories. Florence and Stanley now demanded spiralized suppers. Their favourite treat is curly fries, so I tried to make them with sweet potato. Leaving the potatoes unpeeled for extra fibre, one medium potato made enough for one person. I splashed the freshly made coils with olive oil and baked them in a hot oven for about 20 minutes.Unfortunately, the finer edges of the springs burnt too quickly while the coiled parts remained underdone. Another disaster. Next I found the recipe for sweet potato ‘rice’, which requires chopping the spiralized potatoes in a food processor until they resemble rice grains. I fried a few cloves of chopped garlic and half an onion before adding my sweet potato rice and poaching it in chicken stock for two minutes. A quick sieve and I had an orange-coloured ‘risotto’. It tasted delicious. Best of all, it contained only 107 calories and 25g of carbohydrates per portion (compared with 183 calories and 37.5g carbs in basmati). But is it really prudent to remove significant amounts of carbs from a family’s diet? Seeing spirals: Mandy tries out the spiralizer on beetroot, carrots, courgette and cucumber . Dietitian Vanessa Hattersley says: ‘It’s definitely not a good idea to eliminate carbohydrates from the diet entirely, as they are a food group that provides us with a range of important nutrients. ‘That said, many of us do tend to overload our plates with pasta, rice, bread and potatoes when they are on offer. A well-balanced meal should be a quarter protein, a quarter carbohydrate and half fruit and vegetables, so the spiralizer could play a really useful role in redressing the nutritional balance in a carb-heavy diet.’ There is very little room in the back of my cupboards for yet another faddy gadget to gather dust. But I think this little gizmo may just have earned a permanent place on my kitchen counter.

"The mother of Aaron Hernandez's alleged victim left court sobbing on Thursday as the prosecutor's opening statement revealed details of her son's murder. Ursula Ward later returned to court this afternoon as proceedings got underway in the former New England Patriot player's murder trial  in Fall River, Massachusetts. Hernandez, dressed in a sharp, dark suit, stared straight ahead and rocked from side to side, chewing gum as images of his friend, Odin Lloyd, flashed on a screen in front of him. He has pleaded not guilty to the murder. Hernandez's fiancée and mother of his young daughter, Shayanna Jenkins, sat behind him in court alongside his brother DJ and mother Terri. Mrs Hernandez was also seen wiping tears away in the courtroom. Miss Jenkins' sister Shaneah sat with the victim's mother and other friends who wept at details of Lloyd's death. Shaneah was Mr Lloyd's girlfriend at the time he was shot in the head and torso and dumped in a pit at an industrial park in June 2013. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez pictured in court on Thursday as his murder trial got underway in Fall River, Massachusetts. The former Pats player is accused of killing Odin Lloyd (pictured on the screen) The victim's mother, Ursula Ward, wept in court on Thursday as the prosecutor told the jury details of her son's violent death . Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancée, looks on in court on Thursday during opening statements at his murder trial. Prosecutors have listed Shayanna Jenkins as a possible witness and this month petitioned the court to grant immunity to her, compelling her to testify . Hernandez and his defense lawyer stare at an image of Odin Lloyd's body as it was discovered at an industrial park in North Attlesboro, Massachusetts in June 2013 . Prosecutors said Hernandez and two friends, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, picked Lloyd up at his home in Boston on June 17, drove him to the industrial park and shot him dead. Prosecutors have not said who pulled the trigger but said Hernandez orchestrated the killing. Ortiz and Wallace have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. In opening statements on Thursday, District Attorney Patrick Bomberg took jurors through what he said was the sequence of events that led to Lloyd's killing. He played before-and-after footage that Bomberg said showed Lloyd getting into a car driven by Hernandez, then video taken shortly afterward at the NFL player's home, without Lloyd in the car. The prosecutor also presented an image taken off Hernandez's video surveillance system that showed Hernandez standing outside his basement, holding what Bomberg said was a gun. As the prosecutor showed jurors a photo of Lloyd's body, his mother was overcome and had to leave the courtroom briefly. He told the jury that Hernandez and his fiancée were the only people that Mr Lloyd knew in North Attleboro where his body was found. He said Hernandez was unhappy with the victim, called up his friends and then contacted Lloyd using other people's phones before trying to conceal that he had done so. He then claimed that Hernandez 'drove the victim to a secluded area and participated in killing and covered up the killing'. The jury was shown a photograph of Odin Lloyd's body which was found by a high school student jogging home on June 17, 2013 in North Attleboro, Massachusetts . The prosecutor also said that a blunt - a marijuana cigarette - was found at the scene of Lloyd's body which had Hernandez's DNA on it. Defense lawyer, Michael Fee, began his remarks on Thursday just before 1pm, announcing: 'Aaron Hernandez is an innocent man.' The attorney said that Hernandez had been targeted by police and prosecutors in a 'sloppy' investigation because he was a celebrity and a Patriots player. 'Aaron never had a chance' Fee said. 'They locked on Aaron and they targeted him.' He said the evidence would show that Hernandez did not kill Lloyd and did not ask anyone to do so. He said authorities could offer no motive for the killing. 'The investigation was sloppy and unprofessional. What about the facts that showed Aaron's innocence?' he said. 'The evidence will show that they were ignored.' A surveillance image from the football player's home which appears to show him standing outside his basement holding a gun - although this was strongly disputed by the defense . Family members and friends of Odin Lloyd sobbed as the lead prosecutor described his brutal murder and gunshot wounds . Fee admitted that Hernandez and Lloyd liked to smoke marijuana together and go out on the town to pick up girls. He claimed that friends were desperate to hang out with Hernandez because of his NFL status and how he picked up the tab and was so generous - often hiring cars for his friends to use. The defense attorney also claimed that two nights before his murder, Hernandez gave Lloyd the keys to a rental SUV after partying all night with two women. The keys were later found on Lloyd's body. Fee claimed that the Pats player had contacted his friend Odin on the night of his death, only to see if he wanted to party - and not for any other reason. Noting that Hernandez had long-term football contract, a new house, a fiancée and a seven-month-old baby, the defense attorney said: 'In June of 2013, Aaron Hernandez was planing a future, not a murder.' Terri Hernandez, center, mother of Aaron Hernandez, watches during her son's murder trial on Thursday. She was also in tears during  the opening statements . Evidence that Hernandez was at the scene is not enough to convict him, Fee said. 'Mere presence is not enough. We can't be convicted of a crime just because we hang with the wrong people or are in the wrong place,' he told the jury. On Thursday afternoon, the prosecution called Odin Lloyd's former employer who said Lloyd had failed to turn up for work on June 17 and the following day. The employer said that he had called or texted Lloyd but received no response. Later that day, he learned that Lloyd, whom he employed at his fertilizer company, had died. The prosecution then called 17-year-old Matthew Kent to the stand. The high school student was the first to report finding Lloyd's body as he took a shortcut on his job home through a construction site. The teen testified that Lloyd was lying on his back and did not respond when he twice asked if he was alright. The boy then ran to a nearby business for help where a man called 911. The teen described the scene, saying that a red baseball hat was lying above the man's head and a white rag near his feet. Mr Kent also said that there were tire tracks for about 30 feet close to the body. The prosecution then entered into exhibits two images of the victim's body, lying face up on the dirt. Hernandez often leaned forward in court, paying close attention to opening statements and witness testimony, including the account of Matthew Kent. Victim Odin Lloyd's mother (pictured in the purple suit) with his girlfriend Shaneah Jenkins to her left . The swearing-in began on Thursday morning after some brief delays involving jury issues. One juror was late getting to court, and another juror sent a note to the judge.  Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh then began individually questioning jurors. A jury of 13 women and five men was seated by Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh on Monday after more than two weeks of jury selection. Six of the 18 jurors were randomly selected as alternates just before deliberations started. Garsh instructed jurors not to talk to anyone about the case or share details of the trial with anyone in any manner, including through social media. The murder trial gets underway just days before Hernandez's former team plays in the Super Bowl. Sunday's Super Bowl will be the Patriots' first appearance since 2012, when Hernandez caught a touchdown pass in Super Bowl XLVI. At the time he seemed to be a man with a bright future. At age 23, he had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the team. He and his fiancée had started a family and were living in a mansion in the Boston suburbs with their 8-month-old daughter. But at the opening of the trial, prosecutors have started to paint a different picture of Hernandez as a killer who orchestrated the shooting of semiprofessional football player Lloyd. At 23 Hernandez had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the New England Patriots, but then he was arrested in June 2013 and charged with murder . Hernandez was arrested on 26 June 2013, just days after Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial park near his North Attleboro mansion. The Patriots cut him less than two hours after he was arrested. Prosecutors have listed Shayanna Jenkins as a possible witness and this month petitioned the court to grant immunity to her. That could compel her to testify. The court has not said whether it was granted. Thursday was the first day since the petition was heard that Jenkins appeared in the courtroom. Hernandez, now 25, has also been charged with killing two men in Boston in 2012 because he felt disrespected after one of them spilled a drink on him at a nightclub. He pleaded not guilty after being charged in those shootings in May, and the case has not yet gone to trial. Prosecutors have said Hernandez may have showed Lloyd the spot where a 2012 double homicide took place in Boston.

"A football coach is set to be separated from his Filipino bride for the birth of their first child after she was banned from the UK due to strict visa rules. Ian Wootton, who lives in Bromley, south east London, and his heavily pregnant wife Sunshine are expecting their first son at the end of March. But Mr Wootton, 46, has been unable to get his wife a spousal visa because he does not earn the £22,400 minimum which he needs to support her and her 18-month-old son Russell. Ian Wootton, who lives in Bromley, south east London, and his seven-month Filipino wife Sunshine (pictured at their wedding in October with her son Russell) face being separated for the birth of their first child . Before Sunshine, 26, can move to the UK, Mr Wootton also needs to prove he has at least £72,000 in his savings - a factor which is complicated because he is self-employed. He told MailOnline: 'David Cameron is always shouting about family values but these ridiculous rules are tearing families apart. They are not giving us a fair chance to be together . 'This is the only chance I have to be there for the birth of my child, but it has been made so difficult. 'We don't want her to come over here and claim benefits, or take anything off the government. We just want to be together. But because I have married someone that is outside the EU, I can't.' Mr Wootton met his wife in 2013, when he visited the Philippines for a friend's wedding. His wife then came to the UK for six months on a visitor's visa before they married in the Philippines in October. Mr Wootton returned to the UK in January, hoping Sunshine would soon be able to follow. But his wife - who is seven months' pregnant - has been unable to join him because his income does not fulfill the strict specifications. The football coach, who has three employees working for his business, is now urgently trying to convert the attic in his £350,000 home, so he can put it on the market and declare the profit as savings. The 46-year-old has been unable to get a spousal visa for his wife because he falls short of the £22,400 minimum earning requirement to support his family, which includes her 18-month-old son Russell. He said: 'I need to do this as soon as possible so I can sell the house and have the money, just so my wife can come over and be with me. But if this backfires, I don't know what I will do - it is every penny I have got.' The Minimum Income Requirement policy, introduced in 2012, stipulates that only British citizens, or those with refugee status, who earn at least £18,600 a year can sponsor their non-European spouse's visa. This rises to £22,400 for families with a child, and a further £2,400 for each extra child. Applicants can rely on cash savings to make up the total amount if they are more than £16,000 and held for at least six months under their control. But while cash savings can be combined with income from salaried employment, they cannot be combined with income from self-employment. The Home Office policy also states that income sources from a third party, including state benefits, are not permitted. It means the applicant cannot use any form of welfare benefits, disability allowance, income support, housing benefit, Jobseeker's Allowance or other towards the minimum income requirement. The police states that £62,500 in cash savings is required if no other income sources are being used to meet the income requirement. It would mean someone earning less than the required minimum salary who is self-employed would need to have £62,000, as well as the required difference between their salary and the threshold. Overseas employment income, or prospective earnings from a job offer in the UK, will also not be taken into account. Therefore, only the sponsor's employment income is considered if the applicant is not already living and working in the UK. An all-party parliamentary group said the restrictions were 'causing anguish' with children suffering as a result. The Home Office said the rules are in place so that those coming to the UK for family migration 'do not become a burden on the rest of the public'. But Mr Wootton said he owns his own company, has £20,000 in savings and even owns his own home, meaning they would have no need to rely on the state. He said: 'I never ask for help financially; I always pay my bills. Yes, I am on a low income, but I do not have credit card debts and I work in a job which brings benefit to the community. 'Yet, you could have someone who is earning more than me who is not financially stable, who would not be subject to these same rules. 'What's crazy is that, if I had sat there and taken benefits, I would have been exempt from these rules and my wife could have been here in the UK with me.' He added: 'I mean, what ordinary person just has £72,000 in their savings? It's impossible.' Mr Wootton says he cannot move to the Philippines due to a serious bowel condition, Hirschsprung's disease, which means he often needs treatment. He is also loath to leave behind the company which he set up, which visits different schools in London, coaching children and their parents in sport. Some of his projects are supported by Bromley Council. He said: 'I have gone through every emotion there is - I can't sleep. 'Obviously I want to be there for my wife during labour but I can't just keep leaving the UK, when I have work commitments. And the flights to and from really add up. 'I am trying desperately now to cobble together this £72,000. I have been back from the Philippines since January 1 and haven't even put my heating on yet - everything is costing so much money.' The Home Office said: 'Our requirements reflect advice from independent experts and ensure people coming here for family migration do not become a burden on the rest of the public. 'They are also helping to ensure that those who do come to live in the UK can play a full part in British life.'","Ian Wootton, 46, from Bromley, London, married Filipino wife in October .

"Ukip has been forced to axe one of its shortlisted candidates to stand in May's general election after he shared online a post which described mixed-race couples as 'a plague'. Mark Walker, 46, hoped to stand for the party in Bromsgrove, south of Birmingham. A second social media message claimed that the Israeli secret service organisation Mossad was responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris. Mark Walker, pictured, proudly announced on his Facebook page that he was planning to run for Ukip . He told supporters he had been approached twice, and decided that he should allow his name to go forward . Walker, who was planning to contest Ukip's planned hustings tomorrow in Bromsgrove, had warned fellow party supporters about the dangers posed by social media, while still reposting bizarre conspiracy theories and messages decrying 'the plague of inter-racial marriage'. Walker advised on his Ukip Facebook page, where he announced his plan to run for parliament, that people should 'share far and wide' an article called 'the genocide of the peoples of Europe'. In the disturbing article, the author claims a European elite wants to turn everyone into 'one homogeneous mixed breed of Blacks, Whites and Asians'. Walker posted a 'piece of advice to consider' for all Ukip supporters. He warned about the dangers of being added to groups by 'facebook friends'. He warned: 'Remember your name, profile and image will be associated with that Group and everything written there, and you may be surprised how different the views and opinions of that Group are with yours even though they may show a Ukip banner.' Labour MP John Healey told The Mirror: 'These are yet more disgusting views from Ukip representatives. I hope Mr Farage is going to immediately distance himself from this.' A spokesperson for the political party said: 'Ukip is non-racist, non-sectarian. Mark Walker will not be selected as we believe his comments show he is unsuitable.' This controversy follows comments by one senior Ukip official who claimed 'hundreds of thousands of bigots in the UK need representation too'. Walker warned his supporters of the dangers posed by social media especially when joining groups . Despite his advice on the dangers of social media, he posted a link to this disturbing race-hate website .","Mark Walker wanted to run for Ukip in Bromsgrove in the West Midlands .

"Ladies, let’s have a chat. High-heels: you are getting it all wrong. Most of you don your heels and wobble about thinking that just because you have a pair of expensive-looking footwear on you, everything will fall into place. If you can’t manage to stay upright and look elegant then it’s perhaps best you don’t graduate above one or two inches. Scroll down for video . Etiquette expert William Hanson reveals the best way to walk in high heels . So many of you (35s and under, mainly) are getting it badly wrong: goodness only knows what it’s doing to your feet and leg muscles. If the posture is okay, the gait isn’t, and vice versa. Some of you look highly medicated when you teeter down high streets on a night out – the lack of length and tightness of your skirts not helping, either. Due to having to teach deportment in my own etiquette classes, it came to my colleagues’ and my attention that I really needed to do more than talk female clients through the theory of high-heels and lead by example. It was time to step up to the sling-backs and learn. What I’ve found, coming to it as a total novice, is that I seem to do it better than most ladies. I almost had to intervene in the opticians the other day when I saw the assistant’s heels that had bent (from bad walking and standing) to a perilous 45-degree angle. In order to properly understand the art of walking in heels William invested in a pair of size 9 pumps . So, armed with a pair of hot red four-inch stilettos, I enlisted the help of Pam Holt, who, during the 1970s-1990s, ran the Pam Holt Model Agency, to learn how to walk in heels. On Pam’s newly laid kitchen floor I wiggled back and forth for an initial assessment before being politely corrected by the pro. My already excellent posture helped, apparently, but the positioning of the pelvis and hands are somewhat different for those who wish to wear heels, I learned. Heels aren’t easy. Let’s not pretend otherwise. You need training, and thanks to Pam, and some surreptitious practice at home, I am now somewhat of an aficionado and offer to you, dear ladies (and the odd male), my guide on what you should be doing. The right shoes . First you have to find a pair that fits and are moderately comfortable. Heels should really never be over four inches; unless you’re attending a party where ‘mutton dressed as lamb’ is the dress code. Generally, it is lower heels for daytime, higher for evening. Too many women think they will look sexier the higher the heel. Wrong. Putting them on . Point toes, as if you are Saint Darcey Bussell, arch foot and slide into heel. Wiggle those toes to spread out and settle in their new, rather cramped, home. Posture . Before you can even think about moving, make sure you are standing correctly. So few of us today (of either sex) have good posture thanks to spending far too long slumped over computers. It defeats the object of wearing the heels in the first place (to make you look confident and your legs look sexy) if you shuffle or slouch along. Roll your shoulders quite far back, imagine you are pushing them over a garden fence and back down the other side. Your hands should be behind the seam of your trousers/skirt and your chin should be parallel to the floor. Final prep… . Clench your bottom, tip your pelvis slightly up and let your hips take you forward… Your waist plays no part in all this, it just remains straight and motionless. First steps . Push your weight through the pelvis. Your ankle gets lifted up, knee bent and then straighten onto the floor. A traditional walk is heel-toe, and whilst in heels this is still true, it shouldn’t be as pronounced as when in flat shoes. Whilst we are not trying to emulate Nicole Scherzinger in the latest production of Cats, some find it helpful to picture a feline movement. Stance . Too many women stand with their legs crossed – maybe they want to go to the lavatory? Correctly done, stand with your heels lined up (a gap or two or three inches in between), your toes pointing in different directions, your right foot in front of the left. Set off on the right foot . Literally! With correct deportment, we always set off with the right foot leading. Step in time . Have some rhythm about your gait, but take your time over medium-length strides. Give us a twirl . If you do ever need to turn around, and wish to do it with flare, swivel on the toes of your left foot, so you can set off again on the right foot. When seated . To show off your legs and shoes cross your legs and rest one ankle on your other leg’s shin. The straight and narrow . As you walk, imagine you are walking down an invisible straight line. We don’t want to look like we’re on a catwalk, placing one foot directly in front of the other (too many young girls think that is the be-all-and-end-all of a stiletto), but imagining such a line will help you from walking along imaginary tram lines. Best foot forward . Well, sort of. Your heel should be ‘on’ the imaginary line. Your toe should be pointing off. They key, however, is NEVER RUSH! I know many reading this will initially feel uncomfortable about the sight or thought of a man in heels. I can assure you, I have no further desires to explore the realms of women’s clothing and accessories. But I felt if I was to fairly critique women on their walk, I had to give it a go myself. Many girls learn just by, at best, putting a pair of their mother’s on and tottering around their houses; others, at worst, decide they’ll use their first time out clubbing to learn. It often takes an outsider to point out a social group’s flaws and so I hope my guide will be of some assistant in quelling the gaggle of girls who tend to look more elephant than elegant.

"Rene Enriquez (pictured)  is currently serving two life sentences for murder.The black hand tattooed on his chest is the symbol of the Mexican Mafia . Los Angeles Police Department is under fire for giving an escort to a convicted Mexican Mafia hit man so he could speak to a business leaders' conference. Rene Enriquez, 52, known as 'The Boxer', was a leader in one of the US's most notorious and violent gangs, the Mexican Mafia, and is currently serving two life sentences for murder. But yesterday he was given a police escort from prison to downtown Los Angeles  to address a group of local police chiefs and wealthy business leaders. Enriquez was speaking to around 125 people about the inner-workings of the criminal enterprise. Formed in the Californian prison system in the 1950s, the Mexican Mafia has a reputation for extreme violence. Enriquez worked his way up from enforcer to a leader in the organization - which is also known as La Eme - before his arrest and conviction. After two decades in the gang he defected in 2003 and began helping police by describing the hierarchy and methods used by the gang. Los Angeles Police Commission President Steve Soboroff has called for an investigation into the incident and called the episode 'embarrassing'. 'There were some decisions made that in retrospect were the wrong decisions,' Soboroff said. He called the LAPD's involvement in the event as 'very, very misconceived and surprising' and a 'giant waste of public resources.' NBC News reported that a source who attended the session said Enriquez had the air of a 'corporate leader' who provided 'a rare look into life of a criminal corporate executive.' The source said Enriquez discussed 'gang franchising, marketing, sales, merchandising and branding.' The LA Times reported that from around 12pm police secured a section  near Spring and 6th streets, where the meeting took place, and unmarked sedans dropped off uniformed officers. A bomb squad vehicle was also spotted outside the building for a short period of time. The LAPD headquarters in Los Angeles (pictured). Los Angeles Police Commission President Steve Soboroff has called for an investigation into the police escort given to Enriquez and called the episode 'embarrassing' How much the operation cost is not yet known but the LAPD said the session served an educational purpose. In a statement to NBC News they said: 'The purpose was to learn how a transnational criminal enterprise was built, branded and marketed. 'It is the hope that we can learn and develop better strategies to counter these threats to our region.' The convicted killer is the subject of a book, 'The Black Hand: The Bloody Rise and Redemption of 'Boxer' Enriquez, a Mexican Mob Killer' - and people leaving the event were spotted carrying copies. Enriquez rose from low-level thug to a major player in the organization as his reputation for violence grew and he served time in prisons such as San Quentin and Folsom. Heavily tattooed, the black hand on his chest is the symbol of the Mexican Mafia. In 1993, Enriquez pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder and is serving life in prison. In a 2008 interview with the BBC he said: 'I believe I'm a cut above the rest.' 'As a Mafioso, you have an elitist, arrogant mentality. 'That's how you carry yourself in the Mexican Mafia - you walk into a room and everybody knows you're a leader.'","Rene Enriquez, 52, known as 'The Boxer' was a leader in the Mexican mafia .

"Secret phone recordings have revealed that a Democratic member of Congress and top Pentagon leaders went around then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to negotiate with the Libyan regime of Muammar Gadhafi because they were convinced she was hell-bent on taking the U.S. to war. America's intelligence community was conerned that Clinton was sanitizing their reports to make the case for military intervention on the basis of an impending genocide in the port city of Benghazi, even though there was scant evidence that Gadhafi's military was prepared to massacre rebel groups. The U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff dispatched a middle-man in July 2011 to tell the dictator's son, Seif Gadhafi, that internal State Department reports sent to members of Congress were 'just full of stupid, stupid facts.' The younger Gadaffi, later captured after his father's summary execution and now in a prison cell, told the Americans who phoned him behind Clinton's back that many U.S.-supported armed rebel groups were 'gangsters and terrorists,' and 'not freedom fighters.' 'STUPID, STUPID FACTS': Hillary Clinton allegedly had blinders on about Libya, prompting generals and a member of Congress to conduct their own secret talks with the Gadhafi regime . Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi was captured and killed by rebel leaders backed by the US after Clinton persuaded NATO allies and the UN to suppoort military intervention . COMING UP SHORT: Ohio Democrat Dennis Kucinich was a US congressman when he went ehind Hillary CLinton's back to try to avert military intervention in Libya . 'And now you have NATO supporting them with ships, with airplanes, helicopters, arms, training, communication,' he said in one recorded conversation with U.S. officials. 'We ask the American government send a fact-finding mission to Libya. I want you to see everything with your own eyes.' The stunning story was uncovered by The Washington Times, and fleshed out by interviews with former congressman Dennis Kucinich, the Ohio Democrat who spearheaded the back-channel talks. Seif told Kucinich in one taped call in May 2011 that Clinton's march to war 'was like the WMDs in Iraq. It was based on a false report.' 'Libyan airplanes bombing demonstrators, Libyan airplanes bombing districts in Tripoli, Libyan army killed thousands, etc., etc.,' he said then, 'and now the whole world found there is no single evidence that such things happened in Libya.' Clinton ultimately convinced President Barack Obama, the United Nations and America's NATO allies to green-light military action on the basis of a humanitarian crisis that never materialized, the Times reported Thursday. James Baker, a secretary of state under Presdient George W. Bush, told the newspaper that 'if this story is true, it would be highly unusual for the Pentagon to conduct a separate set of diplomatic negotiations.' Kucinich is a dovish anti-nuclear liberal who never voted in favor of military action during his three terms in Congress, opposed the USA PATRIOT ACT, and once signed a letter of solidarity with Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The remarkable thing about his attempts to avert U.S. military action in Libya is the division it indicated in the Obama administration. It also suggests that Clinton was the primary driving force behind America's war footing and later intervention there. 'There was a distortion of events that were occurring in Libya to justify an intervention which was essentially wrong and illegal,' he said. Libya was the one place where Clinton advocated the U.S. bring military muscle to isolate and depose a foreign leader. France's then-president Nicolas Sarkozy, Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, and current Secretary of State John Kerry have shared that view. Then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen both disagreed since they couldn't confirm what Clinton was telling Congress about conditions on the ground. Clinton is widely expected to enter the 2016 presidential race by the end of the spring. If she runs, her foreign policy record as the United States' top diplomat will make the Benghazi case fair came for attack ads and debate questions . The Times also faults UN Ambassador Samantha Power and National Security Adviser Susan Rice for supporting Clinton by erring on the side of preventing a genocide rather than confirming one was imminent before making the case for war. NO CLEAR POLICY: Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb criticized the Clinton-Obama Libya policy in 2011, and may run against Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination . GUILT COMPLEX? UN ambassador Samantha Power allegedly was wracked with guilt over the Rwandan genocide and determined to help Hillary Clinton stop another one in Libya – despite the lack of evidence for concern . GRUESOME: Gadhafi was captured, beaten and killed by rebels in his home town of Sirte, Liyba in October 2011 . 'Susan Rice was involved in the Rwanda crisis in 1994, Samantha Power wrote very moving books about what happened in Rwanda, and Hillary Clinton was also in the background of that crisis as well,' University of Virginia international relations professor Allen Lynch told the Times. 'I think they have all carried this with them as a kind of guilt complex.'. The secret recordings also show that on the day the United Nations passed a resolution supporting the use of military force against muammar Ghadafi, Clinton ordered a military general to refuse to take a call with Seif Gadhafi and other high-level regime officials. The call was intended to help negotiate a resolution and avoid bloodshed. Gadhafi called for a cease-fire a day later, but the Obama administration waved it off. Jim Webb, a military veteran and then a Democratic U.S. senator from Virginia, questioned the use of force at the time. 'We have a military operation that's been put to play, but we do not have a clear diplomatic policy or clear statement of foreign policy,' he said then. 'We know we don't like the Gadhafi regime, but we do not have a picture of who the opposition movement really is. We got a vote from the Security Council but we had five key abstentions in that vote.' Webb has been mentioned as possibly preparign to challenge Clinton for the Democrats' 2016 presdiential nomination.","Clinton will face tough questions about her march to war against Muammar Ghadafi if she runs for president .

"New England is expected to be hit with storm-force winds and up to 18 inches of snow today, with the latest round of bad weather blasting in before beleaguered residents have had a chance to dig their way out of the last dumping of snow. A heavy storm warning has been issued for Maine and parts of New Hampshire and Massachusetts north of Boston from this morning through to Saturday night. Residents have been told to travel only in emergencies. The National Weather Service said drifting snow driven by strong winds could make travel life-threatening. Efforts to clear the 3 feet of snow that fell earlier this week have been put on hold. Scroll down for video . Worrying outlook: A forecast shows snow engulfing large swathes of New England towards New York and Northern Michigan on Friday . Conditions: On Saturday the poor weather shifts West with only the north west tip of Maine suffering snow . Massachusetts resident Bob Tetrault told NBC News that the new storm warning was 'everyone's worst nightmare'. This week's blizzard shattered a seawall and ripped decks from houses in his neighborhood of Marshfield. Things aren't any better in New York where authorities have issued a 'life threatening' weather warning through to tomorrow evening. The New York City Office of Emergency Management said there would be 'dangerously frigid temperatures and life-threatening wind chill'. Seniors, infants, the homeless and those with chronic medical conditions were said to be at an 'increased risk of health problems', the emergency management office said. One to two inches of snow was expected to have fallen by this morning and temperatures would plummet throughout the day, with a nighttime low of between -11 (12f) and -13 (10f) degrees with wind chills of '5-10 possible'. No respite: Predictions for Sunday show the snow concentrated in the Midwest . The strongest winds, according to the warning, are expected tonight and tomorrow morning, with sustained wind gusts of 40mph. Those winds will diminish Saturday afternoon, but temperatures would remain 'dangerously frigid'. Meanwhile, snow resumed falling in Boston last night and major cities south of Boston were warned they would get about 1 to 3 inches of new snow over the weekend. But for the northern suburbs to the Canadian border up to a foot of snow and gusts of 50mph were expected for eastern Marine area, including Bangor, in what Samantha Mohr, a forecaster for The Weather Channel, said was going to be 'a huge wind event'. On Massachusetts' Nantucket island, power had been restored to 92 per cent of customers by Thursday night, but many residents still couldn't get out of their homes. Nantucket resident Don Van Dyke told NBC News  'it looks like a disaster zone', adding that he had 'never seen it that bad'. Predictions: The wintry conditions are set to spread further west and south by Monday with the North East expected to experience the worst of the weather . Winter storm watches have also been posted further to the West for parts of far eastern Arizona and New Mexico. The Weather Channel forecast suggests the latest band of weather will not be as devastating as the one seen earlier in the week, however it will cause misery for those still clearing snow and fixing flood damage. Bill Simpson, a weather service meteorologist, told the Boston Globe: 'It could be a potential horror show again on the roads.' The mercury is also set to plummet with temperatures in the low 20s for most of the region, falling to single digits at night. Moving into next week, the snow is set to ease off but it's still expected to be cold with below-freezing temperatures expected for some parts of the region. Last week's storm brought heavy snow, hurricane-force winds and coastal flooding - wreaking havoc across a huge swathe of the region, with record-setting snowfall in some parts of Massachusetts. Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and parts of Long Island, New York, were hit by the fierce storm throughout Tuesday, which wrecked homes, cut power and blasted more than thirty inches of snow. The worst-hit state was Massachusetts, where 36inches of snow was recorded in Lunenberg, according to the Weather Channel, while elsewhere blasts of wind topped 75mph.

"BBC Sport have retained Match of the Day highlights at a fair price after rivals ITV conceded it was not worth competing for the rights. ITV’s decision was a surprise after being widely tipped to make a bid during the tender process. But memories remain of the blunders made by ITV when they had the highlights from 2001-04. Screening the show in the early evening and having match analysts operating from the much-derided ‘Tactics Truck’ were innovations that failed to score with viewers. The BBC will keep Premier League highlights on its Match of the Day programme after ITV failed to bid . Gary Lineker is pictured presenting an episode of the BBC's Match of the Day . Gary Lineker delivers the news to his Twitter followers on Thursday afternoon . ITV’s decision not to compete allows the Beeb to keep their flagship programme at a cost of £204million over three years — an increase of little more than £24m over their previous three-year deal. It is also far less than the mooted price of a winning bid if ITV had been fully engaged. Only Wimbledon tennis ranks higher in BBC Sport’s portfolio so their delight is perhaps understandable. It is also a timely boost with the Beeb expecting to lose live rights for The Open golf to Sky in the near future. Pay-TV networks will be offered the chance to bid for another of the BBC’s top three properties, Six Nations rugby, from 2018. And BBC keeping hold of one of their crown jewels means it’s also likely that Gary Lineker will stay at the Corporation for the duration of the next contract that runs for three seasons from 2016-17 onwards. Lineker, however, whose Beeb contract expires in 2016 might still present BT Sport’s Champions League coverage from next season – if his BBC deal that currently gives them exclusivity for Lineker in the domestic market can be re-negotiated. Former England striker Alan Shearer is one of the programme's regular pundits . The flagship BBC football highlights programme started broadcasting back in 1964 . ITV deciding not to enter the highlights auction is also strange considering they axed Adrian Chiles last week as their lead football presenter with immediate effect - replacing him with Mark Pougatch in what was seen as a clear move to get a football revamp sorted before the highlights auction. The Premier League are still guaranteed to get a significant lift in their terrestrial highlights package as nothing about ITV not bidding would have come out before the BBC put in their offer. However the rights were retained for £204m and the BBC have done well to keep them for that amount if they weren’t aware ITV hadn’t bid. They had been expected to fetch at least £250m compared to the £180m paid by the BBC last time. THIS SEASON . ITV - England internationals, Champions League, Europa League .

The agreement covers the Saturday night edition of Match of the Day, its Sunday morning repeat, Football Focus, Match of the Day 2 on Sunday nights and a new midweek magazine show to air on BBC Two at 10pm on Wednesday night. Under the new deal, the Saturday night show will be available on the iPlayer on demand service for the first time. A BBC statement read: 'The new midweek programme will review and preview the weekend’s action with all the latest Premier League news, going behind the scenes at Premier League clubs, and bringing interviews with managers, players and those who have made their mark on the league’s illustrious history.' Barbara Slater, Director of BBC Sport said: 'We’re delighted to retain the rights to show Premier League highlights on the BBC, and continue to bring the most popular league in the world to our audiences. Match of the Day is the most iconic brand in television sport, and we work hard to ensure that it continues to be the destination for millions of viewers each weekend across platforms. 'It’s very exciting to be able to add a new midweek show to the mix, reflecting the continued appetite for Premier League action and analysis.' Match of the Day pundits Alan Hansen and Alan Shearer during an episode last season . BBC Director General Tony Hall added: 'Sport matters. It brings the nation together. It can break hearts and raise spirits. And because it matters to the public, it also matters to the BBC. 'That’s why it’s fantastic news that we have kept the Premier League highlights. 'It’s the best and most exciting league in the world. The BBC has made the highlights programme, through Match of the Day, a national treasure, and fans can look forward to enjoying all the drama with us for another three years.' Match of the Day, the iconic BBC football highlights programme, was first screened on BBC2 on August 22, 1964 and featured coverage of just one match, the first division fixture between Liverpool and Arsenal at Anfield. The programme's audience was estimated at a mere 20,000 - less than half the attendance at the ground - because not many households could receive the BBC2 channel, set up four months earlier. It was not the first time the BBC had broadcast football - live matches had been shown since 1958 - but a new tradition of Saturday night highlights was born. Match of the Day was broadcast on BBC2 for the first year of its existence . The top division clubs initially had objections, fearing the promise of evening highlights would impact on gates at the ground, and so the BBC reached a compromise whereby they wouldn't reveal which match they would show until after the day's play had concluded. This arrangement remained in place until 1983. The programme proved so popular, it was switched over to BBC One in 1965, and has remained there ever since. The first Match of the Day broadcast in colour was on November 15, 1969 for the game between Liverpool and West Ham. Slow motion replays were introduced in 1971 but the BBC's monopoly on League highlights was being challenged by ITV, who started showing Sunday afternoon highlights in the regions in 1968. The BBC responded to 'The Big Match' over on their rival station by showing a second game on Match of the Day. Jimmy Hill presents an episode of Match of the Day during the seventies . In 1979, a new four-year deal saw rights split between BBC and ITV, and for two seasons in the early eighties, Match of the Day occupied a new Sunday afternoon slot before reverting back in 1983. Worse was to follow in 1988, when the BBC lost all rights for League football to ITV, meaning the Match of the Day name continued purely with FA Cup highlights. When England's leading clubs broke away to form the Premier League in 1992, the Beeb seized the chance to get back the highlights with Sky taking up exclusive live coverage. For the first time, Match of the Day showed highlights from three games plus the goals from the other matches for the first time. Commentator Barry Davies on the mic during a Match of the Day broadcast between Ipswich and Liverpool . A Match of the Day camera crew at Portman Road for a match between Ipswich Town and Liverpool . Premier League highlights have been on the BBC for the entire Premier League era with the exception of 2001-2004, when ITV launched 'The Premiership'. Their idea to bring Saturday night highlights to an earlier time backfired and ratings were poor. When the BBC picked up the baton again, they started showing highlights from every game with a commentator at each ground. The famous theme song was written especially for the programme by Barry Stoller in 1970. Previously, the intro had been 'Drum Majorette', written by Major Leslie Statham, the band leader of the Welsh Guards. Stoller's rather vague brief was to write 'something good' and he came up with a theme that is one of the most recognisable in the UK. ADAM SHERGOLD .

"Rising Labour star Chuka Umunna has claimed Parliament is 'quite a sexist place' – and complained about the number of people who cannot say his name properly. The shadow business secretary, tipped as a future Labour leader, revealed that he had heard female MPs being mocked about low cut tops and their appearance in the House of Commons chamber. He added that if he had taken people mispronouncing his name personally he would have gone 'insane a long time ago'. Mr Umunna dismissed claims he is preparing to throw his hat in the ring to take over from Ed Miliband should Labour lose the election – insisting he was 'dying' to win the election in May . Mr Umunna made the remarks after being mocked for referring to 'Worcester' in the West Midlands as 'Wichata' – a city in Kansas, 4,000 miles away in the US. Explaining the gaffe, the Labour MP said: 'I thought, my gosh, if I went as mad as everybody has gone about me mispronouncing Worcester when people mispronounce my name, I would have gone insane a long time ago.' The Labour MP for Streatham, south London, has previously said his name should be pronounced: 'Chook-ah. Uh-mun-a. Think 'snooker'.' Mr Umunna dismissed claims he is preparing to throw his hat in the ring to take over from Ed Miliband should Labour lose the election – insisting he was 'dying' to win the election in May. In an interview with Red Magazine, he said: 'It is quite a sexist place. You don't hear it on the TV, but some of the comments made in the chamber when some of the women get up and speak … . 'And sometimes there have been instances when – I think it's happened to female colleagues – they have been sitting behind the front bench and wearing a slightly low-cut top, and the whole of Westminster has gone mad about it, which is quite insulting.' Mr Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said he had overheard female MPs being harassed about their low-cut tops . The frontbencher, who was only elected to Parliament in 2010, dismissed criticism that he was too 'smooth'. He said: 'When I was growing up my father said, 'When you go out, dress properly and look the part because, before you open your mouth, how you present yourself is important'. 'And so, I don't understand all this 'smooth,' 'charming,' all this business, because it's like ... 'Should I be badly dressed and rude to people?' The frontbencher, speaking to the Women's magazine Red, also dismissed criticism that he was too 'smooth' Asked about his ambitions to be party leader, the shadow business secretary said: 'I don't really think about it. I'm just dying for us to win the general election.' Mr Umanna's father was a Nigerian immigrant who married a British solicitor after moving to the UK to start a business. But he was killed in a car crash in Nigeria when Mr Umunna - the MP for Streatham – was 13. Speaking about his father's death, he said: 'I've known fear in my life. I've lost a parent so I have a strong sense of my mortality. 'It was hard. And it happened when I was 13, so you have to grow up quickly. You've got to get on with life. The last thing he would have wanted us all to do is to crumble. 'He was a larger-than-life character, determined and focused. And I think that's where I get my drive from. 'He drilled it into me that if you want to succeed – if you want to do what I've done and come from nothing to be something and be successful – you've got to work damn hard.' Mr Umunna has also gone further than most Labour MPs attacking Ukip. He said: 'The things candidates for UKIP have said about people of colour and eastern Europeans, a lot of it is quite racist in my view.' The full interview appears in the March issue of Red, on sale 29th January. Also available in digital edition on Apple Newsstand. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has demanded an end to the 'sniping' about Ed Miliband. Lord Kinnock said attacks from the Tories were not as damaging as criticism from Labour allies. The intervention comes after two former Cabinet ministers Alan Milburn and John Hutton attacked Mr Miliband for running a campaign in Labour's 'comfort zone'. They warned it could lead the party to an election defeat like in 1992 when John Major defeated Kinnock's Labour. But Lord Kinnock said the Blairite attacks on Mr Miliband's election strategy had been 'so great that it requires a response'. He said he had received messages from Labour figures about Mr Milburn's attack 'to the effect of asking, ""doesn't he know we've got an election on?"" — in much the same spirit as people used to say, ""don't they know there's a war on""?' The peer added: 'The problem is never really the assaults from opponents. Certainly, it's not a problem by comparison with sniping from behind. That's a distraction.'","Shadow minister Chuka Umunna claims Parliament is 'quite a sexist place'

"Big cheese: Former grammar school boy Steve Easterbrook has become the head of McDonald's . He used to take the train to Harrow as an 11-year-old and eat in the local McDonald’s as a special treat. Now 36-years later Steve Easterbook is the first Brit to cross the pond and take over as chief executive of the fast food giant. Born in Watford, the 47-year-old takes the helm at a troubled time for the firm which has seen fierce competition from rivals deemed to produce fresher and healthier burgers. McDonalds saw its sales fall for the first time 12 years last year, and Easterbrook has been drafted in to mirror the turnaround he staged when running its European arm. The firm already to open fewer restaurants in regions with poorer growth. Born in 1967, Mr Easterbrook attended Watford Boys Grammar School and studied Natural Sciences at Durham University before qualifying as an accountant with Price Waterhouse. A father to three girls, by 1993 he had moved to work within McDonald’s UK finance department. Five years on he begun running restaurants and spent 18 months training in Chicago at McDonald’s Hamburger University. He said previously he had made ‘the seemingly illogical move in 1998 from a good finance role to becoming a McDonald’s restaurant manager'. But, her added, it was to be 'a move which opened up more opportunities from me than I ever would have imagined.’ Following a stint of management roles in Britain he became chief executive of the UK business in 2006, and was given responsibility for other northern countries within months. Retiring: Don Thompson will leave the McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, this spring . He became McDonald’s chief in Europe and the UK, overseeing 7,000 restaurants in 39 countries. Under his watch from its U.S. headquarters the firm introduced healthier menus, quality coffee and a new look for the company’s restaurants. He has said: ‘Money is not my primary motivator, but it is important to me to be rewarded fairly for the results that I help to deliver.’ Mr Easterbrook cites Warren Buffet as the person he most admires in business. ‘I’ve never met him,’ he has said. ‘But I love the simplicity with which Warren Buffet describes good and bad businesses and how he makes his investment decisions.’ In with the new: Mr Easterbrook replaces Don Thompson (right), stepping down after nearly three years .

In 2010 he became president of McDonald’s Europe but left the following year after the firm reneged on an agreement that would have seen him take a global brand role. He joined PizzaExpress as chief executive and then moved to Wagamama in 2012, before being rehired by McDonald’s in 2013 and moving to Chicago to take up that same global role. He was handed the top job on Tuesday. On being a leader he has said the best quality is: ‘Setting a clear vision, communicating it in a simple way and then giving people the confidence and motivation to get the job done.’ Mr Easterbrook replaces outgoing boss Don Thompson, who is due to retire at the end of February. While he is the first Briton to lead the company, he is not the first outside the US. Former CEO Charlie Bell was from Australia. Mr Easterbrook said he was ‘honoured’ to lead the company. 'I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with Don and congratulate him on his remarkable career', he added. 'I am committed to working with our franchisees, suppliers and employees to drive forward our strategic business priorities to better serve our customers.'

"The country’s biggest car park chain has been fining drivers for putting pay-and-display tickets in the wrong place on their dashboards, according to a Tory MP. Robert Halfon made the claim in Parliament yesterday as he called for an inquiry into the ‘disgraceful behaviour’ of NCP, which runs more than 500 car parks nationwide. The MP for Harlow, in Essex, said he had been contacted by commuters complaining about the actions of wardens at his local railway station. Private parking firms like NCP 'fleece' motorists unfairly, Tory MP Robert Halfon (right) told the Commons today . They had ‘fined people for allegedly displaying their ticket on the wrong place on the car’s dashboard’, he said. He asked William Hague, the Leader of the House: ‘Can you contact the transport minister and business minister and call for an urgent inquiry into this disgraceful behaviour by NCP?’ Mr Halfon said commuters had also complained about being fined for parking in a restricted area of the car park that had not been clearly signposted. ‘My constituents have been fleeced by NCP, who have signposted restricted areas improperly and then fined people who innocently park in them,’ he added. National Car Parks has been criticised in the past for high charges at hospital car parks and for increasing prices during big events such as the 2012 London Olympics. Mr Halfon said residents using the station car park had been complaining since December about being unfairly targeted by wardens. Despite paying for parking and displaying a ticket, he added, drivers were told the area they were in was restricted for the use of council staff, whose offices are nearby. ‘These aren’t people trying to bend the rules,’ he said after the debate. ‘Why would you park on the third floor of a car park, and pay for your ticket, unless you thought you could park there? 'They restricted this area and did not make it clear, and now the people who got caught out have contacted NCP and have heard nothing at all back.’ He added ‘a £50 fine is a lot for many people in Harlow’. Mr Hague told MPs parking charges at stations are a commercial matter and complaints are investigated by the Office of Rail Regulation, which was not available for comment last night. Mr Halfon called for an urgent statement in Parliament on on the role of private car park owners like NCP . NCP denied it fined people over the placement of tickets. ‘NCP accepts any ticket that we can see clearly,’ a spokesman said. ‘We have no policy on where or how it is displayed, as long as we can see it.’ Mr Halfon ‘has not made any comment to us of late regarding “wrongly placed tickets”. He has, however, contacted us regarding our bay line markings.’ The spokesman said: ‘On the top level of this car park there is a section designated for customers who pay for premium bay parking. 'These customers have paid for a designated bay and permit for their use when they park on the site; therefore we do patrol the site regularly to ensure that other customers who park in that area refrain from doing so in the future. ‘We have markings on the ground in front of all the bays that explain which spaces are restricted. 'There are also large yellow signs in place when entering the car park and a restriction as the deck area is entered. 'We have reviewed again all our restricted bay markings, which have been refreshed in the last eight weeks, and do believe these to be very clear. ‘We only issue (Penalty Charge Notices) if there is a strong reason for doing so, and always take photographic evidence.’ In 2003, motorist Vincent Ryan was fined £30 at an NCP car park in Ipswich for displaying his parking ticket upside down. The firm apologised and cancelled the penalty.","Tory MP Robert Halfon calls for urgent debate in Parliament on scandal .

"Senior Lib Dems have privately warned Nick Clegg will only be able to stay on as leader if he wins more than 45 MPs at the election. If the party falls below this threshold it will be too small to enter into Coalition with Labour or the Tories, MPs believe, leaving Mr Clegg’s position as party leader untenable. The Deputy Prime Minister is expected to ‘fall on his sword’ if he cannot lead the party back into Government after the election. But if he manages to limit Lib Dem losses to single figures he is almost certain to win a vote of the Parliamentary party to allow him to form another Coalition. One senior MP told MailOnline: ‘At some point it just becomes a matter of numbers. ‘You have to fill Cabinet positions, junior ministerial positions, select committee chairs – things like that – while also having places for MPs sulking or who don’t want to sit in Government. ‘It’s also about balance. You can’t have one massive party and one tiny party with little or no say. ‘If we do go into another Coalition then Nick will stay on as leader – he will have to. If we don’t, then the parliamentary party will have to talk about what we do. But will Nick want to stay? He will fall on his sword, is my guess.’ It comes amid revelations that Mr Clegg has given up on the idea of stopping Lib Dem president Tim Farron from taking over as leader if he is ousted after the election. The Deputy Prime Minister and his supporters had hoped that a leading contender on the right of the party like Danny Alexander could mount a challenge. But allies of Mr Clegg have told MailOnline that left-winger Mr Farron is 'unstoppable', and could mount a challenge even if the Lib Dems are returned to government in a new coalition. Some opinion polls put the Lib Dems behind both Ukip and the Greens, with experts predicting the party could lose up to half of its 57 MPs in May. Mr Clegg has vowed to lead his party into the election, and will refuse to step down if he gets the Lib Dems back into government, regardless of how few of his MPs survive. Party sources suggest he could even cling on for several months if the Tories or Labour can take power without the Lib Dems for a 'transitional period'. But hopes of a Lib Dem minister mounting a challenge against Mr Farron are fading fast. 'Tim is unstoppable now,' said one senior Lib Dem source. 'He is a relentless campaigning politician. 'He replies to every tweet, he speaks to every councillor, he turns up to every dinner. He's got the time because he has never had to run a department.' Scroll down for video . Mr Farron, pictured hugging Mr Clegg in 2012, is seen to have spent the last five years build support amongst the party's 40,000 members while others have been 'tarnished' while serving as ministers in the coalition . Mr Farron has previously been dismissed by some in his party as a 'cheeky chappie telling jokes about Margaret Thatcher and the miners'. But he is understood to have built huge grassroots support, unencumbered by taking difficult decisions in coalition. Supporters of Mr Clegg insist that if he gets the Lib Dems back into a coalition after the election, his position is safe. 'He will be able to go on and on,' said on MP. 'But that doesn't mean Tim won't try to find a way to position himself as a leader in the wings.' Mr Clegg had hoped that his close friend Mr Alexander would have been able to succeed him as leader, to prove the party was serious about being a force in government. Allies saw Mr Alexander as the standard-bearer of the 'responsible' wing of the party. Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has been considered to be 'on manoeuvres' for the last 12 months, raising his personal profile and distancing himself from Tory George Osborne. But he has a huge struggle to cling on to his own seat in the Scottish highlands, and has been tarnished in the eyes of many Lib Dem activists by his close association with Tory austerity. Allies of Mr Clegg had pinned their hopes on his close friend Danny Alexander as the standard-bearer of the 'responsible' wing of the party . Energy Secretary Ed Davey has already thrown his hat into the ring, declaring his willingness to lead the party if it 'falls' to him. He said it was 'not unreasonable' that he and others wold launch a challenge 'when Nick Clegg hangs up his clogs as leader'. He added: 'If one day it falls to me to lead it, then obviously, I'd like to do that.' But he faces a strong challenge from the Tories in his seat, and has failed to impress some of his colleagues. 'If Ed Davey didn't exist as a politician, no-one would invent him,' said one Lib Dem MP. Health minister Norman Lamb is also being urged by colleagues to prepare a leadership bid, but he and his wife are reluctant to embrace the degree of exposure the job would involve. If Mr Clegg is forced out, there is some doubt about who will be in charge in his absence. Sir Malcolm Bruce, the party's deputy leader, is standing down at the election so would not be in the Commons. Vince Cable, who was caretaker leader before Mr Clegg took over, was once tipped as a successor. Health minister Norman Lamb is being urged to prepare a leadership bid, while Energy Secretary Ed Davey has said he would be interested in the job when Nick Clegg 'hangs up his clogs' But his leadership chances suffered a fatal blow when his old friend Lord Oakeshott carried out polling designed to undermine Mr Clegg. Mr Cable denies having any knowledge of the plot, and friends say he has not spoken to Lord Oakeshott since. In a fresh setback, Mr Clegg sacked Mr Cable as the party's economic spokesman for the election campaign, handing the high profile role to Mr Alexander. It means he will debate with Mr Osborne and Labour's Ed Balls, with Mr Cable on the sidelines. Mr Clegg has refused to speculate on his future after the election, but insisted he had survived a barrage ofcriticism from all sides since entering coalition in May. Earlier this month he told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'Look I've tried to deal, with as much good grace as I can muster, all the criticism I get day in/day out, left, right and centre. 'It is unsurprising - if it wasn't me, whoever would be leader of the party - that you get that kind of incoming flack because what we're doing is deeply unsettling to the vested interests on right and left in British politics.'","Clegg will stay as party leader if he leads Lib Dems back into Government .

"Head-to-toe feathers, foiled onesies and thousand-pound dresses; it's just another day on the catwalk at Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week. Kicking off proceedings today was feather specialist, Serkan Cura, with a collection that wouldn't look out of place in Big Bird's wardrobe. The exotic spring/summer 2015 collection was certainly flamboyant and served up goose-feathered coats in an array of bright colours. But the daring designer didn't stop at just coats. Feather specialist, Serkan Cura, unveiled a collection that wouldn't look out of place in Big Bird's wardrobe today in Paris . Vibrant feather-covered boots, crop tops and shorts hit the runway, too. Gowns were inspired by the Charleston and came in fluffy ostrich feathers in bold reds, powder blues and mustards. The Belgian couturier and Jean Paul Gaultier alumni is best known for his fantastic feather creations but that's by no means the only material he can work with. The exotic SS15 collection  served up goose-feather crop tops, knickers and boots, left, metallic as well as see-through silver trousers and high-necked jackets, and even Barbarella-style foil metallic jumpsuits worn with embellished corsets and glam-rock platform boots . The flesh-baring pieces, fun feathered backpacks and sheer shirts wouldn't look out of place in Miley Cyrus's wardrobe . Elsewhere in his show, models wore metallic foiled jumpsuits, structured raffia dresses and sheer crop tops. Over at Zuhair Murad was a whole different story. The Beirut-based Lebanese fashion designer, who is loved by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Jennifer Lopez, sent models down the runway in beautifully embellished floral tulle gowns. The ethereal gowns, which were decorated with blush pink rosebuds and smatterings of sparkle, will no doubt be gracing the Oscar red carpet next year. The ornate gowns were sometimes slashed from the chest to the naval, but the long sleeves and floor-length hemlines kept a certain conservatism about them.

Watched from the front row by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and her husband, the designers aimed to capture the Goddess of Spring with a majestic collection that they say symbolised nature’s regenerative powers. For SS15, the Ralph & Russo muse is an 'exultant deity, whose gifts lend themselves to delight', they say. Acclaimed for its excellence in craftsmanship, the maison de couture aims to inspire with eye-catching embellishment, such as petal appliqué and pearl embroidery; the devil really is in the detail. The colour palette - crisp and most sophisticated - was full of pomegranate pinks, soft mints and cornflower blues. The collection, above all, aims to flatter the female form thanks to sheaths of organza, which promise to hug the figure in all the right places. The show saw the models metamorphose into fairies and nymphs, gracefully collecting blossoms in their structured collars or scattering buds into the folds of their gowns - and Mrs Fernandez-Versini seemed most impressed.

"North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il demanded $10 billion in cash and half a million tons of food as a precondition of holding a summit with the South . North Korea's former leader Kim Jong Il demanded $10 billion in cash and half a million tons of food in 2009 as a precondition of holding a summit with the South, a former South Korean president has revealed. Former president Lee Myung-bak said he refused to pay anything for holding talks, despite the fact one of his predecessors,  president Kim Dae-jung, held the first summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in 2000. Kim Dae-jung was initially credited with bringing in a period of warming ties between the countries, but that achievement was later tarnished by the revelation that he helped channel $500 million to the North. The two Koreas remain technically at war because their 1950-53 war ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Lee was president from 2008 to 2013 and says in his memoir, which is to be published next week,  in 2009 North Korea began proposing a summit meeting between him and Kim Jong Il. The proposal came after senior North Korean officials visited Seoul to pay their respects to the late Kim Dae-jung, who  won a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to reconcile with the North. His efforts were damaged when a close associate  was convicted in 2006 of pressuring the Hyundai conglomerate into sending $500 million to North Korea shortly before the 2000 summit. Kim Dae-jung's immediate successor, Roh Moo-hyun, met Kim Jong Il for a second summit in 2007. Lee says one of the North Korean officials who visited Seoul, Kim Ki Nam, told him that Kim Jong Il had said it wouldn't be difficult for the leaders of the two Koreas to meet again if agreements signed during the 2000 and 2007 summits were carried out. Five days after the meeting, Lee claims North Korea called for a 'considerable amount' of rice, fertilizer and other aid shipments in return for a summit. Ex-South Korea President Lee Myung-bak reveleaed the list of demands made by the North in his new book . Lee said: 'The document looked like some sort of standardized ""summit bill"" with its list of assistance we had to provide and the schedule written up.' Reuters obtained an advance copy of chapters on North Korea today. The book refers to a list sent from the North 'as a condition for a summit' that included 400,000 tons of rice, 100,000 tons of corn, 300,000 tons of fertilizer, asphalt worth $100 million and $10 billion for the establishment of a development bank in North Korea. 'We shouldn't be haggling for a summit,' Lee wrote. In the book Lee claims Kim Jong Il continued to push for a summit with the South before he died in late 2011, but it did not materialize because he refused to acknowledge a 2010 torpedo attack on a South Korean naval vessel. Lee, a conservative who ended a decade of liberal rule in South Korea, pushed Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons programme, left office without ever meeting the North's leader. South Korea's former President Roh Moo-hyun (right) and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il (left) shake hands at a welcome ceremony for Roh Moo-hyun in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, on October 2 2007 . Parts of the memoir reveal that senior intelligence officials from the two Koreas made secret visits to each other's countries to explore summit possibilities in 2010, when two deadly attacks blamed on Pyongyang killed 50 South Koreans. The Cheonan was torpedoed in 2010, killing 46 sailors. South Korea blamed the North which denied any involvement. Lee says a North Korea envoy who visited Seoul that year was later publicly executed after returning to the North. Both Kim Jong Il's successor, Kim Jong Un, and current South Korean President Park Geun-hye said this month they were open to the idea of talks. It would be the third summit meeting since the two Koreas were divided 70 years ago, although chances seem low as the countries bicker over the terms for talks. Last Friday North Korea demanded the lifting of sanctions imposed by Lee's government after the 2010 sinking as a condition for resuming dialogue. North Korea's current leader Kim Jong Un (pictured) who is the third son of former leader Kim Jong Il . The first summit in 2000 prompted an era of cooperation between the rivals, but also became a source of criticism in South Korea. Conservatives said Seoul's then 'sunshine policy' of providing generous economic aid to Pyongyang with few strings attached supported the North's nuclear and missile developmen and allowed it to continue staging provocations against South Korea. Lee halted such aid and refused to implement rapprochement projects signed in the second summit in 2007. His actions earned him public loathing in North Korea, where state media called him a 'rat' and a 'traitor.' Lee also saw tension spike sharply after his inauguration. A soldier killed a South Korean tourist in North Korea in 2008, and North Korea staged long-range rocket and nuclear tests in 2009. On the sidelines of a regional conference in Beijing in October 2009, Lee says Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao told him that Kim Jong Il had sent a message that he wanted a summit. Lee says he was willing, but didn't want to pay for the meeting and wanted the North's nuclear program on the agenda. Later in 2009, officials of the Koreas met secretly in Singapore, and North Korea insisted on economic aid in exchange for a summit. Prospects for summit talks were further hurt after a South Korea-led international investigation blamed North Korea for torpedoing the South Korean warship  in March 2010. The North then launched an artillery strike on a South Korean island that killed four people in November of that year. North Korea has denied involvement in the ship sinking. North Korea's state media did not immediately comment on the contents of Lee's memoir.","Former North Korea leader Kim Jong-Il made demands in return for summit .

"An NFL star who is used to working against opposing wide receivers now holds a world record more befitting of someone who works with a wide-angle lens. Arizona Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson set a Guinness World Record with 1,449 selfies in an hour while visiting Deer Valley High School in Phoenix on Tuesday. The 24-year-old defensive player took an average of about 24 selfies per minute during his record-breaking effort. Scroll down for video . Arizona Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson (sitting) set a record with 1,449 selfies in an hour . Peterson set the record (right) even though many of his snaps were disqualified for not meeting requirements . The shutdown corner set the record while visiting Deer Valley High School in Phoenix, Arizona on Tuesday . The previous record was a mere 657 snaps. His speed isn't all that surprising considering he already holds the NFL record for most punt return touchdowns in a single season. The fifth overall pick of the 2011 NFL Draft also has 15 interceptions in his four-year career. Students had only two seconds to pose with the former Louisiana State University player and Peterson was required to take every snap himself. Peterson was able to shatter the record even though hundreds of his pictures were disqualified because they didn't meet the selfie requirements established by Guinness. In order to count towards the record, the selfie had to show Peterson and another person. Each picture also had to feature the neck and head of the subjects as well as a portion of Peterson's arm. 'This is very tiring,' Peterson said while breaking the record, Yahoo Sports reported. 'Much more tiring than I thought it would be, but I'm having fun.'

"The co-pilot was at the controls of the doomed AirAsia flight just before it plunged into the ocean, Indonesia's lead investigator revealed today. The Airbus A320 vanished from radar screens in bad weather on December 28, less than halfway into a two-hour flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore, killing all 162 people on board. Second-in-command Remi Plesel was flying Flight QZ8501 prior to it crashing into the sea, not Captain Iriyanto - an experienced former military jet pilot - head National Transport Safety Committee (NTSC) investigator Mardjono Siswosuwarno announced today. Cpt Iriyanto, 53, is believed to have taken over control of the aircraft from First Officer Plesel when it started to ascend and then descend sharply, officials said. Captain Iriyanto (left) - an experienced former military jet pilot - is believed to have taken over control of the aircraft from First Officer Plesel (right) when it started to ascend and then descend sharply, officials said . Data from the black box flight data recorder has provided . the accident probe with a 'pretty clear picture' of what . happened in the last moments of the AirAsia flight, but . officials offered few details. 'The second-in-command, popularly known as the co-pilot, who . usually sits to the right of the cockpit. At the time, he was . flying the plane,' the investigator said, referring to First Officer Plesel. 'The captain, sitting to the left, was the pilot . monitoring.' Throughout his career as an engineer for the energy company Total, the first officer had wanted to fly, so a few years ago he quit his job and learned how to. He got a job with AirAsia, and at the time of the accident had earned 2,275 flying hours. His sister Renee, who last spoke to him on December 26, previously told France's RTL radio: 'Aviation was his passion and he was able to make it real. 'He told me that things were going well, that he'd had a good Christmas. He was happy. The rains were starting, the weather was bad, it was raining a lot. He was going to work the next day.' Indonesian officials examine the wreckage from AirAsia flight QZ8501 after it was lifted into the Crest Onyx ship in the Java Sea on January 10 . A coffin containing the body of a crash victim is unloaded from a military plane in Surabaya . The cause of AirAsia's first fatal crash, which occurred . about 40 minutes into the flight, is still unknown. Investigators said the cockpit voice and flight data . recorders showed that the plane had been cruising at a stable . altitude before the crash. The aircraft was in sound . condition when it took off and all crew members were properly . certified, they said. 'The plane was flying before the incident within the limits . of its weight and balance envelope,' investigator Siswosuwarno said. 'While the . flight crew had valid licences and medical certificates.' Indonesian officials previously said the aircraft climbed abruptly . from its cruising height and then stalled, or lost lift, before . plunging out of control into the sea. NTSC chief Tatang Kurniadi told the same Jakarta news . conference that Indonesia had submitted its preliminary report . on the crash to the International Civil Aviation Organization . (ICAO) on Wednesday, as required under global aviation rules. The report, which has not been made public, was purely . factual and contained no analysis, he said, adding that the . full, final report would take at least  six to seven months to complete. Second-in-command Remi Plesel was flying Flight QZ8501 prior to it crashing into the sea, not Captain Iriyanto - an experienced former military jet pilot . A total of 70 bodies have now been recovered after the plane crashed with 162 people on board . It was also announced that the search for dozens of victims . still unaccounted for could end within days if no more bodies . were found. A multinational search and recovery operation has led to the discovery of 70 . bodies in the Java Sea. It was hoped  more would be found following the discovery of the plane's fuselage, but days of rough weather and poor . underwater visibility hampered navy divers' efforts. Cpt Iriyanto was an experienced Air Force pilot who flew F-16 fighter jets before taking early retirement to become a commercial airline pilot. He had more than 20,000 flying hours, of which 6,100 were with AirAisa on the Airbus 320.","Second-in-command Remi Plesel was flying pane before it crashed into sea .

"Ronny Deila  has revealed that Celtic have drawn a line under the  — and insisted the Bulgarian will see out his season-long loan at Parkhead. Tonev will serve the second of a seven-game ban on Sunday after his appeal against racially abusing Aberdeen defender Shay Logan was rejected earlier in the week. Deila had previously suggested that, in the event the appeal was lost, the club would take the matter ‘all the way’ — leading to speculation that the next step was the Court for Arbitration in Sport (CAS). Celtic manager Ronny Deila said the club want to move on from the Aleksandar Tonev racism row . But although Celtic still plan to ask the SFA to review the level of proof required to find Tonev guilty — namely the balance of probabilities — the Norwegian feels it is time to move on. ‘We are disappointed in the statement,’ Deila said. ‘It’s nothing new, it’s word against word. ‘I don’t say anyone is lying. I just said we need more proof. It’s a hard and harsh decision to take, to say someone is a racist. ‘It’s just in a word, that’s why we support him and believe him. ‘We know there is nothing next. We just have to cope with it and go on.’ Tonev won’t be available for selection until the trip to Dingwall on January 24 but Deila foresees the winger playing a central role in his team from that day onward. Deila (left) said that Celtic supports on-loan winger Tonev (right) as there is no real proof of racist language . ‘He’s going to stay,’ he insisted. ‘We haven’t talked to them (Villa). Not me anyway. I don’t know if Peter (Lawwell) has. ‘It’s no problem to keep him for me. People can see behind things, that you need more proof than that to judge people.’ Meanwhile, Deila is preparing to sporadically rest some of his key players to prevent them burning out over the next year. The likes of Charlie Mulgew and Scott Brown won’t down tools for this season until after Scotland face Republic of Ireland on June 13. But mindful that pre-season training is likely to start around that date, Deila plans to follow Neil Lennon’s lead by giving some of his top performers mid-season breathers. Aberdeen's Shay Long accused Tonev of calling him a 'black c***' in their game at Parkhead on September 13 . ‘You have to think about the national-team players,’ he said. ‘If they play every game and we go through to both cup finals and do more in Europe, Broony, Charlie or Stefan (Johansen) will play in 70 games. Then you are on the edge of what people can handle.’ Deila also confirmed his squad will travel to Gran Canaria for an eight-day warm-weather training camp from January 6, with matches against Sparta Prague and PSV Eindhoven on the 10th and 13th respectively. Everton midfielder Francisco Junior is training with Celtic ahead of the January transfer window. The 22-year-old former Benfica youth had a loan spell earlier this year at Stromsgodset when Celtic manager Deila was in charge of the Norwegian club.","Aleksandar Tonev serving seven-game ban for abusing Shay Logan .

"Threats: Abu Rahin Aziz, pictured in Syria, told his Twitter follower to attack MPs and servicemen . A British jihadi who fled to Syria and joined ISIS while on bail for attacking a man with a pen has threatened MPs and servicemen in a string of sinister tweets. Abu Rahin Aziz, a former office worker from Luton, incited fellow extremists to carry out attack on the West using guns, bombs or even by throwing stones. He also insulted the memory of Alan Henning, the British aid worker murdered by ISIS, saying that he would 'burn in hell' because he was not a Muslim. Aziz, 33, who tweets under the name 'Abu Adbullah Britani', is an associate of hate cleric Anjem Choudary who was once a member of radical group 'Muslims Against Crusaders'. Last year he was sentenced to 36 weeks in jail for stabbing a football fan with a pen - but by the time the case came to court, he had already skipped bail and travelled to Syria to fight with other jihadists. He boasted on Twitter that he 'stabbed a kafir in the back of a head with a pen in London for insulting the propher Mohammed'. This week, he returned to the social network to incite violence from jihadis who are still living in the West. 'Muslims in the West given instructions to strike the enemies of Islam and Muslims within their own countries,' Aziz wrote. 'Wonder who will strike first? 'Could it be UK first to be attacked? They've attacked us with jets killing scores, plus they have many Muslims in prison as war on Islam. 'Maybe sit and wait outside TA offices? Maybe some other interests, maybe an MP. Hmm interesting. UK can blame foreign policy.' Tweets: Aziz, who calls himself 'Abu Abdullah Britani' onside, issued a series of sinister messages . A spokesman for the House of Commons said that MPs are routinely given advice on how to protect themselves against threats. In another message, Aziz wrote: 'A call upon Muslims in Europe to carry out attacks whether by explosive devices, bullets, car, rocks or even stones.' A separate tweet sent yesterday made a reference to Mr Henning, who was beheaded by the executioner known as 'Jihadi John' in October last year. 'All kufar [non-Muslims] even if they were good i.e. Alan Henning, Mother Theresa will burn in hell because they died upon disbelief,' Aziz wrote. Jihadi: Aziz has posted several photos of himself on Twitter dressed in military clothes and holding a rifle . He has previously shared photographs of himself holding up an AK-47 in front of a Syrian landscape, and pictures of other high-profile jihadis. Aziz also frequently posts links to news stories about ISIS on British websites, while yesterday he wrote an account of a bombing raid on a nearby building - claiming that he is protected from the US-led bombardment because he is living in a building with no windows. The whereabouts of his wife and two children is not currently known.","Abu Rahin Aziz, 33, posted a string of tweets inciting attacks on the UK .

"Midwives at a Welsh hospital were so shocked when they delivered a 12lb baby, they thought the scales were broken and weighed him twice to be sure. Staff at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff could hardly believe their eyes when baby Zack tipped the scales to nearly double the weight of an average newborn baby boy. First time mother Rhian James said: 'The midwife took him off the scales, re-set them and tried again, but they still showed 12lb - I was in disbelief.' Scroll down for video . Baby Zack, right, was so big when he was born that he would not fit into a newborn babygro, left . Rhian James, right, and her partner Anthony Nelms, left, knew that baby Zach, centre, was going to be a boy . But the couple from Llandaff, near Cardiff, did not expect baby Zack, centre,  to weigh in at 12lbs . Zack Logan James Nelms was born on January 20 at 11.21am, after a labour that lasted for nearly 20 hours. Father Anthony Nelms said: 'I saw Rhian holding him for the first time and it was the best moment of my life.' The couple were delighted to find out Rhian was pregnant, after losing their first baby just before Christmas 2013. Anthony, 28, a driver for Cardiff Bus, said: 'We were so nervous throughout the pregnancy. It was a massive relief when I first heard him cry - I was speechless and so emotional.' The couple, from Llandaff, found out they were expecting a boy at the 20-week scan, but had no idea he would be so big. Ms James, a senior support worker said: 'No one was expecting it. When they measured me, I was a normal size and they were expecting an average-sized baby.' Ms James did not have morning sickness or cravings, but did suffer from symphysis pubis dysfunction, which meant her pelvic joint moved, causing inflammation and pain. 'I had quite a lot of hip pain towards the end, which makes sense now, but apart from that, it was a great pregnancy,' she said. Baby Zack, pictured, was so heavy at 12lb that midwives weighed him twice thinking the scales were broken . Ms James is 6ft tall and weighed 10lb 2oz when she was born, while her partner Mr Nelms is 6ft 6in and weighed more than 9lb as a newborn. Both of Zack's grandfathers are over 6ft tall, so the pair were expecting a big baby, but were 'totally and utterly shocked' when his weight exceeded all expectations. Ms James was finally induced 12 days after her due date. She said: 'By that stage, I was feeling the size of a house. I just wanted him out. I tried hot curries and warm baths, but nothing worked.' The couple from Llangdaf, near Cardiff were especially pleased at Zack's safe arrival because Ms James had previously lost a baby Christmas 2013 . She was induced at 4.40pm on January 19 and when the labour did not progress, doctors broke her waters at 1am. 'I was still not dilating, so they gave me a drip in my hand, but they warned me it would make the contractions worse. Initially, I did not want an epidural, but after that, I was just happy to have the pain relief.' Zack was born seven hours later weighing exactly 12lb. The average weight in Britain is 7lb 8oz for a newborn boy and 7lb 4oz for a newborn girl. According to the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics, of the 33,747 babies born in Wales in 2013, a total of 71 (0.2 per cent) weighed more than 11lb. Records show that the biggest baby born naturally in Britain was George King, who was delivered at the Gloucester Royal Infirmary in February 2013, weighing 15lb 7oz . Ms James was kept in hospital for three nights and quickly became a 'celebrity', with midwives claiming they had never seen such a big baby. She said: ''As I was wheeled from the delivery suite to the ward, people kept stopping me and saying they could not believe I had given birth naturally. 'Doctors and nurses came to visit from all over the hospital, asking to see the 12lb baby, but I was quite happy to show him off.' Ms James is breast feeding her new baby but struggled to keep up with his insatiable appetite. The couple had bought baby grows in preparation, but said he is already too big to fit into clothes designed for newborns. Ms James said: 'I'm dreading the cost of shoes because he already has huge big toes. Anthony has size 15 feet and struggles to get shoes to fit. Life has changed completely. It has only been a week, but already, my life is all about nappies and feeding.' Despite a difficult labour, the new mum said she would not rule out having more children. She added: 'People say your second baby is often bigger, but I don't believe I could have a baby bigger then 12lb. I would do it - as long as I knew I could have an epidural.' Ms James said that for the first couple of days she struggled to feed Zack, pictured .","Baby Zack Nelms was twice the average weight of a newborn baby .

"A Star Wars collector has paid £18,000 at auction for a rare figurine which went on sale 35 years ago for just £1.50. The unopened Boba Fett character, a bounty hunter from the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back, was one of 85 figures put on sale by Star Wars super-fan Craig Stevens. The 45-year-old from Croydon, South London, has a staggering memorabilia collection of around 10,000. The figure was one of only a handful still in 'factory fresh condition' and attracted bids from around the world. Scroll down for video . Extremely rare: A Boba Fett figure (pictured) sold for £18,000 at an auction house in Teeside . In demand: The figure (pictured) was one of only a handful still in 'factory fresh condition' and attracted bids from around the world . Auction: The valuable Boba Fett figure was one of 85 put up for sale by Star Wars super-fan, Craig Stevens . Prized possession: Following the sale of the Boba Fett figure, Mr Stevens (pictured) said: 'I hope it will go to a good collector who will look after it and cherish it like I have' The anonymous UK buyer who bid over the internet must also pay 20 per cent commission to the Vectis auction house in Teeside. Following the sale, Mr Stevens said: 'I hope it will go to a good collector who will look after it and cherish it like I have. 'I'm amazed at the price. The money is going to go towards a house for me and my wife.' Mr Stevens added: 'Star Wars had a tremendous effect on me. I began collecting everything I could get my hands on.' The former chairman of the UK Star Wars fan club claims the Boba Fett figurine is one of only four or five in such pristine condition. Before the auction he said: 'This Boba Fett is in the original packaging in the UK, it is in factory fresh condition, so I am looking at £10,000-plus for this one figure alone. 'He is a very popular character, he had about three minutes of screen time and became a huge cult figure. It was only available in this packaging for a year.' Sold under the UK's Palitoy brand, the packaging is 'unpunched' which means the card had not been pierced to allow it to hang on a peg in a shop. Mint condition: The Boba Fett figure and this Darth Vader toy were among a handful that were 'factory fresh' and attracted bids from around the world . Vintage: Valuer Kathy Taylor said the figures, including this Yoda toy, came from the 'golden age' of Star Wars films . Staggering: The 85 figurines Mr Williams auctioned off are among the 10,000 he owns . Valuable: The Boba Fett figure (pictured) which sold for £18,000 would have retailed for £1.50 when it was released in 1980 . The toy would have retailed for £1.50 when it was released in 1980. A figure in similar condition would sell for around £50 in 1990. It was tough for him to part with the figure, as he was 'one of the children who queued up to see Star Wars when it was first released in 1977'.

"Powerful bursts of radiation may have wiped out life on the majority of other planets and even caused a major extinction on Earth, according to research. Physicists have calculated that gamma-ray bursts - caused by some of the largest explosions in the universe - may have prevented the development of complex life in 90 per cent of galaxies. The intense high energy radiation given off by these explosions is known to be lethal to even the most hardy of organisms and can strip away important gases in the atmosphere. Gamma-ray bursts, shown in the map above of the sky from Earth, could have left many galaxies sterile . The research may help to explain why we have yet to detect any signs of complex life elsewhere in our galaxy and could mean finding any forms of life will be far harder than some believe. The scientists behind the study also found that Earth may well have been hit by a gamma-ray burst powerful enough to cause a major extinction of life in the past. A gamma-ray burst happens when a . massive star dies, collapses into a brand-new black hole, explodes in . what's called a supernova and ejects energetic radiation. The radiation . is as bright as can be as it travels across the universe at the speed of . light. A planet caught in one of these bursts would lose its atmosphere instantly and would be left a burnt cinder, astronomers say. Scientists might be able to detect . warning signs of an impending gamma ray burst, but if a burst were . headed for Earth there wouldn't be anything anybody could do about it. However, astronomers put the chances of that happening at around 1 in 10 million. They calculated that there was a 50 per cent chance that such a burst took place nearby within the past 500 million years. They said that based on the latest measurements of gamma-ray bursts, much of the Milky Way - our own galaxy - would be inhospitable to life. Professor Tsvi Piran, a physicist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem who led the work with colleagues from the University of Barcelona in Spain, said: 'We find that the probability of a lethal gamma-ray burst is much larger in the inner Milky Way, making it inhospitable to life. 'Only at the outskirts of the Milky Way, at more than 10 kiloparsecs (32,616 light years) from the galactic center, does this probability drop below 50 per cent. 'When considering the universe as a whole, the safest environments for life - similar to the one on Earth - are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies, and life can exist in only around 10 per cent of galaxies.' Gamma-ray bursts occur around once a day from random directions and can be detected using telescopes tuned to detect these intense, bright flashes of energy. Trilobites like the one in the fossil pictured above were among the 80 per cent of species that were wiped out at the end of the Ordovician period in an extinction that is thought to have been caused by a gamma-ray burst . They can last for just a couple of seconds to several minutes. Their origin remained a mystery until about a decade ago, when it became clear that they are associated with supernova explosions - caused by a rapidly collapsing star as it forms a rapidly spinning black hole. The most powerful gamma-ray bursts can be seen throughout the universe as the radiation is flung out from the explosion. Gamma rays are thrown across the universe by supernova explosions, like this one in the Tarantula Nebula . If one lasting just a few tens of seconds were to happen close to the Earth, the power of the radiation would damage the thin layer of ozone that protects the planet from ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It would also trigger a chain of chemical reactions that could cause oxygen and nitrogen to bind together, creating poisonous nitrous oxide. Scientists believe that a burst with a brightness of around 100 kilojoules per square metre would deplete 91 per cent of the ozone within a month. This, they say would be enough to cause a massive life-extinction event. Some scientists have proposed that such an event could have been the cause of the Ordovician extinction around 450 million years ago, which wiped out 80 per cent of the species on Earth, the second largest extinction in the planet's history. At the time, Earth was dominated by molluscs and arthropods, although the first vertebrate fish were beginning to appear at the time too. Scientists have been using telescopes like this one on Mount Hopkins, Arizona to study gamma rays in space . Gamma-ray bursts, illustrated above, come from some of the biggest explosions since the Big Bang . Using data on the luminosity of gamma-ray bursts and what is known about their galaxies, Professor Piran and Raul Jimenez from the University of Barcelona in Spain calculated the likelihood of life surviving in other galaxies. Their findings are published in the journal Physical Review Letters. They found that the Milky Way is just one of a rare 10 per cent of galaxies - the larger ones - that would have the ability to sustain complex life. Professor Piran said, however, that it is clear that life can survive gamma-ray bursts - if the Earth was hit with one in the past. He said: 'Early life forms must have been much more resilient to radiation.' According to the laws of physics, the speed of light is a fundamental barrier that cannot be broken - nothing is supposed to be able to travel faster than it. So astronomers were left baffled when they spotted powerful flashes of energy bursting out from the heart of a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy 260 million light years from Earth. Measurements of this gamma ray 'lightning' showed it was travelling across the event horizon - the boundary where nothing can escape the intense gravity of the black hole - at rates that appeared to be faster than the speed of light. While the gamma rays appeared to cross the event horizon within just a few minutes, scientists estimated it should have taken light 25 minutes to pass that distance. This either suggests the gamma rays were travelling faster than the speed of light, or something else was going on. Researchers believe the observations have offered them a rare insight into something that is taking place below the event horizon of the black hole - giving them a glimpse of what may be going on inside.","Physicists calculate that powerful gamma-ray bursts regularly wipe out life .

"Coronation Street bosses have recast the role of Bethany Platt. Producers of the ITV soap axed 25-year-old actress Katie Redford last week after it emerged she'd lied about her age, pretending to be 19  so she could play the 14-year-old daughter of returning character Sarah Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien). Lucy Fallon from Blackpool, who is actually 19, will start filming scenes this week, just days after landing her first ever TV role on the Manchester based drama. Scroll down for video . Welcome to the family: Lucy Fallon can be seen alongside her  co-stars Helen Worth and Jack P. Shepherd in the first shot of the young actress in character as Bethany Platt . The blonde can be seen posing in the Platt household alongside her on-screen grandmother Gail (Helen Worth) and uncle David (Jack P. Shepherd) in a first-look photo of her character. Lucy said: 'Walking onto the set was surreal and nerve wracking but everyone has been really welcoming and I am thrilled to have been given this opportunity.' Teenage tearaway Bethany is set to return to the Weatherfield cobbles later this year. The character was last seen as a seven-year-old in 2007 when she moved after to Italy with young mum Sarah to start a new life. Lucy will make her first appearance as Bethany in late March when she returns to the street after fleeing Milan following a row with her mum. Katie Redford, 25, (left) was first cast in Coronation Street as the 14-year-old daughter of Sarah Platt, played by Tina O'Brien (right), who left the show in 2007  and will be returning in Spring . Despite being determined to drag her daughter back to Italy, Tina will be persuaded to stay in Weatherfield by her family. Corrie fans revealed the truth about Katie's age after discovering an old CV for the actress online, on which her date of birth is listed as March 2, 1989. However, her agent jumped to her defence claiming they'd advised her to lie if questioned as her CV states her playing age is 16-20. They shared: 'We said, ""If they ask, let them believe you are 19"" ... People do it all the time.' Producers decided to axe original choice Katie Redford because at the age of 25, she was just two years younger than her on-screen mother, played by Tina O'Brien. Soap fans unearthed a variety of evidence which reveals the actress's real age after ITV announced that  'Nottingham-born Katie, 19' would be playing the young character. A former online CV for the actress listed her date of birth as 2 March 1989 and her Twitter username has changed from 'katieredford89' to 'Katieredfordtlc' A former online CV for the actress listed her date of birth as 2 March 1989 and her Twitter username has changed from 'katieredford89' to 'Katieredfordtlc'. Public records also show that Ms Redford's date of birth is 2 March 1989 - meaning she would be 12 years older than the character in two months time. Fan Dave Harrison said: 'On her Twitter account there were pictures of the actress at her 25th birthday last year.' Cal tweeted: 'Why are all the press releases for the new Bethany casting saying Katie Redford is 19? She's 25 as she was born in 1989. #Corrie' Megan said: 'It's hilarious how ITV are desperately trying to remove all traces of Katie Redford's real age from the internet.' The actress's agent Jo McLintock revealed that ITV was not aware of her age and said Ms Redford was 'understandably' upset today. She said: 'Katie went in there acting as a young actress with a playing age of 16-20. ITV did not know her age. We were at fault as we let her go in there without the producers knowing her age. 'She is being re-cast and casting was adamant that they would not be using us again unfortunately. Ms Redford (pictured) starred in short film Turn Your Bloody Phone Off: American Blood as Janet . The young actress has appeared in comedy YouTube series 2 Girls 1 Flat (left) with Sarah Dyas . 'She is a brilliant young actress and very talented. We ill-advised her, but she just went in there and acted much younger than her age. Understandably she is very upset today.' Ms Redford trained with The National Youth Theatre and was nominated for Best Actress in award winning film, Pitfall at The Underwire Film Festival. The character of Bethany was previously played by three child actors - Mia Cookson and twins Amy and Emily Walton. Producer Stuart Blackburn said: 'Full of mischief and with a real lust for life Bethany is an unpredictable force of nature who will bring joy and chaos in equal measure, turning their household upside down. 'Life has just got a lot more interesting for The Platts and anyone who crosses Bethany's path.' A spokesman for ITV confirmed last week: 'Coronation Street have taken the decision to recast the part of Bethany Platt.' Coronation Street is now re-casting the role of 'tearaway teenager' Bethany who will be arriving unannounced in Weatherfield from her home in Milan in the spring .

"Mothers with 19 children between them who receive tens of thousands in handouts every year claim they are stuck on benefits and are forced to live off the state because they would be worse off if they went back to work. The women claim they have been told by Jobcentres there are no options for them because the cost of childcare for their many offspring would not be met by their wages. They live in privately rented homes which they are unable to pay for themselves and say they cannot get on council housing lists because they have too many children or face waiting lists running into years. Scroll down for videos . Clare Bache is a mother of seven and says she feels trapped on benefits and the Government should pursue absent fathers, she is  with five of her children - left to right - Huey, Charlie, Luke, Charlotte and Anthony . Each of the women will tell their stories on the Channel 5 documentary Benefits: 19 Kids And Counting The Cost, tonight. Clare Bache has seven children and receives benefits of around £35,000 a year but said she is stuck on benefits and believes the Government needs to pursue absent fathers rather than penalise single parents and think they enjoy living off the state. She said: 'Where can I get a job that earns me more than that?' Her six bedroom house in Birmingham is paid for almost entirely by benefits and she has not worked in 20 years. Ms Bache said anyone who believes living on benefits is easy is 'wrong.' She said: 'The hardest thing is being able to provide for my kids. I can't go out and earn that money. 'The fathers don't provide for their own kids. It's about time the Government cracked down on parents like that. It's all very well pointing a finger at single parents, but what about absent parents?' Struggling with bringing up and providing for seven growing children on her own, the 40-year-old admitted she owes about £12,000 in gas and electric bills, which she has avoided paying in various homes she has lived in. She is trying to get a debt release order to cover the cost, but she admitted 'otherwise I will keep avoiding it.' Lisa Rolfe is a mother of seven and claims the job centre told her it was impossible for her to get a job . Ms Rolfe said her partner Paul Orgill, who is also on benefits for his health problems, is the bigger burden . Ms Bache lives in a three-storey home which costs £725 a month in rent, which is paid for almost entirely by housing benefits. She complains about broken parts of the house - including a leaking shower, kitchen cupboards that are too small and half the power sockets not working. Lisa Rolfe, 36, is also a mother of seven and has an extra burden because she has to care for her partner Paul Orgill, who has health problems. Miss Rolfe’s children are aged between one and 19. Three are from her relationship with Mr Orgill, 40, who has now had a vasectomy to ensure they have no more. She lives with six of her children in a five-bedroom home which is full of gadgets, games consoles and six huge flat-screen televisions, while the seventh child stays with her ex-husband. Ms Rolfe receives £650 a week in handouts. She said her electricity and gas bills for the family run into £40 or £50 every week and they often have to resort to the emergency fund to tide them over for an evening - or at least allow her sons to continue to play their XBox. She said: 'We've got bills, bills, bills, bills. We never do it. We are always behind on something.' Despite this, they happily show off their gadgets, including an iPad and six TVs costing up to £1,100 each – although at least one is thought to have been bought by Mr Orgill’s parents. He tells viewers the items were paid for partly out of £20,000 compensation he received for a past incident. Asking them not to judge him, he says: ‘It’s taken a long time to collect all this nice stuff.’ Mr Orgill has not worked for ten years and spends his days playing poker in the hope he will win 'millions' Ms Rolfe, 36, said surviving on benefits is a struggle but it would be impossible for her to go out to work . In one scene, the house runs out of electricity, leaving the eldest sons distraught that their Xboxes do not work. In spite of these struggles, Ms Rolfe - who has not worked in 12 years - still does not want help to find work. She was asked to go to the Jobcentre about finding work but said they could do nothing to help her and branded the experience a 'waste of time'. Even before going, she said: ‘I don’t know what they are going to do. 'They are going to look into getting me back into work, which is absolutely impossible because I’ve got people to look after. Good luck to them.’ After the meeting, she said: 'They told me ""you won't get working tax credits, you won't get child care. We won't bother doing a job search, there's nothing here for you."" '""Come back when all your children are at school.""' Speaking last night, she added: ‘I was angry they couldn’t help. I filled out this survey about what I thought about benefits, and they asked us to be on the show. ‘I would do anything to help us get off benefits but there just isn’t the work out there.’ Despite having seven children, Ms Rolfe said one of the hardest things to do is look after Mr Orgill, who has trouble getting up the stairs and takes a cocktail of medication to deal with his health problems. The former lorry driver was signed off sick ten years ago due to arthritis and has since developed angina and type two diabetes. Of her husband, Ms Orgill said: 'If he was a horse he would be shot.' Ms Bache, 40,  said it is difficult to prepare and buy enough food for seven children and said sometimes it is cheaper to give her children, like Charlie (right) takeaways to meet the cost of feeding her huge family . Due to his disability, Mr Orgill is provided with a taxpayer-funded Vauxhall Zafira Tourer, adapted for his needs. He had to pay £200 with the rest of the cost, possibly up to £29,000, covered largely by handouts. He regularly plays online poker and says: 'I'm playing poker because there is nothing better to do and if I win millions I can come off benefits.' Mr Orgill claims he wants to work but his health problems - he has arthritis in both knees and ankles, has angina and has had a quadruple heart bypass after suffering a heart attack - bar him from doing so. He said: 'No one in their right mind would employ somebody like that.' Kailey Saunders is a 31-year-old single mum-of-five from Cardiff. She hasn’t worked for 10 years, receives more than £1,500 a month in state help and desperately wants to move into a council house with her family. She insists that single parents get too much undeserved stick. She has been waiting for a council house for five years. She said: 'I would love to have a council house so I could get my own job and provide for my children. I'm not a scrounger.'","Mothers with up to seven children each claim they are stuck on benefits .

"Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey (pictured) has warned that major economies are entering into a recession that will be remembered for generations to come . A hedge fund manager who made millions after correctly predicting the credit crunch has warned major economies are entering a recession that will be ‘remembered in a hundred years’. In a letter to his well-heeled customers, Crispin Odey predicted that ‘equity markets will get devastated’ and described it as the best time to bet on shares slumping in value since the recent financial crisis. Citing the current turmoil in the markets, including a dramatic slump in the oil price and a ‘faltering Chinese economy’, he said: ‘This downcycle is likely to be remembered in a hundred years, when we hope it won’t be rated for ‘How good it looks for its age!’. Oxford-educated Mr Odey is the founder of Odey Asset Management, which runs more than £7.6billion for investors around the world. As one of the most successful hedge fund managers in the UK, he has made a fortune from betting on shares in companies plunging in value. This is known in the industry as ‘shorting’, a process which involves borrowing shares and selling them in the hope that the price will fall and they can be bought back at a profit. Mr Odey, 55, was one of the earliest to forecast that the borrowing binge that fuelled the economy would trigger a financial crisis. But he came in for criticism when he was outed as one of the fund managers shorting the struggling Bradford & Bingley during the summer. The tactic was hugely profitable for Mr Odey, who paid himself £28million after his company enjoyed a bumper year in 2008. Despite the strong economic recovery in the UK, Mr Odey has grown increasingly gloomy over the last six months. In his newsletter to clients he warned of problems further afield, with the slowing Chinese economy dragging down growth in Australia, South Africa and Brazil. He said the fall in commodities such as oil, which has plunged from $115 a barrel in June last year to under $50, is ‘bringing with it pain to those heavily exposed’ – such as the Middle East, Venezuela, Argentina, mid-west USA, Canada, Norway and Scotland. Closer to home, he warned the European Central Bank’s drastic efforts to revive the eurozone by printing £45billion a month through quantitative easing, would fail to prevent a damaging downturn. He compared the combination of QE and negative interest rates to ‘pushing on a string’, and warned huge levels of debt to build up. Some of Crispin Odey’s critics might claim that he acquired his wealth through the misfortune of others. But in the rarefied world of the Square Mile, he is something of a legend. Born to a prominent Yorkshire family and educated at Harrow and Oxford, he turned his back on a promising law career to become one of Britain’s most powerful hedge fund managers. As early as 2005, he was gambling on shares in high street lender Bradford & Bingley going down in value – a bet which paid off when the firm was nationalised in 2008. And his private life is equally high-flying. He was briefly married to Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Prudence, before marrying Nichola Pease, a scion of the Barclays banking family. ‘My point is that we used all our monetary firepower to avoid the first downturn in 2007, so we really are at a dangerous point.’ he said ‘If economic activity far from picks up, but falters, then there will be a painful round of debt default.’ Last night one investment expert says it was difficult to ignore Mr Odey’s grim predictions. Mark Dampier, head of research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘Mr Odey can be wrong but he has also been spectacularly right in the past, including at the height of the financial crisis. He has built a hugely successful business, which you don’t tend to do if you’re wrong all the time.’","Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey warns of impending major recession .

"The barbaric execution of journalist Jim Foley was the direct cause of Sunday's release of a fellow American, Foley's editor believes. 'I don't know what was going through their heads but there can be no doubt they realized it was not in their best interests to be holding an American hostage at this time,' Philip Balboni told MailOnline. Peter Theo Curtis was released to UN intermediaries Sunday by the al-Qaeda offshoot, the Nusra Front. 'I think they made the calculated decision that the inevitable consequences of what IS had done to Jim would be visited upon them if they didn't make this gesture,' said Balboni, CEO of GlobalPost, the Boston-based website that Foley was working for when he was abducted in 2012. Scroll down for videos . Free: Peter Theo Curtis, pictured, was handed over to UN representatives on Sunday, just days after another U.S. reporter, James Foley, was beheaded by the Islamic State group. Philip Balboni, CEO of Global Post and Foley's editor, believes Theo Curtis was released as militants feared American military intervention . 'We are so relieved that Theo is healthy and safe and that he is finally headed home after his ordeal, but we are also deeply saddened by the terrible, unjustified killing last week of his fellow journalist, Jim Foley, at the hands of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, ISIS,' Mrs Curtis said. She said in the statement that she had gotten to know the Foley family over the months their sons had been captive. 'I have seen Diane Foley's bravery and her heroic efforts firsthand, efforts that helped rally the spirits of the families of all the journalists and others being held captive,' she said. 'We appeal to the captors of the remaining hostages to release them in the same humanitarian spirit that prompted Theo's release. The release came on the same day as a memorial for Foley was held in New Hampshire. U.S. officials declined to discuss details of the negotiations for the release of Curtis. It was not known what prompted Curtis' release, though his mother insisted no money changed hands, as some have speculated. 'While the family is not privy to the exact terms that were negotiated, we were repeatedly told by representatives of the Qatari government that they were mediating for Theo's release on a humanitarian basis without the payment of money,' she said. 'My entire focus right now is on helping the other families of those still being held in Syria, and on taking care of my son.' Footage released on June 30 shows a relatively healthy-looking albeit disheveled Curtis, who also goes by the name Theo Padnos. In the video obtained by Al Jazeera, Curtis read from a prepared script stating his name and profession, saying he was a journalist from Boston, Massachusetts. He said he had been well treated and 'had everything' he needed. 'Everything has been perfect, food, clothing, even friends now,' he said on the tape, according to the broadcaster. That account sits in stark contrast to the one told by his cellmate during some of his time in captivity. According to the New York Times, American photojournalist Matthew Schrier, who escaped in July 2013 after being held for seven months, described being tortured and starved by his masked captors. So desperate, Schrier eventually managed to crawl out of a hole in the wall he created by standing on Curtis' back and unraveling wires in a small opening. Safe now: Curtis, pictured prior to his kidnapping, is safely outside of Syria now with a UN representative . Missing: Curtis reportedly went missing in Antakya, Turkey, as he was traveling to Syria in 2012 . However, the heavier-set Curtis became stuck and chose to return to the cell where he remained for another 13 months. The pair were held in the rebel-held portion of Aleppo. U.S. officials declined to discuss details of the negotiations for the release of Curtis. It was not known what prompted Curtis' release. A cousin of Curtis', Viva Hardigg, declined to provide details on the circumstances of his release, but said he seems to be in good health. Hardigg told The Associated Press: 'We are deeply relieved and grateful for his return and the many people who have helped us secure his freedom. At the same time, we are thinking constantly of the other hostages who are still held and those working to help them be freed. We want to do everything we can to support their efforts.' Secretary of State John Kerry dubbed Curtis' safe release a victory for the U.S. and the journalist's family. In a statement Sunday, he said: 'Particularly after a week marked by unspeakable tragedy, we are all relieved and grateful knowing that Theo Curtis is coming home after so much time held in the clutches of Jabhat Al-Nusrah. 'For two years, this young American has been separated from his family. Finally he is returning home. Theo's mother, whom we've known from Massachusetts and with whom we've worked during this horrific period, simply refused to give up and has worked indefatigably to keep hope alive that this day could be a reality. Cellmates: Curtis, left, was held in a cell with American photojournalist Michael Schrier, right, who escaped in 2013 . Before: Curtis was originally from Boston but had lived abroad for many years researching the Muslim faith . Author: Curtis, right,who also goes by the name Theo Padnos, wrote numerous books about Islam . 'Over these last two years, the United States reached out to more than two dozen countries asking for urgent help from anyone who might have tools, influence, or leverage to help secure Theo's release and the release of any Americans held hostage in Syria. 'Every waking hour, our thoughts and our faith remain with the Americans still held hostage and with their families, and we continue to use every diplomatic, intelligence, and military tool at our disposal to find them and bring our fellow citizens home.' National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice said in a statement that Curtis is now safe outside Syria and soon will be reunited with his family. 'For two years, we have kept Peter Theo Curtis, a U.S. citizen held hostage in Syria, in our thoughts and prayers. Today, we join his family and loved ones in welcoming his freedom,' she said. Rice said the government had not forgotten the other Americans still held. There are believed to be four. '...We hold in our thoughts and prayers the Americans who remain in captivity in Syria,' she said. 'Notwithstanding today's welcome news, the events of the past week shocked the conscience of the world. As President Obama said, we have and will continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to see that the remaining American hostages are freed.' James Foley was beheaded by Islamic State militants who released a video last week blaming his death on U.S. airstrikes against their fighters in Iraq. Foley's captors had demanded $132.5 million from his parents and political concessions from Washington. Neither obliged, authorities say. For al-Qaida and some other militant bands, ransoms paid to free kidnapped Europeans over the past decade have surpassed donations from private supporters as a source of funding, according to the United States and Britain. The British government, like the U.S., adheres to a longstanding policy against paying ransoms to extremists. A senior Obama administration official said last week the Islamic State had made a 'range of requests' from the U.S. for Foley's release, including changes in American policy and posture in the Mideast. Mrs Curtis said her son went to Syria because he wanted to help the people there. 'Theo has a deep concern and regard for the people of Syria, which is why he returned during the war,' she said. 'He wanted to help others and to give meaning and to bear witness to their struggles.' She added: 'I am very fortunate that I do not have to tell his whole story. He eventually will be able to do so himself.' Curtis was born Peter Theophilus Eaton Padnos in Atlanta, Georgia, where his father, Michael Padnos, who is now a writer living in Paris, was working as a lawyer. He graduated from Middlebury College in Vermont, has a Ph.D. in comparative literature from the University of Massachusetts and is fluent in French and Arabic, his family said. He also speaks German and Russian. He first became interested in writing about disaffected youth while working as a teacher in the Vermont prison system, resulting in his first book, 'My Life Has Stood a Loaded Gun.' According to the family statement, while working as a journalist in Yemen, Curtis became interested in the stories of the many disaffected young men from the West coming to study Islam and he eventually wrote about them in his book, 'Undercover Muslim,' published in the United Kingdom. He changed his legal name to Peter Theo Curtis after publication of that book to make it easier to travel in the Arab world, although he continued to work as a journalist, writing under the name Theo Padnos. Curtis' family said he grew to love Syria and its people a decade ago while studying Arabic and Russian in Damascus.","Peter Theo Curtis was handed over to UN representatives on Sunday .

He said: 'We breed hens, so breakfast is usually eggs and bacon with a cup of tea. 'I was just making breakfast, I went to break my egg into the pan and lo and behold the chicken formation happened. 'I said, come have a look at this, by which point everyone rushed over and we were in fits of laughter, it was very amusing. 'We didn't show anyone to start with, it was just bizarre and one of those odd things that happens.'

"Aaron Hernandez's murder trial will begin today in Massachusetts - just days before his former teammates on the New England Patriots are set to play in the Super Bowl. There has also been some question as to how the trial will go, with his defense team successfully getting questionable text messages thrown out and barring references to Hernandez's possible involvement in two other murders. The prosecution however may have convinced the former football star's fiancee Shayanna Jenkins to testify against him for immunity it is being reported, as the prosecution believes she may have disposed of the murder weapon. As for the murder weapon, the prosecution also believes they have Hernandez on video holding the gun used in the killing moments after it occurred. Scroll down for video . As Aaron Hernandez's old New England Patriot teammates prepare for Sunday's Super Bowl, the former tight end is getting ready for his Massachusetts murder trial to finally start on Thursday . The prosecution however may convinced the former football star's fiancee Shayanna Jenkins to testify against him for immunity, believing she may have disposed of the murder weapon . This shot shows Hernandez holding the gun, claims the prosecution . A jury of 13 women and five men was seated by Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh on Monday after more than two weeks of jury selection. Six of the 18 jurors will be randomly selected as alternates just before deliberations start. Hernandez is charged with killing Odin Lloyd of Boston in June 2013. Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. He has pleaded not guilty. On Monday afternoon, Garsh continued to screen additional potential jurors in case one of the 18 seated is unable to serve. Sunday's Super Bowl will be the Patriots' first appearance since 2012, when Hernandez caught a touchdown pass in Super Bowl XLVI. At the time he seemed to be a man with a bright future. At age 23 he had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the team. At 23 Hernandez had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the New England Patriots, but then he was arrested in June 2013 and charged with murder . Hernandez is charged with killing Odin Lloyd of Boston in June 2013. Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee . He and his fiancee had started a family and were living in a mansion in the Boston suburbs with their 8-month-old daughter. At age 23 Hernandez had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the New England Patriots, but then he was arrested in June 2013 and charged with murder . But prosecutors at his trial will paint a different picture of him as a killer who orchestrated the shooting of semiprofessional football player Lloyd. He was arrested on 26 June 2013, just days after Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial park near his North Attleborough mansion. The Patriots cut him less than two hours after he was arrested. Hernandez, now 25, is also charged with killing two men in Boston in 2012 because he felt disrespected after one of them spilled a drink on him at a nightclub. He pleaded not guilty after being charged in those shootings in May, and the case has not yet gone to trial. Lloyd, 27, played for the Boston Bandits football team and was dating the sister of Jenkins. Prosecutors say he and Hernandez were friendly and had been at a nightclub together a couple of days before he was killed. Prosecutors have said Hernandez and two friends from his hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, picked up Lloyd at his home in Boston's Dorchester section around 2:30 a.m. on June 17, 2013. New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was arrested on 26 June 2013 and led out of his home in handcuffs and later charged in connection with the murder of Odin Lloyd . Those men, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, have also pleaded not guilty to murder charges and will be tried separately. From Dorchester, prosecutors say the four men drove to North Attleborough in a rented Nissan Altima, stopping along the way to buy bubble gum at a gas station. An hour after he left his house, prosecutors say Lloyd was dead, shot multiple times by a .45-caliber Glock. They have not said who pulled the trigger, but say Hernandez orchestrated the killing. The murder weapon has never been found. New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was arrested on 26 June 2013 and led out of his home in handcuffs and later charged in connection with the murder of Odin Lloyd . Prosecutors have said toll booth, video surveillance, GPS and cellphone records clearly place Hernandez in the car with Lloyd at the time of his murder, and have said video from the security system inside Hernandez's own home shows him walking through his house with a gun minutes after the killing. Christopher Dearborn, a professor at Suffolk University Law School, says that while the Bristol County District Attorney's office has a lot of circumstantial evidence, its challenge is to offer a motive to jurors. Prosecutors have said a possible motive was that Hernandez may have showed Lloyd the spot where the 2012 shooting took place. But Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh last month ruled they may not introduce anything having to do with the 2012 killing in the Lloyd murder trial. Aaron Hernandez #81 of the New England Patriots celebrates with his teammates after catching a 12 yard touchdown pass from Tom Brady during Super Bowl XLVI in 2012 . The lack of a clear motive is the biggest weakness in the prosecution's case, Dearborn said. 'You need to give a jury a reason why, or they're going to have pause,' Dearborn said. 'I don't think they have a motive that they can present in concrete fashion with witnesses that can support a motive.' Hernandez's legal team is likely to focus on the holes, Dearborn said. 'We don't have a weapon. We don't have a confession. We don't have eyewitnesses,' he said. Hernandez's team does not have to offer a defense or explanation, or even deliver an opening statement. But Dearborn said he expects to hear one. 'They will absolutely have to have their own narrative,' he said. 'That narrative will probably suggest alternatives.' Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee has been charged with perjury for allegedly lying to a grand jury — including when she said she could not remember what she did with a box prosecutors believe she disposed of after getting what they called a coded message from Hernandez. She has pleaded not guilty. In the run-up to the trial, Jenkins was often seen in court, and the judge this month granted a request from Hernandez's legal team that she be allowed to attend the trial to support him even though she is listed as a potential prosecution witness. But two days before the trial began, the district attorney petitioned the judge to grant Jenkins immunity, which would compel her to testify. The court has not said yet whether it was granted. Jenkins has not been seen in the courtroom since.","Aaron Hernandez's murder trial to start on Thursday in Massachusetts .

"Victim: Professor Paul Kohler, pictured outside court today with his  wife Samantha MacArthur, 50, has asked a gang of four Polish burglars to explain why they beat him in front of his family . A professor friend of Prince Edward left 'utterly unrecognisable' after being attacked by a Polish gang of burglars today asked them: 'Why did you do it?' Professor Paul Kohler, 55, suffered a fractured eye socket, a fractured jaw and a broken nose when the four career criminals beat him in front of his family at his £2million home in Wimbledon, south London last August. Pawel Honc, 24,  Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, Oskar Pawlowicz, 30, and Dawid Tychon, 29, are being sentenced at Kingston Crown Court in a hearing expected to last two days. All four men entered Britain despite having horrific criminal records and came to the UK because they believed its  wealthy suburbs were a soft target. The head of law at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London still bears the scars of the attack. Speaking today Mr Kohler, flanked by wife Samantha MacArthur, 50, who was also threatened by the gang, said:  'The attack on our home destroyed the calm of a family evening. 'We want to put this behind us and to do so successfully we need to understand why we were attacked. 'I consequently want to say to each of the attackers that, if you are genuinely remorseful, you will waste no more time in telling us, through your counsel if you wish, the real reason we were targeted. 'The pointless ferocity and utter senselessness endangered my family's peace of mind, my physical and our psychological well-being and risked fomenting issues within the wider community both in Wimbledon and beyond.' Mr Kohler said that although the 'mindless action of the perpetrators has undermined the security of what has been a wonderfully happy family home for over two decades' the family had no thoughts of moving. He also said that the attack had 'allowed some to push an anti-Polish agenda which sullied the name of a proud and honourable nation'. 'I would, on behalf of my family, like to finish by thanking our many well-wishers, both within and beyond the Polish community, and to stress that the actions of the perpetrators had nothing to do with immigration, and were simply an example of mindless thuggery,' he said. Scroll down for video . Injuries: Professor Kohler suffered a fractured eye socket, a fractured jaw and a broken nose in the brutal beating at home last August . In the dock: Pawel Honc, 24, and Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, were arrested at the scene and police found both covered in blood . Sentencing: Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, left, was captured a month later when police traced him to a property in Herefordshire and ringleader Dawid Tychon, 29, was arrested six days later driving a suspected stolen car . Images of the battered face of the law expert, a father of four and university friend of Prince Edward, shocked the nation as police mounted an international manhunt. Pawel Honc, 24, and Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, had been arrested at the scene when police found them covered with blood. Ringleader Dawid Tychon, 29, was arrested six days later driving a suspected stolen car – while wearing an England football shirt – and later linked to the robbery by his mobile phone. He was caught with a bewildering array of drugs, including cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines and other stimulants. Police also found a potentially deadly gas-powered flame thrower in the boot of his car. The fourth man, Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, was captured a month later when police traced him to a property in Leominster, Herefordshire. Matthew Buckland, for Tomaszewski, said his client admitted being one of the men who went upstairs and confronted Ms MacArthur. He also accepted that he had taken part in the attack on Mr Kohler by kicking him in the face. Mr Buckland said Tomaszewski believed that he was at Mr Kohler's address to 'enforce a debt' on the night of the attack. Ben Rich, for Pawlowicz, said that his client had not taken part in the violence and denied that he had been the one who threatened Ms MacArthur. He claimed to have been at the property to steal items including antiques and was one of two men who went upstairs, where he took computers. The court heard that Honc was a man of previous good character who claimed to have taken part in the attack to settle a drug debt he had with Tomaszewski. His lawyer, Rossano Scamardella, told Judge Susan Tapping: 'In short, he owed money to his co-defendant Mr Tomaszewski, the result of purchasing drugs from him'. Mr Scamardella said that had his client known that the targets of the raid were people who had 'nothing to do with the world in which Mr Tomaszewski mixed', he would not have become involved. Shauna Ritchie, for Tychon, said her client was also in debt to Tomaszewski, having built up a £600 debt with him for drink and drugs. Ms Ritchie said Tychon and Honc were terrified of Tomaszewski after he threatened to burn down their homes if they refused to take part in the raid. Family: Paul Kohler with his family. They were playing a board game when the raiders burst into their £2m home . Support: Mr Kohler with his daughters Saskia and Tamara. His other daughter Eloise was in the house at the time of the attack and called police to the scene . All four men were revealed to be career criminals and their ringleader was on the run from a Polish prison and had already served three sentences for a gun attack, theft, burglary and drugs offences. Professor Kohler was badly beaten when the masked gang burst into his three-storey Edwardian home in Wimbledon, South West London, on August 11 while his family were playing a board game. They pinned him to the floor and threatened to smash a heavy wooden cabinet over his head while screaming: 'Where's the money?' His wife was also threatened by two of the intruders, who tried to tie her to a chair with duct tape. The terrified couple were saved by one of their four daughters, Eloise, 24, who barricaded herself in her room and dialled 999. Officers arrived within seconds and arrested Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, and Pawel Honc, 23, who were both covered in blood. Police quickly discovered that the men were all career criminals who used their size and strength to overpower victims. None of the four, who all practised bodybuilding and martial arts, knew each other in Poland but they became friends through a heavy-drinking clique. Tychon fled his homeland in 2012 while on the run from prison where he was serving a long sentence for theft and burglary. His right hand man was football hooligan Tomaszewski, who came to Britain in 2013 after being released from an eight-year jail sentence. Labelled a 'very dangerous person' on police files, he is a dedicated follower of the Cracovia football club in Krakow, his hometown. Police suspect he was a member of a criminal gang associated with the club and is responsible for badly beating other men during street brawls. Shaven-headed Pawlowichz was caught on CCTV fleeing Prof Kohler's home and went on the run. The thug, from Tarnow in south-east Poland, has served two jail sentences in his homeland for violent assaults. Foreign offenders are able to walk into the country unchecked, commit new offences – then avoid deportation on human rights grounds once their jail terms are complete, spending watchdog the National Audit Office found. It said 1,400 foreign criminals are living here who should have been turned away at the border. Notorious: Career criminal Dawid Tychon . Each gang member was let into the UK despite a long criminal record. Here, we reveal the shocking scale of their offending. The Bodybuilder . Dawid Tychon, right, is a violent career criminal who masterminded the raid but tried to persuade police he was only the getaway driver. Wanted by the Polish prison authorities and at least two forces, the 29-year-old is a violent gangster linked to robberies, drugs and car crime. He has already served three jail sentences in his native country for an attack involving a gun, theft, burglary and drugs offences. Tychon, an unemployed labourer, revelled in his notoriety, flexing his muscles and wearing hooded tops for photographs he posted online. The soccer thug . Die-hard football hooligan Mariusz Tomaszewski fled Poland where police files described him as a 'very dangerous man'. He served eight years in prison for violent offences and arrived in Britain in 2013 to continue his life of crime while living with his pregnant girlfriend. Tomaszewski lost a job at Heathrow Airport after oversleeping on the first day and instead spent his days drinking and smoking cannabis. His ex-wife, who divorced him in 2003 and has started a new life in Austria with their teenage son, said she was horrified at what he has done. 'I knew that he was only recently let out of jail in Poland so for him to be back inside again so soon is crazy,' she said. The Henchmen . The final gang members Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, and Pawel Honc, 23, both have lengthy criminal records, police said. Pawlowichz, 29, who was caught on CCTV fleeing the robbery, has served two jail sentences in his native country for violent assaults. A brunette, who appears to be his estranged wife Eliza, posted a series of messages online after his arrest, including a social media 'status update' that read 'DEAD!!' Apparently referring to his crime, she added: 'When a person dies there remains after him on this earth nothing but the good which he did to others.'","Paul Kohler, 55, needed facial reconstruction surgery after raid in August .

"The Florida woman originally sentenced to 20 years behind bars for firing a warning shot to scare off her abusive husband given an interview for the first time since a plea deal allowed her to leave prison and serve out a 3-year house arrest sentence. Marissa Alexander told Anderson Cooper on Wednesday that, above all else, she was feeling relief she can now spend her life with her three children, including her youngest who was born just before she went to prison. 'When I left Rhianna, she was six months old,' Alexander told CNN. Now, she said, 'you can imagine the unbelievable joy of being able to see her...we're in love.' Asked by Cooper how she felt about suggestions that race and gender played a part in her original conviction, Alexander chose only to dwell on the positive. Focusing on her family: Marissa Alexander, freed after successfully fighting her 20-year conviction over shooting a warning shot to fend off an abusive husband, sat Wednesday for her first interview following her release. 'You can imagine the unbelievable joy,' said the mom of three who'd already spent three years in jail . 'I could go into it,' she said dismissively, 'but it wouldn't do me any good right now.' Instead, the focus for Alexander as she serves out her two-year house arrest is on making up for lost time with her family. 'She knows I'm her mom,' she said of her youngest, 'and I'm not going anywhere.' Alexander, 34, had claimed self-defense in her originally trial and her tough sentence was highlighted a year later as an example of the unfairness of Florida's Stand Your Ground law after George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin in 2013. On Tuesday Alexander was sentenced to the 1,095 days she has already served in jail after pleading guilty to three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon as part of a plea agreement for the 2010 shooting. She also received two years of house arrest. Applause erupted in the courtroom and once she was outside of the courthouse, Alexander read the following statement: 'Today, after the sentence given by Judge Daniel, my family and I will be able to move on with our lives. Free at last: Marissa Alexander walks by her dad Raoul Jenkins and is surrounded by her legal team and supporters after her sentencing in Jacksonville, Florida on Tuesday . 'Although the journey has been long and there's been many difficult moments, I could not have arrived here, where I am today, without the thoughts, many thoughts and many prayers of so many people who voiced their support and encouragement. 'Words can never express my gratitude for those who stood beside me, including my children and family. I am also grateful that Judge Daniel approached this case with such care and diligence.' The 34-year-old had faced 60 years if convicted at trial because of Florida's minimum-mandatory-sentencing law pertaining to firearm use. The jury at her first trial found her guilty after deliberating for just 12 minutes. The verdict was thrown out after a judge ruled the trial court incorrectly required Alexander to prove she was abused by her husband. Marissa Alexander, pictured in court on Tuesday, had claimed self-defense after prosecutors say she fired a gun at her estranged husband and his two sons, has been released from prison as part of a plea agreement for time served . Although no one was injured in Alexander's case, the court gave her a 20-year prison sentence in 2012 under the state's mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines because she had fired a gun during the assault . For the next two years Alexander must wear a GPS ankle monitor and will only be allowed to leave her home to go to work, job interviews, church, family medical and dental appointments, and to visit her children's schools. She'll have to get a judge's permission to do anything else. 'It's hard to get a job, it's hard to get housing, it's hard to qualify for anything. Her life has been destroyed for this,' supporter Denise Hunt told News4JAX. Alexander’s case had drawn criticism from civil rights groups concerned about self-defense laws and mandatory minimum sentencing rules, but it received little attention outside north Florida until the Zimmerman case. Although no one was injured in Alexander's case, the court gave her a 20-year prison sentence under the state's mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines because she had fired a gun during the assault. A state appeals court ruled in September that Alexander, who is black, deserved a new trial because the judge failed to properly instruct the Jacksonville, Florida jury about her self-defense argument. She was convicted in May 2012. Marissa Alexander's tough sentence was highlighted as an example of the unfairness of Florida's Stand Your Ground law after George Zimmerman, right, was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin, left, in 2013 . Zimmerman was arrested for killing Trayvon Martin in 2012 and was acquitted of murder and manslaughter in July 2013. Under the so-called Stand Your Ground clause which was added to Florida's self-defense law in 2005, people who use deadly force to defend themselves from serious injury - rather than retreating to avoid confrontation - can be immune from prosecution. Zimmerman never sought immunity under Stand Your Ground, instead relying on a standard self-defense law. Alexander, who had never been arrested before, said she fired a bullet to scare off her husband when she felt he was threatening her. No one was hurt, but the judge in the case said he was bound by state law to sentence her to 20 years in prison after she was convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Alexander's Stand Your Ground claim was rejected because she left the house during the confrontation to retrieve a gun from her car, returning to fire a shot near her husband Rico Gray's head. Alexander and abusive husband Rico Gray had a daughter together who is now 4-years-old, right, while she also has two teenage children as well . For the next two years Alexander must wear a GPS ankle monitor and will only be allowed to leave her home to go to work, job interviews, church, family medical and dental appointments, and to visit her children's schools . A slightly built woman who stands 5 feet 2 inches, Alexander said her 245-pound husband was about to attack her when she fired into a kitchen wall during the August 2010 incident. He had previously been convicted of domestic violence for attacking her. Prosecutors said the shot endangered Gray. At the time, Alexander had an active restraining order against her husband and she carried a concealed weapons permit. State Attorney Angela Corey, who oversaw the prosecution of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, has stood by the handling of Alexander's case. Corey said she believes that Alexander aimed the gun at the man and his two sons, and that the bullet she fired could have ricocheted and hit any of them. 'I look forward to the full-time challenge of getting my two teenagers through high school and into college, as well we preparing my 4-year-old daughter for nursery school. My goal is to continue my education beyond my master's degree and to continue my professional career,' said Alexander in her statement following Tuesday's release. 'Also, I will continue to learn lessons from the events of the past, but I will not live in the past. At the age of 34, life is too short and there's too much I have to accomplish in the years ahead. It's my hope and prayer that everyone associated with this case will be able to move on with their lives.' Alexander said she was now looking forward to the full-time challenge of getting her two teenagers through high school and into college, as well we preparing her 4-year-old daughter for nursery school .","Mother-of-three Marissa Alexander was free to walk out of court on Tuesday after receiving two years house arrest as part of a plea deal .

"The European Court of Human Rights today  backed the extradition of a paranoid schizophrenic man accused of setting up a jihadist training camp in the United States under orders from Abu Hamza. Haroon Aswat, 40, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was extradited from Britain to the United States in October after the US government gave assurances about his treatment. Lawyers for Aswat had said that the assurances, which led the High Court and ECHR to lift a block on his extradition, were 'inadequate' and his removal breached Article 3 - prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment - of the European Convention on Human Rights. Radical cleric Abu Hamza pictured in 1999 with Haroon Aswat (right) who was extradited from Britain to the United States in October to face terror charges after the US government gave assurances about his treatment . Aswat's extradition was blocked in April 2013 by ECHR judges who ruled that he could face inhumane treatment as there were no guarantees over where he would be detained. Home Secretary Theresa May was told to put extradition plans on hold after High Court judges heard that Aswat suffered from serious mental illness. But in September judges at the same court said they were satisfied with assurances given by American officials that he would be cared for, and he was finally extradited in October. The European Court of Human Rights today formally reversed its decision, saying the move was legal and it was satisfied Aswat was receiving 'appropriate treatment' in the US. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg (pictured) today reversed its decision, saying it was satisfied Aswat was receiving 'appropriate treatment' in the US following his extradition in October . Judges said the case was inadmissible, calling it 'manifestly ill-founded' and upheld the High Court's decision, writing: 'In considering Mr Aswat's specific complaints, the court found that the assurances given by the United States government ensured that Mr Aswat would be given treatment appropriate to his mental health needs. 'The court found that there was no persuasive evidence before it to suggest that he would not receive adequate treatment in the United States to control his mental illness, or that he would be detained in circumstances which would place him at risk of a mental health relapse so as to render his extradition in breach of Article 3.' Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) was initally told to put extradition plans on hold after High Court judges heard Aswat had a serious mental illness . Aswat is accused of setting up a training camp in Bly, Oregon in the United States between June 2000 and December 2001 for people wanting to fight in Afghanistan. Aswat, who was originally arrested in 2005, was held at Broadmoor psychiatric hospital before he was sent to the US. He is said to have acted under orders from radical British preacher Abu Hamza, who was himself extradited to the US and last year convicted on 11 kidnapping and terrorism charges. Aswat pleaded not guilty to four counts of conspiracy and providing material support to Al-Qaeda in a New York court in October. His trial is due to begin in June and he faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted. Aswat was arrested in 2005 in Zambia, extradited to Britain and moved to a psychiatric hospital in 2008 until being sent to the US. After travelling to Bly, US officials say he spent two months in Seattle living at a mosque where he witnessed men being given additional coaching on how to handle weapons. They say that documents recovered by FBI agents from a safe house used by 9/11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in Pakistan listed a number of individuals associated with Al-Qaeda, including Aswat. Hamza, previously of north London, was jailed for life earlier this month after a jury last year found him guilty of supporting terrorist organisations, including aiding the taking of hostages in Yemen and seeking to set up an al Qaida training camp in the US.","Paranoid schizophrenic Haroon Aswat was extradited to US in October .

"By SAM TAYLOR FOR THE DAILY MAIL . According to the fairy tale, the test of a true princess was whether she could detect a pea hidden beneath a pile of 20 mattresses and eiderdowns. Today, peas are out and thread counts are in. The higher the better. But what does it really mean? Technically, the term ‘thread count’ refers to the number of threads woven together in one square inch of fabric. Manufacturers count them both horizontally and vertically across this little square. The idea is, the more threads they cram in, the more luxurious the sheet. Yet, this is not always an exact indicator of quality. Some manufacturers ‘cheat’ by counting the strands that make up an individual thread as additional threads, meaning a thread count of 600 might really be just 300, low-quality double-ply threads. Scroll down for video . Sam Taylor (pictured) puts all the different bed linens to the test to see whether a higher thread count really does make a difference . Other factors include finish and tightness of weave. For example, sateen is cotton yarn woven like satin for a lustrous sheen, while percale is a closely woven thread-count of more than 200. Sam Taylor tests what the High Street has to offer... LIKE FLOATING ON SILK . John Lewis: Genuisa cotton double fitted sheet, 100 per cent cotton, 1,000 thread sateen, £110 . I grew up with a mother reared on rationing and devoted to keeping things for ‘best’: crockery, cutlery, glasses, tablecloths and bed linen, the ‘best’ cupboard was packed with things that were put away and never used. This sheet would certainly have been consigned to her Aladdin’s cave. The packaging describes Geniusa as offering fibres that are longer and finer than anything else. Without an industrial strength magnifying glass, it is impossible to tell, but certainly the sateen cotton feels thick and sumptuous — and you can’t see the mattress cover through it. The elasticated corners are generous, which means no stretching and the pillowcases are like resting on silk. 5/5 . SLEEK AND NO IRONING! M&S: Supima cotton double fitted sheet, 100 per cent cotton, . 600 thread sateen, £70 . If you have children in the house, oversleeping is something that happens to other people. But this sheet could shake things up a bit. Sam Taylor (pictured) rated the M&S: Supima cotton double fitted sheet at 4/5, praising it for it's impressive non-iron finish . The packaging claims it will deliver the perfect night’s sleep — and it certainly does. Getting out of bed was very difficult and I dreamt of going back to it even more than I usually do. Once on, the sheet looks impressive and having a non-iron finish just adds to its appeal. It also has the added benefit of a 10 in overhang on the edges — which means no nasty gaps on the side, even on a deep-filled mattress. 4/5 . A LITTLE BIT ITCHY AND SCRATCHY . Primark Home: Basic flat double sheet, 50 per cent cotton, 50 per cent polyester . No thread count, £8 . When polyester was first invented in the Forties, it was heralded as a miracle fibre. There was little it couldn’t do — except convince us that it was a luxury item. It was always a bit scratchy and it still is. Primark’s 50/50 cotton and polyester mix is almost transparently thin. No matter which way I lay, it made me itch and overheat, an unwanted extra for the menopausal woman. That said, the manufacturers made no claims for its slumber properties or its deluxe appeal. It is a sheet. Or more accurately, a dust sheet. But at little more than the price of a couple of cappuccinos, it seems churlish to complain. 2/5 . FIT FOR A QUEEN . Dorma: Fitted double sheet, 100 per cent cotton sateen, . 350 thread count, £23.99 . Sheet makers to the Queen and the Prince of Wales, Dorma simply don’t make sheets that are below 200 thread. Since 1921, they have been producing top-drawer bed linen and pride themselves on giving you that extra edge over the neighbours on the washing line. Sam says the Dorma: Fitted double sheet is fit for a Queen and allows coverage for even the deepest mattress . The 350 thread, double sheet is one of their biggest sellers. It’s not difficult to see why. Part of their indulgent range of luxury bedding, it is fit for a Queen who has never knowingly wasted money. It is 14in deep which allows for coverage of even the deepest mattress, perhaps even two mattresses, and the pillowcases are as crisp after five nights as they are after one. 4/5 . SHINY AND VERY SLIPPERY . The White Company: Brompton flat double sheet, 100 per cent cotton, . 300 thread sateen, £68 . Coloured bits around the borders of sheets and pillowcases have always made me anxious and the silver streaks that define the Brompton collection fall into that category. Like most of the sheets I was testing, it has a sateen finish, but set against the almost neon finish white dye used on this range, it gives it a reflective quality that makes the bed look like something off Star Trek. In fact, so shiny is it that it works like a mirrored ceiling in reverse. The experience of sleeping was so slippery that at some point in the night I subconsciously started holding on to the edge of the bed. 3/5 . COSTS MORE THAN A FLIGHT TO PARIS . House of Fraser: Luxury Hotel Collection single fitted sheet, 100 per cent cotton, 500 thread sateen, £140 . All daughters believe they are princesses and mine is no exception, so the chance to upgrade her single bed linen to something that costs more than a flight to Paris was very appealing. Sam says although the £140 sheets from House of Fraser: Luxury Hotel Collection are luxurious they're not quite worth the money . I approached this test with the question of wondering quite who would spend this amount of money on a single sheet. In fact, who would spent this amount on any sheet? True, it does deliver a relaxed and warm night’s slumber as the cotton is very dense, which makes it feel toasty. It’s luxurious, but I think I’d rather wait for the sale. 3/5 . PERFECT FOR PICKY MOTHER-IN-LAWS . John Lewis: Cotton and Percale, 100 per cent Egyptian cotton, 400 thread count, £40 . The guest room often gets overlooked on the bed linen department. When VIP guests go to stay in the White House, the sheets are ironed six times before being put on the bed. This doesn’t happen in our home, which is probably why we don’t have many VIP visitors. The matt finish of the John Lewis: Cotton and Percale gives a classy look and feel, making it seem more expensive than it is . However, this sheet could change all that. The percale weave gives it a matt finish, which immediately makes it look and feel very classy — more like an expensive linen than a mid-market cotton. The ivory colouring is very flattering against the skin; past 50 everything helps. And it gives the illusion you have thought about the picky relatives, even if you can’t wait for them to leave. 4/5 . STUDENT-PROOF . Tesco: Double fitted sheet, 100 per cent Egyptian cotton, 200 thread count, £12 . The majority of us will spend a third of our lives asleep — if you discount some students who notch up another three years in a virtual coma. They leave home with a bag full of freshly laundered towels and sheets and return a couple of months later with a putrid, foul-smelling laundry bag no detergent can bring to heel. So why waste money on them? This sheet is comfortable, the cotton isn’t too thin and it promises longer lasting durability. It also requires minimal ironing and suggests that it can be washed at lower temperatures unless it is dirty. Which of course, it will be. 3/5 . BEST-KEPT BOUDOIR SECRET . Primark Home: Luxury double fitted sheet, 100 per cent cotton, 200 thread count, £9.50 . I have to confess that I had never been to Primark before taking this test. What have I been doing with my life? No wonder I have no money. Where they failed miserably on their mixed cotton and polyester sheet, Primark Home have won the crown with this luxury (for them) offering. It’s a plain, white, soft, matt finish, generously cut, fitted sheet that could hold its own in the smartest houses. Yes, it’s a mere 200 thread, but who’s counting? It’s £9.50 and it feels like ten times that price. Even my husband, Mark, noticed the difference and this is a man who prides himself on once failing to spot that I had a leg in plaster. 5/5 .","Sam Taylor puts thread count to the test in today's challenge .

'Harold, no disrespect to your courtroom, but I'm not staying here with that media,' he said, according to WLKY-TV. Scroll down for video . Dalton Hayes, 18, refused to stay in court when he spotted TV cameras during his hearing on Wednesday . The judge allowed Hayes to leave the Grayson County, Kentucky, courtroom and continued the hearing after a short discussion with the teen's lawyer about a mental competency hearing. Hayes' defense lawyer has argued that the teen is not mentally competent to stand trial. He will appear in court again on February 5 following a mental evaluation. Hayes is accused of custodial interference, second-degree rape, theft by unlawful taking, burglary, criminal trespassing and criminal mischief after a nearly two-week crime spree with his 13-year-old girlfriend that spanned from Kentucky to Florida. Hayes ran away with his 13-year-old girlfriend and allegedly went on a multi-state crime spree before the two were caught in Florida . The brazen nature of the alleged crimes and the age of the two teens involved caused national media attention. Hayes and his girlfriend were caught in Panama City Beach, Florida, on January 18. Hayes was extradited back to Kentucky to stand trial. The girl was sent back to her father - from whom she ran away. The girl's mother, Sherry Peters, faces charges of custodial interference after she allegedly picked the girl up from her father's house - even though she has no parental rights.","Dalton Hayes, 18, walked out of a Grayson County courtroom when he spotted news cameras .

"Charles Townes, who shared . the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for revolutionary invention of the laser,  has died at age 99. Townes, a native of South Carolina, recalled that the idea . for how to create a pure beam of short-wavelength, . high-frequency light first dawned on him as he sat on a . Washington, D.C., park bench among blooming azaleas in the . spring of 1951. The thought would later turn into a feat that forever changed science, medicine, telecommunications and entertainment. Scroll down for videos . Charles Townes invented the maser, a laser precursor, in the 1950s (left) while at Columbia University. He later went on to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964 and the Templeton Prize for advancing life's spiritual dimension in 2005 (right) The revelation led Mr Townes and his students to build a device . in 1954 they dubbed a maser, which stood for microwave amplification by . stimulated emission of radiation. Four years later, he and a brother-in-law, Arthur Schawlow, . conceived of a variation on that invention to amplify a beam of . optical light, instead of microwave energy, and Bell . Laboratories patented the new idea as a laser. The scientist died early Tuesday morning while heading to the hospital from his Oakland home, the University of California at Berkeley reported. Another scientist, Theodore Maiman, was the first to . demonstrate the first actual laser in 1960. Lasers use synchronized wavelength of one color of light to create a focused beam in contrast to spread out normal light . But four years . later, Townes shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work . with two Russians, Aleksandr Prokhorov and Nikolai Basov, who . independently came up with the idea for a maser. Mr Townes went on to pioneer the use of masers and lasers in . astronomy. With the help of colleagues he became the first to . detect complex molecules in interstellar space and first . measured the mass of the giant black hole at the center of our galaxy, the . Milky Way, which he discovered in 1985. Mr Townes spent nearly 50 years with the University of California, Berkeley's physics department . An array of laser-based infrared telescopes he built at the . Mt Wilson observatory outside Los Angeles can measure the . diameter of stars that appear as mere points of light in most . telescopes. ""He was one of the most important experimental physicists of . the last century,"" astrophysicist Reinhard Genzel, director of . the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, said in a . profile of Townes published by UC Berkeley. A professor emeritus at Berkeley, Mr Townes first came to the university in 1967 and spent time on campus as recently as last year. He attended Furman University, Duke University and California Institute of Technology, where he studied under renown physicists J. Robert Oppenheimer and Robert A. Millikan, according to the Los Angeles Times. He worked Bell Labs in New Jersey during World War II before joining the faculty at Columbia University, where he did much of his original work with lasers. Mr Townes's invention turned out to have roles in a wide range . of technical applications that have become ubiquitous fixtures . of the modern world. Incorporated into a broad variety of . consumer electronics and optical fibers, lasers also are used to . cut metal, perform surgery, trap atoms and trigger nuclear . fusion reactions. Throughout his prestigious work in science, Mr Townes remained deeply spiritual. He wrote that instead of religion being separate from science, faith in an orderly universe is what allowed humanity to move 'age of superstition to an age of science'. In addition to his scientific honours, he won the Templeton Prize in 2005 for advancing knowledge in spiritual matters. Previous winners include Mother Teresa and the Dalai Lama. Mr Townes is survived by his wife, four daughters, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Electrons enter an excited state after being exposed to energy often in the form of light flashes, which cause them to shift their positions within an atom and emit photons, or light particles. The emitted light particles are all the same wavelength (meaning they are the same color) and the crests and troughs of the different photon wavelengths all match up to each other. One photon from an excited atom then triggers more atoms to be excited and creates a larger number of photons, stimulating more emission of radiation. The atoms and their photons are often trapped inside a tube with two mirrors at the end, keeping the photons bouncing back and forth and making more photons of the same wavelength. A small hole in one side of the tube allows some photons to escape, releasing a concentrated beam of colored light.","South Carolina native died en route from home to hospital in Oakland .

"Three American contractors have been shot dead by an Afghan soldier during an apparent 'insider attack' in the capital of Kabul. The shooting by a man believed to be wearing a military uniform unfolded Thursday evening at the military base inside the North Kabul International Airport complex. The victims, who were employed under a US Defense Department contract to help train the Afghan air force, died from gunshot wounds. 'Insider attack': The three American contractors employed by the Department of Defense were killed by an Afghan solider in the military based of the North Kabul International Airport complex (file picture) A fourth American man was injured and an Afghan national was also killed in the incident. 'Insider attacks' by Afghan security forces have been on the rise in recent years and have led to the deaths of 142 people. Western troops and civilians training Afghan security forces have faced lethal assaults from Afghans in uniform who turn their guns on their counterparts. They have had a major impact on trust between US and NATO and Afghan forces since 2008 and leading up to the winding down of combat operations in the country. In August Major Gen. Harold J. Greene was the highest ranking official to be killed in four decades in a war zone as the result of an 'insider attack'. A military spokesman told The Washington Post: 'We can confirm that there was a shooting incident at North Kabul International Airport complex 29 January at approximately 6:40 p.m. 'Three coalition contractors were killed as was an Afghan local national. This incident is under investigation. Further information will be released as available and appropriate.'

"North Korea may be attempting to restart its main nuclear bomb fuel reactor after a five-month shutdown, experts believe. Newly released satellite images suggest the country could be in the early stages of bringing its Yongbyon reactor complex back into use. When fully operational, the five-megawatt facility is capable of producing about six kilos of plutonium a year - enough for a nuclear bomb. Scroll down for video . Satellite images (above) taken on January 2 suggest North Korea could be in the early stages of bringing its Yongbyon reactor complex back into use . North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests, and recently threatened a fourth, amid tensions over fresh US sanctions and UN moves to censure Pyongyang for its human rights record. The US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University said the latest satellite images showed fresh activity at Yongbyon prompting suggestions of 'the early stages of an effort to restart the reactor'. Signs included steam coming from a probable pressure relief valve on a steam pipe just before it enters the turbine building, and meltwater running off the centre of the turbine-building roof, the institute said in a post on its 38 North website. The analysis stressed that the activity was too 'limited' to enable an accurate assessment of when the reactor might be tested and become operational. The think-tank said there were clear differences between the latest . 2014-1015 imagery and that from more than a year earlier when . the reactor was known to have been operating. North Korea shut down the Yongbyon reactor in 2007 under an aid-for-disarmament accord, but began renovating it after its last nuclear test in 2013. The country's leader Kim Jong Un is pictured earlier this month . When fully operational, the five-megawatt facility is capable of producing about six kilos (13 pounds) of plutonium a year - enough for one nuclear bomb . Imagery from December 2013 showed snow had melted off the . roofs of all the buildings related to the reactor and foam could . be seen at the end of the turbine building's steam and . wastewater drainpipe. It said the absence of the foam in recent . images could be related to the installation of new piping. North Korea announced in April 2013 that it would revive the . aged five-megawatt research reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear . complex, saying it was seeking a deterrent capacity, a move . condemned by members states of the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the . International Atomic Energy Agency. North Korea shut down the Yongbyon reactor in 2007 under an aid-for-disarmament accord, but began renovating it after its last nuclear test in 2013. The UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in September last year that steam discharges suggested the reactor might already be operational again. But analysis of later satellite imagery led other experts to conclude it had either failed to restart properly or had been shut down again - possibly for refuelling or renovation. Unused fuel rods are pictured in 2009 stacked in a warehouse at North Korea's nuclear complex in Yongbyon . Pictures have also detected activity at a separate Yongbyon facility, thought to be used for enriching uranium. The North says the purpose is to produce low-enriched uranium for a new reactor it is constructing, but experts suspect that the real goal is weapons-grade uranium, an alternative to plutonium for a nuclear bomb. Earlier this month, North Korea offered to suspend nuclear tests in exchange for a temporary freeze on US-South Korea joint military exercises. Washington rejected the offer, which it described as an 'implicit threat' to detonate a fourth nuclear device. A separate analysis on the 38 North website two weeks ago said satellite images of the North's Punggye-ri nuclear test site showed there were no signs that a detonation could be imminent.","Satellite images suggest North Korea in 'early stages' of restarting reactor .

"Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (pictured) wants to develop a reserve firearms squad to tackle the ‘real and present’ threat of a terrorist gun plot in London . Hundreds of extra armed officers are to be trained to deal with a Paris-style gun attack on British streets. The country’s top police officer Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe wants to develop a reserve firearms squad to tackle the ‘real and present’ threat of a terrorist gun plot. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner said the force had already deployed more armed officers on London’s streets to protect key sites in the wake of the slaughter of 12 people in an attack on the Paris offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine. He also revealed that police were in discussions with media firms to restrict live coverage of terror events should an attack occur in the UK. Referring to broadcasts of the Paris police operations, he said: ‘We want to ensure our ability to respond is not restricted by live coverage.’ Met officials are now talking to TV stations amid fears that live coverage of police raids could compromise operations. Scotland Yard has seen a dramatic reduction in its firearms capacity in recent years, with the number of armed officers cut by 750. But Sir Bernard yesterday announced plans to train members of the Territorial Support Group – often known as the riot squad – as an armed reserve in the event of a major terrorist attack. Currently, 2,700 officers are authorised to carry guns in London. The force is now reviewing the number it has available and one option is to create a reserve from the TSG. Yesterday, the Commissioner admitted that protecting the public from the terror threat was an ‘imperfect science’ and police can’t make perfect decisions every time. He told the police and crime committee at City Hall in London: ‘If you have multiple suspects, you can’t follow all of them all the time. ‘Nor can we guarantee we make a perfect assessment of the threat they pose today. ‘We believe we are coping with the threat at the moment. ‘We are looking to increase our resources but it is an imperfect science. ‘We are dealing with human beings here who sometimes change their mind.’ Scroll down for video . Sir Bernard revealed that the Met Police had already deployed more armed officers on London’s streets to protect key sites in the wake of the slaughter of 12 people in an attack on the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo . He went on to say the current counter-terrorism measures in place were working. ‘It’s not too intrusive, it’s a reasonable system at the moment and it’s been effective. ‘But the threat is real and present.’ He also said the force was caught in a dilemma about whether to lone patrols amid fears that fanatics plan to target police officers. ’It’s a dilemma. We have done more double crews over the last few months but if we double crew everyone we halve our flexibility’, Sir Bernard said. He told the committee there had been ‘really good support’ from the London community since the Paris attacks. More parents of children at risk of being influenced to travel to Syria and Iraq were coming forward to police, Sir Bernard added. Sir Bernard said the force was in discussion with the Government over more funding for counter-terror operations, adding: ‘Police need tens of millions of pounds more.’ His call for extra resources came on the day that the Association of Chief Police Officers said that funding cuts will mean forces can no longer deliver an effective service to the public. Sussex Chief Constable Giles York, who is Acpo’s workforce development spokesman, issued the warning after it was revealed that officer numbers had sunk to their lowest level for 14 years. Twelve people were killed when gunmen (pictured) stormed the office of Charlie Hebdo in Paris on January 7 . ‘We are concerned that if budget cuts continue in the current trend there will be a point in the future when forces are unable to deliver the effective and efficient service that the public expects,’ he said. ‘Each force comes to these financial challenges from a different starting point; some will be hit harder and feel the impact earlier than others.’ Home Office statistics showed there were 127,075 officers across the 43 forces covering England and Wales, down 1,295 in a year and around 17,000 fewer than in 2010. All but 14 forces shed posts over the 12 months. Yesterday, the Police Federation of England and Wales chairman Steve White said: ‘There can be no doubt that the drastic cuts in force budgets is doing real harm to the ability of the service to protect the public. ‘We hear that crime is falling but this only measures a snapshot of police activity. What we do not hear about is the extreme pressure these Government cuts are placing on officers’ ability to prevent terrorist attacks, manage sex offenders in the community, protect children from sexual exploitation and return missing persons to their families among other key issues. ‘Officers are at breaking point. You cannot create a better police service by imposing swingeing cuts on its budgets - all that will achieve is to cut the service officers are able to give the public.’","More armed officers being trained to deal with Paris-style gun attack on UK .

"A  dinner with media mogul Rupert Murdoch was the reason Prime Minister Tony Abbott overhauled his media team late last year, it has been claimed. Over Christmas, Mr Abbott dumped his press office director Jane McMillan, replacing her with former media adviser Andrew Hirst following the dinner with Mr Murdoch in December in Sydney, The Financial Review reported. The Prime Minister also hired former ABC journalist Mark Simkin to his office. The revelation of the dinner comes after the media tycoon tweeted that Mr Abbott should sack his chief of staff Peta Credlin after his widely scorned decision to award British royal Prince Philip a knighthood on Australia Day. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott overhauled his media team at the end of last year after dining with media mogul Rupert Murdoch . Rupert Murdoch and Mr Abbott had dinner together in Sydney sometime in December . The News Corp boss took to Twitter on Wednesday to urge Mr Abbott to either get rid of his loyal staffer or for Ms Credlin to 'do her patriotic duty and resign'. Over Christmas Mr Abbott dumped his press office director Jane McMillan . During the dinner, Mr Murdoch is believed to have criticised both Mr Abbott and his government for having 'the wrong people' in the top communication roles, The Financial Review reported. The publication also revealed Mr Murdoch has been calling Mr Abbott to complain about Ms Credlin, to whom the prime minister is fiercely loyal. The dinner revelation comes as influential columnist and vocal Tony Abbott supporter Andrew Bolt also turned on the prime minister on Wednesday, calling his decision to knight Prince Phillip 'fatal' for his leadership. He said the move could spell the end for Mr Abbott, branding the call 'damaging' no matter which perspective it was looked at from. 'This is just such a pathetically stupid - gosh, I didn't mean to be that strong because I actually like Tony Abbott very much - but this is just such a very, very, very stupid decision, so damaging that it could be fatal,' Mr Bolt told 2GB on Wednesday night. 'I thought it was verging on fatal already but this is too much. The prime minister replaced her with his former media adviser Andrew Hirst, pictured here with Mr Abbott and his chief of staff Peta Credlin . On Wednesday Rupert Murdoch called for Prime Minister Tony Abbott to sack chief of staff Peta Credlin . He urged her to resign if Mr Abbott did not fire her, and advised 'leading involves cruel choices' The Prime Minister's chief of staff Peta Credlin (left) has come under attack by Rupert Murdoch, with the media mogul suggesting she resign if Mr Abbott (right) does not sack her . 'This is a friendless decision, where his friends would feel stupid defending it,' he said, according to the ABC. Among other critics of the unpopular decision are prominent broadcaster Alan Jones and fellow columnist Miranda Devine. The criticisms of his decision come as a new poll for approval rating has slipped by more than 10 percent, with his approval rating at just 22 percent. The same Seven News ReachTEL poll of 3,700 people nationwide also found that 72 percent of those surveyed disagreed with Mr Abbott's decision to knight Prince Phillip. Malcom Turnbull is the preferred prime minister with a 45 percent approval rating, with Julie Bishop in second with 31 percent. Mr Abbott scored an approval rating of just 18 percent in the poll. Labor is leading on primary vote with 40.2 percent to the Coalition's 39.7 percent. Peta Credlin (pictured) has become the subject of dissent within the Liberal Party because of her tight control of the Prime Minister's Office . But senior government figures are standing by Mr Abbott and his chief of staff despite some of his biggest backers raising questions over his latest moves. Finance Minister Matthias Cormann says Mr Abbott has learnt a lesson from his unilateral decision about Prince Phillip, and had given an assurance there would be more consultation in the future. He backed the prime minister with 'strong and unequivocal support'. 'He is the best person to lead the Liberal Party, to lead our country,' Senator Cormann said. He's also standing by Ms Credlin, rejecting criticism she was blocking access to Mr Abbott. 'Not in any way, shape or form,' he said. Cabinet colleague Sussan Ley responded to the latest polling by using a tennis analogy. 'Sometimes you can make a silly drop shot in the middle of the game and you can win that game and then go on to win the match,' she told reporters during a visit to the Australian Open in Melbourne. Power player: Prime Minister Tony Abbott's chief adviser has been singled out by Rupert Murdoch . 'Like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank': A loose-lipped Liberal MP reportedly said last month that Ms Credlin (left) and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (right) are at odds . Ms Credlin was a 'terrific asset' to the prime minister's office and the Liberal Party. Another frontbencher Michaelia Cash dismissed the criticism of Mr Murdoch and Bolt. 'When you're the prime minister of the country, when you're the chief of staff to the prime minister, you'll always have your critics,' she told Sky News. Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos, a former chief of staff to John Howard, also backed Ms Credlin. 'Peta's has a hard job. She's done it as well as she can,' he said. Mr Abbott's parliamentary secretary Alan Tudge said Ms Credlin had been an outstanding contributor to the coalition team. 'I just say to Andrew Bolt and all of the other critics, let's just keep this decision in perspective,' he said. But following public ridicule and dissension in his own ranks, the prime minister said on Wednesday he stood by his decision to knight the Duke of Edinburgh. Power figure: A Prime Minister's chief of staff is typically one of the most powerful figures in the government . But he said he accepted people were upset by it. 'I respect their right to be critical... and I take it on the chin, I take it on the chin.' Mr Abbott has insisted his decision was a 'captain's pick' and that he did not consult with Ms Credlin. 'There does need to be wider consultation around these awards in the future'. Ms Credlin has been the subject of internal dissent within the Liberal Party over the past year. Several unnamed MPs have told the press they are chafing under her tight direction of the Prime Minister's Office, or PMO. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has stridently defended his top political operator, telling the ABC in December: 'Do you really think my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was Peter as opposed to Peta?' The remarks came after a frontbencher reportedly told The Australian that Ms Credlin and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop 'were like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank' and that their relationship had broken down. Education Minister Christopher Pyne today hailed Rupert Murdoch as one of the greatest Australians . Prince Philip, pictured right, has not issued a statement about his award . Murdoch met with Ms Bishop in New York at the weekend, according to the Australian Financial Review. A column by opinion writer Miranda Devine in the Daily Telegraph today said Ms Credlin was being blamed for Mr Abbott's gaffe and she should be sacrificed. She suggested Mr Abbott replace her with News Corp columnist Chris Kenny, a former adviser to one-time Foreign Minister Alexander Downer. 'The Prime Minister has to make a sacrificial offering to convince his colleagues that he has learned a lesson,' Devine wrote. 'Something that causes him pain, like chopping off his right arm. In other words, moving on chief of staff Peta Credlin. 'Justly or not, she is being blamed for the Prince Philip gaffe. 'It was Abbott's decision but it's the job of the chief of staff, who he has been known to call the Boss, to stop him from making such a blunder.' Education Minister Christopher Pyne has already jumped to Ms Credlin's defence, saying she was 'absolutely intrinsic to our success'. 'I support the chief of staff, Peta Credlin,' he said. 'I don't think there is any prospect of his suggestion being pursued by the government.' The Prime Minister stood be his decision to bestow a knigthood on Prince Philip, saying he had made a 'great contribution' to Australian public life. 'I accept that it's been a contentious decision – I absolutely accept that – and I absolutely respect people's rights to disagree with my call on this,' he said. 'But Prince Philip has been a distinguished servant of this country throughout a long and active public life. 'He's been part of some of the big events in our national life going back to the 1956 Olympics here in this city (Melbourne). Mr Abbott pointed to the popularity of the Duke of Edinburgh Leadership Awards as one of his major contributions. Rupert Murdoch was far from the only figure to criticise Mr Abbott's 'captain's call'. Queensland premier Campbell Newman, who is in the fight of his political life on the campaign trail, told reporters he disagreed with the decision and described it as a 'bolt from the blue'. Nationals deputy leader Barnaby Joyce told ABC Radio: 'I'm always of the strong belief that all awards should be for Australians'. Backbencher Ewen Jones told the ABC he was fine for previous governors-general to be made knights and dame.

"South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said on Thursday that he has set up a committee to explore running for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, portraying himself as a proven winner and a conservative willing to work with Democrats. The 'conservative' part of that description won't sit well with tea party Republicans and others on the right who see him as too accommodating to Democrats. Graham told reporters that his new website, called, 'Security Through Strength,' will give him a way to raise money. He plans to visit New Hampshire and Iowa, the first to states to vote in the nomination fight, and see if his pragmatic, non-ideological message resonates. 'GRAHAMNESTY': Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina announced on Thursday that he has formed a presidential exploratory committee. He will annoy tea party Republicans who see him as too moderate and accommodating . 'What I'm looking at is: Is there a pathway forward on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire for a guy like me?' the 59-year-old Graham said on Capitol Hill. 'I don't know until I look.' On such issues as national security and President Barack Obama's health care law, the three-term senator said, 'If we don't like what Obama's offering the country, what would we offer the nation?' He's seen as a moderate on illegal immigration – earning him the nickname 'Lindsey Grahamnesty' – and has upbraided his own party for failing to reach out more effectively to Hispanic voters. He also helped write a comprehensive immigration overhaul bill as part of the so-called 'Gang of Eight.' Right-wing radio hosts mock Graham as 'Goober,' for his 'aw shucks' Southern twang. But he said on Thursday that 'a center-right candidacy can prevail in America.' 'I mean, are we going to be a party that embraces the fact that Democrats exist and you can get no big deal done without their buy-in?' he explained. Some Republicans, most notably evangelical Christians, have been wary of Graham, the never-married and childless South Carolinian. And his pattern of compromising with Democrats looks like a white flag to many of the conservatives whose enthusiasm drives fundraising and attndance at speeches during the crucial early going. Graham, they point out, voted for Obama's nominees to the Supreme Court and is likely to vote in favor of Loretta Lynch for attorney general. But his national security credential could carry him past the first few hurdles. Graham told a Fox News Chanel audience on Thursday that 'Ronald Reagan famously said his goal was to have peace through strength. In my view, you can never have peace with radical Islam.' 'They want to destroy us and our way of life, so peaceful coexistence is a nonstarter from their point of you and, quite frankly, from my point of view. But you can have security.' THE COMPANY YOU KEEP: Graham (right) is closely allied with Arizona Sen. John McCain (left), whose moderate approach to presdiential politics lost him the race to Barack Obama in 2008 . Now two dozen Republicans, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, have expressed at least some interest in running next year. Graham bristled when asked how the party's conservative base could trust him given that voting record. He pointed out three times that he won the GOP nomination for Senate by 41 percentage points. 'I represent a form of conservatism that's acceptable in the reddest of red states,' he said. 'I am conservative by any rational definition.' Graham has been a close ally of Sen. John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee who lost to Obama. 'I formally endorse him. He has my all-out complete support,' McCain said Thursday, according to Bloomberg. The South Carolinian cruised to re-election in November, easily defeating six GOP primary rivals who cited his history of negotiating with Democrats as proof that he wasn't conservative enough.","The moderate is reviled by the right for his patience with the left .

"A 'lost' painting sold last year for £3,500 as the work of a John Constable copycat has been snapped up for a whopping £3.5million after it was revealed to be painted by the celebrated artist himself. Renowned auctioneers Christie's of London thought a fan had painted the study of Salisbury Cathedral in homage to Constable's famous 1831 work, and so valued it at just £500. A collector snapped it up for £3,500 in June 2013 but after taking a closer look they suspected the original artwork had been painted over. London auctioneers Christie's thought a fan had painted the study of Salisbury Cathedral (pictured) in homage to British artist John Constable's famous 1831 work. Christie's sold it for £3,500, but the painting was found to be an original work after the buyer realised it had been painted over . Restorers were called in to remove the added brushstrokes, and to the new owner's delight the oil painting was confirmed by scholars to be an original work by the Haywain artist himself. Experts say the previously unknown painting is one of several preparatory sketches Constable did before creating the masterpiece 'Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows', which was bought by the Tate gallery last year for £23.1million. After being catalogued by one of the world's leading authorities on Constable, the painting was relisted with auctioneers Sotheby's with an estimate of £2million, 4,000 times the original estimate. But after an intense bidding war the painting was sold to an unnamed bidder who forked out a staggering $5million - around £3.5million - including the auction house's fees. A spokesman for Sotheby's said: 'It is a wonderful result.' Prior to its sale in 2013 the 18in by 24in painting had been in a collection amassed in the 19th Century by William Henry Smith, founder of the high street stationary chain. It hung on the walls of Hambleden Manor in the Chilterns, home to his descendants the Viscounts Hambleden, until the Elizabethan property was sold in 2007. Lady Hambleden, 83, sold off the contents of the house - including the Constable painting - in the Christie's auction which raised £1.17m. The 'lost' artwork of Salisbury Cathedral was found to be an original sketching by British artist John Constable (depicted in this painting right). The painting was owned by Lady Hambleden (left) until she decided to sell it via Christie's of London because she 'longer had room for it' Experts said the painting is one of several preparatory sketches Constable did before creating the masterpiece 'Salisbury Cathedral From The Meadows' (above), which was bought for £23.1million last year . But specialists apparently failed to spot that the painting of Salisbury Cathedral was an original, instead listing it as being painted by 'a follower of Constable'. It was valued at £500 to £800 and sold for £3,500 to the lucky, anonymous buyer who then realised the painting had been heavily retouched in what experts say was a 'misguided attempt' to 'finish' it. Industry specialists say Lady Hambledon will have a case to sue Christie's if it can be proven the auctioneers did not carry out due diligence when checking the work. Prior to the auction Anne Lyles, a leading authority on the artist and former curator at the Tate, said Constable paintings could be tricky to attribute to the artist but she stood by her view that it was an original. She said: 'The buyer in 2013 will have taken an well-informed punt on this painting, which had a very low estimate, and then got it cleaned. 'Not everyone who takes a punt is going to get it right but on this occasion they did.' The depiction of Salisbury Cathedral (pictured) was sold by Christie's on behalf of Lady Hambleden . The famous newsagents firm was founded in 1792 when the first news vendors was opened in Little Grosvenor Street, London. It was handed down through the family until 1948 when the third Viscount Hambleden died. As Viscount Hambleden owned all the ordinary shares and the death duties were so heavy, a public holding company was formed to buy up all the share capital of WHSmith & Son Limited. The shares of the holding company were subscribed by the family, staff and public and on September 1, 1949, WHSmith & Son (Holdings) Limited was formed. Its governing director, and later its first chairman, was the Hon. David Smith - brother of the third Viscount Hambleden. However, the Smith family's control later slipped away, and the last family member left the board in 1996. Although no family member now sits on the board of the high street stationers, the Smiths collectively own £23million of company stock. Lady Hambleden, born Countess Maria Carmela Attolico di Adelfia, moved into Hambleden Manor when she married William Herbert Smith - the fourth Viscount Hambleden - in 1955. Lord Hambleden, who liked to be known as Harry, was the great-grandson of William Henry Smith, the founder of W H Smith. Lord and Lady Hambleden divorced in 1988 but she remained in the manor - in the heart of the Chilterns - while her ex-husband moved to America, where he died last August, aged 82. In 2013, she decided to sell off a number of artworks at the Elizabethan property because she now lives in a cottage in the village and 'no longer has room for them'. Ivan Macquisten, the editor of the Antiques Trade Gazette, added: 'I would be surprised if the previous vendor was not considering taking the matter further.' Before the auction a spokesman for Christie's said: 'We are aware that Sotheby's are offering this work as by Constable. 'We took the view at the time of our sale in 2013 that it was by a ""follower of"". We understand that there is no clear consensus of expertise on the new attribution.'","Painting thought to be the work of a John Constable fan sells for £3.5m .

"Two New Jersey teenagers looking to make extra money shoveling driveways in the wake of storm Juno, were stopped by police for flouting the travel curfew. Matt Molinari and Eric Schnepf had been passing out flyers offering to shovel snow in their local area when they were told by police their entrepreneurship was flouting the travel ban. A neighbor in  Bridgewater, New Jersey, had called police and reported the two teenagers as 'suspicious', and when police came upon the two boys, an officer ordered them back inside. Entrepreneurs: Eric Schnepf and Matt Molinari were stopped by police when driving around their neighborhood passing out flyers offering snow shoveling . The harsh weather affecting the east coast had seen New Jersey Governor Chris Christie declare a state of emergency and imposing a travelling ban on all non-emergency vehicles. Mr Molinari and Mr Schnepf effectively flouted the ban on they drive around the neighbourhood while trying to make some pocket money in the wake of the storm. 'The roads were fine enough to go out and drive,' Mr Schnepf told NBC New York, saying he had 'no idea' there was a travel ban in place. Local Police Chief Michael Jannone explained that the teenagers were stopped and questioned but were only told to go back inside and resume their business once the  the state of emergency was lifted.

"Broni, of Wythenshawe, has been jailed for four years after the Court of Appeal overturned his previous 'unduly lenient' community sentence for having sex with two 15-year-old girls . A dance coach who was previously spared prison for having sex with two 15-year-old girls has been jailed for four years after a court overturned a judge's decision saying he had 'quite simply got it wrong.' Jon Broni, 23, of Wythenshawe, 'exploited the infatuation' of two 15-year-olds to have simultaneous sexual relationships with them over a period of six months, and swap naked pictures with each of the girls, the Court of Appeal heard. But last year he was spared prison after a judge at Manchester Crown Court found they had given him their 'fulsome consent' and he was instead given a community service sentence. Lord Justice Davis, sitting at the Court of Appeal in London, said: 'Girls this age need protection against themselves. So, ostensible consent counts for little or nothing.' Broni was described at a previous hearing as an up and coming star on Manchester's street dance scene and has mingled with celebrities including Michelle Keegan. He was handed a community sentence last year after he admitted illicit sexual activity with the two girls. He was also put under supervision for three years and ordered to attend a sex offenders' treatment programme. But, the 'too soft' sentence was challenged at London's Appeal Court by Solicitor General, Robert Buckland QC. Three top judges today agreed with him that letting Broni walk free was 'unduly lenient' - and he was instead given a four-year prison sentence. Broni's victims had become obsessed with the highly-talented street dancer, who ran his own studio in Swinton, Lord Justice Davis said. He had sex sessions with them both and also swapped naked pictures with the youngsters who were each 'manipulated into sexual activity', added the judge. Broni's crimes were revealed when one of the girls' mums discovered an incriminating photo on her phone. He persisted even when friends and colleagues warned him about his behaviour. When the teenagers discovered he had been sleeping with them both, he said: 'You can't choose who you fall in love with'. Lord Justice Davis, sitting with Mr Justice Simon and Mr Justice Holgate, said there was an 'element of grooming' in Broni's case, although not as great as in some others. He added: 'True, he didn't use any force or coercion; that would have been an even more significantly aggravating factor - but he didn't need to. The street dancer posed for a photo with Coronation Street actress Michelle Keegan at a previous event . 'They were under his influence and he exploited their infatuation.' He said Broni should have been sentenced to at least six years in prison and added: 'Bearing in mind all these matters, the court takes the view that the appropriate sentence to be imposed is a total of four years'. Broni was ordered to surrender himself at Swinton police station to begin his sentence. Charities had previously criticised Broni's 'lenient' sentence after his last appearance at court. Broni worked as a street dance coach and Court of Appeal judges said he 'manipulated' the two teenagers . Yvonne Traynor, chief executive of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre, said: 'This was clearly a case of grooming and rape of young women and the sentence should reflect the seriousness of this heinous crime.' And Jon Brown, head of the NSPCC's programmes tackling sexual abuse, added: 'It is not possible for someone under 16 to consent to sex legally. 'This law is there to protect children and young people who think they are old enough and believe they are in a loving relationship when actually the older person has taken advantage of them.' During the previous hearing Broni was described as a former up-and-coming star in Manchester's street dance scene. He organised much of his own choreography and opened his own Boulevard studios in Salford, Greater Manchester, at the age of 21.","Jon Broni previously spared prison for having sex with two 15-year-olds .

"Every time you drive, you’re spied on. Countless thousands of cameras monitor your speed and record your car’s number plate. And there are at least 20 kinds — some gathering data for experts to analyse, others helping police catch criminals and manage traffic flow. But the most despised are those supposed to ‘improve road safety’, which seem to be little more than fine machines. Each year, £284 million is collected in speeding fines. Recently, it was revealed that one, called the Hadecs3, trapped 668 drivers on a stretch of the M25 in Kent in ten days. So who gets the cash? Most of the money goes to the Treasury. Your fine might not improve the road where you were caught, but you may help to cut the national debt. Here, GUY WALTERS helps you navigate your way past all the cameras . . . Gatso . These rear-facing devices use radar to record a vehicle’s speed. A radio signal is sent from the machine to the vehicle, which is then reflected back by the vehicle. The time between the signal being sent and being passed back is timed. A second signal is sent out and comes back, and is also timed. The difference enables the Gatso to establish how quickly the vehicle has travelled between the two points. If the vehicle is going above the speed limit, the camera takes several pictures. White lines on the road are markers to show how fast the vehicle has travelled. Newer cameras record images digitally, and beam them to the enforcement office. Locations: All over the country, particularly near accident black-spots. Truvelo . A camera that’s linked to four sensors embedded in the road and is able to calculate how fast a vehicle has passed over them. A series of pictures is taken from the front — thus capturing a photo of the driver. Locations: From the Home Counties such as Hampshire up to places such as Northamptonshire. Truvelo D-Cam . Updated version of the basic Truvelo that employs lasers and can transmit images wirelessly to a central office — thereby removing the need for film in the camera, which requires to be changed often —as is the case with the Gatso. Of course, it needs less staff and increases the capacity to catch speeders. Locations: Not common - currently found in West Yorkshire - but many more on their way. SpeedSpike . Uses Automatic Number Plate Recognition, and the 1,000 cameras currently being used can be linked so as to monitor a motorist’s whole journey on main roads across the country. Locations: Currently on trial in Hursley, Hampshire. Mobile camera . Operated by police officers — these devices are hand-held or mounted in vans that are normally parked in lay-bys. The cameras either use laser or radar technology. Locations: Could surprise you anywhere in the UK. Hadecs 3 . Introduced last year by the Highways Agency. We were told the cameras would primarily be used for ‘smoothing traffic flow and increasing [motorway] capacity’. But it seems they are mostly used as a speed camera. They record average speed over a specific distance. Unlike other average speed cameras, the Hadecs3 is painted grey not yellow, making it hard to spot — raising concerns that it is more about revenue than safety. This would seem at odds with the 2001 law that required all speed cameras to be painted DayGlo yellow to avoid concerns that the cameras were nothing more than hidden revenue raisers. The Hadecs3 camera uses radar to monitor several lanes of traffic. Locations: Known to be on the M25 in Kent. More planned for the M3 in Hampshire and Surrey, the M1 in Derbyshire and Yorkshire, and the M6 around Birmingham. SPECS . Able to monitor four lanes simultaneously, sets of these cameras are mounted on gantries. These are equipped with Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and photograph every vehicle that passes beneath them. The data is then sent to another set of cameras further down the road (a minimum of 200m away). The time that it takes for the vehicle to travel between these two set points is established, and as a result, a motorist’s average speed between the two points is worked out. Fitted with infra-red illuminators, they work night and day, and in all weathers. Locations: Motorways and dual carriageways all over the country. Trafficmaster . A private firm that uses roadside cameras to monitor traffic speeds and congestion levels. Information is sent to drivers whose satellite navigation systems have TrafficMaster built in — including popular sat-nav brands such as Garmin and Magellan. This helps the sat-nav to avoid jams. Police could get a court order to force TrafficMaster to hand over data, but they’d be unlikely to do so for speeding offences. Locations: On all major roads. Peek . Similar to the Gatso, it uses radar to measure a vehicle’s speed. If the vehicle is going too fast, it takes pictures of the rear of the vehicle. Locations: More common in built-up areas, but particularly found in Greater London, Leicestershire and Berkshire. Vector . Primarily intended for controlling average speeds, they can also monitor box junctions and bus lanes for traffic infringements and police congestion zones. Also uses ANPR. Data is transmitted instantly back to an enforcement team. Locations: So new that only a few have so far been spotted — in Kent. Highways Agency CCTV . Its 1,500 cameras on England’s roads ‘assist with management of traffic’. They record traffic flow and how roads cope with it. Cameras don’t store data on individual vehicles. The agency also uses 1,100 Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras that monitor an estimated 14 million vehicles a day. Not used for fines, data not shared with police. Locations: Motorways and major A-roads. SpeedCurb . Uses sensors embedded in the road to trigger a camera to take a photo if a vehicle has passed over them too quickly. In addition, markings on the side of the road also provide photographic evidence of how quickly a car has been travelling between the markings. Locations: Everywhere. Traffic light camera . Whenever a traffic light turns red, the camera takes a picture of any car that passes illegally beneath it — and can calculate its speed. Locations: All over the country. DVLA and DVSA cameras . The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency cameras check vehicles for which the excise duty (tax disc) has not been paid. However, the DVLA (which keeps registers of all drivers and vehicles in Britain) and the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) share data. The DVSA was created in 2013. Its responsibility is to improve road safety by setting standards for driving and motorcycling. As well as sharing information with the DVLA, it has a network of mobile and static cameras to monitor whether goods vehicles have paid the HGV Road User Levy. Introduced nine months ago, the system has raised £500,000 in fines. Locations: Everywhere. DS2 . Cameras are placed in police vans or unmarked cars, where they are fed data from a series of sensors embedded in the road. These sensors, which are visible (like those pictured above) are sometimes also marked by several short grey poles at the side of the road. Information from them is transmitted to police positioned further down the road, who can then stop the speeding car and issue an on-the-spot fine. Locations: Anywhere and everywhere. Police Automatic Number Plate Recognition . These record number plates of every passing vehicle, then store information to ‘help detect, deter and disrupt criminality at a local, force, regional and national level’. Records can be accessed for up to two years. If a vehicle is of interest to police, officers monitoring it can order a patrol car team to stop the driver and, if necessary, make an arrest. Locations: Widespread.","Some cameras are used to catch criminals, monitor traffic, or collect data .

"Holly Anderson was found hanged at home after leaving a note to her estranged boyfriend saying she was trying to win him back . A young hairdresser was found hanged at home after leaving a note to her estranged boyfriend saying she was trying to win him back. Holly Anderson, 19, was found by her uncle at her flat in Failsworth, Oldham, on September 11 last year. He raised the alarm was after climbing in through a window, but paramedics couldn't revive her, Rochdale Coroners Court heard. Miss Anderson - who was described by her family as an independent, happy-go-lucky teenager with everything to live for - had left her boyfriend a note and had sent him a series of text messages, the court was told. The inquest heard she wrote 'I am trying to win you back' in the note to her boyfriend she left in her bedroom and said she was 'lost' without him. She also sent her sister text messages and photographs hours before her death. The coroner was told that she had sent her sister a text asking her to call her boyfriend and get him to ring her 'one last time'. But the inquest heard he had had no credit on his phone. A coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure, saying he believed she was trying to 'elicit a response' from her boyfriend and might not have intended to kill herself. Coroner Simon Nelson said: 'She was doing whatever was in her power to gain his attention. I do not believe that I can be sure that Holly intended the consequences of her actions. 'Very sadly, she had gone that one step too far.' Her mother Lisa Robinson, from Moston, spoke of the family's loss at Rochdale Coroners Court. She said: 'She was a happy-go-lucky girl who had everything to live for. 'She will be very sadly missed. This has shocked us all and we are totally devastated. 'She had a lovely personality. She was a happy girl who had so much to look forward to. I have no idea what was going through her mind at the time.' Miss Anderson - who was described by her family as an independent, happy-go-lucky teenager with everything to live for - had left her boyfriend a note and had sent him a series of text messages, Rochdale Coroners Court was told. The inquest heard she wrote 'I am trying to win you back' in the note . The teenager worked as a hairdresser after studying hair and beauty at Manchester College. She met her boyfriend at the age of 16. He didn't attend the inquest and no statement was read from him. A cause of death was given as hanging. Holly's father Lee Stanley, from Newton Heath, said in a statement that he believed they had split up a month earlier. Paying tribute, he said: 'She was very proud and I was very proud of her.' Mr Nelson said Holly was upset and 'finding it difficult' to come to terms with the end of the relationship.

"Detective Constable Jeffrey Davies (above outside court) was jailed for three years in 2013 for sexually assaulting victims of domestic abuse that he was supposed to be looking after as their family liasion . The number of corrupt police officers exploiting victims and witnesses for sex is on the rise, according to a shocking report. The secret assessment warned that officers abusing their power for ‘sexual gratification’ was ‘a major concern’. ‘The number of reported incidents has been increasing nationally since 2009,’ it added. The report was prepared by the Serious Organised Crime Agency for the Association of Chief Police Officers, or Acpo. It also went on to say that more officers were dealing in drugs such as heroin, cocaine, amphetamine and cannabis. ‘Abuse and supply of class A and B controlled drugs is occurring more frequently among a greater number of forces than was reported in 2010.’ The SOCA national threat assessment – made in June 2013 and the latest available – was based on three years of intelligence reports gathered by forces across England and Wales. It was made public for the first time yesterday by the police watchdog as part of a wider report into corruption in policing. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary found overall that forces were making progress in tackling the issue and it found no evidence that corruption is endemic. But around half do not have the capacity to actively seek out and develop intelligence on corruption and fewer than half have an effective plan to root out the problem, HMIC warned. There have been a number of high profile cases of predatory sex abuse by officers. Northumbria police constable Stephen Mitchell, 43, was jailed for life in January 2011 for carrying out sex attacks on vulnerable women, including prostitutes while he was on duty. He raped and sexually abused heroin addicts, shoplifters and a disabled teenager by offering them help while in custody, then demanding sexual favours. In 2013 family liaison officer Detective Constable Jeffrey Davies was jailed for three years for sexually assaulting victims of domestic abuse that he was supposed to be looking after. In the 12 months to March 31 2014, 406 officers and police staff were investigated for sexual misconduct, a four per cent rise on the previous year. One in six were allowed to retire or resign and around 40 per cent of cases led to no further action. Drugs were also a focus of concern for HMIC inspectors who said that, despite ‘an increasing threat from the use and supply of Class A and controlled B drugs by police officers and police staff’, only half of forces were carrying out random drug testing on their workforce. The report said: ‘Forces that elect not to undertake random drug tests and circulate the results to their workforces are missing an opportunity both to identify and to discourage criminal activity.’ In the 12 months to 31 March 2014, there were 163 investigations into drug-related offences by officers and staff, with more than half resulting in no further action. Northumbria police constable Stephen Mitchell, 43, (pictured) was jailed for life in January 2011 for carrying out sex attacks on vulnerable women, including prostitutes and a disabled teenager while he was on duty . In one case, a constable and his son were caught supplying drugs to another sergeant who was selling them on. The constable was also providing police information to criminals. Both were jailed. There were also 1,178 inquiries carried out into reports of theft, fraud and dishonesty. Less than one in four forces also regularly monitored social media for misconduct by officers and staff on their private accounts. Overall, in the year to 31 March 2014, a total of 37 forces out of 39 made arrests relating to corruption, with 1,138 officers and staff being disciplined or dismissed. Referrals to the Independent Police Complaints Commission over police corruption also increased 30 per cent. Bobbies on the beat are so worried about being accused of corruption they are turning down cups of tea from members of the public, a report has found. The police watchdog warned officers risked being seen as ‘distant’ because some refused to accept anything from the public for fear of landing themselves in trouble with their superiors. The report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, entitled Integrity Matters, said: ‘HMIC is concerned that the focus on ensuring officers and staff act with integrity may be misconstrued by some officers and staff who believe that no gift or hospitality can be accepted.’ It warned this may be ‘leading to some staff not interacting with the public as they normally would and being seen as distant’. Inspectors also discovered that only around a quarter of forces conduct regular audits of their registers on staff declaring gifts and hospitality, business interests and second jobs, expenses claims and the procurement of goods and services in order to identify potential corruption.","Increase in corrupt police officers exploiting victims for sex, report reveals .

"Walking up the aisle is arguably the biggest day of your life. With all eyes on you and photographs you'll cherish forever, there's a fair amount of pressure to look good on your wedding day, but how far would you go - and how much would you shell out - to ensure you look picture-perfect? One magazine editor went to great lengths, spending £5,766 on three months-worth of procedures and treatments to look polished - and the results are amazing. Claudia Waterson, 36, the deputy editor of Brides magazine, imagined she was a bride-to-be to test out what treatments were worth investing in - and which ones should be avoided - for her readers. Scroll down for video . Claudia Waterson, 36, pictured, left, before, and, right, after three months worth of treatments, imagined she was a bride-to-be to test out what treatments were worth investing in - and which ones should be avoided . She had a few key areas she wanted to address: her broken nose, her neglected skin and her 'wonky' teeth. She spoke to her beauty journalist friends and compiled a list of the must-have products and treatments. She kicked off her bridal makeover by overhauling her skincare routine based on the beauty gurus' recommendations. She added a range of products to her collection, including lotions and potions from La Prairie, Estee Lauder, Creme de la Mer and Bobbi Brown, at a cost of £489. She complemented her new skincare regime with a £200 facial by Su-Man. 'It turns out if you buy the right products for you and use them correctly, they will work,' she said. Right she was - she noticed reduced lines and plumper skin. She also visited Headmasters for a hair makeover at a cost of £140. After switching between blonde and brown over the years, she was convinced she'd never be able to achieve glossy blonde locks without drying out her hair. Claudia had a few key areas she wanted to address including her broken nose, her neglected skin and her 'wonky' teeth. She had £5,766 worth of treatments and used the top beauty products to overhaul her look . Speaking about her final look, she said: 'The change in my confidence has been the real shock. These treatments were right for me; they're subtle and pretty... I challenge anyone not to say my face has improved' After a balayage session, where colour is applied freestyle by hand, she was back at her blonde best. Defined brows came courtesy of global chain, Browhaus, where she had her brows and eyelashes tinted and groomed for a cool £608. Dr Uchenna Okoye's Quick Fix Bridal Makeover was the obvious choice for helping her achieve the smile of her dreams. See the full feature in the March/April 2015 issue of Brides, on sale from Thursday 29th January . Her teeth were whitened by a staggering 11 shades and smoothed and rounded at a cost of £2,379. 'My smile, and confidence, have improved, without the lead time of major orthodontics,' she said after the treatment. She opted to have her lips made fuller via a £660 lip enhancement treatment courtesy of Dr Rakus. She said: 'Despite the bruise, my upper lip is fuller yet so natural looking. Some 36 years of average lips and now I have a pout I can paint.' Claudia  also wanted to fix her nose, which was broken and 'given a funny angle' by a netball incident in her childhood. Cosmetic specialist Dr Tapan Patel, medical director at the PHI Clinic in London, suggested a £495 non-surgical rhinoplasty, where filler is injected into the nose to correct deformities - and she was thrilled with the results. Her final treatment was a £795 'liquid lift' by Dr Prager, who developed it to sculpt, tighten and contour the face. Speaking after the three months, Claudia said: 'I embarked on this feature with the mind of a writer who has worked in magazines a long time, and seen a million different beauty claims. 'And I was cautious I didn’t become the Bride Of Wildenstein (Google it. Scary). But the results speak for themselves, I think. Even my other half was forced to admit I look better!

"Private hospitals have offered doctors six-figure sums to refer patients to them over rivals, a major investigation has revealed. The doctors' regulator, the General Medical Council (GMC), failed to act after receiving evidence of widespread payments to consultants in private practice in exchange for referrals to certain hospital groups, particularly those in London, it has been claimed. The discovery has prompted a leading medical journal to call for doctors in the UK to be forced to declare their financial interests. The report published in the BMJ is based on an investigation by a major health insurance company, which uncovered 'covert' schemes often worth 'tens of thousands' of pounds, with some payments exceeding six figures, it said. The insurance company called on the GMC to 'take a clear position on this', but the regulator took no action, the report said. The BMJ said it had learned that the apparently widespread practice first came to light during an internal investigation launched by the insurance company in 2011. Doctors in the UK should be forced to declare their financial interests, the UK's leading medical journal has said, after it emerged private hospitals have offered doctors 'tens of thousands' of pounds to refer patients to them over rival hospitals (file picture posed by models) Land Registry records showed that many independent practices were housed in expensive London properties owned by private hospital groups. One document seen by The BMJ showed 73 properties, many in West End locations, including Harley Street and Wimpole Street, are owned by the giant American hospital corporation HCA alone. In 2014, The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued an order that prohibits inducement schemes - but The BMJ has heard evidence that some hospitals are continuing to 'buy' referrals, the report added. One senior surgeon told The BMJ that he had been approached by a hospital group hoping to attract his referrals away from a rival as recently as nine months ago. A spokesman for The London Clinic, London's largest independent hospital and an opponent of consultant incentive schemes, said although the rules had been 'tightened considerably' by the CMA order 'we are still seeing consultants being approached by competitors.' The GMC's Good Medical Practice does set standards on financial arrangements and conflicts of interest. But The BMJ's editor in chief, Dr Fiona Godlee, said the investigation 'shows an unwillingness to act on possible breaches of these standards'. The investigation by a health insurer uncovered 'covert schemes' aimed at consultants in private practice, encouraging them to send patients to specific private hospital groups, particularly in London . She added: 'The GMC's belief that its role is limited to offering guidance on conflicts of interests is unsatisfactory. 'Its promise to review whether more can be done to help doctors manage potentially conflicting financial ties is vague and insufficient.' She has called for new guidelines that stipulate UK doctors' financial interests should be included in 'a publicly available and searchable central register, updated as part of annual appraisal'. She warned that, 'unless the GMC is serious about regulating doctors' financial conflicts of interest, insidious inducement schemes will continue to reward private hospital groups and some doctors at the expense of patients, the very people that the GMC is obliged to protect'. One document seen by The BMJ revealed 73 properties, many in Harley Street, are owned by the giant American hospital corporation HCA alone . GMC chief executive Niall Dickson said he understood concerns about incentive schemes. In a statement, he said: 'Our guidance states that doctors ""must not allow any interests you have to affect the way you prescribe for, treat, refer or commission services for patients"". 'We set out that doctors ""must be open and honest with your patients about any such interests that could be seen to affect the way you prescribe for, advise, treat, refer or commission services for them"". 'Our guidance is comprehensive and clear in respect of the responsibilities of individual doctors and we have taken appropriate action against individual doctors in the past where there has been evidence that our guidance has been breached. He said the GMC will be writing to all independent healthcare providers to seek assurances that they are not putting their doctors in a position where they could be acting outside GMC guidance. Mr Dickson said the GMC is exploring the possibility of recording doctors' commercial interests on the register. And he added the regulator are reviewing the Competition and Markets Authority report, which highlights the potential for conflicts of interest to arise when doctors refer patients for medical treatment. But the insurance investigator said he found it 'staggering and totally unacceptable that the GMC, as the official regulator of the medical profession, can receive a report from a public body showing that one of the key duties of a doctor is being widely flouted and do nothing about it.' It was, he added, 'a sad day for the medical profession when a competition regulator has had to issue an order stopping such schemes because our own regulator, the GMC, has failed to do so.' The GMC said it did not receive a formal complaint against individual doctors and so could not investigate further.","BMJ report has called for doctors' to make public their financial interest .

Yet I absolutely love it. While it shows off plenty of cleavage, it reveals little else. The wide-legged all-in-one exudes 1970s glamour, plus it’s comfy. As it draws attention to only one place, make sure your cleavage is up to the task. I got some extra help from Wonderbra’s Ultimate Deep Plunge Bra (£32, very.co.uk). Verdict: Daring and dramatic, but a big success. RARE MAXI DRESS . £22.50, asos.com . Body necklace, £12, riverisland.com . The closest I’ll ever get to feeling like Jennifer Aniston, this shimmering gown exudes old-school Hollywood glamour, and the deep V-neck — accessorised with a body chain — inevitably draws the eye. I have an average-sized 34B chest and, having had three children, my cleavage is not as perky as it was. But this plummeting neck creates an impressive embonpoint, accentuated by the gathered waist. Verdict: A dress that will definitely put me in the spotlight, without leaving me over-exposed. MISSGUIDED DRESS . £30, missguided.co.uk . Shoes, £185, lucychoilondon.com . ON women of my age, this kind of clingy dress screams ‘cougar’. I’d have avoided a red, Lycra number like this even in my 20s. And it’s clearly not flattering now I’m in my 40s. However, the bodycon tube does create impressive cleavage. It’s tight enough to hold my boobs firmly in place, and the inbuilt cups give me a sculpted, full shape. Verdict: Undeniably  good cleavage — but I feel like I’ve gone out in my underwear! LIPSY DRESS . £50, lipsy.co.uk . Shoes, £198, lucychoilondon.com . This unusual dress will make you the centre of attention. Just not the right kind of attention. The old rule of thumb says you should never show boobs and legs at the same time: this breaks that rule. There’s no doubt that it shows off my cleavage, but it exposes too much of everything else as well. Verdict: A definite step too far. BLUE MAXI DRESS . £55, asos.com . I feel like a Strictly Come Dancing reject. This gets top marks for flounce — yet in the chest department, it’s decidedly flat. I struggle through layers of chiffon and complicated straps, but it’s when I finally get the dress on that the work begins. I spend ten minutes trying to get my boobs in place — each time, they slide into nothingness under folds of pleated fabric. In the end, I resort to strategically placed body tape to give my chest the uplift it needs. The result is underwhelming. Verdict: Strictly to be avoided.","With awards season in full flow and celebrities are testing their red carpet style there's been one look that's been very popular .

"Ryan Harriss, now 24,  nearly died when he suffered a heart attack on a night out. He is pictured before he started using steroids . A gym fanatic suffered a near-fatal heart attack on a night out after becoming addicted to the effects of taking a cocktail of steroids. Ryan Harriss, from Harlow, Essex, collapsed on a night out with friends six months after first taking the performance-enhancing drugs. Once in hospital, doctors discovered the then 22-year-old's heart had swollen to the point it was much larger than normal, and his blood pressure had gone off the scale. They warned Mr Harriss he would die if he continued to place his heart under the strain of taking the drugs. There and then he vowed never to touch steroids again. Mr Harriss first began the drugs after seeing how well they had worked for friends he trained with at the gym. While he had been working hard, he wasn't seeing the same results as others. It was when friends told Mr Harriss that he would never achieve the results he wanted without the help of steroids, that he experimented for the first time. 'My metabolism is apparently really fast, so I shed weight really quickly and it makes it really hard to maintain muscle mass,' he said. 'There were guys around me who didn't seem to be trying as hard as me but were getting much better gains. 'I didn't even think about it. My next pay cheque that came in, I went to a friend of a friend and I ordered them in. 'For most of these guys, they suffered no problems at all.' After starting taking anabolic steroids, Mr Harriss admits he became addicted to how his body reacted. 'The difference was instant,' he told MailOnline. 'I started noticing the gains immediately. You are supposed to do steroids in courses, but I saw myself getting bigger and bigger. 'My arms toned up, my chest and back muscles were more defined and I went from a pretty average body to hench in a few weeks.' Determined to get bigger and bigger, he began to up the dosage. 'I started to do lots of different types of steroids - They call it stacking,' he told MailOnline. 'I didn't really stop or give my body any kind of a break. 'I'd started to get chest pains quite frequently, but I just ignored them and kept going to the gym. 'I didn't want to lose my new physique.' Six months after first starting to take the drugs, Mr Harriss was on a night out, having a few drinks when he collapsed. 'I became breathless,' he told MailOnline. 'I started getting really hot and was sweating. 'My chest went so tight and I got that feeling you hear about in my arm. It is hard to explain. 'I didn't know what was happening to start with, it was similar to a panic attack. 'But as my chest got tighter and tighter I realised what was happening to me. 'Everything went blurry and that's all I remember, I blacked out.' The then 22-year-old collapsed after six months of taking anabolic steroids to try and bulk up (pictured) Doctors warned Mr Harriss if he continued to take the performance enhancing drugs he would die. He told MailOnline he made the decision there and then never to touch the drugs again . When he woke up in a hospital bed, his girlfriend was holding his hand and crying. Mr Harriss spent five days in hospital while medics performed ECG tests and MRI scans on him. 'The doctors came in and informed me that I'd had a heart attack,' he recalled. 'They said my the rate my heart was beating, I was lucky to be alive. 'I'd collapsed in the bar and an ambulance had brought me straight to hospital, and I'd been unconscious since. 'It was horrifying,' he continued. 'I have never experienced anything like it in my life and pray I never do again.' Mr Harriss spent five days in hospital, with doctors warning if he didn't give up the steroids, he was likely to die. 'My heart was massive,' he told MailOnline. 'It had swollen so much it was much bigger than normal. 'And my blood pressure was through the roof.' It was while lying in his hospital bed that Mr Harriss made the decision - he vowed never to take the drugs again. 'What you see, the results from taking the drugs, it's addictive,' he admitted. 'It isn't very nice injecting them, you end up with a numb bum, but it is when you see in the mirror the results, and people start commenting on how big you look, that's what becomes addictive.' Despite this, Mr Harriss has stuck to his word, in the last two years not one steroid has been injected into his body. The Drug . Steroids are drugs that mimic natural hormones  that regulate and control how the body works and develops. There are two main groups - anabolic steroids and corticosteroids. Anabolic steroids are the type widely misused. They are similar to the male hormone testosterone and can improve endurance and performance, as well as stimulate muscle growth. Some people are tempted to take anabolic steroids to build their muscle mass, while others use them to improve their performance. The Effects . Sports players and body builders have claimed the drugs help them: . But they have also been known to . The Risks . In the young, anabolic steroids can disrupt the way their body develops, stunting growth in some cases . For men, the drugs can cause problems with erections, promote the growth of breasts and cause a man to become sterile. They can also cause men to lose their hair and develop acne, while others have suffered shrunken testicles. In women, the drugs can promote more masculine features. Women have been known to develop facial hair, a deeper voice, lose hair on their heads, notice their breasts shrink. They may also suffer an enlarged clitoris, as well as acne, menstrual problems and changes in their sex drive. Steroids also raise blood pressure, increasing the risk of illnesses including death from liver failure, stroke and heart attack. Regular users have reported having trouble sleeping, becoming paranoid and experiencing dramatic mood swings. Meanwhile, injecting drugs comes with its own risks, damaging veins, causing ulcers and gangrene. And injecting increases the risk of spreading HIV and hepatitis C. The Law . Anabolic steroids are Class C drugs, which are sold by pharmacists but only with a doctor's prescription. It is legal to possess or import steroids as long as they are for personal use. Possession with intent to supply, including giving them to friends, is illegal and those found guilty face up to 14 years in prison. Source: Talk to Frank . 'I feel very lucky and unlucky in many ways,' he said. 'I am lucky to be alive, but, while I was stupid, this kind of reaction doesn't happen to everyone. 'I am so grateful I didn't die, it was the wake up call I needed.' Since his heart attack, Mr Harriss struggles to do proper work outs, fearing his heart can't cope. 'I miss being big,' he said. 'But I couldn't keep risking my life just for a few extra muscles. 'If I was to use them again, doctors warned me I wouldn't last a month, my heart just can't take them.' He told MailOnline he is sharing his experience to warn others of the dangers. 'A lot of people do steroids,' he said. 'I would advise never touching them, but you have to be realistic. 'There will be people out there who use them, and to them I would just say, don't abuse it. 'There are safer ways of taking them. 'Mine is a horror story, but it was a wake up call for me and should be for others considering using the drugs.'","Ryan Harriss was envious of the muscular bodies his gym friends had .

"Paris was gripped by travel chaos today as train drivers went on strike following a vicious, unprovoked assault on one of their colleagues. Commuters were dangerously crammed into stations and trains as they desperately tried to get into work and then home, causing pandemonium across the French capital. Frustrated workers took to social media to reveal the scenes as the city's public transport system struggled to cope with the millions of extra stranded people. Commuters were seen walking up central panels of escalators in desperate attempts to keep out of the crush, while other pictures revealed crowds  at a complete standstill. Scroll down for video . Desperate: Commuters walk up the central panels of escalators on their way to catch trains in a bid to avoid the crowds after drivers went on strike following an assault on their colleague . Chaos: As commuters sought alternative routes home, Saint Lazare station in Paris was swamped with tens of thousands of extra people struggling with travel plans . Crush: Twitter users uploaded shots of the chaos when the extra passengers at Saint Lazare station caused an immense rush hour crush after train drivers went on strike . Drivers on the RER Line A refused to work on Thursday  after a colleague had his nose broken when he was headbutted by an angry passenger on the outskirts of the city on Wednesday night. It is understood the passenger had his hand stuck in the door and set off the train's alarm system which alerted the driver - who was then attacked before the passenger fled. Striking staff have demanded extra security when they work before they return to the tracks. The Line A is one of the busiest in the world, carrying an estimated 1.2 million people per day across the French capital. As commuters sought alternative routes home, Saint Lazare station was swamped with tends of thousands of people struggling to make their way home. Thierry Babec, Secretary General of the UNSA-RATP union, said: 'The drivers have seen their colleague assaulted for no reason. Their first instinct was to not return to work out of solidarity. 'The workers aren't machines and we can't pretend that nothing happened. Once these emotions have calmed down, work will resume as normal.' Alain Vidalies, French Secretary of State for Transport, said that while he sympathised with the victim of the attack, the strike 'did not constitute the right response'. Standstill: Frustrated commuters were caught in the crush after train drivers refused to work in support of their colleague. They are demanding extra security before they return to work . Crammed: The city's transport authorities laid on extra buses to ensure commuters could get to work, but they were also packed out as they city struggled to cope . Extra buses were running in the city to try and ease the problem, and more trains were also running on the other lines that were still operating. It is also understood that the problems escalated when there was a derailment on the RER Line D and another incident on the RER Line C which caused trains to slow. The RER Line A travels from the north-west to the south-east of the city, covering 67 miles and 46 stops. Authorities in the city are desperately trying to resolve the issue and convince the drivers to return to work on Friday morning. Pierre Mongin, head of the RATP Group, which manage public transport in the city said criticised the strikers. He said: 'A spontaneous interuption of services, without respect to the rules around strike warnings, is not an appropriate reaction for this kind of situation,' he said, before apologizing to commuters while at the same time condemning the 'unacceptable' attack on the driver.

"A gun range owner who banned Muslims from her business as a matter of 'public safety' claims trade has 'quadrupled' since the controversial move. Jan Morgan decided to bar all followers of Islam from her Gun Cave Indoor Firing Range in Hot Springs, Arkansas, last September while claiming the religion 'commands them to kill' her. Five months on and she says business is booming and that threats of a lawsuit by federal civil rights enforcers have failed to materialise. Scroll down for video . Arkansas business owner Jan Morgan says business has boomed since she turned her shooting range into a 'Muslim-free zone' The American-Islamic Relations had written to the Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the gun range on the grounds of racial and religious discrimination. The group's attorney, Jenifer Wicks, said at the time the move could 'inevitably result in a hostile environment for ordinary Muslims in Arkansas.' But Morgan has no plans to back down, despite receiving threats over the contentious decision, and even claims business has 'quadrupled' with people coming from out of state and some offering donations for what they predict will be a legal battle. Morgan claims keeping Muslims out of her firing range is a matter of public safety and not a constitutional issue . In a bizarre blog post, she wrote that she doesn't consider Islam to be a religion — and as such Muslims shouldn't be allowed protections under the U.S. Constitution. 'Why would I want to rent or sell a gun and hand ammunition to someone who aligns himself with a religion that commands him to kill me?' she added. The shooting range owner said she made the decision in September after two customers she deemed suspicious visited. She said their furtive behavior and cellphone ringtones of 'Allahu Akhbar' prompted her to revise her range's policies. Morgan, who says she has been threatened before, wrote in a rambling blog post: 'Why would I want to rent or sell a gun and hand ammunition to someone who aligns himself with a religion that commands him to kill me?' Morgan said she excludes those she believes to be Muslim based on their names. 'We are dealing in lethal firearms,' Morgan told FoxNews.com. 'I'm not going to let a Nazi shoot in here, or a Ku Klux Klan member in here, either.' She added in her blog that she believed the Koran contains '109 verses commanding hate, murder and terror,' and claims threats on her life have been made by Muslims. Earlier this month, a Hindu father and son say they were turned away from the gun range. The men, of Indian descent, said they had arrived hoping to shoot but were immediately asked where they were from and told it was a Muslim-free range. Despite telling Morgan they were Hindu, the son, who did not want to be named, claims he and his father were still asked to leave. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Arkansas  has now petitioned federal authorities against Morgan's decision. Executive Director Rita Sklar said the rule was religious discrimination and warned her group would be 'more than happy' to proceed with legal action should a client approach them. Morgan is the owner of the Gun Cave Indoor Shooting Range (pictured) in Hot Springs, Arkansas . Legal experts say Morgan may be within her rights if her gun range is deemed a private club. However, they warned that a gun range open to the general public but excluding Muslims could struggle to prove it does not fall under federal civil rights regulation. Morgan cited the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the Boston Marathon bombings as some of the reasons she mistrust Muslims. Morgan said some of her patrons were 'frightened' when two men with 'Allah Akbar ring tone and message alert tones' — the Arabic phrase meaning 'God is the greatest' — walked into her range recently. 'They spoke very little English, one did not have proof of U.S. citizenship, yet they wanted to rent and shoot,' Morgan wrote. 'They were constantly glancing toward the cameras in the range, then looking at each other and speaking in their own language. 'Their behavior was so strange, it frightened my patrons. No one would enter the range to shoot while they were there. Some of my customers left. I lost business and the people who remained at my facility said they did so out of fear for my safety.' Morgan was unavailable for comment when sought by MailOnline on Thursday evening. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate Morgan (pictured) on ground of racial and religious discrimination . In a phone call, an employee at Gun Cave Indoor Shooting Range said Morgan is considering changing her business into a private shooting club. 'As such, we can say who may or may not be a member,' the staffer said. 'We don't ask anybody what their religion is, we don't care. 'They come in here and act normal, we don't have a problem.' Bizarrely, Morgan seems to justify her Muslim-free idea on the advice of agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. She claims two agents told her 'if we feel ANY reason for concern about selling someone a firearm, even sense that something is not right about an individual, or if we are concerned about that [person's] mental state, even if they pass a background check, we do not have to sell that person a gun. She added: 'I understand that not all Muslims are terrorists. I also believe there are as many Muslims who do not know what is in their Koran as there are Christians who do not know what is in their Bible. 'Since I have no way of discerning which Muslims will or will not kill in the name of their religion and the commands in their Koran, I choose to err on the side of caution for the safety of my patrons.' The Council on American-Islamic Relations sent a copy of its letter to Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Justice Department, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas and the ATF's regional office in Little Rock. Responding to the letter, she wrote in her Facebook page: 'I've been a target of Islamist threats for five years..fully expecting at any time one of them to follow through with the threat. I may go down for speaking the truth about Islam... … I may lose everything I have, (which isn't much) but they can't take my integrity... This is a mountain I'm willing to die on….'","Jan Morgan  banned Muslims from Gun Cave Indoor Firing Range in Hot Springs, Arkansas, last September .

"A Utah man serving life in prison for a double murder that he believes was directed by God says his ideas likely influenced a couple's decision to fatally overdose along with their children. Dan Lafferty sees himself as the prophet Elijah and the world as hell, a philosophy that played into the September deaths of Benjamin and Kristi Strack. He also claims that he and Kristi Strack fell in love, something her husband was aware of and didn't mind. Scroll down for video . Survivalist: Dan Lafferty poses for a photograph, at Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah. A Utah couple who overdosed on drugs along with their three children was obsessed with Lafferty . Tragedy: Benjamin and Kristi Strack and three of their children, Benson, 14, Emery, 12, and Zion, 11, were found dead inside their home in September. Their oldest son, who survived, is pictured left . Police say five members of the Utah family found dead last fall died from methadone and other drugs, and interviews with people who knew them revealed the parents worried about a 'pending apocalypse' Lafferty is in prison for the 1984 slayings of his sister-in-law, Brenda Lafferty, and her 15-month old daughter, crimes which were chronicled in the 2003 Jon Krakauer book 'Under the Banner of Heaven.' The 66-year-old said he first became close to the Stracks about 10 years ago, after Kristi Strack had a dream about him while she was reading the book. She reached out to him, and eventually Kristi and Benjamin Strack became almost weekly visitors to the Utah State Prison. At one point, Lafferty cut off his waist-length hair and beard at her request and sent them to the family. However, the friendship tapered off after the couple pleaded guilty to criminal charges including forgery and drug possession in 2008, which ended their prison visiting privileges. They exchanged letters afterward, but Lafferty said Kristi Strack didn't believe he was Elijah, and when he persisted she quit answering his letters. Questions: Authorities could not determine if Benson (pictured), who was 14 at the time, had been killed or if he had taken his own life. He was the only one not under the covers, suggesting he had been the last to die . Heartbreaking: Their bodies were found in a bed in the master bedroom by their eldest son and his girlfriend . Dan and Ron Lafferty are both in prison for the 1984 murders of Brenda Lafferty and her 15-month-old daughter, Erica. They slit their victims' throats with a 10-inch boning knife and later claimed God had ordered the slayings. The men were tried separately; Dan Lafferty is serving a life sentence, and Ron Lafferty -- who claimed to have the revelation to kill -- is on death row. The revelation to kill their brother's family came from Ron after Brenda spoke out against her husband Allen Lafferty joining his brother's radical polygamist group. Dan and Ron Lafferty in 1984. The brothers were tried seperately and both remain in prison . Dan Lafferty looks at evidence Tuesday, April 2, 1996, during testimony in the retrial for the 1984 murders of Brenda and Erica Lafferty in Provo, Utah. The evidence seen is a vacuum cord that was tied around Brenda Lafferty's neck . Ron said they needed to be 'removed' so that, as God put it, 'my work might go forward.' According to investigators into the Strack case, Dan had not left behind his cult-leader mentality when Kristi first made contact with him. Springville Police Corporal Greg Turnbow says that Dan communicated with Kristi like she was his child--a part of his flock. Strack and her husband became close friends with Lafferty, who believes himself to be the prophet Elijah, for several years. While the Stracks did have frequent communication with Lafferty, it did not generally include talks about the end of the world. The communication also ended in 2008 and police still aren't sure exactly what led them to commit suicide in September. DAN'S IDEOLOGY - A 1,000-YEAR SEX PARTY . But Dan's ideology seems to point toward why the Stracks, who'd struggled with addiction for years, might have found him so alluring. Dan explained to the Salt Lake City Weekly in a lengthy 2014 profile that, as a devout Mormon child, he struggled with seductions of the flesh. 'When I was young and going to church, I thought because I couldn’t stop masturbating, that I might be an evil person, and it tormented me so much that I contemplated castration as a possible way to stop offending God,' he said. So, as an adult, he began to see such desire not as a test from God, but as one of his gifts. He believes the righteous will be treated to a 1,000-year party during which they'll be filled with the light of Jesus and have sex the likes of which have not before been experienced on Earth. As the prophet Elijah, Dan believes it is his duty--as the only one who can see the continual cycle that begins at birth and starts over with the thousand-year party--to cull from the Earth the 'weeds' of the Devil that have grown for 6,000 years. Only when he personally replaces these weeds with God's righteous 'wheat' can the 1,000 party begin again. 'When he comes back,' Dan says of his God of Love, 'he’s gonna be smoking a doobie, saying, ""Tired of this world? Well, it’s time to party."" I really believe it.' Ron Lafferty is cuffed after his court hearing in a courtroom in Provo, Utah in 2005 as he  appealed his 1996 death sentence. Lafferty's attorneys contend that his legal team during the 1996 trial provided him with ineffective counsel . Lafferty says he hadn't talked to the couple for years and didn't know of their plans or mindset. 'I'll miss them, but I'm happy for them,' he said. 'I believe they're in paradise now.' Lafferty, who is polite and friendly in conversation, has a self-devised philosophy that he refers to as his insanity; though he says he's not crazy. 'My 'insanity' messes with people's lives,' he said. 'It's just the way it is.' Strack and her husband believed that the apocalypse was near just before they killed themselves with a drug overdose and took their three children with them. Friends and family thought that meant they would one day move somewhere remote and live 'off the grid,' but no one thought they'd kill themselves, police said. Police still aren't sure exactly what led them to commit suicide in September. But Lafferty communicated with Kristi Strack like she was one of his children, police said. When she suffered a bout with ovarian cancer, there was talk about Lafferty being able to cure it. Investigation: Chief Scott Finlayson speaks during a news conference about the Strack family on Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2015, at Springville, Utah . On Tuesday, Springville Police Chief J. Scott Finlayson said authorities concluded their investigation into the deaths and said the cause was 'drug toxicity'. Benjamin Strack, 37, hadn't been to work for a week when Kristi Strack's older son from a previous marriage found the family's bodies in a locked bedroom Sept. 27. Police found traces of a lethal drug mixture in a child's sand pail in the room. Investigators also found several empty methadone bottles, 10 empty boxes of nighttime cold medicine and two boxes of allergy medicine in their garbage, along with a red liquid in Pepsi cups. They also found a pitcher of red juice, a purple bucket with yellow liquid, a bag of marijuana and other medications, including sleeping pills, inside the home. Mr Strack had high levels of heroin in his system, while his wife had methadone, dextrorphan, diphenhydramine and doxylamine in her system, and both deaths were ruled as suicides. All three children died from diphenhydramine and methadone; the two youngest children's deaths were ruled homicides. Author: Colorado-based author Jon Krakauer speaks during an interview, in Denver.

"Lorena Oberg (pictured) swears by vitamin drips and says they make her feel like a different woman . Lorena Oberg lies down on the clinical white bed and clenches her fist in preparation for the needle and cannula being inserted into a vein in her arm. While it might appear that the 47-year-old is receiving urgent medical treatment she is, in fact, paying hundreds of pounds for the privilege of having a cocktail of vitamins and minerals pumped directly into her bloodstream via a drip. Lorena insists that it is worth every penny, and that the discomfort of being fed through an intravenous drip for up to four hours is just the price you pay for looking ten years younger and buzzing with the energy of a 20-year-old. Vitamin drips have been dubbed ‘party drips’ because of their popularity as a hangover cure among celebrities. Underwear model Poppy Delevingne was the latest to post a picture of herself on Twitter hooked-up to one a few weeks ago. Her sister, Cara, did the exact same thing a year earlier. Yet Lorena is no A-list model. She’s a working mother-of-two who sees her £500-a-month drip ‘habit’ as money well spent as an antidote to her busy life. And there seems to be a growing set of women who, like her, are willing to pay hundreds at a time for a ‘mother’s little helper’ — a combination of vitamins and minerals that could include anything from vitamin C to the minerals magnesium and potassium and glutathione, an antioxidant. Additionally, there is a new supplement that many women — like Lorena — add to the cocktail. It’s called NAD+, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and is a co-enzyme responsible for repairing cells. However, as we age our NAD+ levels fall, and a diet low in nutrients and high in alcohol can deplete us yet further. ‘I had my children quite late in life in my mid-30s and am also very busy running two beauty clinics, so I worried that they were missing out on having a mum with enough energy to do the things they love,’ says Lorena, from Caterham, Surrey. ‘Since I started having drips a year ago I’m like a different woman. I can go to bed at 1am and still be up early and fresh for work. What’s more, I still have energy at weekends to go roller-skating and dry-slope skiing with my children.’ Yet doctors are dubious about the benefits of taking extra nutrients this way, and say it could actually do you harm. Dr Adam Cunliffe, principal lecturer in nutrition at London’s South Bank University, says there is no solid proof that vitamin infusions have any real health benefits. Likewise, there is not enough clinical evidence to prove the benefits of NAD+ injections. ‘The benefits for people who are ostensibly well, who just want to gain some kind of advantage in how they feel or to recover from a misspent weekend, are not clear,’ he says. ‘I can’t look up research papers to see how beneficial this is, because it’s largely anecdotal. Scroll down for video . The procedure involves having a cocktail of vitamins and minerals pumped directly into your bloodstream via a drip (pictured) ‘Celebrity endorsement makes lots of people want to try it. If somebody is deficient in a nutrient, the drip will help them return to normal levels. The problem is that most people who go for these things are not tested to see if they are low in anything.’ This concern is shared by Dr Sarah Tonks, who runs the Omniya Clinic in Knightsbridge, London. She says blood tests for deficiencies ramp up the cost of treatment and — unlike her clinic — not all practitioners insist on them. ‘It’s pointless giving people vitamins they may not need,’ she says. ‘But worse than that, it could be dangerous because too much magnesium or potassium could, in people with a pre-existing weakness, cause a heart attack.’ Incorrect dosing could also harm the kidneys and liver if they are unable to process the excess minerals. Very high sodium levels can even cause seizures and coma and in rare cases the drips could trigger a fatal allergic reaction. John Gillen, director of the Bionad clinic in London, introduced the NAD+ drips to the UK two years ago. There is currently not enough clinical evidence to prove the benefits of NAD+ injections . However, Dr Tonks says, many people with a range of conditions — including asthma, auto-immune diseases and chronic fatigue syndrome — do report improvements. ‘A friend of mine who is a professor of neurology in the States prescribes IV magnesium for people with migraines as many sufferers are deficient in this,’ says Dr Tonks. John Gillen, director of the Bionad clinic in London, introduced NAD+ drips to the UK two years ago and has seen their popularity rocket. As well as the scores of clients who come to the clinic, a nurse also does around ten visits each week to ‘high-end celebrities and VIPs’ who prefer to be treated in the comfort of their own home. Due to demand, Bionad is extending its London clinic and plans to open a second in Saudi Arabia this year. So why do so many consider this extreme technique a better way to get their nutrients than through food or vitamin pills? The vitamin injections have attracted a large celebrity following, Poppy Delevingne recently shared a photo on Instagram (above) where she was also using the vitamin injections . The answer is that it’s administered in larger amounts and fed directly into the blood stream. According to John, the bulk of his clients are middle-aged, middle-class career women, desperate for an boost to cope with their busy lives. ‘This is the same social group that is also seeing an increase in alcoholism,’ says John. ‘And what some of these women have discovered is that NAD+ is the first thing to be depleted when the body is trying to detoxify itself of alcohol. By replenishing it you can stem the damage to cells, as well as minimising the symptoms of a hangover. ‘We also have party people who come to us every Monday morning after drinking from Thursday night to the early hours of Monday morning. We of course counsel them that this is not good practice and over time they report that they are drinking less.’ As well as clients coming in to the clinic the nurses also does around ten home visits each week to ‘high-end celebrities and VIPs’ Karen Lovell, 56, paid an extra £1,200 for a full blood test before beginning her vitamin therapy at the Omniya Clinic — and discovered she had B12 deficiency, anaemia and was low in vitamin D. Karen, a divorced mother of two grown-up sons, with a demanding career as a business development manager and a commute into London from Buckinghamshire, says life had been overwhelming her. ‘I leave home at 6.30am and am rarely back before 7.30pm,’ she says. ‘I live the life of someone 20 years younger than me and it was really taking its toll. I’d crawl into bed exhausted every night.’ She made numerous visits to her GP complaining of a lack of energy and an inability to sleep, and at one point even thought she was depressed. ‘Until last summer I had no energy, I couldn’t drag myself to the gym nor could I face meeting friends for dinner,’ says Karen. ‘I’d also put on more than a stone. ‘But since I’ve been having drips every two months, I’ve got bags of energy. ‘The drips have given me my life back and although, at £500 a session it’s expensive, I earn the money so I deserve to spend it on making myself feel better.’ Robyn Puglia is another convert. She is convinced that vitamin drips helped her overcome a severe episode of coeliac disease — an auto-immune condition that flared up after she was given pasta containing gluten. Robyn, 34, a nutritionist who lives in London with her physicist husband Stephen, felt ill for three months — exhausted and with inflamed skin — until she booked into IV Boost UK in London. She now visits the clinic twice a month — forking out £150 a time. ‘I remembered hearing about vitamin drips in the States studying and, when my symptoms persisted, I decided it was worth a go,’ says Robyn. ‘I felt better after the first treatment. Lorena (pictured) uses the vitamin £500 a month vitamin injections as a way of dealing with her busy life as a working mother-of-two . ‘I have a good diet but I lead a busy life, so fortnightly visits to the clinic give me an extra boost. ‘Why stop something that’s obviously helping me?’ she adds. However, Dr Joshua Berkowitz, a specialist at IV Boost UK, says the real question to ask is whether the benefits to vitamin drips are, in fact, all in the mind. ‘Is there any hard science that can prove it works? Not that I have read,’ he says. ‘People may say the improvements in health could be psychosomatic, and I would accept that’s true. ‘But perhaps there’s an element of that with everything in the medical world, other than surgery. What I do know is that patients report enough of an improvement to keep coming back.’ And his and other clinics are, of course, relying on those who spend thousands of pounds on the treatment — among them Lorena, Karen and Robyn — keeping the faith.","It's been championed by various celebrities including Poppy Delevingne .

"Victoria's Secret sales associates have been accused of plus-size and age discrimination by disappointed and dejected customers. After a redditor wrote an open letter addressed to Victoria’s Secret, accusing its staff of sending plus-size women to Lane Bryant for bras despite sizes going up to 40DDD, other customers have come forward to share their disappointment in the lingerie retailer. 'I am plus-sized and came in looking for some lingerie for a special occasion and the seventeen-year-old, size three sales associate, while looking down her nose at me, told me that I'd be better off going to Lane Bryant and that her store had nothing for me,' commented Sara Crow on Styleite. Victoria's Secret sales associates have been accused of plus-size and age discrimination by disappointed and dejected customers . Another women admitted that this happened to her twice, at two different stores in different states. 'I don't go in there anymore even though I know they have my size,' wrote Humorless Feminist. 'I am tired of the world being full if presumptuous jerks who think that because they like a particular aesthetic they're entitled to treat people who fall outside of it with disrespect.' Meanwhile Alara Morningstar said she doesn't shop at Victoria's Secret anymore because she is a 'big girl'. 'I've gone to many stores, not even shopping for myself, and gotten the ""we don't have anything for people like you.""' And a woman by the name of Mary W, who wears a size 40C, says she has been turned away by Victoria's Secret saleswomen. 'I searched their racks for my size only to be told that they don't carry my cup size that big and to go to Lane Bryant.' Victoria's Secret does, however, carry bra sizes in 40C. The largest bra size the retailer goes up to is 40DDD, and the largest underwear size is XL. The redditor who penned the original accusations believes that Victoria's Secret employees are discriminating against certain women, refusing to sell them bra that they have in stock. In her letter, the woman identifies as a Soma lingerie employee. 'Far too often we hear horror stories about women, or once even a husband looking for a nice gift for his wife, being told they are ""plus sized"" and ""in the wrong store."" A dismissive sales associate told another woman she was 'too old,' and sent her to Lane Bryant and Soma, writes the redditor. 'I would like to take the opportunity to use this woman's story to remind you, that here in the real world, where we don’t all look like Adriana and Behati, we still want to feel beautiful.

"Scientists tracking the spread of Ebola have warned the virus is showing signs of mutating . Scientists tracking the spread of the Ebola in West Africa have warned the virus is showing signs of mutating, and could become more contagious. It was a team of researchers from the Institut Pasteur in France who first identified the outbreak in Guinea, in March last year. Patient zero - the first person to be infected - has been identified as two-year-old Emile Ouamouno from the rural village of Meliandou. He died four days after he fell ill with a sky-high fever and vomiting in December 2013. Just weeks later his sister succumbed to the disease, followed by their mother and grandmother. From there the virus spread, before the scientists at Institut Pasteur identified it as Ebola three months later after it was reported to the health authorities. The team have since been tracing the virus' spread through Guinea, to establish if the disease could become more contagious. They have started the process of examining hundreds of blood samples from Ebola patients in the West African nation where the first cases struck in December 2013. Human geneticist Dr Anavaj Sakuntabhai, told the BBC: 'We know the virus is changing quite a lot. 'That's important for diagnosing and for treatment. We need to know how the virus (is changing) to keep up with our enemy.' He told Radio 4's Today programme viruses have to 'fight a balance' between infecting people and spreading. 'We have seen several cases that don't have any symptoms at all when infected,' he said. 'These people may be the ones who could spread the virus better, we do not know yet. 'A virus can change from more deadly into less deadly but more contagious and that is something we are afraid of.' Viruses do change over a period of time. Ebola is an RNA virus, similar to HIV and influenza, and as such it has a high rate of mutation. But while it is not surprising the virus is mutating, experts said, we cannot predict how it will evolve. Dr Marta Tufet, science portfolio developer at the Wellcome Trust, which is funding one of the experiment vaccinations in development, said the longer the virus remains infecting the human population, 'the more likely it is to mutate and adapt to its environment'. But she cautioned: 'There is really no precedent for any known RNA virus to mutate so radically that it would change its mode of transmission.' People can only catch Ebola by coming into contact with the bodily fluids - urine, vomit, diarrhoea - of an infected individual. It is not an airborne disease, and as such cannot be transmitted through infected people coughing or breathing in open spaces. Dr Tufet added: 'HIV is another RNA virus that mutates all the time and has been circulating in far more people than Ebola, yet its route of transmission remains unchanged.' While acknowledging it is important to study the way Ebola is changing to help better understand how to tackle it, and how it responds to vaccines and drugs, she said a suggestion the virus could become airborne is 'unfounded'. Scroll down for video . The Ebola epidemic in West Africa has claimed more than 8,000 lives in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, but the World Health Organisation say the outbreak has now entered its 'second phase' with the focus shifting to ending the crisis . 'It risks detracting from the important issues at hand,' she added. Echoing Dr Tufet's thoughts, Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham said it is a well known fact that viruses mutate. 'Even if the virus is mutating, we don't know what impact, if any, those genetic changes are having,' he said. 'Asymptomatic infection is not a new thing, it's been seen in past outbreaks. 'Why some people remain well while others die is not clear, but it's most likely down to the host, our own genetic make-up has a massive influence on how viral infections affect us.' It's feasible, he said, that changes in the virus could change the severity of the infection but said the truth is scientists do not yet have the answers. 'That's why studying virus and host genetics is important,' he added. 'When at last we have those answers, then we can start to determine their possible impact.' Meanwhile the World Health Organisation (WHO) said there were fewer than 100 cases in a week for the first time since June. In the week from January 25 there were 30 cases in Guinea, four in Liberia and 65 in Sierra Leone. The WHO said the epidemic has entered a 'second phase' with the focus shifting to ending the outbreak.","Researchers in France believe the Ebola virus is showing signs of mutating .

Europe's answer to a 'space taxi' is now poised and ready to launch on a February 11 test flight. Pictured is the Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) flight model during the last preparations at Torino in Italy . On February 11, the Vega rocket will be launching the unmanned space plane from Kourou, French Guiana, to undertake a 100-minute test flight. The initial launch had been scheduled for November 18, but Arianespace in October announced a postponement 'to carry out additional flight trajectory analyses'. Studded with 300 sensors, the prototype IXV will collect data on the craft's handling and thermodynamics.

"Alan Barnes was left with sight and growth problems due to his mother contracting German measles during pregnancy. He now weighs just six stone and is 4ft 6in tall . A disabled 67-year-old who is just 4ft 6in tall was attacked by a cowardly thug who demanded money as he was putting his bins out. Alan Barnes was born with sight and growth problems after his mother contracted German measles during pregnancy. He now weighs just six stone and is partially sighted. He was the victim of a sickening attack outside his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear on Sunday night in a crime that has shocked his neighbours and relatives. Frail Mr Barnes was pushing his bin from the back of his home to the front at around 6.30pm when he was targeted. He was knocked to the ground, breaking his collar bone as he landed. The mugger demanded money and searched Mr Barnes' pockets before realising his stricken victim was not carrying cash and fleeing. Mr Barnes stumbled to the house next door where his neighbour called his sister Carol Hill, who rushed over and took her brother to hospital, where X-rays revealed the fractured collar bone. Mr Barnes, a committed Christian, said: 'Someone just jumped on me. It all happened in a very short time. I would like to see him caught because he might do it again. 'I didn't see him coming. He must have jumped on me from a back garden. 'He pushed me down and put his hands in my pockets, then told me to give him my money, but I didn't have any. 'I shouted ""help"" and then he ran off. As soon as he had gone I got up, and I knew I had been hurt.' Mr Barnes's broken collar-bone will take nearly two months to heal, in which time he will need special care. He added: 'I'm just frustrated now that I can't do anything for myself. They say it will take four to six weeks for me to recover. 'I'm trying to do the best I can. I can manage to get a bath if someone puts the water in. But I can't tie my shoelaces.' Ms Hill is furious that anyone would stoop so low as to attack her frail brother. The 55-year-old said: 'The police seem to think it was a random opportunist attack. But they must have seen Alan as an easy target. 'I was furious. Whoever has done this has no morals at all to attack someone so vulnerable.' Mr Barnes is well known in the area around his home and is an active member of the congregation at his local Methodist church. He fills his days taking long walks around the area. He is known as a skilled mathematician and impresses youngsters by being able to quickly work out exactly how many days a person has been alive after finding out when they were born. His sister believes he was targeted because he is an 'easy target'. Police are appealing for information . Mr Barnes is now too frightened to return to his home, and Ms Hill is helping her brother look for new accommodation. Detectives hunting the would-be robber have branded the crime 'disgraceful'. Det Con Chris Neil, of Gateshead CID, said: 'This was a cowardly assault on a vulnerable man who wasn't able to defend himself. 'His disability means he is partially sighted and quite short and it's disgraceful that someone would target him. 'The victim is quite a well-known man in the area and this has left him extremely distressed. 'We're doing everything we can to trace the suspect and I would urge anyone who saw this attempted robbery or who has information about the person responsible to get in touch.' Locals have launched a fund to help Mr Barnes and have so far raised more than £1,400, which they plan to give to the pensioner to make his house more secure or to help him move home. Anyone with any information should target Northumbria Police quoting log number 1180 25/01/15 or the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","Alan Barnes, 67, has suffered growth and sight problems since birth .

A magnificent coastline of some 300 miles surrounds Cornwall, offering pristine beaches that are superbly maintained by the local authorities. The Cornwall Tin Mine is one of the popular spots for sightseers to learn more about the county's history . Storms over the National Trust owned Godrevy Point and its lighthouse, near St Ives, Cornwall are a sight to behold and remember . Fountains Abbey in Ripon, North Yorkshire, is a beautiful spot for a bit of history in the summer . Captivating fishing harbours as well as the perfect spot for fans of watersports make Cornwall such a popular tourist destination in the UK.

Runner-up in the most picturesque list was Yorkshire, complete with its two national parks (North York Moors and the Yorkshire Dales). They polled 18 per cent. Yorkshire features over 800 attractions, from World Heritage Sites to mining museums, ruined castles and abbeys, to hands on museums. You'll find serene gardens and unique breweries, thrilling rides and industrial heritage. From attractions and museums to sports and galleries, from the history-lover to the inquisitive child, there's something for everyone. In third spot was Cumbria, who have their own national park in the Lake District, scored 11.5 per cent. The county is best known for containing the Lake District National Park, an area some 30 miles across, containing England's highest mountains (four over 3000 ft), and some of England's biggest lakes. Looking down towards Seathwaite Valley from Sour Milk Gill in the Lake District, UK, it's clear to see why Cumbria snared third place . Devon came fourth in the list of England's most picturesque counties with 11 per cent of the vote . The county contains the Eden Valley, part of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding natural Beauty (AONB), the western end of Hadrian's Wall, and some 180 miles of coastline along the county's west coast. Cumbria has something to offer all visitors, young and old, those seeking adventure, and those seeking peace and quiet, with its history, landscape of mountains and lakes, and much more. Tom Lowes of Sykes Cottages said: 'Cornwall has always been a favourite destination of ours at Sykes Cottages so we were thrilled to see it top the list. The view of the Kent village of Goudhurst from the church tower is akin to something out of a fairy tale, and right, the Oast houses in Horsmonden are unique in their own special way . 'It's also unsurprising that Yorkshire and Cumbria rank highly thanks to their spectacular National Parks.

"For those looking for romance, a quick trip to the country may just be worth your while. A recent study has found that Britain's single hotspots are found in some rather unlikely locations. While you may think that London or Manchester would be brimming with daters, it's actually the little-known towns, such as West Malling, Kent, or Northallerton, North Yorkshire that boast the highest number of active singles by population. Wouldn't this make a lovely date spot? St Leonard's Tower is in West Malling, Kent, which is one of the UK's singleton hotspots . Looking for love in London? Think again! For the best chances at romance, try a smaller town, like Huntington, Cambridgeshire . In fact, according to match.com, both towns have more than eight times as many daters per 1000 population than the capital. 1. West Malling, Kent . 2. Northallerton, North Yorkshire . 3. Huntington, Cambridgeshire . 4. Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire . 5. Prescot, Merseyside . 6. Cheadle, Greater Manchester . 7. Stockton Heath, Cheshire . 8. Epsom, Surrey . 9. Leigh-On-Sea, Essex . 10. Windsor, Berkshire . 11. Truro, Cornwall . 12. Malborough, Wiltshire . 13. Cambridge, Cambridgeshire . 14. Cirencester, Gloucestershire . 15. Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire . 16. Chichester, West Sussex . 17. Bridgnorth, Shropshire . 18. Banstead, Surrey . 19. Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warwickshire . 20. Marlow, Buckinghamshire . Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire and Aberdeen are also home to highly concentrated populations of singles. Match.com Managing Director, Karl Gregory, says: 'Although big cities have more singles in total, their greater populations mean that they are not as concentrated as in these small hotspots.' And it may just be worth a trip. Though West Malling, Kent, is not known for its nightlife, the small market town is famous for its historic buildings, such as St. Leonard's Tower, and its cricketing heritage. The village, with a population of 2,266, has the highest number of active daters in proportion to its population. Keep an eye out for a potential mate while taking in the town's quaint surroundings, which include a 1966 abbey church, used by the Anglican Benedictine nuns. For those in further North, it may be time to visit Northallerton in North Yorkshire (population 16,832) and Aberdeen in the Scottish Highlands. Aberdeen, Scotland's third most populous city, offers plenty of first date picks to suit any taste. From dolphin spotting excursions and scenic fishing village strolls to the contemporary Aberdeen Art Gallery, the city is full of options for young workers who've relocated for work. Northallerton in North Yorkshire also has a large percentage of daters. Pictured: Market Cross High Street . In Scotland, Aberdeen is home to many young adults looking for love - especially after so many oil industry workers have re-located to the city . Users in more than 500 towns and cities from across the UK were analysed as part of the project. Gregory added: 'Some of these [results] are more easily explained than others. Aberdeen, for example, has a number of workers who have re-located to the city due to its oil industry, and people in a new town may be more likely to use dating sites to find a partner or just meet some new people. 'Places such as West Malling or Northallerton though are a bit more of a mystery. We can only assume that in smaller towns such as these, good news spreads fast, and that those who have found dates or met a partner through sites like match.com recommend their friends also try the service.'","Match.com has found the UK's single hotspots: Kent and North Yorkshire .
West Malling & Northallerton have highest number of singles by population .
Aberdeen's influx of workers have also caused number of daters to spike ."
"Losing weight without dieting or exercising is every slimmer’s dream come true. Now, a Nasa scientist has developed an 'ice jacket'  he claims  allows people to burn 500 calories a day - the equivalent of a Big Mac, two Snickers bars or four slices of bacon. The Cold Shoulder Jacket  cools the body so it has to work harder to stay warm, burning more calories in the process. Professor Wayne Hayes, of University of California and a visiting scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, claims the jacket will burn 1lb of fat a week when worn for two hours a day. In fact, it more than doubles the fat burning achieved from dieting alone, he says. Scroll down for video . Professor Wayne Hayes, of University of California and a visiting scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has developed the Cold Shoulder jacket - which he claims burns an extra 500 calories a day when worn for around two hours . The jacket contains gel packs made of ice (pictured above in white). These cool the body, forcing it to generate more heat - and burn more calories - to stay warm. But because the ice is placed on the shoulders and back, where there are fewer nerve endings, the user doesn't feel uncomfortably cold and doesn't shiver, Professor Hayes claims . The jacket is kept in the freezer, so when it is taken out and put on the skin it will be the same temperature as the freezer. The ice melts to 0°C and cools the back, neck and shoulders, where most of the body's fat-burning and heat-generating 'brown' fat is found. Brown fat burns more calories when the body is cold . 'It could be used for people trying to lose weight, or for damage control, offsetting a temporary binge such as over the holidays,' he told MailOnline . 'My wife intends to use it for post-childbirth weight loss.' The jacket is a waistcoat which drapes gel packs of ice over the shoulders and across the back. It is kept in the freezer so it remains chilled - and should then be worn when a person is at a comfortable temperature and not exercising. ‘If you are sitting down at rest in a room (or your car, or whatever) that is at a comfortable temperature,’ Professor Hayes told MailOnline. ‘Then wearing The Cold Shoulder directly from the freezer, and with a shirt underneath, will extract heat from your body and cause you to burn extra calories in order to stay warm.’ The vest will not work if a person is in a hot environment, or if are exercising, as it will simply keep the user cool but not force their body to burn more calories to stay warm, he warned. He claims the jacket isn't particularly uncomfortable to wear. 'The first time you wear it, yes, it'll feel cold,' he said. 'But you won’t shiver. After trying it a few times, you’ll hardly notice you’re wearing it.' The comfort factor is the incentive for wearing the jacket and not turning off the heating, he said. The Cold Shoulder jacket drapes ice over the back and shoulders. Under the skin of the shoulders and back is where most of the body’s brown fat, or brown adipose tissue, is found. Adults have a small amount of this brown or ‘good’ fat in this area. The jacket can help people burn 500 calories a day - a pound a week, Professor Hayes says . This fat is different to the white fat, which is amassed from gorging on too many calories. Brown fat is made of several fat droplets and large numbers of iron-containing mitochondria, which – along with blood vessels – is which is what gives the fat its brownish appearance. It burns calories to generate heat, and burns calories when a person enters mild cold. Professor Hayes claims cooling the body  will force brown fat to burn more calories to generate heat. His own clinical trials found wearing the Cold Shoulder vest twice a day for about an hour burns up to 500 calories more per day than a person would burn without it. That's the equivalent of 1lb a week. 'If you turn off your heating in winter your whole body will be cold and you'll be uncomfortable. This way you won't be uncomfortable. It's a ""cheat's way"" of being cold,' he told MailOnline. The jacket works using a phenomenon known as mild cold exposure, which Professor Hayes said has long been studied by scientists. ‘Any mild cold exposure causes your body to burn extra calories, whether it’s a cold day outside, air conditioning set too high, or your skin being in contact with a cold object,’ he said. He added: ‘Scientists have been studying the effects of mild cold exposure for decades, and it’s a well documented fact that mild cold exposure induces calorie burn.' The shoulders and back is the most comfortable place to put the ice because that’s where the body has the fewest nerve endings, he explained. Mild cold exposure has no known side effects, and has long been studied by scientists as a way to burn calories, Professor Hayes said. However, he warns it is not a panacea for weight loss as its effect can easily be nullified by eating an extra 500 calories . This area is also where most of the body’s brown fat, or brown adipose tissue is found. Adults have a small amount of this brown or ‘good’ fat in this area. This fat is different to the white fat, which is amassed from gorging on too many calories. Brown fat is made of several fat droplets and large numbers of iron-containing mitochondria, which – along with blood vessels – is which is what gives the fat its brownish appearance. It burns calories to generate heat, and burns calories when a person enters mild cold. Therefore cooling the area of the body where brown fat is found – the back and shoulders – will force brown fat to burn more calories to generate heat, Professor Hayes said. Big Mac: 550 calories . Half a tub (500ml) of Ben & Jerry's Cookie Dough ice cream: 555 . Two Snickers bars: 500 calories . Four slices of streaky bacon: 500 calories . Bottle of Sauvignon Blanc wine: 595 calories . He warns that too much cold exposure can be fatal. ‘On the other hand, mild cold exposure is perfectly healthy, and has been studied by scientists for decades as a way to burn calories.’ His own clinical trials, of eight people, found wearing the Cold Shoulder vest twice a day for about an hour burns up to 500 calories more per day than a person would burn without it. However, he warns the jacket is not a panacea to weight loss - it can simply aid fat burning for people who are reducing their calorie intake. He said: 'The vest can burn up to 500 calories per day if used as directed, but you can easily nullify the effect by eating an extra 500  calories. 'So don't expect that you can continue to eat junk food, wear the vest, and lose weight. You can't.' And while it might seem like an extreme way to lose weight, he argues it’s no more wacky than other methods. He said: ‘Think of all the other crazy things people do in order to try to lose excess fat. Starving themselves? While cooling the body might seem like an extreme way of burning calories, Professor Hayes (pictured) argues it is no more wacky than other methods such as starving oneself, wearing a corset or liposuction . ‘Eating zero-calorie clay just to feel full, which carries a risk of arsenic poising? Exhausting themselves in the gym? Ingesting questionable supplements that, if they work at all, have side effects like insomnia or over‐stimulation? ‘How about wearing a corset just to appear thinner? Drug injections? Liposuction? Freezing fat cells? Gastro‐intestinal surgery?’ He concluded: ‘Considering these options, wearing a cool, calorie-burning vest is pretty tame in comparison.’ The jacket costs $160 and will be available in sizes XS to XXXL.

"A man who was trapped inside his body for years following a mystery childhood illness has revealed how he overcame unimaginable hurdles to become independent again - and find love. Martin Pistorius, who grew up in South Africa and now lives in England, was just 12 when he slipped into an inexplicable comatose state and spent the next dozen years trapped inside his body. Speaking to the Today show in his first U.S. television interview, he showed how far he has come since doctors realized he was aware of his surroundings  - including completing a degree, learning how to drive and getting married. 'I thought, ""I have so much love inside of me and nobody to give it to"",' the 39-year-old recalled, using a computer to speak. Scroll down for videos . Miraculous: Martin Pistorius, pictured during an interview with the Today show, slipped into an inexplicable coma when he was 12 and remained trapped inside his body for years before people realized he was aware . Happy together: In 2008, he met his sister's friend Joanna, left, and said it was love at first sight . But on New Year's Day 2008, he met his sister's friend Joanna and knew she was The One. 'It is hard to explain but you just know,' he said. 'I had heard people say that and always thought ""yeah right"" until it happened to me.' Joanna, who sat beside him during the interview, said she felt it too. '[He] had such a nice smile and I just thought he's really attractive,' she said. 'He seemed like such a kind person.' The couple, who married in 2009, are now hoping to start a family. Pistorius is able to have biological children, his wife said. It is a life that, 20 years ago, his family never could have imagined he would have. One day in January 1988, when he was 12, he was sent home early from school with a sore throat and his condition quickly deteriorated. His mobility was the first to go, followed by his memory, and he was left completely unresponsive. His muscles wasted away and his hands and feet curled in on themselves. Before: Pistorius is pictured (second right) with his parents and siblings before he was taken ill in 1988 . Bizarre: Doctors were unable to explain why he had fallen ill. He was left unable to communicate or move . Doctors were never able to conclusively pinpoint the exact cause, but cryptococcal meningitis was the most likely culprit. 'We were told to take him home and take care of him until he died,' his father told the Today show. But a couple of years later, Pistorius started becoming aware of his surroundings again even though he could not tell his family. He said he would attempt to move but it would go unnoticed. 'For so many years, I was like a ghost,' he told the Today show from his Essex home. 'I could hear and see everything, but it was like I wasn't there. I was invisible.' Every day, his father would take him to a care center for eight hours, return at the end of the day and then take him home to be bathed and put to bed. He said the powerlessness was terrifying. 'Every single aspect of your life is controlled and determined by someone else,' he said. 'They decided where you are, what you eat, whether you sit or lie down, in what position you lie in, everything.' For days on end when he was  17 and 18, he would be put in front of the children's television show 'Barney & Friends', and he says the thought of the purple dinosaur is still painful for him. Overwhelmed: Pistorius' parents, Rodney and Joan, were unaware that their son started to understand them when he was about 16. At one point, Joan told him that she hoped he would die . Struggle: When he was 26, a nurse realized that he seemed to understand her and told his parents to get him tested. It emerged that he did understand and slowly he re-learned how to read and communicate again . 'Barney played, I guess you could say, a tormenting role in my life,' he said. 'For years, I would get flashbacks and have nightmares.' Instead, he tried to pass the time by looking at how the seasons changed, how the light moved across his room or how plants grew. His inner life kept him busy, he said. 'I used to live in my mind,' he said. 'I've had conversations with myself and other people all in my head. I'd imagine I was doing all sorts of things.' His condition also caused pain for his family. One night, his mother told him that she hoped he died. She did not know that he could hear it. Pistorius said he isn't angry at his mother for what she said. 'I felt only love and compassion for my mother,' he said. 'My mother often felt that she wasn't a good mom and couldn't take care of me. One of the hardest things for me was I couldn't tell her that, 'No, you are doing great'.' Eventually, in 2001, a new worker at his care center started sitting with him every day, and noticed that he was giving her small signals that suggested he was aware of his surroundings. At age 26, Martin passed a test by identifying pictures of various items with his eyes. Love of his life: In 2008, he met Joanna, pictured, and she said she was immediately drawn to his smile . By his side: The couple married in 2009 and live in England, where they hope to start a family soon . Fighter: The couple chat with NBC reporter Kate Snow at their Essex home. Pistorius uses a computer, pictured, to help him speak. He said it came with an American accent but he changed it to South African . Joan, his mother, quit her job as a radiographer and spent the next two years helping Martin master a computer program that enabled him to communicate. 'I don't think I will ever forget that feeling when my mom asked me what I'd like for supper and I said, ""Spaghetti Bolognese,"" and then she actually made that. I know that must seem insignificant, but for me, that was amazing,' he said. He had to learn everything again, including reading and how to have a conversation. He was also soon able to use a wheelchair and drive in a car that operates with his hands, and enrolled in a university to study computer science. He now works as a web designer and in 2011, he released his autobiography, Ghost Boy. But for him, the greatest joy was meeting Joanna. 'I probably have a somewhat unique perspective on life, I appreciate it a lot,' he told the Today show, with a smile across his face. 'The simple things... To have someone to share your life with, simply to cherish life.'","Martin Pistorius, 39, appeared on the Today show on Thursday morning in his first TV interview in the U.S.

"These shocking images shows the moment a wheelchair-bound cerebral palsy sufferer was carried out of a bar by bouncers who said he could only stay if he stood up. Troy Hitchins, 20, had gone to the pub with his friends on Saturday night, but was told he could only stay in the upstairs bar if he could get out of the wheelchair.

Mr Hitchins said he felt 'humiliated' by his ordeal and accused the pub of discrimination. 'I felt embarrassed, I felt really embarrassed when door staff carried me down the stairs. I felt everyone was watching me,' he said. 'I didn't argue when they said I could stay if I could stand because I'm not an argumentative person. 'Would they have said to a blind person, ""you can stay if you can see""? It was the first time I've been in the pub, but I won't go back.'

The pub has since apologised on its Facebook page, but said Mr Hitchins had to leave the upstairs area because of health and safety concerns . The talented wheelchair basketball player was carried up to the first-floor bar of The King's Head, in Birmingham, because the disabled lift was broken . But when bouncers spotted Mr Hitchins was upstairs, they informed the group they were breaching health and safety regulations and that he would have to go downstairs. His family now want to know why staff allowed friends to carry him up the stairs in the first place and demanded an apology. Mr Hitchins' mother Zakalin Sloly said: 'When I saw the picture of Troy being carried down the stairs, his head bowed, I could tell he was absolutely mortified.

In a lengthy Facebook post, the Mr Perry said staff were initially unaware Mr Hitchins had been taken upstairs. 'On behalf of the Kings Head, I would firstly like to apologise for any ill feeling felt by the disabled gentleman identified in the photograph. This was by no means intended,' he said. 'This decision was taken to comply with health and safety practices and to negate any risk to any disabled persons and our non-disabled patrons . 'To comply with the Equality Act 2010 we would offer the use of the ground floor to any person unable to utilise the Attic [upstairs bar].

"The Indonesian courts have received a request to review the death sentences of Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, their lawyers say. A Bali court registrar visited Kerobokan prison on Friday, where the Australians are jailed for their role in the Bali Nine heroin trafficking plot. Lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis said an application for a judicial review of the case had been accepted. 'It has been accepted, it will go to the courts, then it depends on the district court heads,' he told reporters. 'There should not be an execution because the legal process should be respected as well.' It comes after Sukumaran's grandmother delivered an impassioned plea for her grandson's life at a candlelight vigil in Sydney on Thursday night. Edith Visvanathan rose from her wheelchair in front of hundreds of supporters as she tearfully said 'Don't kill him. Please, don't kill him' after Indonesia's attorney general announced that Sukumaran and fellow Bali Nine inmate Andrew Chan were among the next drug offenders in line for execution. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine inmates Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) are among the next drug offenders in line for execution in Indonesia . Myuran Sukumaran's grandmother delivered an impassioned plea for her grandson's life at a candlelight vigil in Sydney on Thursday night . Mr Lubis said the review - the last legal effort to save the men - should consider the pair's rehabilitation over the past 10 years, and their right to life as protected in the constitution. But it's unclear whether these arguments will be considered, because of legal uncertainty over how many reviews a prisoner is entitled to have. Mr Lubis said Sukumaran and Chan should have every opportunity to seek justice. 'We have the constitutional right to file the PK and we hope the District Court of Denpasar will proceed,' he said. The PK is asking for the death sentences to be commuted to life, not an acquittal, he stressed. 'Those two men, the petitioners, have changed a great deal. 'They have become good men.' The attorney-general is reportedly of the view the PK should not proceed. But Mr Lubis said it wasn't his call to make: 'I'm dealing with the courts,' he said.

"Survivors of child sex abuse have received death threats after their names and confidential details were published by MPs after being leaked by the Government's inquiry into historic child abuse. A group of victims have written to the Home Secretary expressing 'grave concern' that documents leaked by a member of the  inquiry  were published online. The Home Affairs Select Committee published the documents on its website without blanking out the names of the victims, it has emerged. The revelation came after the Government admitted it had lost two confidential discs containing sensitive information - including the identity of the police marksman who killed Mark Duggan in 2011 sparking nationwide riots. Information relating to three judge-led inquiries including the fatal police shooting of Mr Duggan in Tottenham went missing after being sent in the post, the Ministry of Justice has admitted. Scroll down for video . Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz published leaked documents from the Government's child abuse inquiry . The group says that names and contact details of panel members have since been redacted from the site – but not before they were contacted and threatened. The Home Secretary Theresa May has written to Mr Vaz describing her 'dismay' at the Committee's decision to publish the documents, Sky News has reported. Mr Vaz is now understood to be apologising to the victims whose identities he accidentally exposed. The Committee released a statement tonight, admitting that it had published material which it had received without redacting the names of abuse survivors. The statement said: 'Last week some material from the Independent Panel Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse came into the Committee's possession in the course of our inquiry. 'The material included directions to Panel members about how they should answer questions from the Committee, as well as e-mail exchanges between Panel members about the Panel's external communications strategy. 'These e-mails included the names of third parties. At the request of the individuals concerned the material has been redacted to remove references to these individuals. The names of these individuals were already in the public domain. 'It is the policy of the Home Affairs Committee to publish all material it receives unless they concern matters of national security.' Ben Emmerson QC, the leading lawyer advising the inquiry, said the Home Secretary needed to disband it and set up a new investigation after details were leaked by panel member Sharon Evans . Member of the Independent panel inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse Sharon Evans has been accused of leaking information . One abuse survivor and his young daughter were approached by a convicted abuser after their details were published, it has been claimed. In a collective statement to the Home Secretary the group said: 'It has exposed us as individuals, making us feel vulnerable, and is having a huge impact on our work.' The news is likely to raise questions about the conduct of Mr Vaz, who earlier this week stated his intention to publish documents widely as a measure of 'transparency'. The documents also revealed the confidential details of a medical condition suffered by one survivor. The news is a further setback for the child abuse inquiry, which has been beset by controversy after two previous chairs were forced to step down after their links to establishment figures were revealed. Last week it emerged there was discord within the inquiry, as panel member and survivor Sharon Evans claimed she had been bullied by the inquiry's most senior legal adviser, Ben Emmerson QC. The government inquiry into child abuse has been without a chairman since November after Fiona Woolf resigned over links to the late Tory peer Lord Brittan . Fiona Woolf (left) resigned as committee chair - becoming the second inquiry head chosen by Theresa May (right) to step down . But on Monday Mr Emmerson told the Home Affairs Select Committee Mrs Evans had breached her duty of confidentiality and was diminishing the trust of survivors on the panel and its ability to protect sensitive details of past abuse from the general public. The Home Affairs Select Committee now stands accused of being embroiled in those breaches itself. A spokesperson for the Committee said that only the names of four survivors were revealed, and that those names have now been redacted. Bungling government officials have lost two discs containing the identity of the police marksman who killed Mark Duggan in 2011 sparking nationwide riots. Information relating to three judge-led inquiries including the fatal police shooting of Mr Duggan in Tottenham went missing in the post, the Ministry of Justice has admitted. Officials realised two discs containing documents on the Duggan case – as well as the police shooting of career criminal Azelle Rodney and the 1997 murder of Irish Catholic Robert Hamill in County Armagh - were lost in early January. The identity of the police marksman who killed Mark Duggan, sparking the 2011 London riots, has been lost . In a statement the MoJ said police have taken 'necessary steps' to ensure the protection of any officers whose information could be disclosed. The police marksman who killed Mr Duggan in north London in 2011, sparking nationwide riots, has never been made public, along with the identities of other officers involved in the case. Meanwhile, the Government has launched an investigation into the security breach of its guidelines and said disciplinary action will be taken if appropriate. A statement from the MoJ said: 'Government officials became aware on January 8 that two discs containing documents relating to these inquiries were missing, having been dispatched by post. Mark Duggan was shot and killed by a policeman . 'Immediate steps were taken, including intensive searches to locate the discs. These searches continue, with police assistance. The discs have not, as yet, been found.' It added: 'At this stage there is no evidence to indicate that the information loss arose from malicious intent. 'Nevertheless, it is essential to take the most precautionary view and to take all necessary steps to safeguard the interests of anyone whose information could be disclosed. 'Police and other agencies have undertaken their own risk assessment, and have identified and taken any steps necessary to ensure the protection of officers. 'The Rodney, Hamill and Duggan families and the three judges who conducted the inquiries and inquest have been informed. So too has the Information Commissioner's Office.' Lawyers are undertaking a review of the missing documents to discover if they held confidential or sensitive details, the MoJ said. A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said the force has undertaken a risk assessment of the material that was on the discs and has taken 'appropriate steps'. Labour's Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan MP attacked the security failure. He said: 'This is an appalling lapse in security concerning highly confidential information on very sensitive investigations. It would be disastrous if this data got into the wrong hands. 'The Justice Secretary needs to get an urgent grip on this situation and set out what the Government is doing to find this data and reassure the public that measures are in place to prevent it happening again.'","Survivors of child sex abuse have received death threats, it has emerged .

"James Blunt has been accused of homophobia after joking about 'picking up the soap' in the showers around fellow public schoolboys including David Cameron and Boris Johnson. The pop star faced a backlash after posting the comment online alongside a magazine front cover of himself under the words: 'Does it pay to be to posh'. The group were pictured sipping champagne and wearing white tie evening dress on the cover of the New Statesman, to go with an article on privilege and success. Blunt, 40, posted the image on Twitter and then joked: 'I won't be picking up the soap when this party moves to the showers.' Scroll down for video .

Lisa Gifford wrote: 'Just when I thought James Blunt couldn't be any more repugnant, he manages to put homophobia and a rape joke together.' It is not the first time Blunt has made similar jokes. In 2001, he told a US chat show host he had spent a lot of time with men at public school and as an army captain, adding: 'It wasn't my choice. I dropped the soap and it just happened.' Blunt, who is married to society beauty Sofia Wellesley, branded Labour's Chris Bryant a 'classist gimp' and a 'prejudiced wazzock' earlier this month after the MP said the arts were dominated by public school alumni such as him and Eddie Redmayne.","Blunt pictured with fellow public school boys such as David Cameron .

"The unwanted bodies of dozens of dead foreign ISIS fighters have been left to pile up in Iraqi hospitals. More than 100 corpses of Islamist combatants from 13 different countries are dispersed among the country's healthcare units. That's according to an unnamed, high-ranking official in the country's Interior Ministry, who told Arabic-language newspaper Akhbar Al Iraq that the dead jihadist's home countries refuse to accept them while local cemeteries won't take them either. Scroll down for video . ISIS forces prepare for battle in Iraq. More than 100 bodies of jihadists have piled up in the country's hospitals . The government is still trying to figure out what to do with the bodies, which are reportedly from European, Asian and Arab nations. According to the same official their countries of origin have told Iraq to 'Burn them or drown them, we don't want them. 'We took away their citizenship.' The official added: 'These nations wanted to send a message first to Iraq; a message of support against terrorism and radicalism, and second to tell the people who want to fight with ISIS that they mean nothing to their countries and people.' According to the London-based Arabic newspaper Al Quds Alarabi, Iraqi civilians and politicians are refusing to allow the foreign terrorists' bodies to be buried in cemeteries. Most of the fallen fighters were killed fighting Kurdish Peshmerga forces or were hit by coalition air strikes. The bodies of Islamic State fighters from abroad are often not wanted by their home countries . Some are jihadists who were executed for committing acts of terrorism. Several nations have moved to revoke citizenship of residents known to have left to join Islamic State. The ministry official said talks are underway with the nations involved to explore possible options for getting rid of the unwanted remains, including burial in the desert in western Iraq. But according to FoxNews.com, a colleague at the Interior Ministry denied the claims and said Iraq is responsible for burying bodies of Islamic State militants. A US State Department official told the website that, for American citizens who are killed fighting abroad, it is up to his or her family to decide whether to bring their remains home. The Iraqi government is still trying to figure out what to do with the corpses of more than 100 ISIS combatants . The official said: 'The Bureau of Consular Affairs will locate and inform the next-of-kin of the US citizen's death and provides information on how to make arrangements for local burial or return of the remains to the United States.' The latest data from the International Center for Study of Radicalization and Political Violence shows more than 20,000 foreign fighters have traveled to Iraq and Syria to join Islamic State. The highest numbers of Islamic State fighters come from the Arab world. Tunisia and Saudi Arabia have each documented more than 1,500 citizens who have joined Islamic State. Western Europe accounted 4,000 fighters, with France leading the rank with nearly 1,200 militants. There have been an estimated few hundred from the United States and Canada.","Combatants come from 13 different nations, according to unnamed official .

"An untouched Melbourne property which has been in the same family for generations has been placed on the market for the first time. The Fitzroy North home once belonged to war veteran Eric Worsley, who passed away at the age of 102 in 2013, after inheriting the house from his mother. 8 St George's Road South, now owned by Mr Worsley's carer, Maria, has been left in it's original condition out of respect, creating the distinct impression of a museum or time-capsule. Scroll down for video . 8 St George's Road South, Fitzroy North, has hit the market and is up for auction . Still filled with the belongings of Mr Worsley, a war veteran, and kitted out with peeling paint and well-worn furniture, the home is now up for grabs. The property is expected to sell for upwards of $640,000 when it goes up for auction on Valentines Day under the guidance of selling agent Steven Scalise, from Chambers Real Estate. 'The home means a lot to me. I grew up in this area and I used to go the picture theatre across the road,' said Maria. 'When I was a little girl there was a children's matinee show and all the local children would congregate out the front, and Eric said he could hear the chatter of the children waiting for the doors to open,' she told Fairfax Media. The mid-Victorian home has been left untouched by it's owner Maria, who was the former owner's carer . Maria said she left it in it's original condition out of respect for the former owner, Eric Worsley . Mr Worsley, a war veteran, passed away in 2013 at the age od 102 . The two-bedroom home has all the charm and antiquity of a well-loved family home, still lined with checkered linoleum and painted shades synonymous with the 1960's. The house even has old television sets, leather suitcases stacked atop a wardrobe, and a sunhat hanging from a dresser. The selling agent described the home as 'untouched by time', one of three matching decorative mid-Victorian terraces built as a trio. 'On entering you will discover a relic of an era long past that reads more like a meticulously constructed film set than original faded Victorian,' reads the property description.

"I'LL HAVE WHAT SHE'S HAVING . by Rebecca Harrington . (Virago £8.99) You can’t be a woman and not think you need to go on a diet or get a face transplant, writes Harrington at the start of her journey into the bizarre world of celebrity dieting. She exaggerates — but only a little. Like it or not, celebrities are role models for many of us. We crave their fame, glossy hair, glowing skin and fabulous post-baby bikini bodies. And whether from a prudent desire not to upset the public (adoration can turn sour in an instant, as Gwyneth, Angelina et al know only too well), or because they have books and fitness apps to flog, celebrities almost never admit that their astonishing beauty is a lucky accident of fate — the equivalent of winning the genetic lottery. Rebecca was surprised to find Gwyneth’s recipe for roast fish with anchovy salsa verde was delicious . Instead, they talk about superfoods, elimination diets and kale smoothies, holding out the tantalising possibility that, if only we had their self-discipline — and unlimited supplies of kale — we, too, could find ourselves sharing a joke at the Oscars with George and Amal Clooney. Fascinated by the fact that the easiest thing to discover about most celebs is what they consume, Harrington set herself the alarming task of following the diets recommended by 16 celebrities, from Gwyneth Paltrow to Pippa Middleton, to find out if we really are what we eat. Her self-imposed rules were simple: try to keep exactly to the diet recommended by her chosen celebrity. Also ‘buy any cookbook a celebrity wrote, even if it looked really bad. And I would try to employ exercise regimens, clothing choices or dinner parties when appropriate’. Would she achieve her ideal body at the end of it all? Would she have any friends left? There was only one way to find out. Paltrow, with her formidably wholesome diet and much-mocked lifestyle website, Goop, where she is currently recommending a chocolatey confection called sex bark and products from Californian health shop Moon Juice, is the Queen Bee of diet-conscious modern celebs. After a food allergy-related panic attack, she was inspired to write It’s All Good, a cookbook that eliminated ‘bad’ foods, such as bread, red meat and cow’s milk, in favour of healthier alternatives. The astonishing cost of the ingredients for Gwyneth’s seven-day detox — almost triple Harrington’s usual weekly food budget — was a shock, and the recipe for turkey and arugula meatballs came out an offputting shade of green. But when she consciously uncoupled from the diet, having followed it for ten days, she had lost 4 lb and discovered Gwyneth’s recipe for roast fish with anchovy salsa verde is totally delicious. From this high point, it was downhill all the way. Liz Taylor’s diet includes the cheering element of a ‘controlled pig-out’ (she liked a whole pizza followed by a hot fudge sundae), but it made Rebecca sick. Karl Lagerfeld’s regime involves ten Diet Cokes a day and a sinister recipe for quail (‘emaciated birds with dinosaur claws’). An attempt to live like Pippa Middleton, following the diet and exercise regime with which Kate’s sister apparently maintains her famous posterior, while holding themed parties from her book, Celebrate, came adrift when haggis, the essential ingredient of a Burns Night supper, proved illegal in New York. (It contains lung, apparently a prohibited substance in the city.) Harrington made do with a lung-free, tinned version, but it wasn’t the same. You can’t plunge a ceremonial dagger into the steaming heart of a tin. As the diets get more bizarre (Dolly Parton recommends chewing food then spitting it out), Harrington’s attempts to follow them become increasingly perfunctory. By the time she gets to Liz Hurley’s diet (vodka and tonic, watercress soup), she lasts three days. At the end of it all, her weight remained exactly the same, but she was surprised at how much insight she had gained into celebrities by following their diets: ‘I never quite imagined I would understand so much about the women I profiled through their food. ‘Jackie Kennedy was very refined. Liz Taylor just wanted to drink! Gwyneth is great at everything, even healthy eating . . . I had a certain affinity for all of them after a while.’ In the end, she concludes, we shouldn’t copy celebrities, but pity them. ‘Instead of derision, [they] need compassion! Their lives are horrible!’ A thought worth remembering next time you’re tempted to embark on Gwyneth’s Warming Winter Detox.","Rebecca Harrington tested out 16 diets recommended by celebrities .

"An outraged father has slammed rules which protect children with peanut allergies but allow children who have not been vaccinated against measles to sit next to his six-year-old son, who is recovering from leukemia. Carl Krawitt, from Corte Madera, California, is the father of Rhett, six, and daughter Annesley, eight. With Rhett recovering from a four-and-half-year battle with leukemia and, with California experiencing a measles outbreak, Mr Krawitt is worried his son could become infected with the illness while his immune system is still recovering. Left to right: Jodi, Annesley, Carl and Rhett Krawitt. Rhett is recovering from leukemia - his father has asked officials to stop children who are unvaccinated because of their family's personal beliefs entering school . Rhett underwent rounds of chemotherapy until his doctors last year declared he was in remission, but is not yet robust enough to be vaccinated. His father says it could be months before Rhett is healthy enough to get all of his immunizations. He is also at a higher risk of complications if he were to get measles because of his weakened immune system. Mr Krawitt has now taken the unusual step of asking school officials to bar entry to students who have not been vaccinated due to family beliefs. Rhett underwent chemotherapy for three years for his leukemia – because of this he has a weakened immune system compared to other children . The family live in Marin County, which has the highest rate of personal belief vaccination exemptions in the Bay Area, and one of the highest rates in California. Currently, 6.45 percent of children in Marin have a personal belief exemption, which allows parents to lawfully send their children to school unvaccinated against diseases like measles, polio, whooping cough and others. His son attends Reed Elementary in Tiburon, a school with a seven per cent personal belief exemption rate - the statewide average is 2.5 percent. Mr Krawitt told NPR: 'If you choose not to immunize your own child and your own child dies because they get measles, OK, that's your responsibility, that's your choice. 'But if your child gets sick and gets my child sick and my child dies, then your action has harmed my child.' Mr Krawitt said at a parents meeting at his daughter's school that a staff member told parents not to send peanut products to school, since a child or children had an allergy and could die. He told NPR that he replied: 'In the interest of the health and safety of our children, can we have the assurance that all the kids at our school are immunized?' He later found out that parents at the meeting were 'mad' that he asked the question as they do not immunize their children. Now he and his wife, Jodi, have emailed the district's superintendent, requesting that the district 'require immunization as a condition of attendance, with the only exception being those who cannot medically be vaccinated.' He replied them and said the district is monitoring the situation 'closely' and will take whatever actions necessary to ensure the safety of students. Reed Elementary in Tiburon (pictured) has a seven per cent personal belief vaccination exemption rate . Unvaccinated children in California are required to stay home for the entire incubation period during any contagious-disease outbreak in their school - which is 21 days for measles - but there is no precedent for excluding unvaccinated students when there are no confirmed cases of a disease. Marin County Public Health Officer Matt Willis told Yahoo Parenting: 'I see the father’s request as a prompt to have important conversations as a community regarding our ethical obligations to one another. 'While the Krawitts’ request to the school might not be going anywhere right now it is going somewhere as far as stimulating discussions.' Carl Krawitt makes dinner with son Rhett (left) and daughter Annesley (centre) in their home in Corte Madera . A measles outbreak that began at Disneyland last month has now spread to at least 95 people across the US. Those at risk of exposure who haven't been vaccinated have been warned to stay at home for 21 days or, if they must go out in public, to wear a mask. A California high school barred dozens of non-vaccinated students from school yesterday over concerns that a classmate may have contracted measles.. The US experienced a record number of measles cases last year, with 644 infections from 27 states, amid a resurgence in a disease that was largely eliminated in 2000.","Rhett Krawitt, aged six, is recovering from a four year battle with leukemia .

"Some of the very first cells to form life on Earth could be hiding on the moon. This is according to British scientists who believe evidence of the origins of life may be trapped beneath ancient lunar lava flows. They claim the molecules were flung towards the moon during the Late Heavy Bombardment - a time when Earth was bombarded by asteroids, and chunks of its material were thrown into space. Some of the very first cells to form life on Earth could be hiding on the moon.This is according to British scientists who believe evidence of the origins of life may be trapped beneath ancient lunar lava flows. Pictured is an artist's impression of the Earth as viewed from the lunar surface . 'Unlike the Earth, the moon has been geologically quiet for billions of years, meaning there is a good chance these organic and volatile records remain relatively intact,' Richard Matthewman from Imperial College London told Maddie Stone at Motherboard. Life began on Earth around four billion years ago, but the planet's geologic record only goes back 3.8 billion years. The cells and molecules that formed before have been erased through plate tectonics. Scientists want to find them as they could provide crucial evidence to how organic molecules transformed into life systems. In April, physicists tested what would happen if rock containing microscopic fossils from Earth were to be fired into space and smash into the lunar surface. None of the fossils survived perfectly intact in the University of Kent study, but being able to recover anything at all was still promising for the scientists. The scientists claim the molecules were flung towards the moon during the Late Heavy Bombardment - a time when Earth was bombarded by asteroids, and chunks of its material were thrown into space . The latest study, however, shows that these fossils can survive and now researchers are attempting to find out exactly how long. 'We think a lava flow might be a good way to do that,' Professor Matthewman told Motherboard said. The Imperial College team heated a range simple organic compounds and complex polymers up to 700°C in a vacuum. They also added JCS-1 - a synthetic mixture of minerals the mimic's the lunar surface. Without JCS-1, the organic materials were destroyed. But in its presence, they were able to survive the intense heat. However, so far, no one has found an Earth meteorite on the moon. Professor Matthewman said that if scientists found a series of lava flows with terrestrial meteorites inside, they could find the first appearance of recognisable life. Researchers from Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich have attempted to solve one of the paradoxes of the origins of life. They say that complex life could have gained a foothold in hydrothermal vents (stock image shown) in the early Earth, billions of years ago . One of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on Earth is how complex organisms began to take shape. Theory should hold that 'short' fragments of genetic material would have reproduced in abundance, leaving longer strands - and thus complex life - behind. But new research has revealed that longer strands may have thrived in volcanic 'pores' on the young Earth - ultimately allowing life to evolve to the complexity we see today. The research was carried out by a team from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich and published in the journal Nature. They found that water-filled micropores in hot rocks may have acted as the nurseries in which life on Earth began. One crucial precondition for the origin of life is that comparatively simple biomolecules must have had opportunities to form more complex structures. These, in turn, had to be capable of reproducing themselves, storing genetic information in a chemically stable form. Creating longer strands of RNA to store this genetic information would have been essential - but it simply wouldn't have been possible in most conditions on Earth. But LMU physicists led by Dr Dieter Braun showed experimentally that pore systems on the seafloor that were heated by volcanic activity, namely hydrothermal vents, could have served as reaction chambers for this RNA.","Cells may have been flung to the moon in Late Heavy Bombardment .

"Cuban President Raul Castro demanded on Wednesday that the United States return the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, lift the half-century trade embargo on Cuba and compensate his country for damages before the two nations re-establish normal relations. Castro told a summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States that Cuba and the U.S. are working toward full diplomatic relations but 'if these problems aren't resolved, this diplomatic rapprochement wouldn't make any sense.' No way, the White House said Thursday. The president's spokesman affirmed that Obama 'does believe that the prison at Guantanamo Bay should be closed down. 'But the naval base is not something we're interested in closing,' he clarified. Cuba's president Raul Castro demanded that the United States return the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, lift the half-century trade embargo on Cuba and compensate his country for damages before the two nations re-establish normal relations . Castro and U.S. President Barack Obama announced on December 17 that they would move toward renewing full diplomatic relations by reopening embassies in each other's countries. The two governments held negotiations in Havana last week to discuss both the reopening of the embassies and the broader agenda of re-establishing normal relations. Obama has loosened the trade embargo with a range of measures designed to increase economic ties with Cuba and increase the number of Cubans who don't depend on the communist state for their livelihoods. The Obama administration says removing barriers to U.S. travel, remittances and exports to Cuba is a tactical change that supports the United States' unaltered goal of reforming Cuba's single-party political system and centrally planned economy. Retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro released a statement, dated this week, saying that he doesn't trust U.S. policy, but that he doesn't reject peaceful solutions to conflicts . Cuba has said it welcomes the measures but has no intention of changing its system. Without establishing specific conditions, Castro's government has increasingly linked the negotiations with the U.S. to a set of longstanding demands that include an end to U.S. support for Cuban dissidents and Cuba's removal from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. On Wednesday, Castro emphasized an even broader list of Cuban demands, saying that while diplomatic ties may be re-established, normal relations with the U.S. depend on a series of concessions that appear highly unlikely in the near future. The U.S. established the military base in 1903, and the current Cuban government has been demanding the land's return since the 1959 revolution that brought it to power. Cuba also wants the U.S. to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for losses caused by the embargo. 'The re-establishment of diplomatic relations is the start of a process of normalizing bilateral relations, but this will not be possible while the blockade still exists, while they don't give back the territory illegally occupied by the Guantanamo naval base,' Castro said. He demanded that the U.S. end the transmission of anti-Castro radio and television broadcasts and deliver 'just compensation to our people for the human and economic damage that they're suffered.' The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Castro's remarks. The White House confirmed on Thursday that returning Guantanamo was not a subject of past discussions. U.S. moves to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba and loosen the five-decade trade embargo have 'the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere' and have 'added up to new hope for the future in Cuba,' Obama said in his State of the Union address . Castro's call for an end to the U.S. embargo drew support at the summit from the presidents of Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff also praised the effort by the leaders of Cuba and the U.S. to improve relations. 'The two heads of state deserve our recognition for the decision they made — beneficial for Cubans and Americans, but, most of all, for the entire continent,' she said. John Caulfield, who led the U.S. Interests Section in Havana until last year, said that the tone of Cuba's recent remarks didn't mean it would be harder than expected to reach a deal on short-term goals like reopening full embassies in Havana and Washington. In fact, he said, the comments by Castro and high-ranking diplomats may indicate the pressure Cuba's government is feeling to strike a deal as Cubans' hopes for better living conditions rise in the wake of Obama's outreach. 'There is this huge expectation of change and this expectation has been set off by the president's announcement,' Caulfield said. The Cuban government feels 'the constant need to tell their people nothing's going to change ... the more the Cubans feel obligated to defend the status quo and to say that's nothing going to change, the more pressure it indicates to me is on them to make these changes, partly on the economic side but I would also say on the political side.'","The Cuban president had previously welcomed Obama's normalization efforts but now says Gitmo must go .

"Workers on the £15billion Crossrail project have made their latest breakthrough after tunnelling under the City of London with a 1,000 tonne drill. The colossal machine, named Elizabeth after the Queen, has broke into the eastern end of Liverpool Street Crossrail station. The breakthrough - 40 metres below the financial district - symbolises light at the end of the tunnel for the project which is around 60 per cent complete. Elizabeth now has 750m to bore to reach the end of the line as part of Crossrail's longest tunnelling drive of 8.3km from Limmo Peninsula, near Canning Town, to Farringdon and is expected to be finished in the spring. Scroll down for video . Workmen look on as the drill, named Elizabeth after the Queen,  breaks through into the east end of Crossrail's Liverpool Street station . Workers on the £15billion Crossrail project made their latest breakthrough by tunnelling under the City of London this morning . Elizabeth now has 750m to bore to reach the end of the line as part of Crossrail's longest tunnelling drive of 8.3km from Limmo Peninsula, near Canning Town, to Farringdon and is expected to be finished in the spring . A worker takes a selfie in front of the huge drill. Liverpool Street is one of 10 new Crossrail stations being built in central and south-east London . Workmen wait for the tunnel machine to appear through the far end of the tunnel deep beneath London's banking district . Andrew Wolstenholme, Crossrail's chief executive, said: 'We are now on the final countdown to the big east/west breakthrough at Farringdon, which will link all of Crossrail's tunnels for the first time. 'This is a phenomenal feat of civil engineering that London can be justifiably proud of. The next challenge is to implement railway systems across the route, keeping the project on time and within budget.' Upon the breakthrough, a worker poked his head through the narrow gap and waved to colleagues in celebration. So far more than 60 per cent of the overall work has been completed for the project which will see, by 2018, high-speed trains running from as far west as Reading in Berkshire, through central London to Abbey Wood in south London and as far east as Shenfield in Essex. A sister machine, named Victoria, will reach Farringdon several weeks after Elizabeth. Last week it was reported that Crossrail was facing major signal problems which could prevent any trains from being allowed to run when the line's due to open in 2018 - and engineers admitted the complex signal issues may not be resolved in the next three years. A source inside the project claimed it was still likely that Crossrail would open, with reduced services, but suggested said it was also possible that no trains would be running at all in 2018. So far more than 60 per cent of the overall work has been completed for the project which will see, by 2018, high-speed trains running from as far west as Reading in Berkshire, through central London to Abbey Wood in south London and as far east as Shenfield in Essex . More than 10,000 people are currently working on the project, including 400 apprentices, with the project at peak rate of construction.Tunnel machines Elizabeth and Victoria each weigh 1,000 tonnes, are 150 metres long and more than seven metres in diameter . The walls slowly begins to crumble as the gigantic drill bores through. Crossrail, Europe's biggest construction project, is initially scheduled to run 24 trains per hour during peak periods, and it is hoped this will increase to 30 . Elizabeth and Victoria each weigh 1,000 tonnes, are 150m long and over seven metres in diameter. They are the last of eight Crossrail tunnel machines to have carved a route beneath London linking the West End, the City, Canary Wharf and southeast London . Crossrail adopts both traditional metro signalling and modern high-tech systems to connect trains on the 26 miles of new tracks underneath London to existing major cross-country rail lines. As it stands, engineers are struggling to create 'interfaces' - meaning the trains are unable to shift smoothly from the orthodox Metro system to the state of the art sytsem used once outside central London. Crossrail's chairman, Terry Morgan, conceded that a 'mitigation plan' was being put in place, The Independent reported. By the end of May this year rail services between Liverpool Street and Shenfield will join the TfL transport network. This will be the first phase of the introduction of Crossrail, which will be fully integrated with TfL services. Joint Venture Dragados Sisk is constructing the eastern tunnels between Pudding Mill Lane and Stepney Green, Limmo Peninsula and Farringdon, and Victoria Dock Portal and Limmo. The station tunnels at Liverpool Street have been built by a joint venture comprising Balfour Beatty, BeMo Tunnelling, Morgan Sindall and Vinci Construction. The Crossrail route will pass through 40 stations and run more than 100km from Reading and Heathrow in the west, through new twin-bore 21km (13-mile) tunnels below central London to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east . A worker emerges from behind the drill - watched from the other side by colleagues. The first Crossrail services through central London will start in late 2018 - an estimated 200 million annual passengers will use the new scheme . Upon the breakthrough, a worker poked his head through the narrow gap and waved to colleagues in celebration . On completion of the project, some 4.5 million tonnes of excavated material from the tunnels will be shipped to Wallasea Island in Essex where it will be used to create a new 1,500 acre RSPB nature reserve . The Crossrail route will pass through 40 stations and run more than 100km from Reading and Heathrow in the west, through new twin-bore 21km (13-mile) tunnels below central London to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. £14.8bn: Total funding available to deliver the project isCrossrail construction began at Canary Wharf on May 15 2009. Tunnelling began in May 2012. 40km out of 42km: Length of Crossrail train tunnels are now constructed and the programme is more than 60% complete. 10,000: Number of people currently working on the project, including 400 apprentices, with the project at peak rate of construction. 1,000 tonnes: The weight of tunnel machines Elizabeth and Victoria each. They are 150 metres long and more than seven metres in diameter. They are the last of eight Crossrail tunnel machines to have carved a route beneath London linking the West End, the City, Canary Wharf and south-east London. 10 %: The percentage that Crossrail will boost the capital's rail capacity by, bringing an additional 1.5 million people within 45 minutes' commute of central London. Liverpool Street is one of 10 new Crossrail stations being built in central and south-east London. The first Crossrail services through central London will start in late 2018 - an estimated 200 million annual passengers will use the new scheme. Some 4.5 million tonnes of excavated material from the tunnels will be shipped to Wallasea Island in Essex where it will be used to create a new 1,500 acre RSPB nature reserve.","Colossal machine, named Elizabeth after Queen, has broke into the eastern end of Liverpool Street Crossrail station .

"Oliver Gore-Booth, a former public schoolboy, used a pen camera to secretly film women in the shower at his gym and up their skirts on escalators . An ex-private schoolboy who used a secret pen camera to film up women's skirts on the Tube and spy on them showering is facing jail. Oliver Gore-Booth, nephew of the former High Commissioner of India and the great, great grandson of Arctic explorer the 5th Baronet Gore, of Lissadell, used a pen camera to film women showering at a north London gym as well as up their skirts on escalators on the Tube. He had collected three years of secret videos. The 34-year-old HR manager also installed a hidden camera in his bathroom to secretly film women showering. He was rumbled when a gym user found the spy camera he had been using at the Anytime Gym in Pentoville Road in Islington. Gore-Booth has worked for Sky, Eurostar, Viacom, and moo.com and went to co-educational independent Canford School in Wimborne, Dorset, which charges boarders over £10,000 a term. He also comes from an influential family. His uncle, the late Sir David Gore-Booth, died aged 61 in 2004 after a 34-year diplomatic career as both ambassador to Saudi Arabia and High Commissioner in India. His great uncle was leading diplomat Lord Paul Gore-Booth, while his great, great grandfather was an Arctic explorer, the 5th Baronet Gore, of Lissadell, co. Sligo. At a hearing at Blackfriars Crown Court Gore-Booth admitted five counts of voyeurism and four of outraging public decency and was told to prepare for a prison sentence when he is jailed next month. Lyell Thompson, prosecuting, said: 'A member of the gym found the pen positioned to film persons using a shower cubicle area. ‘Police went to his home and found a laptop with images of what’s been filmed on previous occasions. ‘There are images in a private place such as his bathroom of people using the shower. ‘The other charges are incidents in public where he has been putting a camera pen or similar item up ladies’ skirts as they go up an escalator.’ Gore-Booth went to Canford School in Wimborne, an independent school which charges £10,000 a term . Gore-Booth used the concealed camera to secretly film women showering at the Anytime Gym in Islington . Judge Blacksell freed Gore-Booth on bail on the condition he does not go to the Anytime Gym, but told him: ‘It was over a fair old period of time and I can’t ignore that it’s a camera he set up for these purposes. ‘There is a history of using a camera in order to obtain images that he found gratifying and it’s obviously an affront to those he abuses in this way. ‘This obviously does cross the custody threshold.’ He was told the offences, carried out between 2011 and 2014, fell into the most serious category. Gore-Booth, of Wandsworth, admitted five counts of voyeurism and four of outraging public decency. He is due to be sentenced on February 26. Oliver Gore-Booth is the nephew of the late Sir David Gore-Booth, the former High Commissioner of India and Saudi Arabia .","Oliver Gore-Booth, 34, is a former public schoolboy and HR manager .

"Police have uncovered a £1million 'Downton Abbey' mansion which had been transformed into a cannabis factory containing more than 1,000 plants. Wendreda House in March, Cambridgeshire, was raided by officers yesterday after an anonymous tip-off about a pungent smell coming from the three-storey property. They found three huge water tanks on the ground floor fed into seven growing rooms along with a maze of air filtration systems, electric leads and lights. Officers raided a £1million mansion in March, Cambridgeshire, yesterday and uncovered a cannabis factory . Wendreda House (above) boasts nine bedrooms, six bathrooms, two utility rooms and four drawing rooms . Intense humidity and an over-powering damp smell had generated a thick layer of mould in the house's nine bedrooms, six bathrooms, two utility rooms and four drawing rooms. Detective Inspector David Murphy, of Cambridgeshire Police, said: 'This place looks like something you would see in Downton Abbey or the place people take on for TV series Grand Designs. 'It's certainly not where you expect to see a highly professional cannabis factory. It is on a main road and surrounded by other homes. It was a risky project.' He said they suspect the impressive home has been used for growing cannabis for the last six months. Police found three huge water tanks on the ground floor fed into seven growing rooms along with a maze of air filtration systems, electric leads and lights . Police received an anonymous tip-off from a member of the public who reported a 'pungent smell' Fashion magazines were piled on a coffee table in one of the ground floor living rooms where chandeliers hang over beautifully stripped and polished oak flooring. 'It was obviously once a much-loved and cared-for family home,'  Det Insp Murphy added. 'How it has got to be used like this we don't know. 'Usually cannabis factories are in remote areas or industrial units. This is something else - a really unusual find. The smart living room was equipped with two sofas, a table tennis table and a chandelier, while the kitchen was also in a good condition and still had food and drink left out on the side. However, on the two floors upstairs there was a complex labyrinth of filtration systems and lights. The kitchen in the property looked virtually normal, and still had food and drink items left on the worktops . One of the drawing rooms at Wendreda House, which police said was 'once a much-loved and cared for home' The entrace to Wendreda House, which police described as looking like 'something out of Downton Abbey', before it was transformed into a cannabis factory . The windows were blacked out and there was no furniture in the  bedrooms to make way for the cannabis plants and equipment. DI Murphy added: 'The downstairs rooms were in such a good condition that you could buy the house, do a bit of work to it and then be in within a month.' They also found plants which appeared to be undergoing a nine-week growing period with baby plants being stored in the basement. Det Insp Murphy revealed that the electrics had been bypassed, saving them from receiving a massive heating and lights bill. He said: 'The lights are left on for around 18 hours a day to speed up the growing time. Officers were shocked to uncover more than 1,000 cannabis plants being grown inside the stately home . Several baby plants were found in the property's basement, which appeared to be undergoing a nine-week growing period, according to police . Det Insp Murphy revealed that the electrics had been bypassed, saving them from receiving a massive bill . When police arrived they found three large water tanks on the ground floor feeding into seven growing rooms . 'You couldn't afford what a system like this would cost in terms of electrics.' He said two men in their 20s were arrested at the grand house - valued at just over £1million by property website Zoopla - and taken into custody for questioning. The mansion was named after St Wendreda, a Saxon princess who lived at March most of her adult life after setting up a Benedictine nunnery there.

"A Montana woman who killed her husband-of-eight-days has been told she has no grounds to appeal her murder conviction. Jordan Graham, 23, was sentenced to 30 years in jail for the 2013 murder of her husband Cody Johnson, 25, in Glacier National Park. Federal prosecutors have said the former nanny has no grounds to appeal after lying to officials and using trickery in a bid to conceal her crime. Staying in jail: Jordan Graham, pictured leaving court in 2013, has been told by prosecutors that she has no grounds to appeal after lying to officials and using trickery in a bid to conceal her crime . Graham admitted to killing Cody . Johnson, 25, by pushing him to his death from a 300ft cliff in Glacier . National Park on July 7, 2013. His body was found at the bottom of the cliff three days after he was reported missing by a friend and co-worker. After she was sentenced . last month to the maximum of 30 years, Graham tried - and failed - to . withdraw her guilty plea - despite the fact her attorneys asked for a . 10-year sentence in exchange for change of plea. Her defense attorney Michael Donahoe had . previously said in a motion that her 'extremely reckless but . unintentional act' only warranted 10 years in prison. Her . attorney's filing this week claims that Judge Molloy failed to take . into account that accepting the plea meant she had not premeditated her . new husband's death. Graham's defense team also claims that the judge made improper calculations when deciding on her sentence. Murder: Graham admitted to killing her husband CodyJohnson, 25, by pushing him to his death from a 300ft cliff in Glacier National Park eight days into their marriage . Lies: Jordan Graham, accompanied by members of her legal team in 2013, lied to friends and police officers and even fabricated an email exchange to cover up her crime . Details on how Judge Molloy calculated the 22-year-old's sentence were sealed. Before he accepted her plea in December 2013, the judge asked Graham to tell him what happened. Graham . said she was having second thoughts about being . married so young and that she and her husband went to the park to talk about it. It . wasn't planned, but she said it was 'definitely reckless with an . extreme disregard' for life. Afterward, she ran back to where the car . was parked. She drove back home to Kalispell, . about an hour away, without seeking help. She sent text messages to . friends on the drive back - but told nobody what had just happened. 'At that moment, I was so scared, I didn't know what to do,' she said. Johnson was reported missing on July 8 when he failed to show up for work. Graham . initially told investigators that Johnson left their house on July 7 with . friends. But his friends testified they were suspicious of the story and . suspected Graham played a role in his disappearance. Heartbreak: Cody Johnson's mother Sherry broke down outside the court following Graham's guilty plea in December 2013 . Graham showed police a fabricated . email - purportedly from a friend of Johnson - that said Johnson was . dead and to call off the search. She . later told Glacier rangers she had found Johnson's body near The Loop . because it was a place he wanted to see before he died. Ultimately, . Graham acknowledged she was with Johnson on the cliff after . investigators confronted her with a security camera photo of the couple . entering the park. Graham was sentenced last March after a U.S. judge  rejected her request to withdraw the guilty plea that came as part of a deal with prosecutors that saw them dismiss a first-degree murder charge. Graham last October appealed her conviction, arguing prosecutors engaged in misconduct by publicly labeling her a sociopath, distorted facts and acted in a vindictive manner toward her. Prosecutors argued in legal documents filed on Wednesday that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should reject Graham's attempts to overturn her conviction and sentence since her claims of prosecutorial vindictiveness 'are based on the kind of supposition that will not sustain a valid motion.' Prosecutors also contended that Graham not only killed her husband in cold blood, but she later lied about it to investigators and even created a fake email in attempt to cover up the crime.","Jordan Graham sentenced to 30 years in prison for husband's death .

'Our list of top eateries, compiled from tens of thousands of Yelp reviews written in 2014, highlights the varied dining experiences open to the UK public with varying budgets and tastes' To determine  top places to eat for 2015, the guide's data science team analysed which places were the most popular and well reviewed over the course of 2014. Businesses were compared on a nationwide basis. Engineers  used a technique based on the Wilson Score to compile a list of highly rated places to eat. This method takes into account both star rating and number of reviews to reveal which spots not only have top notch ratings, but also which are most popular in the Yelp community.

In Hindu vegetarian households, eggs are off limits, so this would have been a real indulgence. The yolks must be runny so that when you cut into them they ooze all over the toast. It might not sound like much, but give it a go – it'll become your weekend brunch favourite. Recipe serves one. Ingredients: Two slices white bloomer bread; 100g mature Cheddar, grated, two spring onions, chopped; one green chilli, cut in half lengthways then finely chopped; Cracked black pepper; one tablespoon oil; two free range eggs . Method: Toast the bloomer slices until lightly browned. Mix the cheese, the onions, the chopped green chilli and cracked black pepper in a bowl. Put 2 tbsp of the mixture to one side, then mash the remaining mixture with the back of a spoon. Spread the mashed cheese mixture evenly on the toasted bread. Heat the oil in a frying pan. Place the cheese-on-toast under the grill to cook. Crack the eggs into the frying pan and fry until the whites are set and the yolks are golden and runny Remove the cheese-on-toast from under the grill when it is slightly browned and bubbling on top. Slide the eggs on top of the cheese-on-toast, then sprinkle on the cheese mixture that you put aside earlier, grind a little more black pepper, and grill for a further minute. Serve immediately, with tomato ketchup on the side.","Yelp's reviews pushed Dishoom Covent Garden to the top spot .

"Public health officials in Sacramento, California, are dealing with an Ebola scare today after a patient who had recently been to West Africa checked into a local hospital. The University of California-Davis Medical Center says the patient is suffering from Ebola-like symptoms and that the hospital has activated its Ebola response team. The patient checked in at Mercy General Hospital in Sacramento on Thursday complaining of 'symptoms consistent with Ebola infection.' Scroll down for video . The patient initially went to Mercy General Hospital in Sacramento (pictured). Hospital officials closed down the emergency room there so it could be sanitized . The first signs of Ebola infection often include a fever and vomiting. The patient was transferred from Mercy General to the UC-Davis Medical Center, which is one of four hospitals in California designated as an Ebola treatment site by the Centers for Disease Control. A hospital spokesman told KTXL-TV that officials would not ave activated the 'Ebola response team' unless that patient had been to a country with active cases of Ebola. Mercy General closed its emergency room on Wednesday to give it a full scrub-down after the patient was there. Health officials have emphasized that the patient is at low risk for Ebola. Health officials have categorized this Ebola scare as 'low risk' The disease is still spreading through Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone - though infection rates have slowed in recent months. It could take several days before the results of the Ebola test are known. Test results sooner than that could result in a false-negative. More than 8,800 people have died in the outbreak and 22,000 have been infected. Ten people have been treated for Ebola in the United States and two have died. Five Americans and a Sierra Leonian national have been flown to the US with Ebola. Four others were diagnosed in the country - including Liberian national Eric Garner and two nurses who treated him.","Patient is being treated at University of California-Davis Medical Center until the results of Ebola tests can be confirmed .

"A woman has lost an incredible ten stone after she became so fat that she broke her sofa. Christine Drane, 53, from Scunthorpe, ballooned to a size 28 after years of overeating and snacking on treats and chocolate. But she was finally spurred into action when she slumped on the sofa after a long day and the springs gave way under her 24st frame. Christine Drane, 53, from Scunthorpe, weighed 24st (left) after gorging on junk food for years. She finally managed to lose 10st after starting the 80/20 diet, which allows treats 20 per cent of the time. She currently weighs 14st (right) and is on track to reach her final goal of 11st . Christine was so determined to do something about her weight that she turned down the chance to get a gastric band fitted and opted to shed to flab the hard way instead. The customer care worker tried everything from juice diets to calorie counting and managed to get her weight down to 20st, but then she hit a wall. It was only when she sought help from weight loss expert Steve Miller, after seeing him on Sky's Fat Families, that she finally mastered a weight loss regime. Christine has now lost more than ten stone by following an 80/20 regime. The three-meal-a-day plan allows the dieter to indulge in their favourite treats 20 per cent of the time, so long as they eat healthily for the remaining 80 per cent. Christine tried every diet under the sun, but never managed to lose much weight . Christine currently weighs 14st and is well on track to reach her final goal of 11st. She said: 'For as long as I can remember, I've always been overweight. 'My husband and I have been married for 33 years and I have literally been on a diet for the whole time. 'There is no diet that anyone can name that I haven't tried. 'Occasionally, I would drop a few stone here and there but it would just pile back on. 'I mean, If weighing 20st was after weight loss then that's saying something!' Since losing 10 stone, Christine now enjoys wearing fitted dresses and has started to wear make-up again . Christine continued: 'I remember meeting with my GP when he told me about gastric band surgery and I was absolutely mortified.' 'I remember thinking I would rather die from being fat than have surgery - it's just something I would never even contemplate. 'The first time I met with Steve, he told me I was really fat and it was what I needed to hear. 'He has never let me make excuses and always encouraged me to do more, I never thought I would be able to lose so much weight and keep it off. 'I've started wearing make-up again and I'm always receiving lovely compliments.'","Christine Drane, 53, ballooned to a size 28 after gorging on junk food .

"Drug addict tenants are leaving squalid bedsits filled with piles of rubbish, discarded food, ripped up carpets and broken doors. Filthy kitchens crammed with dozens of packets and rotting food left behind by tenants have been discovered in bedsits in South Somerset where floors are strewn with discarded clothes and alcohol bottles, walls are damp and covered in mould, and doors left hanging off their hinges. Housing inspectors are trying to get private landlords who own more than 400 bedsits across the county to clear up the properties which have turned to squalor, frequently after use by drug addict former tenants, so they are safe for the 1,000 people living in them. Bedsits across south Somerset have been found littered with rubbish, with damp walls and broken doors and handrails - putting many of the 1,000 vulnerable and elderly people living in them in the county at risk . They said some of the problems are often caused by one tenant who may make the mess, but landlords are not then stepping in to deal with the problem and clear up properly or fix broken items and damp rooms - making them unsafe for people who need to live there. Inspectors visited a number of bedsits across the county and found damp, mould, disrepair, trip hazards and dangerous electrics as well as inadequate handrails and rubbish on the floor. They found damp, mould, disrepair, trip hazards and dangerous electrics as well as inadequate handrails and rubbish on the floor. One of the pictures includes a home in Yeovil, Somerset, that was being used as a base for drug dealing before police and officials shut it down. Piles of rubbish were found in bedsits inspectors and the council wants landlords to take more responsibility . Kitchens were found in filthy states of disrepair - with food and takeaway packets spilling out of cupboards . Other bedsits were found to be filled with litter, including old food waste, wrappers, newspapers, bottles and old clothes. The bedsits have become filthy as demand for properties in  in the area has increased in recent months because of rising rental costs. In some cases inspectors said private landlords were not clearing up properly so that bedsits were unsafe when vulnerable people moved in, and they called on private landlords to step up to deal with the issues. Private landlords have been accused of neglecting their duties, by not making repairs where they are needed .

Councillor Peter Seib, the district council's portfolio holder for environmental health, said: 'With increasing housing pressure it is important for us to work with private landlords to ensure everyone is provided with a good standard of accommodation. 'Likewise we need to ensure that private homeowners get the help they need to ensure their homes are kept in good repair.

"House Republicans will sue President Barack Obama over his executive actions on immigration. House Speaker John Boehner announced the plans in a closed-door meeting with lawmakers Tuesday, according to a person in the room. He told them GOP leaders are finalizing a legal plan with the best chance of blocking Obama's moves curbing deportations for millions of people here illegally. 'The president's overreach when he took executive action to deal with the immigration problems in our country, frankly, in my view, is a violation of our Constitution,' Boehner said to Fox News during  a 'Special Report with Bret Baier.' Anger: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, followed by Rep. Bill Johnson, R-Ohio, emerges from a closed-door strategy session with House Republicans, on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2015. On Wednesday he signaled he was preparing Republicans to file a lawsuit against President Obama . 'We believe that the filing of a lawsuit to try to stop the president from - from violating our Constitution is an important step for our institution,' he added. 'This isn't about immigration. This is the president violating the Constitution, violating his oath of office, and frankly, not upholding the rule of law.' Options include joining a lawsuit already filed by states over the issue, or filing a separate lawsuit. The person in the room spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting. The House already has passed legislation to overturn Obama's immigration actions, but the Senate looks unlikely to agree to the measure, which was added to must-pass legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security beyond February. It's not clear how that issue will be resolved. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised a vote on the House-passed bill, and said Tuesday that the Senate would take up the issue after completing consideration of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which could be as soon as next week. Taking the fight to the president: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, acknowledges that there have been 'a couple of stumbles' in the opening weeks of the new Republican-run Congress, as he and GOP leaders meet with reporters following a strategy session on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Tuesday . Nearly all Senate Democrats signed a letter to McConnell Tuesday urging him not to include immigration measures on the Homeland Security spending bill. With Republicans six votes short of the 60 needed to advance most legislation in the Senate, McConnell cannot move the bill without some Democratic support, leaving the way forward unclear. He has promised there will be no government shutdown. The uncertainty has frustrated conservative Republicans who believe Congress' top priority on immigration should be to hold firm against Obama. They united against a separate border security bill that was scheduled to come to a vote on the House floor Wednesday, and GOP leaders delayed action, citing changes to the House schedule caused by the inclement weather. It's not clear when that bill will come back up. House Republicans already have sued to try to undo Obama's health care law.

"A mother has won a restraining order against her 'childish' next-door neighbour after a bitter 18-month dispute over wheelie bins culminated in him being arrested for allegedly attacking her. Joanne Dowling, 42, of Aberdare, south Wales, became locked in a bin battle with neighbour Gary Jones, 58, after claiming he blocked her parking space with his garbage. Heated words escalated after Jones smeared grease over Ms Dowling's bin handles before later allegedly lunging at her in her own home. Garbage wars: Trainee solicitor Joanne Dowling, 42, of Aberdare, south Wales, became embroiled in a bitter dispute with next-door neighbour Gary Jones (R), 58, over their wheelie bins . According to trainee solicitor Ms Dowling, she had initially politely requested her next-door neighbour refrain from leaving his rubbish in front of her property. After tensions mounted between the pair, Jones began to coat the handles of her wheelie bins with thick grease, preventing her from opening the lid to dispose of her garbage on collection days. The extraordinary row came to a head when Ms Dowling opened her bin one day and found it was full of her neighbour's rubbish. Jones and his family had filled it with leftover party decorations and half a birthday cake and when Ms Dowling found it, she flung it on to her neighbour's doorstep in anger. She was then confronted by her neighbour's screaming daughters and later, a furious Jones banged on her door and allegedly lunged at her when she opened it, pushing her on to her sofa. The father was arrested and ordered to appear in court - where he was banned from having any contact with Ms Dowling for three years. Sparked row: The 18-month dispute began when Ms Dowling complained that Jones was blocking her parking space with his wheelie bin . Extreme measures: Jones smeared grease (L) over Ms Dowling's bin handles to prevent her from being able to open the lid. The row came to a head when she tossed a half-eaten birthday cake on his doorstep (R) Ms Dowling said: 'Every day when I got home from work the neighbours would have deliberately obstructed my parking spot with their bin. 'We live on a very narrow street so everyone keeps their wheelie bin tight to the front of their house but for some reason next door liked to keep their bin on my side. 'They objected to me moving it out of the way and started to smear builders grease on the handle so I wouldn't touch it. 'They also wrote signs warning me not to touch their bin. It was so childish.' When she attempted to move the bin out of the way her neighbours claimed she was tampering with their property. Describing the birthday cake incident, she added: 'I'd had enough by this point so I grabbed the cake out of the bin and plonked it on the neighbour's door step. 'But the next thing I knew Gary's daughters were out of the house and screaming at me. Screaming confrontation: After dumping the half-eaten birthday cake on Jones' doorstep, Ms Dowling claimed she was angrily confronted by his daughters. Jones pictured with daughter Paige, above . 'I couldn't believe there was so much grief coming my way over our bins so I went home.' The next day Jones, 58 knocked on her front door. She anticipated that he was calling by to apologise and opened the door to greet him but he lunged at her - shouting and swearing. She said: 'I opened the door and he burst in and grabbed me by the top. He yelled and swore at me and shoved me onto the sofa. 'Luckily my boyfriend was home and he's a big bloke - there's no way Gary would have argued with him.' Following the altercation Ms Dowling called the police and Jones was charged with a public order offence. Restraining order: The mother had Jones arrested after he allegedly attacked her in her own home, grabbing her by the top and pushing her on to a sofa . At Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates' Court he was given a fine of £360 plus a ten-week community order. He was also made the subject of a three-year restraining order not to contact Ms Dowling, her partner or children, and not to attend her property. Gareth Walters, defending, said that what had started as a 'petty dispute' between two neighbours had led to an 'out-of-control' situation.

"Five years ago I took part in a reality TV cooking show called Marco’s Kitchen Burnout involving several celebrities being judged on their culinary skills by chef Marco Pierre White. It was already a stressful time for me. My 91-year-old father had been slowly dying for some time so I wasn’t particularly thrilled to be stuck in a kitchen with a celebrity chef known for being difficult. To top it all off, I’d just started my period. Now, on any other day of the month, I’d say I’m quite a rational person. I don’t let things wind me up. But on one memorable day, Marco was being particularly ‘Marco’ and I was hacked off. British No 1, Heather Watson (pictured), admitted recently that she had suffered the effects of her period during the Australian Open . At one point, as I stood by a row of sharp kitchen knives, I thought: ‘I’d better move away from these or who knows what I’m capable of,’ and I walked away. Of course, I’d never do anything remotely violent. But that feeling of being powerless in the grip of my hormones is one that will be familiar to many women. Certainly it’s something that tennis star Heather Watson recognises. Last week, the British No 1 admitted she’d been playing badly in the Australian Open because of ‘girl things’. During the match the 22-year-old had needed attention from a doctor and said afterwards she had felt light-headed and low on energy. ‘The last couple of days I felt fine. I think it’s just one of these things that I have, girl things. It just happens,’ she said. Cue a massive media storm. For any woman to admit she even gets periods, let alone that they might affect her, remains taboo. I applaud her for being brave enough to say the unsayable. Carol Smillie applauds women who are prepared to openly discuss menstruation . It’s great that other sportswomen have pitched in, too. Even former world champion Martina Navratilova has admitted she suffered. ‘It sounds like an excuse but for women it is a reality,’ she told Radio 5 Live. ‘You don’t want to use it as an excuse, but it can affect some players in a big way. I never talked about it but it certainly was there.’ The fact is, women ARE affected by periods. There are more than 100 symptoms of pre-menstrual tension including stomach cramps, headaches, lethargy and bloating. Why shouldn’t we be honest about the reasons we feel below par? At 53, I’m coming to the end of my monthly cycles, but I’m happy to admit there were some days when I could happily have stayed in bed because of cramps and irritability. Thanks to the fluctuating hormones oestrogen and progesterone, some women find they are clumsy around their period and that was me. Looking back, there were times when I shouldn’t have been allowed to drive — I’d often notice that I’d clip the pavement as I parked. I’d be more prone to arguments. My husband Alex, 48, a restaurateur, and I have been married for 23 years and had only a handful of rows. But on my period, I could look at him and think: ‘You are so annoying!’ He’d often look at me with an expression that said: ‘Hmmm, are you on your period?’ I’d want to throttle him. Yet I’m lucky Alex is so understanding about my ‘time of the month’. Growing up with sisters, he’s never been fazed by popping sanitary products in his shopping trolley. And our daughters Christie, 19, and Jodie, 15, think nothing of asking him to stock up on Tampax. As a man, he’s in the minority. What struck me most about Heather Watson’s confession was the way her male interviewer handled it. Heather was simply stating the blindingly obvious. Yet you could feel him squirming with embarrassment. When she mentioned ‘girl things’ he didn’t seem to have a clue what to say. Was he worried she was about to go into gory detail? It’s astounding that we have programmes such as Celebrity Big Brother where Z-listers cheerfully talk about their sex lives in graphic detail but worry that the mention of periods will cause offence. I see this time and time again in my meetings for Diary Doll, the company I’ve set up with my friend, former tennis player Annabel Croft. We’re making feminine, pretty and waterproof ‘period pants’ to help minimise embarrassing ‘accidents’ when girls start menstruating. During these meetings I’m always wary of saying anything too graphic. Even so, most men start squirming in their seats and steer the conversation to facts and figures. Only a few — usually fathers of girls — feel relaxed enough to ask questions. My husband didn’t realise the extent of the problem until he joined the company last year. One or two of his male friends refuse to discuss it — they’re just not comfortable with ‘women’s issues’. But we can’t lay the entire blame on men. If we want men to change, we have to change, too. We have to start talking openly and frankly and, most of all, without embarrassment. Martina Navratilova has admitted she also suffered. ‘It sounds like an excuse but for women it is a reality,’ she told Radio 5 Live. ‘You don’t want to use it as an excuse, but it can affect some players in a big way. I never talked about it but it certainly was there.’ Like many women of my generation I grew up thinking periods were shameful or dirty. I vividly remember, aged eight, visiting department store loos with my mother and innocently asking about the ‘special towels’ in the vending machine on the wall. My mild-mannered mum marched me out and refused to discuss it. Mercifully, I learnt the truth just before I started my periods at 12. But it was older schoolfriends enlightened me. Not Mum. My girls were both 13 when they started their periods. I’d stocked up on products beforehand and told them where they were. I explained that if they just wanted to help themselves that was fine, but if they wanted to talk to me that was also fine. And I’ve always been frank with our 17-year-old son, Robbie. If one of his sisters was on her period and didn’t want to come swimming, I’d tell him why. Yet many women still act as though periods are somehow shameful. It’s almost as though we have been conditioned to protect men from the nitty-gritty. I’ve seen women apologise to my husband in business meetings for going into too much detail. Another problem is that we are still so determined to prove we are as good as the boys, we don’t want to admit any weakness. I know businesswomen who feel obliged to sit through interminable meetings worried about having an accident because they feel they can’t ask for a loo break. If we want our daughters to grow up in a world where periods are seen as normal, not shameful and embarrassing, then we need to talk openly. I’m not suggesting we go overboard — like the obstetrician who suggested we give women ‘menstrual leave’. Although I empathise with women who suffer so badly they pass out, most of us are not ill when having our period. We’re just not at the top of our game. And like Heather Watson, we need to be more honest about it. Period.","Last week, British No.1 tennis star, Heather Watson acknowledged that she had struggled in the Australian Open because of 'girl things'

"An Indian father has been arrested for attempted murder after trying to bury his ten-year old daughter alive. Locals in Putia village, in Tripura, northeast India, alerted police that Abul Hussein was trying to bury his daughter in the backyard of his home. When police arrived at his home he had had tied his daughter's hands with rope and taped her mouth before burying her up to her chest. An Indian father has been arrested for attempted murder after trying to bury his ten-year old daughter alive . Police said that Hussein disliked girls and tried to kill his ten-year-old daughter Rukshena while his wife was away from their home. He was desperate for a son and hated that he had a daughter. Senior police official Pradip Dey said: 'We received a call from a villager telling us that a man was trying to kill his daughter by burying her alive. Our team immediately reached the house and found Rukshena. 'We rescued her and arrested Abul Hussein for attempted murder. He is now in judicial custody until his trial.' After burying Ruskshena up to her waist her mother returned home but Hussein temporarily threw a bamboo basket over her head, intending to finish the job later. But his wife grew suspicious and called neighbours for help. She claimed she was already worried about her husband's love for their daughter. The dad threw a bamboo basket over his daughter's head to hide her from her mother when she returned home. He intended, it's alleged, to come back and finish burying her . When neighbours found Ruskshena buried Hussein was beaten before police arrived. Ruskshena was admitted into a local hospital after falling seriously ill on January 16 but was discharged after a few days. She is now back with her mother and is being protected by her mother's relatives. In many parts of India, parents consider daughters an economic burden while sons are seen as the breadwinners in the family. They are also seen as the child to continue the family's legacy and are often preferred to female children. The huge cultural preference often leads to abortions of female fetuses or decimation against girls by denying them access to education. India's sex ratio of 943 females for 1000 males has been an ongoing concern for Indian governments. And to generate awareness to save female children and empower women, the new government has launched an ambitious Beti Bachao, Beti Padao campaign, translating as 'Save Girl Child, Educate Girl Child'.

"Regularly drinking beer could help slow dementia, research suggests. Scientists have discovered an ingredient in hops which they think could slow the progression of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In laboratory experiments they found that the chemical, called xanthohumol or Xn, could help protect brain cells from oxidative damage associated with dementia. The research, published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, suggested that people who regularly drink beer might be better able to ward off the progression of neurological diseases. Scroll down for video . Healthy pint: Scientists have discovered an ingredient in hops which they think could slow the progression of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (file photo) Dr Jianguo Fang, of Lanzhou University in China, wrote: 'Hops from dried female clusters of the hop plant are widely used in beers and a few types of soft drinks. 'In traditional Chinese medicine, hops have been used to treat a variety of ailments for centuries. 'The presence of a high concentration of Xn in beers might be linked to the epidemiological observation of the beneficial effect of regular beer drinking. 'Xn has attracted considerable interest because of its multiple pharmacological functions, including anti-oxidation, cardiovascular protection, anticancer and cancer chemoprevention, antivirus, anti-obesity, and anti-inflammation.' His team isolated Xn molecules and tested them on brain cells from rats in a series of laboratory experiments. They found that Xn reduced the level of oxidative stress on the cells, a damaging process thought to be closely linked to degenerative diseases. Writing in the journal, they said: 'As neuronal cells are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and have limited replenishment during the entire lifespan, increasing evidence has supported oxidative stress as one of the pathogenic causes in the neuropathology of adult neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.' Stopping the oxidative process 'could efficiently block or retard the process of such diseases', they wrote. Discovery: Scientists found that the chemical called xanthohumol (Xn) could help protect brain cells from oxidative damage associated with dementia (file photo) Dr Fang's team suggested that beer might slow down common neurological diseases, but they also suggested the molecule could be used in drugs to better target the problems. They cited a 1998 Canadian study in which men who regularly drank beer were found to have lower rates of prostate cancer, a trend they suggested may also be down to the protective function of Xn molecules. 'Our results suggest that Xn might be a potential candidate for the prevention of neurodegenerative disorders,' they wrote. British scientists, however, warned against drinking beer too often. Previous research has suggested that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to brain tissue loss and that binge drinking is associated with an increased risk of dementia. And separate studies have concluded that developing a beer belly in middle age boosts the risk of Alzheimer's in later life three-fold. Doctors have warned that increasing trends of heavy drinking among the middle class and younger people will lead to a 'silent dementia epidemic' within a few years. Dr Arthur Roach, director of research at Parkinson's UK, said last night: 'Many drugs have their origins in natural products. 'Xanthohumol, the molecule in beer this study focuses on, appears to have protective effects on cells grown in the lab similar to those lost in Parkinson's. 'It certainly does not suggest drinking a pint a day could stave off the condition. 'This is a very early step, and only further work will indicate whether this could lead to new drugs for Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases.'","A chemical in hops could slow the progression of degenerative diseases .

"TLC's latest episode of My Strange Addiction ended last night with an unusual triumph when a male Madonna impersonator finally gave up on his damaging obsession.

During the couple's heart-to-heart, Michael insists he 'really, really' cares for Adam, but that his Madonna addiction is going to 'mess everything up' for the couple. 'I just don't understand,' he pleads. 'Where does it end? You're going to fall into a coma and never wake up?' Adam, taken aback, responds: 'That's a very harsh way to go with it.'

"Marshawn Lynch has fired back at his critics at the Super Bowl. After two days of giving only scripted answers, the Seattle Seahawks' star running gave his most extensive comments of Super Bowl week, mostly telling reporters why he won't talk to them. 'I don't know what story y'all trying to get out of me. I don't know what image y'all trying to portray of me,' Lynch said Thursday. 'But it don't matter what y'all think, what y'all say about me because when I go home at night, the same people that I look in the face — my family that I love, that's all that really matter to me.

Marshawn Lynch has fired back at his critics at the Super Bowl Thursday (above), explaining why he does not speak to the press . This as Lynch and his Seattle Seahawks are set to take on the New England Patriots Sunday . When Lynch arrived at the podium, a man with a reporter's credential who said he was a teacher asked him to give his students a 'shoutout.' But the running back wouldn't bite and began his unscripted statement. 'Y'all shove cameras and microphones down my throat' Lynch continued. 'But when I'm at home in my environment, I don't see y'all, but y'all mad at me. And if you ain't mad at me, then what y'all here for? I ain't got nothing for y'all, though. I told y'all that.' Lynch, who had spurned reporters' efforts to get him to talk at mandatory news conferences Tuesday and Wednesday, seemed frustrated that they were still trying. 'I'm here preparing for a game. And y'all want to ask me these questions, which is understandable. I could get down with that. But I told y'all. I'm not about to say nothing. ... All of my requirements are fulfilled.' Lynch praised his teammates, his hometown of Oakland, California, and his Family First Foundation. When asked who the best player on the Seahawks was, he said: ""All of them."" As he has all week, Lynch stayed five minutes before leaving. At Media Day on Tuesday, Lynch repeated: 'I'm just here so I don't get fined' while talking to reporters. On Wednesday, he replied to all questions with: 'You know why I'm here.' Lynch has a history of avoiding reporters. In November, the NFL fined him $50,000 for violations of the league's media policy in addition to collecting the $50,000 fine that was imposed against Lynch for violations last season. The fine from 2013 was held in anticipation of future cooperation from Lynch. The Professional Football Writers of America complained to the league about Tuesday's session and Lynch had been apprised of a potential fine. A league spokesman declined comment. Lynch again wore a Beast Mode baseball cap and told everyone where they could buy one. The two hats he already wore this week have sold out on Lynch's website, where they're part of his Beast Mode apparel line.","Marshawn Lynch of the Seattle Seahawks spoke to the press at the Super Bowl for the first time on Thursday .

"Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, said society's concept of rape needed to be challenged, and called for an end to victim-blaming . Date rape suspects will now need to prove that a woman consented as part of tough new rules on the way sex offence cases are investigated. The Crown Prosecution Service said the time has come to move beyond the idea of 'no means no' when it comes to identifying situations where women may have been unable to give consent. As part of the major overhaul, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, said she wanted police to ask suspects how they knew the alleged victim was saying yes, and was doing so 'freely and knowingly'. The CPS wants to tighten the law against offenders who target people incapacitated through drink or drugs, or where the alleged rapist holds a position of power over the victim. Questions on consent should also be raised where the complainant has mental health problems or learning difficulties, it was said. The rules also aims to stop suspects using social media to construct ‘false narratives’ to help cover their tracks. Numbers of rape cases coming to court in the past two years have risen by 30 per cent but police remain concerned that as many as three quarters of victims do not come forward. Mrs Saunders said: ‘For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent – by drinking or dressing provocatively for example. 'But it is not they who are confused, it is society itself and we must challenge that. Consent to sexual activity is not a grey area – in law it is clearly defined and must be given fully and freely. ‘It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime for a rapist to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink. ‘It is now well established that many rape victims freeze rather than fight as a protective and coping mechanism.’ Speaking at a conference yesterday, Mrs Saunders added: ‘We want police and prosecutors to make sure they ask in every case where consent is the issue – how did the suspect know the complainant was saying yes and doing so freely and knowingly?’ New CPS rules say such situations include where someone is incapacitated through drink or drugs or where ‘a suspect held a position of power over the potential victim – as a teacher, an employer, a doctor or a fellow gang member’. The ability to consent to sex should also be questioned where the complainant has mental health problems, learning difficulties or was asleep or unconscious at the time of the alleged attack. Police will be asked to consider whether consent was given  freely. Factors which would give the defendant power over the victim, such as being a teacher, doctor or gang member, will be considered . Also covered are domestic violence situations and those where ‘the complainant may be financially or otherwise dependent on their alleged rapist’. During the conference a hypothetical case was examined by police and prosecutors involving an 18-year-old student in her first week at university who went to a party with an older male student, drank and took drugs then woke to find him in her room. She repeatedly told him to leave but he took off her clothes and when it was clear that he was about to rape her, she gave him a condom for protection. Prosecutors and police were asked whether the man should be prosecuted for rape – and an overwhelming number said yes. On the rise: More than 22,000 rapes were reported to police in 2013/2014 - up almost a third on 2012/13 . In discussion of the case, it was recommended that should a complaint have been made, police should check social networking sites as standard practice for evidence and to check if the defendants had posted comments putting a deceptively innocent spin on the night. New guidelines issued to police and prosecutors warn that ‘offenders may take steps which, on the face might seem normal or reasonable, to distance themselves from an offence or to reframe the offence … in order to undermine or pre-empt any allegation’. Officers are urged to watch for suspects being over-friendly or seeking reassurance and reinterpreting events leading up to the offence as spontaneous rather than planned. The conference heard that other examples of behaviour to try to conceal an offence of rape include boasting to friends, pretending to fall asleep afterwards, or making counter-allegations. Delegates were told by Martin Hewitt, a Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner, that the rise in reporting of rapes was ‘unreservedly welcome’. The conference heard this was partly due to abuse scandals involving figures such as Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris. But Mr Hewitt added: ‘The reality is that we are still only getting 20-25 per cent of those who suffer the offence … 75 per cent of those [who are raped] are not coming forward.’ Charities today welcomed the new guidance, saying it could boost victims' confidence in the justice system. Katie Russell, from Rape Crisis England & Wales, said it was 'vital if the criminal justice system is to become fit for purpose for survivors of sexual violence'. She said: 'Rape and other sexual offences have long been under-reported, with the Government estimating that only 15 per cent of those who experience these horrific crimes choose to go to the police. 'Through our frontline work at Rape Crisis, we know that among the many reasons for survivors' reluctance to report is fear, including fear of not being well treated by the criminal justice system. 'We hope the police, Crown Prosecution Service and others will continue to strive for positive change of this kind to enable the cultural shift necessary for sexual violence survivors to receive the criminal justice they want and deserve.' 'Operation Yewtree' effect: The prosecution of celebrity figures such as Jimmy Savile, pictured, for historical offences has encouraged other victims to come forward, the Office for National Statistics said . The number of rapes in Britain hit a record high in 2013 - with more than 35 women attacked every day according to the latest official figures, released in October. An extra 4,000 women were raped in the year to June than in the previous 12 months - a shock 36 per cent increase in a year - police recorded crime figures revealed. Overall, 13,455 women reported being raped in 2013/14 – the highest in 10 years of recording the crime. Attacks on men, girls and boys also soared – with the number of rapes almost twice as high as a decade ago. Martin Hewitt, a Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner, told the conference yesterday that the rise in reporting of rapes was ‘unreservedly welcome’. But he said these figures still only represented between 20-25 per cent of those who are raped - meaning 75 per cent are still not coming forward. Despite the increase in the number of rapes being reported, the conviction rate over the same period fell. In 2012/13 police sent 5,400 cases to the Crown Prosecution Service in 2012-13, representing just 31 per cent of all reported rapes they had received. Of the cases sent to prosecutors for trial, around 60 per cent result in convictions. It represented a 3 per cent drop from the previous year, when 63 per cent of cases resulted in convictions. The Office for National Statistics said the increase in reports of sex attacks could be due to an 'Operation Yewtree' effect – where the prosecution of celebrity figures such as Jimmy Savile for historical offences has encouraged other victims to come forward. It said improvements in police recording of sexual offences could be another reason for the rise.","Alison Saunders said it is time to move beyond 'no means no' argument .
Police will ask whether consent given freely, and how defendant knew that .
Will also look for attempts to undermine allegation on social media .
Police believe almost three quarters of rapes are still going unreported ."
"Death row inmate Richard Glossip, whose execution has been blocked after challenging Oklahoma's lethal injection procedure . The U.S. Supreme Court has blocked the execution of three inmates on death row in Oklahoma after they challenged the state's lethal injection procedure. The decision means that convicted killers Richard Glossip, John Grant and Benjamin Cole will not be put to death using a sedative, which they have claimed is cruel. However, the court's order does leave open the possibility that the state could proceed with the executions of the prisoners using different drug combinations. Last week, the high court agreed to hear the case, but did not block the inmates' death sentences at that time. Arguments before the high court are set for April, with a decision due by the end of June. Oklahoma's three-drug process has been under scrutiny since the botched execution of convicted murderer Clayton Lockett in April last year. He could be seen twisting on the gurney after death chamber staff failed to place the IV properly. The inmates challenging the state's procedures argue the sedative midazolam, used by Oklahoma, cannot achieve the level of unconsciousness required for surgery, making it unsuitable for executions. Dale Baich, an attorney representing the inmates said: 'The scientific evidence tells us that even the proper administration of midazolam can result in an inhumane execution. But the state of Oklahoma contends its current drug combination is appropriate and effective. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin explained: 'I disagree with the necessity to grant Glossip yet another round of legal appeals. 'However, given that the U.S. Supreme Court has decided to hear his case, it is entirely appropriate to delay his execution until after the legal process has run its course. The executions of Benjamin Cole, left, and John Grant, right, have also been blocked after a Supreme Court order . Glossip, who was convicted of arranging for his employer to be beaten to death, was scheduled to be executed on Thursday. After hearing the news that his execution has been blocked, Glossip told the Huffington Post: 'I've felt amazing today. 'Unless it's your life on the line, you don't know how heavy it is.' He has staunchly maintained his innocence from the start, and his case has attracted the support of high-profile death penalty opponents. The Supreme Court's, pictured, order does leave open the possibility that the state could proceed with the executions of the prisoners using different drug combinations . Grant, who stabbed a correctional worker to death, was due to be executed on February 19, while Cole, convicted of killing his nine-month-old daughter, was scheduled for execution on March 5. In a similar case earlier this month, the high court declined to halt Oklahoma's execution of Charles Warner, convicted of raping and murdering an 11-month-old baby. Warner had raised the same legal question as the other inmates.","Decision means three convicted killers will not be put to death using drug .

"In the past year experts including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have said the rise of ‘super-intelligent’ robots poses a threat to humanity. And now Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, too, has joined the voices calling for caution. He said the rise of AI should be a concern, and he doesn't understand why people are not taking the threat seriously. Scroll down for video . Bill Gates (pictured) has joined Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking in warning that AI poses a threat to humanity. In an AMA on Reddit he said he is 'concerned about super intelligence'. And he said he doesn't understand why some people are not concerned. He also revealed Microsoft was working on a virtual 'Personal Agent' Taking part in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) Q&A session on Reddit, Mr Gates - who lives in the state of Washington, US - said: ‘I am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence. ‘First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. ‘A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.’ It has been suggested that as robots become more advanced, and we ask them to perform more and more tasks, they may be unable to empathise with human ethics and morals. Source: Philosophical Disquisitions . 'Suppose that the programmers decide that the AI should pursue the final goal of “making people smile”. 'To human beings, this might seem perfectly benevolent. Thanks to their natural biases and filters, they might imagine an AI telling us funny jokes or otherwise making us laugh. 'But there are other ways of making people smile, some of which are not-so benevolent. You could make everyone smile by paralsying their facial musculature so that it is permanently frozen in a beaming smile. 'Such a method might seem perverse to us, but not to an AI. It may decide that coming up with funny jokes was a laborious and inefficient way of making people smile. Facial paralysis is much more efficient.' Specifically, they may not be able to really understand right from wrong like a human does, no matter how safely we think we have programmed them. Back in December,  Professor Hawking echoed Gates' sentiments, telling the BBC: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' This followed claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history, [but] unfortunately, it might also be the last.' In November, Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind Space-X and Tesla, warned that the risk of 'something seriously dangerous happening' as a result of machines with artificial intelligence, could be in as few as five years. He has previously linked the development of autonomous, thinking machines, to 'summoning the demon'. Speaking at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AeroAstro Centennial Symposium in October, Musk described artificial intelligence as our 'biggest existential threat'. He said: 'I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence. 'I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish. 'With artificial intelligence we're summoning the demon. You know those stories where there's the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he's sure he can control the demon? Doesn't work out.' Bill Gates' warning on AI echoes similar comments made by Elon Musk (left) and Stephen Hawking (right). In December Professor Hawking told the BBC: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race,' while Musk has warned of 'something seriously dangerous happening' It has been suggested that as robots become more advanced (stock image shown), and we ask them to perform more and more tasks, they may be unable to empathise with human ethics and morals . Elsewhere in the AMA, Mr Gates answered some other questions from Reddit users. Responding to one comment, he hinted at a new technology he was working on that could act as a sort of personal assistant, although he did not elaborate much further. Earlier this month Microsoft  revealed  a 'holodeck' headset that allows wearers to see 3D images superimposed over their vision. The wireless headset, called HoloLens, can project 3D images into the wearer's field of view - making it appear as if screens, games and even people are in front of them. It uses a visor to project 'holographic' images onto the wearer's field of view. It uses sensors to track the wearer's head to ensure the hologram is in the same way. A projection system them beams the holographic images into the wearer's eye, fooling the brain into thinking they are real. The cameras also has a camera to track the user's hands, allowing them to interact with the holographic images. ‘One project I am working on with Microsoft is the Personal Agent which will remember everything and help you go back and find things and help you pick what things to pay attention to,' he said. ‘The idea that you have to find applications and pick them and they each are trying to tell you what is new is just not the efficient model - the agent will help solve this. It will work across all your devices.’ And if Microsoft hadn’t worked out for him when he started the company back in 1975, Mr Gates said he ‘would probably be a researcher on AI.’ He continued: ‘When I started Microsoft I was worried I would miss the chance to do basic work in that field.’ He also had time to comment on the newly revealed HoloLens, saying: ‘The HoloLens is pretty amazing. Microsoft has put a lot into the chips and the software. 'It is the start of virtual reality. Making the device so you don't get dizzy or nauseous is really hard - the speed of the alignment has to be super super fast. It will take a few years of software applications being built to realize the full promise of this.'

"A dinosaur with a long serpent-like neck that resembles a traditional Chinese dragon has been discovered by construction workers in southern China. The 49 feet (15 metres) long dinosaur lived around 160 million years ago during the Late Jurassic period. It was discovered by a construction workers digging in Qijiang City, in China, when they hit a series or large neck vertebrae that were stretched out in the ground. Qijianglong, seen here in an artists impression being chased by two carnivorous dinosaurs lived around 160 million years ago in southern China. Its name means Dragon of Qijiang, due to its long serpentine neck . Palaeontologists who have reconstructed the skeleton say that the enormous neck accounts for up to half of the length of the animal. They have now named the new dinosaur Qijianglong, which means dragon of Qijiang, after the distinctive serpentine dragons depicted in Chinese legends. The fossilised remains of the biggest dinosaur ever discovered were found in Argentina. Named Titanosaur, the dinosaur weighed 85 tons, about as heavy as 14 African elephants, according to palaeontolgists. The herbivore sauropod is thought to have lived between 95 million and 100 million years ago in the Cretaceous period forests of Patagonia. After first being discovered by a farm worker, scientists then unearthed 150 bones of seven individuals. They estimate that the gigantic animal would have been 130ft (40m) long and 65ft (20m) tall. Most long-necked dinosaurs, or sauropods, have necks that only measure about one third of their body length. Scientists have also speculated whether discoveries of other similar fossils in the past may have led to the legends of the distinctive serpent-like dragons that persist through out China. Tetsuto Miyashita, one of the scientists at the University of Alberta who studied the fossil, said it was extremely unusual to find an animal with its neck in tact. He said: 'It is rare to find a head and neck of a long-necked dinosaur together because the head is so small and easily detached after the animal dies. 'Qijianglong is a cool animal. If you imagine a big animal that is half neck, you can see that evolution can do quite extraordinary things. 'I wonder if the ancient Chinese stumbled upon a skeleton of a long-necked dinosaur like Qijianglong and pictured that mythical creature.' The huge fossilised vertebrae, above, of Qijianglong were first dug up by construction workers in Qijiang . A reconstructed skeleton of Qijianglong, seen above, is now on display in Qijiang Museum in China . The new species is thought to belong to a group of dinosaurs called mamenchisaurids, plant eating dinosaurs found through out Asia with particularly long necks. Unlike others in the group, however, Qijianglong appears to have had air pockets within the huge bones in its vertebrae. The Qijianglong's neck (shown above) makes up more than half of its entire 49 feet long body length . This would have meant that the animal's neck was relatively lightweight despite its huge size. Unlike the mythical dragons in China, however, the neck would also have been relatively stiff. The scientists studying the fossil found that the bones of the vertebrae had interlocking joints, meaning it could bend up and down but was unable to move side to side much. This stiffness could have meant that the creature was limited in the food it could access. Qijianglong was also far from being the largest mamenchisaurid - the first of the group found in 1952 called Mamenchisaurus reached up to 115 feet (35m) in length. Mr Miyashita, a PhD student working with palaeontologistofessor Philip Currie at the University of Alberta, said the new discovery, which was first unearthed in 2006, could help provide new details about why these dinosaurs evolved such long necks. Their study is published in the Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology. He said: 'Qijianglong shows that long-necked dinosaurs diversified in unique ways in Asia during Jurassic times—something very special was going on in that continent. 'Nowhere else we can find dinosaurs with longer necks than those in China. 'The new dinosaur tells us that these extreme species thrived in isolation from the rest of the world. 'It is still a mystery why mamenchisaurids did not migrate to other continents.' Serpentine dragons have become a popular part of traditional Chinese culture and celebration. Early discoveries of fossils similar to Qijianglong could have started the legends about these mythical creatures .","The dinosaur has been named Qijianglong, which means dragon of Qijiang .

"There have been 50 online bomb threats made since January 17 when a social media post led to a plane being evacuated in North Carolina, a US official claimed. CNN reports that an unnamed official blamed the publicity surrounding the earlier incident for spawning copycat threats, as airlines have seen the number of threats increase sharply. 'We are continuing to investigate these threats with our law enforcement and airline partners as we do with all stated threats,' an FBI spokesman told the network. An unnamed US official told CNN that there have been 50 bomb threats known to authorities since the January 17 grounding of a Delta flight out of Atlanta (file photo) 'Threats of this nature can and do result in costly responses from a multitude of law enforcement and airport entities and greatly inconvenience travelers. Individuals responsible can be prosecuted federally,' the official added. WRAL reports that a January 17 Delta flight out of Atlanta was grounded at Raleigh-Durham due to a social media threat. Passengers were ordered to leave their luggage and exit out the back of the plane before being detained several hours in airline authority offices. On January 24, a post on Twitter against two flights was deemed credible enough that two F-16 fighter jets were scrambled to escort the planes into Atlanta. Southwest Airlines Flight 2492 from Milwaukee and Delta Air Lines Flight 1156 from Portland both landed safely at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Once on the ground, the planes were searched by bomb-disposal units, which gave the all clear, according to airline officials.

FBI special agent in charge Britt Johnson told WSB-TV the Joint Terrorism Task Force is currently investigating, though the agency has not yet labeled the incident an act of terrorism.

"In the weeks following Christmas, thousands of children across Britain sat down to write thank you letters to friends and family kind enough to give them a present. But parents at one primary school were left fuming after they discovered their children had been told to do the complete opposite and complain about the gifts they received. Children as young as seven were asked by teachers to write a letter of complaint to Father Christmas about their 'rubbish' presents. Ungrateful: Children at a school in Kent were told to write a letter to Father Christmas, complaining about their presents . Pupils in years three and four at Green Park Community Primary School in Dover, Kent, were told to 'use adjectives' to describe their shoddy gifts and how they felt when they tore off the wrapping paper. Children were instructed to use 'metaphors and personification' to get a gold award for their work, while all children were told to tell Father Christmas what they expected him to do about it. Some, including Charlotte Balfe's nine-year-old daughter Summer, were told do the task as homework. Summer did the homework reluctantly as she was worried she would 'get into trouble' if she did not. Mrs Balfe said: 'My little girl did this homework as she was worried about getting told off by the school. I think it was wrong they were given it to do though.' Other furious parents took to Facebook to vent their anger at the posts. Stacey Britton wrote: 'I was appalled when Cole come home with his homework stating this...sufficed to say he's not doing it!' Pupils in years three and four at Green Park Community Primary School (pictured) in Dover, Kent, were told to 'use adjectives' to describe their shoddy gifts . Headmaster Richard Hawkins did not apologise for the assignment, calling it a 'bit of a misunderstanding' Tisha Fullbrook said: 'My kids school homework is that this week! Mine ain't doing it!' Carolanne Kemp added: 'My son wont be doing this homework, i teach him to be grateful for what he's given not complain about it as other children are not so fortunate. 'Not to mention the fact that his dad worked bloody hard including working overtime to make sure he had a brilliant christmas only for him to be told to write a letter complaining about what he got... i dont think so!!' Richard Hawkins, the headteacher of the 265-pupil school rated 'Good' by Ofsted, said the homework was not meant to cause offence. He said: 'Lots of the children understood what the home work was about - writing a letter of complaint. 'We chose Santa as they are used to writing letters to Santa.' He added: 'Some parents said they didn't want their child to complain about presents. We took that feedback and reacted quickly to it. 'It led to engaging families and discussions with the parents which is always good. 'It's a little bit of a misunderstanding. We have a fantastic record with homework.'
