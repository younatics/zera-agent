"(CNN) -- Juventus will go into Italian football's winter break level on points with leaders AC Milan after being held 0-0 by third-placed Udinese on Wednesday. Antonio Conte's team extended their unbeaten run to 16 Serie A matches to keep pace with the defending champions, who beat Cagliari 2-0 on Tuesday. Claudio Marchisio came closest to scoring in the eighth minute when he scraped the post with a low shot, while the home side rarely tested Juve keeper Gianluigi Buffon and had coach Francesco Guidolin sent to the stands late in the match. ""If someone had told me in July that we would finish the year without losing I would have thought he was mad,"" Conte told reporters. Fourth-placed Lazio could have joined Udinese on 32 points -- two behind the leaders -- but only drew 0-0 at home to Chievo. Inter Milan moved up to fifth with a 4-1 victory over bottom club Lecce, while Napoli took sixth on goal difference after crushing Genoa 6-1 with two early goals from striker Edinson Cavani. Roma also have 24 points after a 2-0 win at Bologna, while ninth-placed Palermo blew a two-goal lead in the 2-2 draw at Novara in new coach Bortolo Mutti's first match. Atalanta striker German Denis took his season tally to a league-leading 12 with a penalty in the 4-1 victory over Cesena that lifted his club up to 11th, while Parma and Catania drew 3-3. German Cup holders Schalke failed to reach this season's quarterfinals after losing 3-1 at Bundesliga high-flyers Borussia Monchengladbach. Young Gladbach striker Marco Reus netted two goals on 57 and 88, while Schalke had Dutch forward Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and U.S. midfielder Jermaine Jones sent off at the start and end of the second half respectively. Top-flight club Mainz also crashed out, losing 2-0 to fourth division Holstein Kiel, but Hertha Berlin went through with a 3-1 win over Bundesliga rivals Kaiserslautern. Struggling Spanish club Villarreal sacked coach Juan Carlos Garrido after exiting the Copa del Rey at the hands of third division Mirandes, losing 2-0 on Wednesday for a 3-1 aggregate defeat. Atletico Madrid also went out to third division Albacete by the same overall result after losing 1-0 at home. Second division Alcorcon ousted La Liga strugglers Zaragoza with a 2-0 away win, also progressing 3-1 on aggregate.","AC Milan retain Serie A lead after second-placed Juventus draw 0-0 at Udinese .

"Paris (CNN) -- The French government will pay for tens of thousands of women to have silicone breast implants removed over concerns about a possible link to a rare form of cancer, the Ministry of Health said Wednesday. French health authorities are due to make a recommendation Friday about whether women with implants by a company called Poly Implant Prosthese (PIP) must have them removed. The ministry says about 30,000 French women have PIP implants, which are not currently approved for use in the United States. According to a news release from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, PIP is now defunct. It says the company ""used non-medical grade silicone believed by the manufacturers to be made for mattresses."" The French government agency that evaluates the safety of medical products says 523 women have had them removed since a defect was discovered last year. More than 1,000 implants have ruptured since then, the agency says. British authorities are advising caution over the implants but are not going as far as the French. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said Tuesday it was ""aware of the recent report in France of the death of a woman implanted with breast implants from anaplastic large cell lymphoma,"" which it called ""a rare form of cancer which affects cells from the immune system."" It said it would ""monitor for any associations of all types of breast implants, including PIP, with cancers and any other health implications."" But it did not advise women with PIP implants to have them taken out, saying more generally that ""women with any type of breast implant... who have questions about their breasts or think that their implants may have ruptured, should seek clinical advice from their implanting surgeon."" A committee made up of representatives of several French health agencies was set up December 14 to discuss PIP implants. Women will only be reimbursed for new implants if they were originally for reconstructive surgery, the Health Ministry said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration decided in March 2000 not to approve saline PIP implants in the United States. The company never submitted a marketing application for its silicone implants in the United States, the agency says. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro and Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","The French Health ministry is concerned over a possible cancer link .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona forward Lionel Messi leads a three-man shortlist for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, the award given to the world's best footballer, which was announced on Monday. The 24-year-old is joined by Barca teammate Xavi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo on the list, with the winner being announced at the FIFA Ballon d'Or Gala in Zurich, Switzerland, on January 9 2012. Argentina star Messi is looking to win the accolade for the third year in a row, having been crowned the game's leading player in 2009 and 2010. Spain's Xavi was third last year while Portugal's Ronaldo won the award in 2008. Should Messi once again be named the world's best, he would draw level with Frenchman Zinedine Zidane and Brazilian Ronaldo as a three-time winner of the gong. Messi and Xavi were part of the Barca team which defeated Manchester United 3-1 at London's Wembley stadium in May to become European champions, while the pair also helped the Catalans seal a third consecutive Spanish Primera Liga title. Ronaldo netted the winning goal as Real beat Barca to clinch last season's Copa del Rey, going on to finish the 2010-11 season as the top goalscorer in Spain. In the women's game, Brazil's Marta will look to take home the prize for the sixth consecutive year. The 25-year-old is joined on the shortlist by Abby Wambach of the U.S. and Homare Sawa, a 2011 World Cup winner with Japan. Barca's Josep Guardiola heads the nominees for the Coach of the Year award, alongside Real's Jose Mourinho and Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who guided the Red Devils to a record 19th English championship last season. Norio Sasaki is up for the women's award after guiding Japan to their first World Cup triumph in July, with France's Bruno Bini and Sweden coach Pia Sundhage also shortlisted. The FIFA Puskas Award, named after legendary Hungary striker Ferenc Puskas, is awarded to the player who has scored the ""most beautiful goal of the year"", with Messi once again in the running. Messi's chip and volley against Arsenal is shortlisted, with Manchester United's Wayne Rooney also nominated for his spectacular overhead kick against arch rivals Manchester City. Brazil's Neymar is the final nominee for the Puskas Award, with his brilliant solo dribble for Santos against Flamengo completing the three-goal list.","Barcelona's Lionel Messi heads three-man FIFA Ballon d'Or shortlist .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City retained their leadership of the English Premier League as a David Silva goal settled a high-class clash against Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium Sunday. Champions and city rivals Manchester United had gone a point clear with an earlier 2-0 win over Queens Park Rangers, but City responded with their eighth straight league victory in their home stadium. Sergio Aguero wasted a great chance for City as they made a strong opening, but they had to wait until the 53rd minute to make the breakthrough. Mario Balotelli's shot was pushed out by Wojceich Szczesny and Silva reacted quickest to prod the ball home. Is Mancini the right man to lead Man City? Pablo Zabaleta saw his shot rattle the Arsenal post, but the visitors played their part in a pulsating encounter. Central defender Thomas Vermaelen drew a fingertip save from Joe Hart as the clock counted down and then saw another curling effort go inches wide. But Roberto Mancini's men held on for the win to restore their two points advantage over United. ""It was massive for us, we didn't underestimate the importance of this game and we're happy with the result and to keep a clean sheet,"" said City captain Vincent Kompany. Alex Ferguson's men were on the front foot at Loftus Road from the moment Wayne Rooney headed home their opener inside the first minute. Midfielder Michael Carrick grabbed his first goal for United in 70 games to wrap up the win in the second half. Tottenham Hotspur moved back into third place with a 1-0 win over Sunderland, but saw winger Aaron Lennon limp off after a hamstring tear in the first half. His replacement Roman Pavlyunchenko scored the only goal just after the hour mark after clever work by Rafael van der Vaart. Liverpool maintained their push for a Champions League spot with a 2-0 win at Aston Villa whose fans vented their frustration at manager Alex McLeish. Craig Bellamy opened the scoring and then set up Martin Skrtel with a 15th minute corner to put Kenny Dalglish's team on course for a fifth away win of the season. They are now level on points and goal difference with fifth-placed Arsenal.","David Silva goal gives Manchester City 1-0 win over Arsenal .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pfc. Bradley Manning allegedly suggested to someone at the Kansas military prison where he is being held that WikiLeaks paid for the hundreds of thousands of leaked documents, according to a legal document filed in the Article 32 proceedings for Manning. This suggestion of payment for secrets could be a pivotal issue in the Manning case, and down the road in any potential effort by the government to prosecute WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The heavily censored legal document filed by the defense lawyer for espionage suspect Bradley Manning suggests the admission came up in conversation between Manning and an unidentified person at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The existence of the document was first reported by Politico. ""He will testify that he explained the purpose of his visit and asked PFC Manning who he was and why he was at the JRCF (Joint Regional Correction Facility),"" the document says. The name and details were blacked out out in the document by the Army Criminal Court of Appeals before it was provided to CNN as the result of a Freedom of Information Request. ""PFC Manning allegedly responded with, 'I sold information to WikiLeaks,' "" according to the defense document. ""Shortly after this alleged statement, the guards realized that (name blacked out) should not have been in the pre-trial area,"" the statement continues. But the claim seems to contradict a claim made by Manning to a hacker named Adrian Lamo. Manning confided in Lamo about his access to the classified documents. In an instant message exchange obtained by Wired Magazine, Manning wrote he could have made a lot of money selling the documents to Russia or China but rejected the idea because ""it belongs in the public domain,"" and ""information should be free."" The document lists 48 possible witnesses, most of which were denied by the investigating officer overseeing this preliminary Article 32 hearing. The list seems to include President Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking officials, but the names and much of the details are redacted. The defense criticized the investigating officer for refusing most of their witness requests and it appears the person who heard the alleged statement by Manning at Leavenworth did not appear at the hearing this week.","Pfc.

Bhutto, who was campaigning for next month's parliamentary elections, had completed an election rally minutes earlier and was leaving the rally site, Rawalpindi's Liaquat Bagh Park, at the time of the attack. As a shocked Pakistan absorbed the news of Bhutto's death, authorities called for calm and asked residents to stay inside. Many obliged, shuttering shops or rushing home from work and surrendering the streets to protesters who set fire to banks, shops and gas stations, blocked streets and pelted police with rocks, Pakistani media reported. At least five people were killed in Karachi in the violence, GEO TV reported, and dozens more were wounded. Police in Khairpur fired on an angry mob, killing two people, the station reported, and two more people were killed in Larkana.

She climbed into a white Land Rover and stood through the sunroof to wave to crowds after the speech. It was then that someone fired two shots, and Bhutto slumped back into the vehicle, said John Moore, a news photographer with Getty Images who saw what happened. Seconds later an explosion rocked the park, sending orange flames into the throng of Bhutto supporters and littering the park with twisted metal and chunks of rubble.

"New Orleans (CNN) -- How do you balance work with motherhood and your belief in God? I posed that question to actress Regina King, when she arrived for her Red Chair interview. ""Being honest that sometimes it's not balanced,"" she responded, her skin flawless, her muscles well-defined. She elaborated that celebrities are no different than people of other professions. They, too, have to work hard to sync schedules and determine their priorities and their beliefs. Do not put yourself in a box or even label yourself, she said. Juggling is the key to any balancing act. King took acting lessons from Todd Bridges' mother from 9 to 14. Betty A. Bridges ran an acting school. That coaching helped the teenaged King land a role in the TV series ""227."" Her career continued with pivotal roles in films such as ""Jerry Maguire,"" ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back,"" and ""Enemy of the State."" On the small screen, she's starred in ""24"" and ""Southland."" It was, however, the real-life role of mother that was by far, her ""a-ha"" moment. ""I get emotional because my son is an amazing young man, and it took me to be a mother for me to realize how incredible of a woman she (my mother) is. You don't know what unconditional love is. You may say you do, but if you don't have a child, you don't know what that is. But when you experience it, it is the most fulfilling ever. So, that is the greatest part about me.

King revealed that she and all of her sisters have been diagnosed with high blood pressure. King is one to seek relaxation. ""Are you from here?"" the Los Angeles native asked me.

"(CNN) -- A Florida man pleaded guilty Friday to kidnapping, molesting and murdering a 7-year-old girl more than two years ago, an admission that elicited anger, disbelief and contempt from the slain's child's relatives. As part of a plea deal reached with prosecutors, Jarred Harrell was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole, waiving his right to appeal, after pleading guilty to first-degree murder, kidnapping, sexual battery and lewd and lascivious molestation. He admitted in court that he made the agreement in order to avoid potentially facing a death penalty. ""You're not even a human being,"" the victim's sister said in court after Harrell's plea. ""Your name is not Jarred Harrell. Your name is monster."" She was one of several relatives of Somer Thompson who took the stand in the tear-filled courtroom Friday to give victim's impact statements. Several of them noted that Harrell refused to look at them, including the slain girl's twin brother. ""She trusted you, but you had to do what you did and look where it got you. And now you're going to jail,"" yelled out the boy, now 9, after trying to stare down his sister's killer. Somer Thompson went missing in October 2009 in the Clay County town of Orange Park, Florida. Her sister, then 10, told police that Thompson had been in a fight with another girl at school that day and had brought up the subject while she and her brother walked her home. Thompson ran off, apparently upset. The older sister said she lost sight of her in a group of other children leaving the school, according to a police report. Days later, Thompson's body was found about 55 miles north of Orange Park in a landfill in Folkston, Georgia. In February 2010, Harrell was arrested in Meridian, Mississippi, by federal agents following a search of his Florida residence, Clay County authorities said. He was charged with 29 counts of child pornography, and eventually was extradited to Florida. A few weeks later, on April 1, 2010, Harrell was indicted on the four additional counts -- first-degree murder, kidnapping, sexual battery and lewd and lascivious molestation -- related to the disappearance and death. In the indictment, prosecutors said Harrell, now 26, killed the girl ""by asphyxiation with blunt force injuries."" He also ""forcibly or by threat"" held the girl ""against her will and without lawful authority,"" the document states. Harrell initially pleaded not guilty to all the charges -- from the murder to the child pornography counts -- before changing his plea on the various counts on Friday. Succinctly answering questions posed by 4th Judicial Circuit Judge Don Lester, Harrell admitted to the facts of the crime, including taking video and pictures of Somer Thompson. Prosecutor Steve Nelson noted that there were ""numerous consultations"" with Somer's relatives about the plea deal, and that several law enforcement agencies were included in the process. The slain girl's mother, Diena Thompson, said she couldn't bring herself to forgive what Harrell did to ""an innocent child."" ""835 days ago, you lured my baby into your lair with trickery and malice in your soul,"" the mother said, after following her son to the stand to give the final victim's impact statement. ""All to commit unspeakable acts of your own selfish desires and flat-out evilness."" Diena Thompson added that Harrell took her daughter's dignity, virginity and then life, ""and after all that, you then treated my child like trash."" ""It is now time to take out the trash,"" she said, referring to Harrell. ""May God have mercy on your sorry, sorry soul.""","NEW: ""Your name is monster,"" a girl says of her sister's killer .

"(Oprah.com) -- It began with a sign reading ""Be excellent to each other,"" which I printed from my computer in Gothic type and taped to my workspace. I was about to launch into a series of temporary jobs to supplement my freelance writing income. My plan was to temp for a few months, save enough money so I could stay home and write for a while, back and forth, my intention being eventually to write full-time. As is often the case with best-laid plans, however, I soon discovered an unexpected goal within my temporary career: the pursuit of excellence as a way of life. The phrase on the sign was borrowed from the silly eighties movie ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure."" I hoped it would remind me to be helpful, apply myself fully to every task, and be kind to even the most unpleasant individuals. I also secretly wished people would see the slogan and take the words to heart. My fellow temps were skeptical. ""People treat temps like dirt,"" they scoffed. ""You'll be lucky if you can maintain excellence through your first assignment."" They had a point: I was likely to meet challenges. Nevertheless, I rolled up my sleeves and went to work. Oprah.com: How to make yourself more marketable . The sign made its debut at a corporation that designed robots (affectionately called ""the girls"") for the food-packaging industry. Dubbing myself Robo Temp, I typed, filed, and amused my coworkers by invariably responding ""I'll tell your fans"" when they announced their departures for lunch. No one seemed to notice the sign until several days into the job, when I set up a videotape for a troubleshooting meeting. The tape showed ""the girls"" malfunctioning -- throwing chocolate chip cookies at each other instead of neatly filing them into their respective boxes. ""Hey,"" I heard a software engineer exclaim as I left the room. ""They aren't being excellent to each other!"" ""Yeah!"" someone else shouted. ""Be excellent to each other!"" Later someone left a box of the girls' cookies in the break room, accompanied by a note: ""For the team. Thanks for your excellent help."" Not everyone embraced excellence with such enthusiasm. Some people ignored the sign (and the intention). Others were short-tempered, despite my best efforts. But, for the most part, my colleagues responded positively to kindness. They grew radiant when I told them their jade earrings made their eyes look beautiful or when I complimented them on a haircut. They took pride in their work when I admired the brilliant organization of a paper they'd written. They opened up more to others when I inquired about their weekend and actually listened to their responses. When I smiled, they smiled back. Oprah.com: 5 mistakes women bosses make . On one occasion, being excellent even helped redirect the career of an unhappy administrative assistant. After overhearing her on the phone with her daughter, I asked if she had majored in child psychology, since she seemed especially gifted at dealing with children. Several weeks later, she came to thank me for my observation and to say goodbye: She was leaving to open her own day-care center. As a longtime Zen student, I had been taught to appreciate small, mundane moments -- moments opportune for practicing excellence in the workplace. For example, seemingly endless sit-at-the-receptionist-desk moments prompted me to be aware of when someone needed a sympathetic ear. Humdrum Xeroxing moments were great for noticing harried coworkers who might appreciate assistance in meeting a deadline. Oh-so-yawnish envelope-stuffing projects were ideal times for spotting bottles to be carried to the recycling bin and spiders that needed to be taken outside in paper cups. Oprah.com: Could flextime work for you? During mundane moments, I came to understand that excellence wasn't about being perfect or about being nice so people would like me. On the contrary, sometimes it meant defending someone against vicious gossip or saying no to a colleague who asked me to lie about his overtime hours. I also realized that there were some people I couldn't be excellent to, like the account manager who regularly screamed at his staff. There were other people no amount of excellence could save, like the typist who would rather be treated as a victim than receive any kind of help. Eventually, I would carry my sign to more than 100 jobs in Boston and Boulder, Colorado, at universities, high-tech companies, museums, manufacturers, publishers, environmental research organizations, and even a wildlife rehab center. My tasks included FedExing socks and underwear to a corporate spy whose business trip was unexpectedly extended and feeding warm milk from eyedroppers to newborn squirrels. After a few years of temping, I branched out. First I wrote two books on what Buddhists call right livelihood -- earning a living without doing harm -- hoping that others might benefit from what I had learned. Oprah.com: 10 steps to a more organized workspace . Next I offered employment workshops through university extension programs and community centers, where I intended to present practical information but somehow ended up teaching excellence as well. Meanwhile, in my personal life, I attended to my relationships with renewed commitment. I listened more fully and was more readily available to friends and family than I'd ever been before. I was given the opportunity to test this commitment when my best friend and my father died within the same year and I was called upon to devote full-time hospice care to them both. I was there until their very last breaths -- my most profound experience with excellence yet. I finally met my writing goal and am no longer temping, though we are all temps in one form or another, since nothing really lasts forever. Still, my practice of excellence endures. Now, instead of a sign, I carry excellence within me as a mantra, as a presence. Excellence has the most impact when I first focus on my own peace and happiness, and then send it out into the world.

"Dakar, Senegal (CNN) -- Senegal remained tense Wednesday following days of violent protests over a court decision that allows the incumbent president to run for a third term. President Abdoulaye Wade, 85, has been in office since 2000. Wade plans to run for re-election this year despite a constitutional mandate that limits presidents to two terms. A court ruled in his favor last week after the incumbent argued he is exempt because he took office before the term limit was put into place. Throngs took to the streets in the West African nation this week to protest the Friday ruling, with protesters clashing with police in the capital Tuesday. In the capital of Dakar, an opposition group demonstration turned violent Tuesday night when a speaker called for protesters to march to the presidential palace. One protester died and dozens were injured, state media reported. Angry mobs burned tires and hurled stones at the police, who responded with tear gas and advanced in armored vehicles. Footage on local news stations showed a man run over by an armored car as he tried to run away from the police. A government official confirmed a protester died, but denied state forces were responsible, according to the state-run APS news agency. ''We (police) were professionals to the end. The police never fired live ammunition at the demonstrators. People say it is the police vehicle which struck the young man who died: it is completely wrong. This is not true,"" said Arona Sy, the Dakar police commissioner. Sy said authorities have checked all police cars dispatched to the protests. ""There is no trace of blood in the vehicle,"" Sy said. Senegal's opposition organized the rally to protest the ruling allowing Wade to run for a third term and call for the release of its leader and dozens of others arrested in the weekend rioting that followed the ruling. The group is also demanding that Senegal's highest court, the constitutional council, allow three independent candidates, including Grammy-winning musician Youssou N'Dour, to seek the presidency. The court rejected their candidacies last week in the same ruling that granted Wade and 13 others spots on the February ballot. It ruled that the three rejected candidates failed to gather 10,000 valid signatures. The June 23 Movement, or M23, is named after the date of protests last summer that forced Wade to withdraw a constitutional amendment that would almost guarantee his victory in the February 26 election. West Africa has a history of political strife, but Senegal has largely maintained peace and has never experienced a military coup. CNN's Umaro Djau and journalist Nick Loomis contributed to this report.","At least one is killed Tuesday as Dakar protest turns violent, state media says .

"(CNN) -- For observers of Latin America, this week's meeting in Caracas between Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos was remarkable for how unremarkable it was. Santos and Chavez, both in suits, sat closely at a table as they signed a number of bilateral initiatives on agriculture, trade and security. Before last year, the thought of Colombia and Venezuela cooperating on anything at all seemed remote. Relations were so strained between the two countries that the word ""war"" was on politicians' lips. Chavez and Santos' predecessor, Alvaro Uribe, volleyed insults back and forth like professional tennis players. The relationship has healed much since then, but analysts say that old wounds remain near the surface. Distrust had poisoned the relationship between the neighbors -- Uribe accused Venezuela of creating a haven for guerrillas; Chavez accused Colombia of creating a haven for the U.S. military. When Santos -- Uribe's hardline defense minister -- was elected president, he was expected to continue his policies, and he has, with one big exception. ""When Santos was elected, we thought this was it for Venezuela, but after the election, he took some real steps to patch things up,"" said Adam Isacson, a Colombia expert and senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America. In August of last year, Santos and Chavez agreed to put the hostilities aside. ""Starting at zero,"" Santos called it. ""I'm here to turn the page,"" Chavez said. ""One thing they agreed to do was cooperate more on the FARC presence in Venezuela and it's a real debate on what's actually been done,"" Isacson said, referring to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a guerrilla group. Santos has vouched for a Venezuelan claim that all FARC encampments located in Venezuela have been dismantled, but the true test of cooperation will come now that the FARC has a new leader. Rodrigo Londono Echeverri, also known as Timoleon Jimenez and Timochenko, is the new FARC head after its former chief was killed in a military operation last month. Colombia has specifically named Londono as a guerrilla that lives in Venezuela. He is believed to cross the border between the two countries freely, Isacson said. How strongly Venezuela goes after Londono could be an indicator of how deep these new ties are. Nonetheless, even talk of cooperation is a world away from the atmosphere two years ago. In November 2009, Chavez ordered his military to begin preparations for a war with Colombia, warning of a conspiracy between Colombia and the United States to attack Venezuela. Colombia called the announcement a ""war threat,"" and Venezuela retorted by calling Colombia's response ""hypocritical"" and ""immoral."" Eight months later, Venezuela broke off all diplomatic relations with Colombia. So when Santos and Chavez decided to be friends, ""most of the region let out a huge sigh of relief because of it,"" Isacson said. But from his perspective, the relationship is ""fragile, and it remains fragile,"" he said. The friendship between the two leaders also speaks to the pragmatism of each, said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue. Unlike Uribe, Santos has aspirations to be a regional leader, and cordial relations with Venezuela make it possible for Colombia to become less isolated from other South American countries, he said. Also, by cooperating with Chavez, there is probably the expectation of more progress against the FARC, Shifter said. And cooperation has shown some rewards in the shape of increased trade, reduced tensions and some high-level captures. During their meeting Monday, the leaders announced that Venezuela had captured Maximiliano Bonilla Orozco, one of Colombia's most-wanted drug traffickers. ""This shows that if we work together, if our police enforcement work together, we will get better results,"" Santos said. Chavez added, ""We will do everything we can to stop any attacks from Venezuelan soil into Colombia."" There is a sense of pragmatism on both sides, it appears, but mistrust has ruined that before. ""The relationship is based on mutual interest, but I don't think the trust goes very deep on either side,"" Shifter said. Other challenges exist as well. Chavez's health -- he underwent treatment for cancer this year -- has kept the two leaders from meeting often, Isacson said. Their meeting this week was the first in seven months. Also, Shifter points out, Chavez is unpredictable and Colombia makes an easy target. ""They are very, very close in many areas. That's made for a complicated relationship,"" he said. For now, at least, Chavez summed up his view like this on Monday: ""We can be an example of how governments with different views ... (can) put those differences aside and put forth a single direction, a single compass.""","For a period, Venezuela and Colombia were bitterly at odds .
In the past year that relationship has healed .
Obstacles to the strength of that relationship remain, analysts say ."
"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese and Japanese leaders held talks Monday to discuss peace and stability on the Korean peninsula following the recent death of North Korean ruler Kim Jong Il, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda met with Chinese President Hu Jintao on Monday, wrapping up his trip to Beijing to discuss cooperation between the two countries. ""The two sides believe that maintaining peace and stability of the Korean peninsula serves the common interests of all parties,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters Monday. ""The two sides are ready to make concerted efforts to realize peace and stability of the Korean peninsula."" During Noda's visit, discussions over the stability of the Korean peninsula overshadowed traditionally controversial issues between the countries -- including issues of disputed islands and energy disagreements in the East China Sea. Both sides also signed energy conservation and environmental protection agreements, along with an announcement that the two sides will use their own currencies in bilateral trade rather than U.S. dollars in an effort to encourage economic cooperation. Noda, in his first visit to Beijing since taking power in September, is the first foreign leader to visit with China's leaders since Kim's death. Both sides touched on the importance of resuming the six-party North Korean nuclear talks in an effort to promote the long-term stability of the region, according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency. Kim's death was announced by Pyongyang on December 19 and has put the region on edge, as the world waits to see how North Korea's succession will play out. In an effort to improve North and South relations, an 18-member civilian delegation of South Korean citizens arrived in Pyongyang on Monday to express condolences after the death of the Kim, North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency reported.","Peace between the Koreas ""serves the common interests of all parties,"" an official says .

"San Diego (CNN) -- I bet it sounded like a good idea at the time. Now, not so much. ""It"" was the ill-conceived decision by GOP presidential hopeful Rick Perry to hitch his wagon to the clownish Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, an opportunist who in recent years has taken to rounding up illegal immigrants and parading them outside his jail to catch the attention of television cameras. How did Perry get mixed up with that circus? Simple. The Texas governor got into a political scrape, and made the mistake of overcompensating. He was looking for quick validation from his party's nativist fringe because he had gotten hammered by GOP rivals for signing, in 2001, a reasonable bill in the Lone Star State that allows illegal immigrants who go to college to pay what other residents pay: in-state tuition. In fact, Perry didn't just sign that bill. He defended it and defiantly said he'd sign it again. Worse, in one debate, he told Republicans who disagreed with the measure that they didn't ""have a heart."" Good for him. Yet, after that, his poll numbers plummeted. In a futile attempt to get them up again, Perry underwent a radical makeover. He said that, if elected president, ""My policy will be to detain and to deport every illegal alien that we apprehend."" Ah, governor, you mean the ones you're not helping put through college? Perry even did penance by making a pilgrimage to the desert where he asked Sheriff Joe for his support. He got it. Just a few weeks ago, Arpaio announced he was endorsing Perry and he even went to New Hampshire to help him campaign. ""The federal government has failed on border crime and border enforcement, and no candidate for president has done more to secure the border than Governor Rick Perry,"" Arpaio said in a statement. ""I'm endorsing Rick Perry because we need a tough-on-crime president who will champion and fund full-time border security operations from Brownsville to San Diego."" Now, America's toughest sheriff is busy fending off allegations of discrimination and racial profiling. Such is the result of a three-year investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. At issue: their clumsy handling of something they never had the know-how or skills set to do: immigration enforcement. The DOJ's report packed a punch. It accused Arpaio's office of maintaining a ""pervasive culture of discriminatory bias against Latinos"" that ""reaches the highest levels of the agency."" It accused the sheriff's deputies of routinely engaging in ""unconstitutional policing"" that includes racially profiling Latino drivers, illegally detaining and arresting Latinos and carrying out military-style immigration patrols sparked by racially tinged citizen complaints. It said that inmates in the county jails who don't speak English are often punished and denied critical services. Finally, it also charged that the leaders of the agency have an odious practice of using their power to retaliate against critics. None of this will come as a shock to Maricopa County's growing Latino population, which has been complaining of abuse by Arpaio and his deputies for several years. Following the report's release, the Department of Homeland Security immediately terminated its 287(g) agreement with the Sheriff's Office and denied it access to the federal databases that it is practically forcing upon other agencies to locate illegal immigrants under the controversial Secure Communities program. As someone who lived in Phoenix in the late 1990s and wrote columns for the Arizona Republic newspaper, I've known Arpaio and written about him for nearly 15 years. I prefer the original version. Back then, the sheriff said that his office should not waste limited resources enforcing federal immigration law. By contrast, Joe Arpaio 2.0 seems to take shortcuts that run afoul of the Constitution. Just because a media hungry lawman is hunting for illegal immigrants doesn't mean he can single out Latinos -- including the U.S.-born, some of whose families have lived on this side of the border much longer than Arpaio's ancestors have lived on this side of the Atlantic. Next, Justice Department officials will try to strike an agreement with Arpaio to implement a plan that fixes what is broken, one that can be enforced by a judge. The officials are giving the Sheriff's Office 60 days to come up with a solution or face litigation. Those who defend Arpaio and brush aside concerns over racial profiling will likely say that it's appropriate for law enforcement officers to put extra scrutiny on Latinos since most illegal immigrants in the United States are Latino. The last statement is true enough. But just because most illegal immigrants are Latino doesn't mean that most Latinos are illegal immigrants. Besides, the opponents of illegal immigration always want to convince us that they're colorblind. That argument gets hard to make when the apologists for racial profiling start defending the idea of singling out people of one ethnicity. So what did Perry do when the Justice Department report came out? The worst possible thing. He doubled down on his bad judgment. He had already made two mistakes in snuggling up to Arpaio and accepting his endorsement. He went for three by defending Arpaio. ""I would suggest to you that these people are out after Sheriff Joe,"" Perry told reporters. ""He is tough. And again, when I'm the president of the United States, you're not going to see me going after states like Arizona or Alabama, suing sovereign states for making decisions."" Even if those decisions are bad? This is not a good sign for Perry. We need a president who has character and courage, and he showed both of those qualities early in this campaign. But we also need a president with judgment, and the ability to stop and change course when they take a wrong turn. For Rick Perry, that wrong turn occurred in the Arizona desert, near the intersection of ambition and fear. And now a once-promising candidate has lost his bearings. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette Jr.: Rick Perry has hitched his wagon to Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio .

"London (CNN) -- Bamboozled by eurozone debt crisis jargon? CNN is here to help you tell your bond yields from your banking interventions, your defaults from your haircuts. And if you need anything more explained, please submit your questions to Soundoff at the bottom of the story. Eurozone . The euro is the common currency used by a bloc of nations within the European Union. The 17 states that use the euro -- including Germany, France, Italy and Spain -- form the eurozone. A further 10 EU nations -- including the UK, Sweden and Denmark -- continue to use their own currencies. Recession . A recession is technically defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking output -- or a country going backwards financially. The eurozone is currently teetering on the edge of recession, triggered in part by the crisis which has rolled on since May 2010. A double dip recession is when a country which has been in recession enters a downturn again after a brief and weak recovery. Contagion . The ""contagion effect"" referred to in the eurozone crisis is the fear that one country's financial problems will spill over to another country. This happens because the capital markets -- where sovereign bonds are bought and sold -- can be influenced by sentiment as well as the fundamentals of each country. Contagion can also occur because the more countries within the bloc struggle, the higher the cost to others of giving aid. Default . Countries, or companies, default when they can no longer pay their bills on time. Defaults can come in different forms: ""Orderly"" -- when investors holding the bonds can agree to take haircuts (see below) -- or ""disorderly,"" where losses are unexpected and sudden. Bond yield . Countries raise money by issuing sovereign bonds which are then purchased by investors. The '""yield"" of the bonds - which can be thought of as IOUs -- is how much the investor wants to be paid to hold that bond. So, a higher yield indicates a higher risk bond. For sovereign bonds a yield of more than 7% is considered unsustainable for any extended period of time, because a country's earnings are unlikely to be able to cover repayments. Liquidity . Liquidity is the oil which greases the world of finance. It refers to the ease at which funds -- cash, for example -- can flow through the system. A market with lots of buyers and sellers is liquid, while one without is illiquid. Haircut . A haircut refers to a cut in the value of investments lenders are asked to take. For example, a 50% haircut on an investment means you'll get back only half of what you paid. Investors in Greek bonds have been asked to take a haircut on their debt. It would be in their interest to do so if they thought the value of the debt could drop further in the future. Investors can also be asked to swap bonds maturing soon for longer dated ones which would pay out at a much later date. Junk . The ratings agencies -- Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings being the big three -- award scores based on a company or country's credit worthiness. ""Junk"" refers to when that rating drops below investment grade. Once a credit rating drops below the BBB level, it is ""sub-investment"" grade and is commonly referred to as junk. Eurobond . Eurobonds are being suggested as a way to tie the finances of the eurozone's 17 countries more closely. A eurobond would be a bond -- or debt which investors buy in return for yield -- backed by all the countries of the bloc. The idea remains under discussion, although it has rejected by the eurozone's two most powerful leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Fiscal union . Fiscal unity is centered on integrated taxation and spending. The eurozone is a monetary but not fiscal union, meaning its 17 members maintain their own taxation policies and also raise money to fund themselves. However, the bloc does have a central bank -- the European Central Bank (see below) -- which maintains monetary policy. The bloc appears to be moving toward closer fiscal integration as it seeks to stem the crisis. European Central Bank . The European Central Bank, based in Frankfurt, Germany, was set up in 1998 to maintain monetary policy for the eurozone under its common currency, the euro. The ECB's mandate is to keep inflation at around 2% or below, and ensure some level of stability for the countries that use the euro. Like other central banks, the ECB's main tool for keeping to these targets is by raising or lowering interest rates -- a key tool for influencing financial markets. The ECB has also been actively buying the sovereign bonds of troubled eurozone economies, in the hope that it will lower those countries' funding costs. European Financial Stability Facility . The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) is Europe's temporary bailout fund. It was hurriedly set up after Greece needed its first bailout in May 2010, and has since become a key tool to combat the debt crisis. European leaders have increased its lending capacity from around â‚¬250 billion to â‚¬440 billion, and are investigating ways to boost its clout. A permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, or ESM, should be available as early as next year. International Monetary Fund . The International Monetary Fund, which is based in Washington D.C., is an organization of 187 countries. It is designed to assist countries in financial trouble. Member countries contribute to the fund, relative to their economies, when assistance is needed. It has been a key player in the European bailouts.","The crisis in the eurozone has dominated the region's finances and disrupted global markets .
The crisis has introduced financial jargon into everyday conversation .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps it's the inherently soul-crushing nature of the holiday season, but it seems many of our readers have been beset by quandaries of late. So, being the utterly benevolent souls that we are, we're choosing to devote this week's column to more reader questions. This week we tackle Facebook friend collectors and the eternal query: To tweet or not to tweet? Merry, Happy Whatever, everyone. Most times when I get a friend request or if someone accepts mine, I initiate a ""thanks for the friend (request/accept)"" in a private message, plus a quick update -- one or two lines max. Most of the time I receive something similar in return. With some friends this leads to more conversation, sometimes not, but either way at least we communicated. Every once in a while, I''ll initiate a message and the new ""friend"" doesn't bother to respond. I guess I'm not sure what to make of it. I see their activity on FB so I know they have signed in but they never responded back. If we're supposed to be ""friends"" a quick ""hello"" and maybe an update would seem good manners. I have had different friends suggest different meanings: . 1. If they have not responded after several weeks and you see them active, just ""unfriend"" them because they were just ""collecting"" you anyway. 2 Don't private message them, post on their wall. Many people don't like the PM stuff -- too creepy. (I've posted on their wall as well with about the same rate of return communication). 3. Who cares? You don't want to talk to those people anyway (I guess that returns me to option 1 but that approach seems rather harsh). What do you think is the correct approach? - Fed-Up With Fake Friends . Assuming that you are not, in fact, clicking obsessively through your new friend's Timeline, fastidiously poring over years 2005-2011 and shooting off private messages that amorously detail the imagined flick of her tongue as she enjoyed a melting cone of pistachio sherbet on June 3, 2006, it sounds like you've been suffering some serious abuse at the hands of ""The Friend Collector."" (That's a term both similar and many ways vastly different from the 1999 flick starring Denzel Washington, which your new friend added to her favorite films in early 2007). The friend collector is a wily, often drunk beast that lurks within all of us, threatening to rise up and assume our form during a particularly vigorous bout of Facebooking/memory lane-walking/power-houring. The phenomenon was admittedly less common back in the days when we actually had to type a remembered acquaintance's name into the search bar, squinting through the dust of childhood and a veil of tequila to remember his/her surname. But a while back Facebook added that pesky ""People You May Know"" feature, impelling us to add childhood friends, half-remembered college classmates and random guys in indie bands (or what I like to call ""future ex-boyfriends"") with wild abandon. Many times, we add such people not because we particularly want to talk to them, but merely because we're afflicted with the oh-so itch-able question, ""I wonder what so-and-so is doing now,"" and we just have to scratch. And you know what happens when you scratch too hard: You draw blood. And in this case, that blood is yours, in that you're getting hurt when your fake pal shuns your friendly -- non-creepy, non-murderous, right? -- advances. So let's all take a vow, as we wander myopically into the New Year: Thou shalt not friend collect. Even if our good friend Martin Martini makes a strong case for it at 3 a.m. Oh, and to answer your question: Go ahead and unfriend the phony. She'll probably just attempt to friend you again, wholly unaware that she has already done so. Like a true criminal, a Friend Collector always returns to the scene of the crime. I am a writer and I love sarcasm. My work is posted on patch.com (Upper Dublin, Pennsylvania) but I would like to get it noticed -- I don't think anyone reads it. How could I get my work noticed? A writer friend told me to Twitter whenever I'm published. Who the heck is going to go on my Twitter account? I'm a 58-year-old mom in the suburbs -- please. Plus I don't have a Twitter account. - To Tweet or Not to Tweet? OK, so just because you're a 58-year-old mom in the suburbs, that means no one cares what the hell you have to say? I would use a word synonymous with (and less idiotic than) ""baloney"" here if this weren't CNN, but, yeah, there you have it. Ever heard of Sam Halpern? Well, he's a 70-something-year-old man who has nearly 3 million people in his thrall daily via the Twitter account @sh*tmydadsays. Granted, the Twitter account is not run by Sam himself but by his son Justin, but regardless, Sam's pearls of weirdness and wisdom have spawned a book and a TV series. But here's where you differ from Sam: You're the writer here. You're the one creating content that you think others should see (unless you have some kind of weird obsession with corgis in Cosby sweaters, in which case your kids are about to cash it in big time) and you need to be the one to get it out there. So listen to your writer friend: Start a Twitter account, but do so in a tactical way. Don't just sign up and start tweeting links to your articles into the ether. Search for other writers whom you admire -- and work with on Patch.com -- and follow them posthaste. Read what they have to say, engage in conversations and post links to articles and stories that both you and your followers can appreciate. Then, once you've built up a relationship with this online network of people -- who will see you as much more than a suburban mom (not that there's anything wrong with that) -- add your own work into the mix. Since people will already trust you and your judgment, they will be much more willing to retweet your stories and thereby score you a much wider audience than you would have had out there, rockin' the suburbs. And, who knows, if your work is good, maybe you, too, can score a book/TV deal. If not, well, then go ahead and use my corgis in Cosby sweaters idea. That one is solid gold.","Have a Facebook friend who doesn't respond to your posts? They're likely a ""friend collector""
Many friend collectors send requests out of curiosity and nosiness .
Should writers promote their work on Twitter? Yes, but they must do so in a tactical way ."
"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Park Police began enforcing a ban Monday on camping in two Washington parks, with Occupy protesters at one site defiantly huddling under a large blue tarp that they dubbed the ""tent of dreams."" No one had been arrested as of early Monday afternoon at McPherson Park or Freedom Plaza, Park Police spokesman Sgt. David Schlosser said at an impromptu news conference frequently interrupted by protesters. But some protesters had voluntarily agreed to remove sleeping bags, pillows and housekeeping supplies, he said. On Friday, the National Park Service set a noon Monday deadline for protesters who have occupied the parks for months to remove their camping gear. Park officials said protesters would be allowed to remain around the clock and keep up tents, so long as one side of each tent remains open at all times, officials said. Georgia resident Dane Charles Primerano filed a complaint and motion for a temporary restraining order in U.S. District Court in Washington on Monday claiming that ""the term 'camping' is defined over-broadly."" Acting as his own attorney, he argued that sleeping in the park ""is unavoidable for destitute participants in a long-term political assembly,"" adding that calling it camping ""implicitly and wrongly (suggests) that the behavior is somehow trivial, frivolous or optional."" ""This is not about 'camping,'"" Primerano wrote. ""It is about preserving political discourse, a good more sacred than any warrior's statue, and infinitely more fragile than the park's Bermuda grass."" The threat of arrest didn't deter many in the Occupy DC movement. On its official Twitter feed, the group claimed Monday evening that 50 to 75 protesters were on site -- including a ""bunch of new occupiers."" ""I'm going to do the best I can to stay here,"" said Emily Margaret, who has been staying at the McPherson Park camp. ""If they want to arrest me, they can."" John Zangas said many fellow protesters have removed prohibited gear from McPherson Park, but others have moved in and deliberately set up camp to challenge police. As Monday's noon deadline passed, protesters pulled the tarp over a statue of the park's namesake, Civil War Gen. James B. McPherson, to create what they called a ""tent of dreams."" ""Let us sleep so we can dream,"" they chanted. Protesters have been camping in McPherson Park since October to rally against what they consider to be corporate greed and financial abuses. Protesters ""glitter-bomb"" senator outside D.C. gala . Occupy DC said in a statement posted on its website Sunday that members ""will defend the public space we have used as our center for activism,"" calling possible arrests of protesters a ""politically motivated attempt to suppress the free speech of the disenfranchised 99%."" Pastor Brian Merritt of Washington's Palisades Community Church said area churches have discussed helping house some of the protesters overnight so that they could continue a 24-hour vigil if park police began enforcing the rules against overnight encampments. Whatever happens with the camps and police, Caty McClure said it would not alter her and fellow demonstrators' commitment to their cause or their activism. ""The park and the occupation of the park is a tactic. It's not the movement,"" she said, calling the camps ""a really important symbolic statement."" ""If we can't sleep here, that does not end the movement,"" McClure said. One man was arrested Sunday after he allegedly went from tent to tent, removing notices from the Park Service. A video posted online showed the man walking away from police as officers tried to grab him. One officer used a Taser on the man, who fell to the ground and was handcuffed. Schlosser said Monday that the incident was under review. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee's website indicated that more than 15,000 people had signed an online petition criticizing the incident and calling on the Park Service to ""stop buckling to political pressure and to respect free speech on federal land."" White House spokesman Jay Carney mentioned the general situation unfolding at the two parks, both blocks from the White House, in his daily press briefing Monday. ""Our position has been and continues to be that we need to balance First Amendment concerns of the right to demonstrate, the right to speak freely, with public safety concerns and public health concerns,"" he said. ""And we understand that local law enforcement as well as, in this case, the National Park Service and U.S. Park Police are weighing those considerations when they make these decisions. And that's appropriate."" Until now, Occupy protesters have been allowed to remain under a Park Service interpretation that considered the activity a ""24-hour vigil."" Two weeks ago, National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis said he saw no reason to move against the encampments. ""I think if there's any place in this country, Washington, D.C., is the place where we need to be the most tolerant of individuals that are exercising their First Amendment activities,"" he said. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa disagreed, saying Jarvis was ""completely out of line."" ""It is not his job to interpret the Constitution over law,"" Issa said. Issa, who last month wrote a letter to U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar citing damage to part of a $400,000 renovation of McPherson Square, continued his criticism at a House hearing last week and came away unsatisfied with the Park Service's answers. Occupy DC is part of a larger activist surge that began last year in New York and quickly spread. While the protesters have highlighted a number of causes, the overarching theme has remained largely the same: populist anger over what activists portray as an out-of-touch corporate, financial and political elite. Occupy protesters in the nation's capital aren't the only ones who have found themselves at odds with authorities in recent days. Violent clashes, for instance, erupted last weekend in Oakland, California. Protesters trying to take-over a vacant convention center threw rocks, bottles and other objects Saturday afternoon at police, who responded with bean-bag rounds, tear gas and smoke grenades. Afterward, the activists criticized police as being heavy-handed, with police and city officials said the protesters instigated the violence. The Oakland demonstrators later got into a downtown YMCA and, eventually, City Hall. Once there, police said that protesters painted graffiti on walls, took down and burned an American flag and committed other acts of vandalism. Oakland police Chief Howard Jordan later said about 400 demonstrators were arrested. He said three police officers and two protesters were confirmed injured, though the Occupy Oakland forces on Twitter claimed that many more members of their ranks got hurt. City Hall reopened Monday after an extensive clean-up effort. Also on Monday, protesters in Charlotte, North Carolina, were given an afternoon deadline to remove tents from the site of the old city hall, CNN affiliate WCNC reported. Afternoon video from the scene showed police taking down and carrying off several tents, and at least one protester was seen being carried away by authorities. ""We're doing the right thing, peacefully and quietly,"" protester Malachi Vinson told WCNC. ""We're expressing ourselves in a better way than anyone else would."" CNN's Ed Payne, Athena Jones, Joe Sutton, Courtney Battle, Paul Courson, Brian Todd and Dugald McConnell contributed to this report.","NEW: A DC protester goes to court saying the eviction of ""destitute participants"" is unfair .

"(CNN) -- An Army Green Beret charged with trying to take explosives on an American Airlines flight over the weekend told investigators he didn't realize he had C-4 in his carry-on bag, according to a criminal complaint. Trey Scott Atwater, 30, waived an initial court hearing Tuesday and remains in jail. He was arrested Saturday after Transportation Security Administration screeners found the explosive material in his bag. According to the complaint, Atwater told the FBI he is a demolitions expert with the Army's 7th Special Forces Group and had recently returned from his third deployment to Afghanistan. Investigators said Atwater explained it was his practice to carry at least two blocks of C-4 explosives on any operation. He added that when he packed his bags to leave Afghanistan, he brought along the bag in question but ""had no recollection of there being any C-4,"" the court document said. Investigators said Atwater told them he grabbed the bag to use as a carry-on when he traveled to Midland, Texas, for the holidays and put children's items in it. The Green Beret told authorities he didn't see explosives in the main compartment of the bag and was ""surprised that the C-4 was in the bag when it was located"" by TSA screeners at Midland International Airport, according to the complaint. Officials did not disclose the amount of explosives found. The court document says Atwater had another run-in with airport security while leaving Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Christmas Eve en route to Texas when a military smoke grenade was found in his bag. ""The smoke grenade was confiscated, and he was admonished before being allowed to continue on his trip,"" according to the criminal complaint. When asked about the earlier incident in Fayetteville, the complaint said, Atwater admitted it had happened but that he had ""forgotten to mention it"" during his initial interview with law enforcement after he was arrested in Texas. Law enforcement officials have said Atwater was not involved with anything nefarious. One official also noted he was not carrying a detonator or an initiator and therefore it would not have been possible for the material to blow up. If convicted, Atwater would face a maximum of 10 years in prison, according to Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office for the Western District of Texas. According to the Pentagon, Atwater carries the rank of sergeant first class and is based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. His service awards include the Bronze Star and the Army Commendation Medal. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","Man in Texas says he didn't know the C-4 was in his carry-on, a criminal complaint says .

"(CNN) -- Scotland and Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher is taking an extended break from soccer due to illness. The 27-year-old has been at the reigning English Premier League champions since 2000 and is suffering from ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel condition. Fletcher, who has won four Premier League titles and one European Champions League crown with United, has been battling the condition for a year. He has made just ten appearances for the club this season. His last game was against Basel when United dropped out of the Champions League group stage for the first time since 2005 and the club confirmed in a statement on their official website that several absences from playing in the past year have been due to his illness. Is Mancini the right man for Manchester City? The statement read: ""Whilst he was able to maintain remission of symptoms for a considerable period this has proved more difficult recently and Darren's continued desire to play and his loyalty to both his club and country has probably compromised the chances of optimizing his own health and fitness. ""He has therefore accepted medical advice to take an extended break from the demands of training and playing in order to afford the best chance possible of achieving full remission once again."" News of Fletcher's absence comes as a fresh blow to United who are struggling with several injuries. Mexican striker Javier Hernandez, Brazilian trio Fabio, Rafael and Anderson, England midfielder Tom Cleverly and strikers Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Owen are all on the casualty list, as is Serbian defender and United captain Nemanja Vidic, who is likely to be out for the rest of the season.

"(CNN) -- Attackers gunned down an elderly Christian couple late Sunday inside their Baghdad home, the latest in a string of religious-rooted violence that has spurred international outcry and a full-court press for justice from Iraqi authorities. Gunmen broke into the couple's residence in Baladiyat, a predominantly Shiite area in eastern Baghdad, during the night and shot them dead, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. Hours earlier, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta said in a press conference broadcast on state-run Iraqiya TV that 15 ""Arabs"" -- in Iraq, a euphemism indicating they came from outside the country -- were responsible for three deadly attacks in Baghdad in recent months, including a bloody church siege. The spokesman for the Iraqi military command in Baghdad showed pictures of each of the men, whom he called ""terrorists"" and said they had entered Iraq from unidentified countries between June and August. Ten of them had died while carrying out suicide attacks or had been killed by Iraqi security forces, Atta said. The other five remain at large, with Atta urging the public to help in tracking them down. ""According to our intelligence information, four of the five terrorists are still in Iraq and one of them has fled to Syria,"" he said. While Atta did not immediately link Sunday's killings to the remaining suspects from the group of 15, he did tie the group to a deadly attack on a Christian church as well as two other incidents. The first of the three attacks happened August 17, when suicide bombers killed at least 48 people at a military recruitment center in the Bab al-Moudham commercial area of central Baghdad. On September 5, at least eight people died in a suicide bombing at a military base in that same area. And the deadliest attack that Atta referred to occurred October 31, when militants stormed the Sayidat al-Nejat Cathedral, or Our Lady of Salvation Church, in Baghdad. Some 70 people died and 75 others, including 51 congregants and two priests, were wounded. About a month later, Iraqi authorities announced they had arrested 12 people who had a role in either plotting or executing the operation. They included Huthaifa al-Batawi, described by Iraqi officials as the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the ""mastermind, direct supervisor and planner"" of the attack. That siege was among the first of many attacks in recent weeks targeting Christians, which have left scores dead and many more wounded throughout the Middle Eastern nation. While there have been a few larger scale operations, most were more like what happened Sunday evening, with gunfire or bombs targeting a few Christians at a time. While the issue has become more public in recent months, the threat has been real for years. Christians are among the religious minorities in a country dominated by Sunnis and Shiites, and tens of thousands have fled Iraq in recent years. The violence had led the United States, the United Nations Security Council and an American Catholic archbishop to express concerns for Christians and other religious groups in Iraq. Pope Benedict XVI said after the siege that he was praying ""for the victims of this absurd violence, all the more ferocious in that it hit defenseless people gathered in the house of the Lord, which is home to reconciliation and love."" Cardinal Emmanuel Delly III -- the patriarch of Iraq's largest Christian community, the Chaldean Catholic Church -- urged Iraqi Christians in a televised address last month to ""stand firm"" within their country during these ""difficult times."" On Sunday, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said that he pressed the need to protect Christians in conversations with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, calling it an issue ""of paramount interest for my country and for me personally."" Frattini -- who also met this week with survivors of the church siege, as well as Cardinal Delly -- also said it was important that Christians felt secure in Iraq, and that they remained there. ""We shouldn't tolerate Christians leaving Iraq,"" the Italian minister said. ""If Christians leave, the terrorists and al Qaeda would have won."" Al-Maliki gave ""assurances"" that those behind the violence would be ""severely punished,"" according to the Italian cabinet minister, and that Christian leaders in Iraq would be kept up-to-date on key developments. Frattini also said the Iraqi prime minister told him that a Christian would head a new parliamentary committee looking into how best to safeguard security for members of this religious group. Iraqis are also mulling forming police units specifically charged with protecting Christians, according to the Italian foreign minister.","Attackers shot dead an elderly Christian couple Sunday in their home, an Iraqi official says .

"(EW.com) -- Tom Cruise rang in the New Year smiling, as ""Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" led the box office with an estimated $31.3 million over the three-day (Friday to Sunday) weekend. That represents a 6 percent jump from Christmas weekend. However, nearly every wide release saw their grosses rise compared to last weekend. The weekend after Christmas has historically been a strong box-office period, as many families are still on break but are no longer occupied with holiday preparations. ""Ghost Protocol,"" the fourth entry in the action franchise, has now cumulatively tallied $134.1 million, surpassing the final gross of ""Mission: Impossible III"" ($134 million). The PG-13 movie, which was helmed by Pixar animation director Brad Bird, will now attempt to catch up with the first ""Mission: Impossible,"" which collected $181 million in 1996. That figure should be within reach for ""Ghost Protocol."" In second place was ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,"" which rose 9 percent for $22.1 million. The sequel has taken in $132.1 million in 17 days. The original ""Sherlock Holmes,"" by comparison, had earned $165.2 million by this point. Although ""A Game of Shadows"" trails its predecessor, it is slowly closing the gap. This is because the first ""Sherlock Holmes"" opened on Christmas weekend, thereby inflating its initial figures. ""Shadows,"" on the other hand, debuted on the (typically slow) weekend before Christmas, and is just now benefiting from a post-Christmas bump. In other words, the first ""Sherlock Holmes"" started out of the gate much quicker, but ""Shadows"" is picking up steam. The sequel probably won't have enough momentum to reach its predecessor's final tally of $209 million, but the gap between the two films should be a lot smaller than many people initially thought. The same holds true for ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,"" which jumped an incredible 45 percent for $18.3 million. The rodent threequel has so far earned $94.6 million in 17 days. In the same time frame, the 2007 original had grossed $141.4 million and its 2009 sequel had amassed $165.4 million. Despite ""Chipwrecked's"" slow start, it has been holding up well and should finish its domestic run with a respectable number. In its first full weekend, Steven Spielberg's equine epic ""War Horse"" finished fourth with $16.9 million. Whereas most films dropped from Friday to Saturday this weekend (on account of Saturday being New Year's Eve), ""War Horse"" actually jumped 20 percent on Saturday. One possible explanation could be that the movie is drawing a decidedly older audience that wasn't about to let New Year's Eve get in the way of its moviegoing plans. According to CinemaScore, 79 percent of ""War Horse's"" audience was at least 25 years old. The Oscar hopeful has so far collected $43 million and is on its way to becoming a genuine holiday hit. Finally, in fifth, was David Fincher's ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" which rose 28 percent for $16.3 million. The $90 million adaptation of Stieg Larsson's bestselling novel has so far grossed a decent but somewhat disappointing $57.1 million in 12 days. In limited release, ""The Iron Lady,"" starring Meryl Streep as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, debuted to an outstanding $221,800 at four theaters -- that's a per-location average of $55,450. The acclaimed Iranian drama ""A Separation,"" which is practically assured an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, opened to a solid $66,600 in three theaters. And the Sundance drama ""Pariah"" started its run with a merely okay $49,700 at four locations. 1. Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol -- $31.3 mil . 2.

"(CNN) -- The Peace Corps is slashing operations in Honduras and scaling back in El Salvador and Guatemala, citing security concerns in a region beset by violence linked to the lucrative drug trade. The U.S. program currently has 158 volunteers serving in Honduras. They are all scheduled to come home early next year on administrative leave, and the Peace Corps ""will review the safety and security climate in Honduras before continuing with volunteer operations,"" the agency said in a statement issued this week. In a similar but less severe move, the Peace Corps canceled its January training classes for new volunteers in El Salvador and Guatemala. It said it will enhance support to the 113 volunteers in El Salvador and the 222 volunteers currently serving in Guatemala. ""The safety and security of all Peace Corps volunteers is the agency's highest priority,"" said Peace Corps Director Aaron S. Williams. He added that the program will conduct a ""full review"" of its operations in Honduras, where homicide rates more than doubled between 2005 and 2010, according to a recent U.N. report. Much like its neighbor to the north, Mexico, Central America is struggling to get a grip on violent crime. Drug cartels use the region as a strategic way station between South America, where most of the world's coca is grown, and North America, a major cocaine market. Coca is the raw ingredient for cocaine. The Peace Corps has operated since 1963 in Honduras and Guatemala, sending more than 5,500 and 4,800 Americans to serve in each country, respectively. It operated in El Salvador between 1962 and 1979, and returned in 1993.","All 158 volunteers currently serving in Honduras will be placed on administrative leave .

"(CNN) -- Wisconsin released the names of more than 1 million people who signed a recall petition against Gov. Scott Walker, state officials said, despite safety concerns among petition signers. ""In the interest of full transparency, the board has always planned to release copies of recall petitions to anyone who requested them and to post them online,"" said Kevin Kennedy, director and general counsel. ""However, we recently heard from a number of people who are concerned about their personal safety if their names and addresses are made public."" The state Government Accountability Board announced its plans Tuesday, citing Wisconsin's Public Records Law and a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the release of referendum petitions in Washington State. The documents are posted on the board's website as PDFs. ""Weighing all of these concerns and public interests, we have concluded that the balancing test of the Public Records Law favors disclosure of the entire recall petition without redaction of information on a recall petition ..."" the board's statement said, noting the public and officeholders have the right to view the petitions. ""Few processes in the electoral system or elsewhere are more public than the signing of recall petitions against state elected officials."" Before the decision, Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen, a Republican like Walker, said the signatures should be made public, stating the importance of transparency in the recall process. ""Our law I think is very clear that the maximum amount of information that is available should be made available,"" he said. ""It's general knowledge that if you do something in public, that's going to be public information."" This would be the first time in Wisconsin's history that a governor has faced recall. Crowd celebrates end of the recall effort in Madison . In fact, there have only been two successful gubernatorial recalls in United States history, that of California Gov. Gray Davis in 2003 and that of North Dakota Gov. Lynn Frazier in 1921. The more difficult battle will begin once the signatures are approved, and the state schedules a recall election. Both sides will be well financed and ready to battle, said Kenneth Goldstein, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group. Walker was undaunted by the recall effort, CNN affiliate WTMJ reported. ""The optimist in me looks at that and says: the overwhelming majority of the people in the state chose not to sign that and I earned the trust of the majority the last time. My hope is I will earn their trust again,"" he said. Walker set off a firestorm in January 2010 when he moved to curtail the collective bargaining rights of most state employees. With majorities in both houses of the Legislature, Walker and his GOP allies voted to limit raises for public employees except police and firefighters to the rate of inflation, bar unions from deducting dues from workers' paychecks and force them to hold a new certification vote every year. That bill was signed into law in March, following weeks of protests at the state capitol building in Madison. Republicans insisted it was necessary to control the skyrocketing costs of public employee benefits and close the budget shortfall. Democrats argued it was an attempt to gut public-sector labor unions, one of their core constituencies. The public brouhaha all but shut down the Wisconsin state legislature for weeks. It also drew protesters by the tens of thousands, among them union supporters and public employees, who called the measure an attack on workers. A group of Democratic lawmakers left the state for some time in an effort to not allow a quorum for a vote. Eventually, the law was passed and signed by Walker in March. The state Supreme Court upheld the law in June, but the battle sparked a storm of political activism that led to the recall effort.","Some who signed the petition are concerned about their safety .

"(CNN) -- Doctors studying to become dermatologists have, for years, shared exam questions by memorizing and writing them down after the test to become board certified, CNN has confirmed. Reports of the use of what are known as ""airplane notes"" comes after revelations last month that radiology residents around the country for years also have used what are known as ""recalls"" to prepare for the written exam, which is one step in becoming certified by the American Board of Radiology. In the wake of the CNN story, the group that oversees 24 medical specialties issued a statement condemning the use of the recalls. The American Board of Medical Specialties said on its website that, ""It should be made abundantly clear that recalling and sharing questions from exams violates exam security, professional ethics and patient trust in the medical profession. When it happens, the practice should be addressed swiftly and decisively. Whether someone is providing or using test questions, ABMS Member Boards enforce sanctions that may include permanent barring from certification, and/or prosecution for copyright violation."" CNN has confirmed the practice also exists with dermatology, where the recalls are known as ""airplane notes,"" because residents write down as much as they can remember on the plane after taking the test. In an anonymous e-mail to the American Board of Dermatology in 2008, a resident wrote: ""The board needs to know that there is an organized effort year after year to, by verbatim, reproduce each and every question of the official ABD certifying examination minutes after its completion. So-called ""airplane notes""...are well known to dermatology residents and are compiled, typed up and quietly distributed among residency programs across the country."" The resident, now a practicing dermatologist, wrote, ""Each year, minutes after the certifying exam is complete, there is an almost ceremonial meeting of examinees at a local hotel or restaurant there in Chicago. A feverish and collective effort is made by examinees from many programs to reproduce on paper as many questions as they can -- verbatim -- that they had just encountered. This is then integrated into an updated ""airplane notes,"" which then has questions from the year before, and the year before that, etc., in an organized fashion. These are even professionally bound at Kinko's at times."" In a response to the e-mail, the board's executive director, Dr. Antoinette Hood, wrote: ""The board takes every precaution to discourage this practice amongst graduating residents: maintaining strict security of items, minimizing the number of previously used questions, and requiring an honor code statement (signed two separate times) declaring that information will not be shared. Unfortunately we have no mechanism for enforcing the honor code or controlling interpersonal communications that occur after an examination. The real issue is how do we police professionalism and how do we identify the offenders?"" Hood said she has addressed this issue for several years during the board's annual meeting by telling dermatology residents the practice is not allowed. ""I've never seen airplane notes, but I've heard about it,"" Hood said. ""We really try to do something to prevent it from happening,"" Hood said. ""It's a high stakes examination and people are naturally very anxious about it and that brings out the potential worst in people."" Asked if she considered this cheating, Hood said, ""Yes, but I can't prove it - period."" The board has warned residents that using airplane notes is illegal, because test questions are copyrighted. ""There are legal consequences to this practice, as the questions of the American Board of Dermatology are protected by copyright laws, and any reproduction, not approved by the board, illegal. But, of much greater importance, this practice is unethical and violates our professionalism and ethical standards, which are the basis for the trust given us by our patients,"" one board newsletter obtained by CNN reads. Dermatology residents confirm the practice has been widespread, but the value of the actual airplane notes varies depending on the accuracy of the memorization. The dermatology board scrambles the approximately 300 questions from test to test to make it more difficult to memorize them. About 20% of the questions each year are recycled from old tests, compared with about 50% for the written exam in radiology. ""We scramble the questions so that discourages the rote memorization,"" Hood said. After a phone interview, Hood agreed to an an on-camera interview with CNN to discuss the recalls. But she abruptly canceled the interview two days beforehand, saying she had changed her mind. While the use of airplane notes and recalls has been discussed for years in dermatology and radiology, they are not widely known outside those professions. Dr. Gary Becker, executive director of the American Board of Radiology, said using recalls was cheating. ""I am saying it's cheating. It's a violation of our policy,"" Becker said. Dr. James Borgstede, the radiology board's president-elect, said said the test-taking culture has changed since he took the exam in 1978. ""Right now, in radiology, jobs are hard to find. Board certification is very, very important. When I took the exam, you could still practice without being a board-certified radiologist. Now, that's virtually impossible,"" Borgstede said. ""So, a high-stakes examination, and the other thing is it's a difference in culture. These individuals sort of view us as a system, and them as outside the system, and there's this issue of sort of stick it to the man. You know, that we're the system, and they can do this and it's acceptable. We tell them it's not acceptable."" Becker said that despite the use of the recalls, the public is protected because of the overall training and an intensive oral exam that residents must undergo to become certified. Next year, the board is rolling out a new exam for the first time in more than 10 years. Instead of two written tests and one oral exam, the first exam will be a ""core exam"" taken after three years of residency training, and the second certifying exam will be taken 15 months after graduation. The oral exam is being eliminated. Meanwhile, The American College of Radiology, which does not certify radiologists, posted a statement on its website after the CNN story aired. ""The most troubling aspect of this report is the implication that all radiologists who pass these examinations are 'cheaters.' The allegation of cheating not only involves an unspecified and unidentified number of individuals, but smears the entire specialty with a broad and unjustified brush,"" the statement said. ""Whether one considers the sharing of mentally recalled questions to be unethical, or simply a type of study aid, board certification represents significantly more than passing an exam, and should not be impugned simply on the basis of examination methodology,"" it said. Asked whether the group considered recalls cheating, a spokesman said it had no comment beyond the statement. Other medical specialties contacted by CNN said they had not experienced that kind of systemic use of recalls. The American Board of Family Medicine has sent investigators into test review company classes to ensure they aren't teaching from old test questions. ""When we've investigated these groups and (gone) through these classes, we've never found old exams,"" said board spokesman Robert Cattoi. The board only re-uses ""a very small number of questions"" from old exams, he said. The American Board of Orthopedic Surgery re-uses about 20% of old questions each year. ""We know of no similar recall registry of questions such as was in your piece (about) the radiology residents,"" said the board's executive director, Dr. Shepard Hurwitz.

"(CNN) -- A former leader of Mexico's Tijuana drug cartel pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court in San Diego on Wednesday to charges of racketeering and conspiracy to launder money, according to court documents. The plea agreement signed by prosecutors and Benjamin Arellano Felix calls for a maximum of 25 years in prison and the forfeiture of $100 million to the United States. ""Arellano Felix led the most violent criminal organization in this part of the world for two decades,"" U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said in a statement. ""Today's guilty plea marks the end of his reign of murder, mayhem and corruption, and his historic admission of guilt sends a clear message to the Mexican cartel leaders operating today: the United States will spare no effort to investigate, extradite, and prosecute you for your criminal activities."" A lawyer representing Arellano Felix described the deal as ""very favorable."" ""It gives Mr. Arellano Felix the hope of one day being released from custody and returning to his family in Mexico,"" attorney Anthony E. Colombo Jr. said after Wednesday's hearing. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for April 2, attorneys said. Arellano Felix, 58, had been named in two U.S. indictments alleging conspiracy, money laundering, drug trafficking, operating a drug smuggling organization and murder. If convicted on those charges, he faced between 40 and 140 years behind bars, Colombo said. Beyond racketeering and conspiracy to launder money, other charges against Arellano Felix will be dismissed at the sentencing hearing, Colombo said. Arellano Felix was one of seven brothers who ran the cartel until he and the majority of the leadership were arrested. Officials have said the cartel was weakened as a result but is still considered one of Mexico's major drug trafficking operations. Wednesday's plea agreement says he was the ""leader, organizer and ultimate decision-maker"" for the cartel, also known as the Arellano Felix Organization, from at least 1986 until his March 9, 2002, arrest. William Sherman, acting special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's San Diego office, said in a statement Wednesday that authorities had ""effectively dismantled this once powerful cartel from the top down."" The Tijuana cartel, during its peak in the 1990s and early 2000s, controlled the flow of cocaine, marijuana and other drugs into the United States through Tijuana and Mexicali. In addition to trafficking drugs, the cartel under Arellano Felix's leadership ran a network known for bribes, spies and killings, according to the Mexican attorney general's office. He was considered the brains and accountant for the organization, the agency said. Arellano Felix has been convicted of organized crime activities in Mexico and served nine years there before his extradition to the United States last year. He was arrested in 2002 in the state of Puebla. Extradition processes against him began in 2007.","NEW: Prosecutor: Guilty plea ""marks the end of his reign of murder, mayhem and corruption""

"(CNN) -- Holders Barcelona were paired with Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen in the draw for the last 16 of this season's European Champions League Friday. The Catalan giants, who defeated Manchester United in May's final to claim a third European crown, will be favorites to advance at the expense of 2002 runners-up Leverkusen. The two teams last faced each other in the second group phase of the 2002/03 competition, with four-time European champions Barcelona claiming victory in both matches. Elsewhere, seven-time winners AC Milan came out of the hat against English Premier League side Arsenal, who were beaten by Barca in the final in 2006. The pair faced each other at the same stage three years ago, with Arsenal advancing 2-0 on aggregate after registering an impressive second-leg triumph at the San Siro. Barcelona's arch-rivals Real Madrid will continue their quest for a 10th European crown against Russian outfit CSKA Moscow. Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho would become the first coach to have won the Champions League with three different teams, having led Inter Milan to glory in 2010 and Porto in 2004. Mourinho's former club Chelsea are looking to win the Champions League for the first time in their history, having lost the 2008 final on penalties to Manchester United, but face an awkward tie against 1989 UEFA Cup winners Napoli. APOEL Nicosia made history by becoming the first Cypriot team to advance beyond the group stages of the competition. Their reward is a clash with French side Lyon. The 2010 champions Inter Milan will also come up against French opposition in Didier Deschamps' Marseille.

"Ventura, California (CNN) -- A Southern California teen who pleaded guilty to killing a gay classmate was sentenced Monday to 21 years in prison. Brandon McInerney, 17, will serve time in a juvenile detention center until he turns 18, at which point he will be transferred to the custody of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. He will get no credit for time already served, and was ordered to pay $10,000 in restitution. In September, a judge declared a mistrial in the case of McInerney after a nine-week trial when jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked on whether he should be found guilty of manslaughter or murder in the death of Lawrence King. He was set to be retried as an adult. But last month, McInerney agreed to plead guilty to killing King ""under the penal code sections for both murder and voluntary manslaughter,"" as well as to using a firearm in that crime. He will serve 11 years for manslaughter and 10 years for the use of a firearm. McInerney was 14 years old when he brought a handgun belonging to relatives to E.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard, prosecutors said. He shot the 15-year-old King twice at point-blank range in the back of the head, while both were typing papers in a computer lab for their English class along with two dozen students and their teacher, authorities said. Friends said King, an eighth-grader who lived in a group home called Casa Pacifica, was proud of being openly gay. He liked wearing jewelry and makeup to school and he often wore high-heeled boots with the school uniform. He asked his teachers to call him Leticia instead of Larry. Some students bullied him, pupils said. Other students said McInerney was also subject to some harassment because King had a crush on him and made it publicly known. The victim's father, Greg King, read a statement in court Monday on behalf of Larry's mother. ""I will never forgive you for what you did,"" she wrote. ""You have left a big hole in my heart where Larry was.""","Brandon McInerney, 17, pleaded guilty to killing 15-year-old Lawrence King .

We were newlyweds and continued to gain weight. We had tried other diets but this one worked for us.  How did you finally lose the weight? Diet: Weigh Down Workshop, a spiritually based weight loss regimen. I just started without a real goal of losing a specific amount of weight and reduced my portion sizes. I spent so much of my life thinking about it and planning for it. Finally, I stopped focusing on food, stopped counting calories and eating low-fat foods. You just have to eat what your body craves and reduce portion sizes. Exercise: I didn't really exercise. I walked occasionally but I never followed a specific fitness regimen.  How long did it take you to lose weight? Just about 17 months from January 2003 to May 2004. My wife had tried the Weigh Down Workshop and had success with it. I was trying diet foods and fat-free foods. But I knew there had to be a way someone could eat normal food and still lose weight. How has this changed your life? When I was born I was close to 11 pounds and all of my life I've dealt with weight issues. People always teased me about being overweight. Once I started this program, I realized that I had to stop being angry at the world and I needed to look internally. Once I started this program, it changed my outlook on my entire life. I realized that being happy is a choice. I can either be filled with hate and despair or I can be happy and help others.","Andy Sorrells wore a size 64 when he weighed more than 500 pounds .

"Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Saturday held up Poland's transition to democracy in the 1980s as a model for nations today pushing back against their governments -- from countries in North Africa and the Middle East to some in Eastern Europe. In remarks with his Polish counterpart and member's of Poland's Solidarity movement, Obama said, ""Your actions charted a course for freedom that inspired many on this continent and beyond. And it has many relevant lessons, so we want to encourage all states undergoing similar experiences to learn from Poland."" Obama thanked Poland for its contributions to Tunisia, which saw the ouster of its leader this year, and for sending its foreign minister to the Libyan opposition stronghold of Benghazi as rebels fight the forces of strongman Moammar Gadhafi. The president also pointed to Poland as an example for neighboring Belarus, which has seen an authoritarian crackdown since December. Poland, which was one of the first countries to recognize Belarus, has seen its diplomatic relations strained over the crackdown. Poland has been a leader in pushing for sanctions against certain members of the Belarusian government, and the United States has discussed the same. On Saturday, Obama said that there is an ""unacceptable situation"" in Belarus. His remarks came in a speech in Warsaw with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Obama said that the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, has ""a total disregard for democratic values and rule of law."" Lukashenko, once called ""the last dictator in Europe"" by a U.S. official, was re-elected last year in a contest that triggered massive protests and led to hundreds of arrests. More recently, press freedom groups lashed out at a Belarusian court for the two-year suspended jail sentence of a reporter accused of ""organizing and preparing a public order disruption"" in connection with the protests surrounding the election. Pressure must be applied to Belarus to get it to change its practices, Obama said, adding that he was familiar with the case of journalist Irina Khalip. The situation in Belarus was among the issues that Obama discussed with Tusk Saturday. Tusk highlighted cooperation between the two countries on clean energy sources. The two countries agreed to convoke a special session of the Polish-U.S. Strategic Dialogue to promote efforts for new energy sources, including wind, clean coal, shale gas and nuclear power. Obama called Poland one of America's strongest allies, and reaffirmed the strength of their commitment through NATO. Prior to meeting with Tusk, during the last day of a six-day trip, Obama praised Polish leaders and acknowledged the sacrifices Poles have made in wars. Obama spoke after meeting with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski. Poland's ""incredible transformation"" to democracy over the past two-and-a-half decades has made it a leader in the region, Obama said. He singled out the successes of Poland's Solidarity movement, which in the 1980s led a broad opposition to the country's communist leadership. ""The solidarity leaders and others in this room launched a peaceful revolution that eventually led to a regime's collapse and the downfall of a broader system of Soviet repression,"" Obama said. He added that there was an ""understanding that history was being made because ordinary people were standing up and doing extraordinary things with great courage against great odds."" The president's visit to Poland included a stop at that country's World War II Warsaw Ghetto Memorial and a dinner with Central and Eastern European leaders hosted by Komorowski. Before leaving Poland, Obama stopped at the Field Cathedral of the Polish Army, where he visited a memorial to the victims of a plane crash that killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife and several military leaders in April 2010. Obama stood before a memorial wall with the names of the victims of the crash. He lit a candle and clasped his hands together and gazed silently at the names.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Disney star Demi Lovato left the treatment center she voluntarily entered three months ago and returned to her home in Los Angeles this week, a source close to her family said. Lovato, 18, dropped out of a world tour with the Jonas Brothers and sought help for ""emotional and physical issues"" in early November after an ""altercation"" with a dancer on her concert tour, a source close to Lovato's camp said at the time. With her prescribed treatment and an outpatient program completed, Lovato is getting back into her regular routine and spending time with family and close friends, the family source said. Her treatment for issues she was working on at the inpatient facility will continue with doctors in Los Angeles, the source said. Little information had been made public about the issues, but a statement by her publicist in November described them as ""emotional and physical issues she has dealt with for some time."" The publicist cautioned against describing the treatment as ""rehab."" ""Demi has decided to take personal responsibility for her actions and seek help,"" the November statement said. ""She is doing just that."" Last year, Lovato also suffered a public end to a short romance with Joe Jonas, one of the three brothers she had been traveling the world with. The 18-year-old singer-actress has talked extensively about being bullied while in middle school. ""People say sticks and stones may break your bones, but names can never hurt you, but that's not true,"" Lovato wrote on a anti-bullying website in October. ""Words can hurt. They hurt me. Things were said to me that I still haven't forgotten."" Along with her solo music career, Lovato co-starred in Disney's ""Camp Rock"" movies with the Jonases. She also has the lead role in Disney's TV series ""Sonny With a Chance."" CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Lovato checked into a treatment center in November .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesia on Sunday released an Australian teen convicted of marijuana possession on the resort island of Bali after the boy spent two months in detention, a local prosecutor said. The 14-year-old was sentenced in late November to two months for marijuana use in a case that has drawn international attention. The sentence included time already served, local prosecutors said. He will leave Indonesia and will be blacklisted from re-entering the nation for six months, prosecutor Gusti Gede Putu Atmaja said. After he has arrested in October, the teen was moved from a prison to an immigration center because the latter is more favorable for a teenager, the prosecutor said. Authorities arrested him while he was on holiday with his parents in Bali. After the arrest, the boy's attorney, Mohammad Rifan, said he had hoped to avoid a prison sentence and have him released to undergo drug rehabilitation. Indonesia's drug laws are among the strictest in the world. But they have a provision, article 128, under which those arrested with small amounts of drugs can be released to rehabilitation if they can prove they are an addict. In the case of underage offenders, that requires a declaration from the youth's parents, officials have said. Visitors to the country are warned on arrival that some drug crimes carry a maximum penalty of death. Still, many have been arrested and convicted for various drug offenses. Two Australians are on death row in a Bali prison while six others are serving life sentences.","The teen's sentence included time already served .

"(CNN) -- Despite below-freezing temperatures, divers searched two bodies of water in central Maine on Friday, looking for signs of a toddler last seen more than seven weeks ago. Authorities said there was no initial indication that Friday's search led to the discovery of anything related to Ayla Reynolds' disappearance. They added that more searches could be forthcoming. ""If we don't find anything that can be attributed to Ayla today, we'll be back again some other day -- maybe someplace else,"" said Lt. Kevin Adam of the Maine Warden Service. Ayla's father, Justin DiPietro, told police he put his then-20-month-old daughter to bed at 8 p.m. December 16 in the first-floor bedroom of their Waterville, Maine, home. He called police the next morning, just before 9 a.m., to report her missing. Police have said the three adults in the home that night told them ""someone snuck into the house, went into the bedroom where Ayla was sleeping, and no one heard or saw anything."" Yet authorities said days ago -- and Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Stephen McCausland reiterated Friday -- that there is no evidence of any break-in or kidnapping. ""We still think they know more than what they've told us,"" McCausland said Friday. ""We have grave doubts that an abduction ever took place there."" No arrests have been made related to Ayla's disappearance, and no one has been identified as a suspect. Nor has there been any public indication of where the girl may be, with McCausland saying authorities are branching out to cover as much area as possible in a hunt for clues. Friday's search of part of the Kennebec River, near the Carter Memorial Bridge, and Messalonskee Stream, near the North Street bridge, is part of that effort. Both bodies of water had been looked at before, though Adam noted that the divers returned because ""we didn't search them to the amount that we wanted to last time."" He explained that inclement weather prompted divers to twice cancel new searches. Conditions were better Friday, though the area the divers could safely cover was still restricted by daytime temperatures that were below freezing. ""It's not like diving down in the Keys,"" Adam said, noting that divers are underwater for only about 20 minutes at a time. ""It's 20 degrees out there, and the water is freezing. So it just takes time. Plus, it's dark."" Testing on blood found in the basement of Ayla's home determined that some of it belonged to the girl, McCausland said Sunday. A website created by Ayla's family disclosed the police findings in a posting that same day, saying investigators told them the blood found was ""more ... than a small cut would produce."" Earlier Sunday, McCausland said that while some of the blood found ""was visible to the naked eye, some wasn't."" DiPietro, Ayla's father, sleeps in the basement of the home, which is owned by his mother. He has said that he would never do anything to harm his daughter. ""I have to believe that Ayla is with somebody, and I just want that person to find the courage to do the right thing and find a way to return her safely,"" he said in a statement issued soon after the girl was reported missing. When asked Friday about communication between authorities and Ayla's family, McCausland said, ""There has been contact this week, and we hope that contact will continue."" The state spokesman noted authorities have received more than 700 tips, admitting that the pace has slowed down in recent days. The fears of a worst case scenario are increasing, as time passes, he acknowledged. ""It's been 48 days, and our concern grows every day,"" McCausland said. ""But we remain hopeful that we're going to find her.""","Ayla Reynolds was 20 months old when she was reported missing in December .

"(CNN) -- A United Nations report blaming a record loss of Afghan civilian lives last year on insurgents and the Taliban was dismissed as ""untrue"" by a Taliban spokesman Saturday. Meanwhile, a commander of the International Security Assistance Force was encouraged by the report's findings that coalition forces were not to blame for the increased casualties, but agreed that civilian deaths must drop. The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said 3,021 civilians were killed last year, up from 2,790 the prior year. In an e-mail sent to CNN, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid ""strongly"" disputed the U.N. mission's report as ""untrue."" ""It has been 10 years since UNAMA has started blaming our Mujahideen with such numbers and untrue figures while the invading forces are using tons of explosives every day in our country, conducting raids on civilian houses and they are killing our innocent people,"" Mujahid said in the e-mail. ""Unfortunately I should say that UNAMA, which is operating under the umbrella of the U.N. as a propaganda tool for the invading forces, is trying to blame Mujahideen for the majority of the killings happening in Afghanistan,"" Mujahid wrote. ""It is unfortunate that UNAMA is supporting oppressor Americans and other invading forces and is undermining its international reputation,"" Mujahid stated. A total of 11,864 civilians have been killed in the Afghanistan conflict since 2007, the U.N. mission said. ""Afghan children, women and men continue to be killed in this war in ever-increasing numbers,"" Jan Kubis, the U.N. special representative for the secretary-general, said in a statement. ""For much too long Afghan civilians have paid the highest price of war. Parties to the conflict must greatly increase their efforts to protect civilians to prevent yet another increase in civilian deaths and injuries in 2012."" General John R. Allen, ISAF commander, said the report showed a reduction in coalition-related civilian casualties. ""Every citizen of Afghanistan must know ISAF will continue to do all we can to reduce casualties that affect the Afghan civilian population. This data is promising but there is more work to be done,"" Allen said in a statement. ""The most striking -- and obvious -- component of the report is the increasing number of civilian casualties attributed to insurgents,"" said Allen. ""IEDs are now responsible for roughly one out of three civilian casualties according to UNAMA. The death toll from insurgent attacks is much too high and deserves Mullah Omar's direct attention and action."" The U.N. report said last year's deaths are 8% more than in 2010, and double the number in 2007. The vast majority of 2011 civilian casualties -- 77%, according to the U.N. report -- were caused by anti-government forces. The number of deaths attributable to the Afghan army and international forces declined year-over-year by 4%, to 410. The report concludes that the higher number of casualties was due to changing tactics on the part of insurgents, including greater use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), deadlier suicide attacks and more targeted assassinations. IEDs alone killed 967 Afghan men, women and children in 2011. Many of the 495 victims of targeted killings were provincial and district governors, peace council members and tribal elders. Among the most disturbing statistics: in the second half of 2011, the number of women and children killed grew by 29 and 51% respectively, compared to 2010. That is in part due to the growing use of the pressure-plate IEDs, which are indiscriminate -- such that a van carrying civilians is just as likely to set off the explosive as a Humvee. ""A piece of shrapnel had gone through his head. My son is dead, and his loss is killing me and my wife. He was the only son I had,"" said a man in Mazar-e Sharif, who was quoted in the report. ""My daughter is nine years old, and every day before I leave for work, she cries: 'Mama, don't go to work, I don't need to eat,' ""a police officer in Herat was quoted as saying. The U.N. report says several statements from Taliban leaders in 2011 pledging greater efforts to avoid civilian casualties ""neither resulted in improved protection of civilians nor minimized civilian casualties."" While NATO can take comfort from the fact that its forces -- and its allies in the Afghan National Army -- caused fewer civilian casualties last year, it is clear that overall security for civilians has not improved. This is despite the deployment of well over 100,000 international troops across Afghanistan in 2011. In addition to casualties, the number of Afghan civilians displaced by conflict soared last year. According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, conflict and insecurity displaced some 185,000 people in Afghanistan, a jump of 41% compared to 2010. The U.N. report suggests that there has been a significant geographic shift in casualties. As NATO and Afghan Army units focused on the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand, the number of civilian casualties fell sharply in the second half of 2011. But elsewhere -- in southeastern, eastern and northern Afghanistan -- incidents rose. The number of civilians killed in Kabul province, including in the capital itself, more than tripled largely because of several devastating suicide bombings. The figures show that the number of casualties caused by NATO and allied night operations dropped sharply, despite the much greater intensity and frequency of such operations. That suggests better intelligence and tactics among pro-government forces. But the number of civilian killed in NATO airstrikes -- a source of friction with the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai -- rose 9%. Increasingly, as the transition to Afghan leadership gets underway, local security duties are being assigned to a relatively new force: the Afghan Local Police. The U.N. says it has received ""mixed reports"" about this entity's overall performance. While most suggested that it had improved security, there were also accounts of human rights abuses and corruption. Altogether, the U.N. Assistance Mission concludes that ""the unremitting toll of civilian casualties coupled with pervasive intimidation affected many civilians directly, and many more indirectly, by fueling uncertainty, tension and fear."" The report's authors welcome ""ideas that could contribute toward peace negotiations,"" adding their value will be measured by reduced civilian casualties and improved security. CNN's Tim Lister, Michael Martinez and Masoud Popalzai contributed to this report.","NEW: Taliban spokesman calls U.N. report ""propaganda""

"(CNN) -- Twitter says it has more than 100 million active users -- a pretty impressive chunk of the online population who are, if nothing else, checking in to see what other people are sharing. With that many folks on the six-year-old microblogging site, Twitter is always good for a few surprises. Sure, you already know about such famous tweeters as Ashton Kutcher, Lady Gaga and Shaq. But did you expect funnyman Danny DeVito to create a photo series of his foot in interesting places? And, sure, Democratic political strategist David Axelrod uses the site to share talking points and links. But who would have expected him to post a candid picture of President Barack Obama with ""First Dog"" Bo, then turn it into a not-so-subtle jab at GOP front-runner Mitt Romney? And then, there are the Twitterers who surprise you by being there in the first place. Whether because of their age, image or interests, some people just don't seem like likely fans of Twitter's 140-character bursts of wit and wisdom (or ... you know ... other stuff). And yet there they are, tweeting to thousands, if not millions, of followers. Here are 10 well-known people whose Twitter accounts caused us to do a double-take. Let us know in the comments if you think we missed somebody good. Rupert Murdoch . First, he's 80 years old. Second, he was fresh off of a brutal few months, during which the flagship paper of his media empire folded in shame after a phone-tapping scandal. But that didn't stop the media-empire tycoon from leaping with both feet into the Twitter pool last month. There have been a few gaffes (chatting with a fake Google co-founder Larry Page, and not seeming to realize that an account set up in his own wife's name was not real) but Murdoch is active on the site and appears in for the long haul. Sample tweet: @rupertmurdoch Facebook a brilliant achievement, but $75-100bn? Would make Apple look really cheap. Mark Zuckerberg . If you're the creator of the world's biggest social networking site, it might be surprising that you'd pop up on another. But there he is. (It's worth noting that Zuck also has an account on upstart Google+ and, for a while, was its most-followed member). That said, Zuckerberg can't exactly be accused of lighting his Twitter feed afire. He hadn't tweeted since 2009 before January, when he posted a message opposing the now-shelved Stop Online Piracy Act. So, if you follow him, be patient. Sample tweet: @finkd Tell your congressmen you want them to be pro-internet. My Facebook post is here ... . Don Rickles . OK, maybe it's just because this one feels like such a time warp. He was born in 1926 and broke into the comedy business in the 1950s. But, by all appearances, that's really ""The Merchant of Venom"" on Twitter (witness the photo he posted with his dog Chauncey who, he explains, writes all of his tweets). He tweets at a clip of about once a day and, as you might expect, they're just about all zingers. And by the way, you may ask ... whom does Don Rickles follow on Twitter? Nobody, hockey puck! Sample tweet: @donrickles Just finished ""Hot In Cleveland"" - I keep telling Betty White I'm happily married 46 years, but she keeps saying we can work something out! Queen Rania . It's not every day you find real-live royalty on networking sites. But not all royals are Rania Al Abdullah, the queen of Jordan. She's answered questions of followers online and told interviewers that sites like Twitter can be used to achieve real social change. But we're particularly fond of her Twitter bio: ""A mum and a wife with a really cool day job.. ."" Her more-than 1.8 million followers seem to agree. Sample tweet: @QueenRania V. special day. My youngest turns 7 & His Majesty 50! One life full of potential, the other full of accomplishments. #HappyBirthday . Dalai Lama . How much direct input does His Holiness have in running this account? It's, of course, hard to say. But while the frenetic pace of the micro-blogging site might seem an unlikely home for the Buddhist leader's gentle musings, the format works surprisingly well. Few links, no ""text-speak"" ... and the thoughts certainly feel authentic. After a long day of Charlie Sheen rants, this is as good a place as any for your moments of Twitter zen. Sample tweet: @DalaiLama If the twentieth century was a century of violence, let us make the twenty-first a century of dialogue. Stan Lee . ""True believers"" of a certain age will find Stan the Man's tweets familiar. They're clearly from the same mind that penned all of those back page letters that appeared in Marvel comic books through the years. Some of us here at CNN.com had a chance to meet The Generalissimo a while back and it's not surprising that, at 89, he's still got plenty to say. Sample tweet: @therealstanlee Pres. Bush gave an actress an award and kissed her cheek. When I was to get my award I said, ""We don't haveta kiss, do we?"" We both broke up! Pope Benedict XVI . Why are we surprised to see him tweeting? Well, because he's the pope, he's kind of old school, and as the leader of more than a billion Catholics worldwide, he probably has better things to do than sharpening his message into 140-character chunks. Maybe that's why he's tweeted only five times -- mostly inspirational nuggets -- since joining Twitter last June. Sample tweet: @PopeBenedictXIV The universe is not the result of chance. We are invited to read something profound into it: the inexhaustible creativity of God . Cher . Except for her infrequent movie projects (""Burlesque,"" anyone?) we don't hear much from Cher these days. So it's a little startling to see the 65-year-old diva so prolific on Twitter, where she has 478,000 followers. It's not unusual to see Cher post more than a dozen tweets a day, engaging with fans about her music, politics and son Chaz. And, bless her, Cher's profile pic makes her look 35. Sample tweet: @cher When i tour i want to keep a Twitter Diary & get all the Crew, Dancers, Singers & Band to Tweet with me . Hugh Hefner . Hef may be 85, but he's no newbie to Twitter -- the Playboy founder fired off his first tweet back in 2008, ahead of the cultural curve. These days the robed Lothario is padding about the Playboy mansion while posting daily updates about his TV viewing and current girlfriends, Anna Sophia Berglund and former Playmate Shera Bechard. Sometimes he even retweets their stuff. Sample tweet: @hughhefner Both Shera & Anna have early modeling assignments tomorrow, so we'll be going to bed early tonight. Amy Winehouse . We're all fans of the gifted, yet troubled, Ms. Winehouse here, so no disrespect intended. But when someone's dead, it definitely qualifies as a surprise when you see them active on Twitter. Sure, Winehouse's official account was managed by others even before her death on July 23 (It was silent between July 7-September 12). But it's her name ... and seeing stuff pop up under it even still is just weird. Sample tweet: @amywinehouse Amy's final track ""Body And Soul"" w/ @itstonybennett is out today on iTunes http://bit.ly/TonyAmy, proceeds to the Amy Winehouse Foundation. CNN's Brandon Griggs contributed to this report.","Twitter is home to some surprising tweeters .

"(CNN) -- Canada's rising star Milos Raonic broke more new ground when he reached the first clay quarterfinal of his short top-level career in Portugal on Thursday. The 20-year-old, seeded fifth at the Estoril Open, set up a clash with French No. 4 Gilles Simon after beating local wild-card entry Joao Sousa 6-3 6-3. Raonic, the second-youngest player in the top-100, is the highest-ranked Canadian in the history of the ATP Tour at 27th. He has leapt up from a year-starting 156th following his first title at the San Jose hard-court event and then a losing final in Memphis earlier this year, also reaching the fourth round of the Australian Open. Is Nadal's clay domination good for tennis? Raonic lost in the last 16 in the European season's opening clay events at Monte Carlo and Barcelona this month, which both had bigger entry fields, as he attempts to adapt his big-serving game to the more subtle surface. ""He's the player with some of the best for this season,"" world No. 22 Simon told AFP of a player who has the third-fastest serve on record. ""He's playing well but he doesn't have that much experience on clay. ""I think it might be better to play him now instead of for the first time when he may be in the top 15."" Simon beat Argentina's Carlos Berlocq 6-2 6-1 in his second-round match. The winner of his clash with Raonic will take on either second seed Fernando Verdasco or South Africa's big-serving Kevin Anderson in the semifinals. Verdasco has dropped from ninth to 15th in the rankings after a run of early exits, but he rebounded to beat another Portuguese wild-card, Frederico Gil, 6-1 7-6 (7-5). Seventh seed Anderson defeated Victor Hanescu 6-4 6-2, avenging his defeat by the Romanian in the second round in Barcelona. Djokovic eases past Ungur in Belgrade . In Belgrade, second seed Viktor Troicki crashed out in second round of his home Serbia Open. The world No. 16, who helped Serbia win last year's Davis Cup final, lost 6-2 6-3 to 52nd-ranked Spaniard Marcel Granollers. Granollers will next face unseeded Italian Filippo Volandri, who beat Ukraine's Illya Marchenko 6-3 1-6 6-3. Third seed Guillermo Garcia-Lopez also crashed out against India's Somdev Devvarman. Devvarman, ranked 71st, had lost to the Spaniard in Houston on clay this month but triumphed 7-6 (8-6) 2-6 7-6 (10-8). He will next play seventh seed Janka Tipsarevic after the Serbian beat Russia-born German Mischa Zverev 6-2 6-0. In Munich, third seed Marin Cilic, No. 5 Florian Mayer and fellow German Philipp Kohlschreiber reached the quarterfinals of the BMW Open on Thursday. Croatia's Cilic will take on Russian seventh seed Nikolay Davydenko following his 6-3 7-6 (9-7) win over Argentina's Horacio Zeballos. Mayer beat Russia's Teimuraz Gabashvili 6-4 7-6 (7-1) to set up a clash with young Bulgarian Grigo Dimitrov, while eighth seed Kohlschreiber faces Czech Radek Stepanek after eliminating compatriot Denis Gremelmayr 6-3 6-3. In the semifinals of the Barcelona Women's Open, Italian fifth seed Sara Errani will play Lucie Hradecka of the Czech Republic. Errani won 6-3 6-2 against compatriot Alberta Brianti, who won the Fes Grand Prix in Morocco last weekend. Another Italian reached the last four after sixth seed Roberta Vinci beat France's Virginie Razzano 6-4 6-1 to set up a clash with Slovenia's Polona Hercog or Spain's Laura Pous-Tio. The top three seeds of the women's event in Estoril all lost in the quarterfinals on Thursday. Top-ranked Alisa Kleybanova of Russia lost 6-4 6-2 to Germany's Kristina Barrois, who came back from 4-1 down in the opening set. The 19-year-old will next face Sweden's 80th-ranked Johanna Larsson, who beat Russia's Alla Kudryavtseva 6-2 7-5. Austrian second seed Jarmila Gajdosova also tumbled out, losing 5-7 6-4 6-2 to Romania's Monica Niculescu. Niculescu will take on Spain's Anabel Medina Garrigues, who beat Czech third seed Klara Zakopalova 6-3 7-5.","Fifth seed Milos Raonic sets up quarterfinal against French No. 4 Gilles Simon .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spain's new government announced a series of spending cuts Friday intended to bring down the country's soaring deficit amid concerns over the European debt crisis. The conservative Popular Party, which was only sworn in last week, has said it will set out its full budget by March 2012 but urgent action is needed to reduce borrowing. Among the austerity measures ahead are a continued freeze on public sector salaries and hiring, as well as a freeze, for the first time, on the minimum wage, said Budget and Public Administration Minister Cristobal Montoro Romero after a Cabinet meeting Friday. The only public spending increase next year will be on pensions, which will rise by about 1%, he said. Pension payments were frozen under the Socialists, who led the previous government, amid much public outcry. Welfare payments for the unemployed will be maintained, Montoro said, while those earning the most will face higher taxes. Tough measures are needed for the next two years because the 2011 deficit is higher than expected, at 8% of Gross Domestic Product, Montoro said. GDP is the total market value of all the goods and services produced by a country in a given year. He said the government was asking for sacrifices from those who have more, rather than the ones who are already suffering. Prime Minister Rajoy, whose party won a landslide election victory over the Socialists last month, has said his top priority is pulling the nation out of its deep economic crisis. Investors have been closely watching yields on euro area government bonds this year for signs the debt crisis is spreading to larger economies such as Spain and Italy. The concern is that their governments may not be able to service their debts and fund their activities if borrowing costs hold above 7% for a sustained period. If that happened Spain and Italy might be the next eurozone nations to need a bailout. Yields on 10-year Spanish bonds hit a 6.7% high in November but have dropped back since. In a speech to Parliament after he was sworn in last week, Rajoy reiterated his campaign theme that fixing the broken economy, including boosting growth and job creation, would be his priority. About 5 million people in the country are jobless. Spain has an overall unemployment rate of 21.5%, but its youth unemployment rate is a staggering 45%. Rajoy said 16.5 billion euros (about $21.5 billion) would be cut from the budget next year to meet Spain's deficit reduction target, in measures yet to be spelled out in full. He said there would soon be labor market reforms to make Spain's workforce more flexible and competitive, and that there would be mergers and takeovers in Spain's troubled banking sector -- which holds a lot of bad debt from 750,000 unsold new homes that went up during the real estate boom but before the financial crisis and credit crunch set in. CNN's Al Goodman and journalist Belen Chiloeches contributed to this report.","New Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said Spain's economic recovery is his top priority .

"(CNN) -- Pilot error was mostly to blame for a plane crash that killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski and nearly 100 others last year, the nation's investigators said Friday. Unclear instructions from Russian air traffic controllers and bad weather at Smolensk airport also played a part, according to the report released Friday in Warsaw. Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife and many top Polish officials died in the April 2010 crash as they headed to a memorial service to mark the 70th anniversary of a World War II massacre. ""The flight crew of the airplane in question was not sufficiently prepared for the task at hand given the complexity of the situation the crew encountered during their last flight,"" the 328-page report said. ""The aircraft commander, co-pilot, and navigator had been trained hastily, haphazardly and in violation of the respective training regulations."" The report also highlights communication issues between the Polish crew and Russian air traffic controllers at Smolensk. The landing zone controller gave incorrect information to the crew members as they made their descent and ""issued the command to stop the descent and to level out too late,"" the report said. The Russian controllers ""kept informing the Tu-154M crew about the correct position during approach contrary to the actual position of the airplane"" during its descent, which led the crew to believe they were approaching correctly when they were not. The situation was compounded by ""the crew's insufficient knowledge of the airplane's systems and their limitations,"" the report says, and ""inadequate cross-monitoring among the crew members and failure to respond to the mistakes committed."" In addition, visibility for air traffic control and air crew was impeded in bad weather by poor lighting at the airfield and trees on the approach to the runway that were too tall, the report says. In January, a Russian-led investigation concluded that the Polish crew was at fault in the crash. The crew should have decided to divert to another airport in light of ""repeated and timely"" warnings about bad weather in Smolensk, Russia, the Interstate Aviation Committee said. The presence of a Polish air force commander in the cockpit may also have contributed to the crash, the aviation committee said, noting that he had alcohol in his blood at the time of the crash. The Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154 plane crashed on April 10, 2010, in Russia's Smolensk region west of Moscow, killing everyone aboard. They were headed to the village of Katyn to commemorate the 1940 massacre, in which some 22,000 Poles were executed by the Soviet secret police.","NEW: Russian air traffic controllers gave incorrect information to the Polish crew .

"(CNN) -- Soccer superstar David Beckham will not be leaving the U.S. to join Paris Saint-Germain, the French club announced on Tuesday. The 36-year-old had been widely expected to sign for the Qatari-owned side during European football's January transfer window, but PSG sporting director Leonardo said the former England captain would likely stay in Los Angeles. ""It's over. It's a shame,"" Leonardo said from the team's mid-season training camp in Doha, according to the website of French sports paper L'Equipe. ""But the welfare of his family in Los Angeles, the wish not to change everything in his life, weighed heavily."" Beckham is now expected to negotiate a new contract with Los Angeles Galaxy, the Major League Soccer team he joined in 2007 and led to the MLS Cup title in November last year. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder's previous five-year deal expired on December 31, and he was tipped to return to Europe in order to secure a place in the Great Britain team for the 2012 Olympics in his native London. However, it now appears that Beckham would prefer not to uproot his wife Victoria and their four children. The youngest, daughter Harper, is the only one to be born in the ""City of Angels"" after her arrival in July 2011. Confirmation that Beckham would not join the French league leaders was not a surprise as Leonardo and new coach Carlo Ancelotti had both denied reports that a deal had been done in the past few days. The PSG squad are in the Middle East preparing for Wednesday's friendly match against one of Ancelotti's former clubs, Italian champions AC Milan, in Dubai.","PSG sporting director Leonardo says David Beckham will not join French club .

"(CNN) -- Kim Jong Il's death comes only days before 2012, the 100-year anniversary of the birth of North Korea's founder and Kim's father, Kim Il Sung. North Korea's long-planned celebration of this anniversary will now be pre-empted by collective shows of mourning (but perhaps few real tears for Kim Jong Il), uncertainty despite clearly laid plans for succession and heightened strategic anxiety among North Korea's neighbors. Over the last two years, Kim had put into place a succession plan (similar to the one his father had put into place for him) by naming his third son, Kim Jong Un, to key posts in the Korean Workers' Party and National Defense Committee. Just as Kim Jong Il was named head of the funeral committee for his father in 1994, Kim Jong Un will lead the funeral committee for his father. There will be the compulsory large crowds of mourners in the streets of Pyongyang to honor Kim Jong Il. A collective leadership, including top party and military leaders and relatives of Kim Jong Un, will provide guidance. Kim Jong Il observed a three-year ""mourning period"" before he formally took the reins of leadership and began participating in public functions. No one knows if this delay, which coincided with North Korea's famine, was also a result of internecine leadership struggles. Will the new succession unfold according to plan? North Korea's political system is closer to a dynasty than a modern state, but it can no longer live in isolation from the modern world. Kim Jong Il was successor-in-waiting for two decades, his son only two years. Kim Jong Il came to power in his 50s; Kim Jong Un in his late 20s. North Korea's system is less centralized and possibly less capable of exerting political control in 2011, compared with 1994, since money has replaced ideological loyalty as the essential ingredient for getting ahead. Kim Jong Il allowed institutions -- with the exception of the military -- to atrophy before belatedly revamping the party apparatus in September 2010. The system is fragmented and stovepiped so that only the leader can exercise control. A vacuum at the top could lead to bureaucratic infighting, with no person able to step in and exert authority across institutions. The worst case would be anarchy or infighting among bureaucratic factions for political control. The main advantage that Kim Jong Un has is that the core leadership knows that if it doesn't hang together, it will hang separately. There is no viable alternative for survival among elites if the regime fails. World reacts to Kim Jong Il's death . North Korea's neighbors will watch developments warily, but they will also be watching each other as closely as they watch Pyongyang, if not more so. For some time, China has pulled out the stops to underwrite economic stability in North Korea, and it fears that South Korean intervention to restore order in North Korea might lead to a reunified peninsula allied to the United States. South Korea fears that the North's economic dependency on China will give China political leverage to deny South Korea the ability to lead the way to Korean unification. The United States worries that either instability or desperation may lead to proliferation of North Korean bombs or fissile material. Russia and Japan also have interests that lead them both to prefer stability on the Korean peninsula. An unstable North Korea is a hot potato: No one wants to own it, but strategic fears forestall effective cooperation among its neighbors. North Korean instability would require extensive resources just at the moment when the world is cash-strapped. For this reason, North Korea's neighbors will exercise caution, keep their fingers crossed and hope against hope that North Korea's new leadership can chart a more reformist (and less nuclear) path than did Kim Jong Il. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Scott Snyder.","Scott Snyder says Kim Jong Il's death introduces uncertainty, anxiety in region .

"London (CNN) -- A landmark ruling which could change the way top-level European football matches are broadcast and sold by television companies was made on Tuesday. The European Court of Justice said that soccer fans have the right to watch sport franchises, such as the English Premier League, on a range of European broadcasters rather than solely via the rights holder designated for each national territory. The court said in a statement: ""A system of licenses for the broadcasting of football matches which grants broadcasters territorial exclusivity on a member state basis and which prohibits television viewers from watching the broadcasts with a decoder card in other member states is contrary to EU law."" Since its launch in 1992, the Premier League has sold exclusive match rights to a small number of television networks per national territory, a business model which has seen it become one of the richest in the world -- generating an estimated $5.3 billion in income, according to British newspaper The Guardian. Can football chants ever go too far? But the ruling -- in response to a long-running case by BSkyB against a British pub landlady who broadcast a Greek match feed -- now means that consumers could buy decoder boxes from satellite broadcasters from other nations, at a cheaper price, to watch the games they are interested in. BSkyB, which paid a combined $2.73 billion with ESPN to be the main rights owner for the Premier League in the United Kingdom, saw its share price drop 3% on news of the statement. ""It will have implications for how rights are sold across Europe in future, which we are considering,"" a Sky spokesman told CNN. ""As a broadcaster, it will remain our aim to secure high-quality content for our customers based on the rights available to us."" The ruling's effect could be far reaching if the value of football rights were to be diminished. The large amount paid to the Premier League has seen record amounts of prize money given to top-flight English clubs such as Manchester United and Arsenal -- finance which has subsequently been used to build new stadia and attract some of the world's best players. ""This could drive a coach and horses through Sky's business model for broadcasting of Premier League matches,"" according to Stuart Adams of intellectual property law specialist Rouse, based in London. ""There is every prospect they will find fewer people willing to pay for licenses to broadcast Premier League matches if for a little effort they can get the same pictures via a cheaper overseas feed. When the deal is re-negotiated with the Premier League it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change. ""And if they are markedly reduced, of course, that will have a direct impact on clubs' revenues and therefore their ability to buy and pay the salaries of top talent. That in turn could lead to yet more polarization between the haves and the have-nots of the English game."" The English Premier League said it would release a statement shortly. Sanjay Nijran, a sports lawyer for Smithfield Partners based in London, told CNN it could affect future revenues for sport franchises across Europe. ""Any broadcasting rights holder that intends to license rights will be bound by this ruling, it appears they will not be able to limit exclusivity to national borders and consequently the value of these rights could be limited. They may have to look for other models,"" Nijran said. ""We're not sure but we would imagine the Premier League would possibly be considering a pan-European license to sell the same broadcasting rights to the continent."" But it could mean that football fans in Europe are able to pay less to watch the matches they want. ""Currently top-level football is sold to a host broadcaster in each European Member State, you have only one choice of provider through which to watch the match. Now, this ruling allows you to watch on the same terms as any other person across Europe,"" added Nijran, who is representing suppliers of satellite television decoders over the issue. ""What this gives the consumer is choice because through increased competition they are able to choose cheaper providers."" However, the ruling could have a detrimental affect on English lower-league football, Adams told CNN, as it would circumvent the ban on Saturday afternoon matches being broadcast live -- a regulation which is supposed to protect smaller clubs. ""This would have a huge potential impact on clubs' pricing policies as they are likely to have to reduce prices at the turnstile in order to continue to attract crowds,"" Adams said. ""While this is an issue for Premier League clubs, it is likely to be much more acute for lower-league clubs who are far more at risk of reduced attendances in these circumstances. Such clubs are also more reliant on revenue generated at the turnstiles. ""If the net result of this is more football on the telly for fans to watch, and less money for clubs to lavish on the salaries of their top players, I think most of us would be overjoyed. But if we also see smaller clubs go out of business as a direct consequence, I'm not so sure that football fans will be cheering quite so loudly.""","European court says sports fans have the right to choose how they watch matches .

"(CNN) -- A 20-day state of emergency was declared Saturday in the Kazakhstan's oil city of Zhanaozen after violent clashes between police and striking oil workers left 10 people dead. The clashes, which injured police officers and involved looting and burning, occurred Friday as the former Soviet state celebrated its 20th anniversary of independence, according to Russian and Kazakh state-run media. ""In order to restore the economy of the town of Zhanaozen, restore the facilities that were burned down and, most importantly, ensure the security of the citizens, I am issuing a decree on the introduction of the state of emergency in the town of Zhanaozen according to the constitution and the law on the state of emergency,"" President Nursultan Nazarbayev said in a statement. ""It will be in force for 20 days, beginning today. If we are able to resolve all issues before then, and if calm is ensured, it can be rescinded at any time,"" the president said Saturday. The Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported Friday that eyewitnesses saw police fire upon unarmed striking oil workers in the country's western oil city, an accusation denied by authorities. Eyewitnesses claim police fired on unarmed striking oil workers in the western town of Zhanaozen on Friday, a charge denied by the authorities. The opposition Social Democratic Party (OSDP) called for an emergency panel to investigate, and the commission should be made up of ""senior officials, striking oil workers, and representatives of the public and press,"" the Russian news agency reported. The violence erupted as police tried to clear protesters from the town's main square that was occupied by workers for more than six months, the Russian agency said. The president provided a different account saying ""a group of hooligans"" attacked ""peaceful citizens"" gathered on the central square to commemorate independence. ""In response to the demands of the police to stop their illegal actions, the group of hooligans attacked police officers seeking to seize their weapons. Yet, the police officers did not allow that to happen,"" Nazarbayev said. The mayor's office and a nearby village's administrative office, a hotel and an office building were burned during the violence, the president said. Also torched were cars, he said. Banks, ATM machines and shops were looted, he said. ""A total of 46 facilities were attacked. In that small town, almost all facilities were attacked, burned or destroyed,"" the president said.","Ten people were killed when police and striking oil workers clashed in Zhanaozen .

"(CNN) -- Iraq is on the edge of the precipice as a consequence of the standoff between Shia Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, with the former accusing the latter of engaging in terrorism and the latter accusing the former of dictatorial ambitions. This crisis involves all three major sectarian and ethnic groups in Iraq, with al-Hashimi taking refuge in the autonomous Kurdish region of Iraq as a guest of Iraq's Kurdish President Jalal Talabani. What happens over the next couple of weeks will determine whether Iraq will continue to exist as a unified state or begin to irretrievably unravel in sectarian strife. Two realities stand out in the midst of all the noise and fury currently surrounding the debate in and over Iraq. First, it is clear that the American venture in Iraq has ended in abject failure at the cost of 4,500 American lives and between 100,000 and 200,000 Iraqi lives. No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, nor was any link established between the Saddam Hussein regime and al Qaeda. Furthermore, as the events of the past few days demonstrate, the United States has been largely unsuccessful in establishing an inclusive, democratic order in Iraq, another objective touted by Washington to justify the invasion of Iraq in 2003. What the American invasion ended up doing was creating unprecedented sectarian strife and totally debilitating Iraqi capabilities, thus tilting the regional balance of power in the energy-rich Persian Gulf substantially in favor of Iran. Second, it is only Iran that can now prevent Iraq from sliding into the abyss of chaos and disintegration. This argument has a simple logic. Iran is the country with the greatest leverage with the Shia-dominated al-Maliki government. In fact, al-Maliki would not have been able to put together a coalition after haggling for nine months, and become prime minister for a second time after the last elections, had Iran not weighed in on his behalf. Iran is also the state with the greatest stake in keeping Iraq unified and ensuring its sovereignty, because Iraq's disintegration could adversely affect Iran's national integrity and its aspirations to become a regional leader in the Middle East. While the major Shia parties in Iraq -- the Dawa Party, the Sadrists, and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq -- are not Iranian creations per se, all of them are beholden to Iran in multiple ways. Their leaders lived in exile in Iran during Hussein's rule, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps trained their militias. Their links with the IRGC and the militias' dependence on Iranian training and weaponry continue to exist. Whenever the going gets tough for any Iraqi Shia faction, its leaders take refuge in Iran, as Muqtada al-Sadr did time and again over the past few years. Iraqi dependence on Iran is bound to grow now that the Americans -- who had tended to favor the Shia over the Sunni in Iraq -- have departed the shores. The al-Maliki government, its current bombast notwithstanding, will soon realize -- if it has not done so already -- that it is surrounded by a host of latently hostile Sunni Arab neighbors, from Saudi Arabia and Jordan to Egypt and potentially Syria. Iran is its only dependable ally and one which it cannot afford to alienate. Iran also forms the lifeline of the Iraqi economy, especially in the predominantly Shia south. Iranian pilgrims flock to the Shia holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, providing livelihood to thousands of Iraqi citizens. Cheap Iranian manufactured products flood the Iraqi market, and Iranian contractors are involved in infrastructure projects such as power, health and housing. Iran is now Iraq's second largest trading partner after Turkey, which has a near monopoly on trade with Iraqi Kurdistan. Additionally, Iranian financial support keeps many Iraqi Shia institutions, parties, and leaders afloat. In short, the Iraqi government's dependence on Iran in political and economic terms is of a very high order. This provides Tehran with enormous leverage that it can use, if it so desires, to compel the al-Maliki government to undertake a radical course correction and return to the model of a more inclusive political system rather than one based simply on Shia demographic strength. Shiites constitute approximately 60% of the Iraqi population, with Sunni Arabs and predominantly Sunni Kurds each accounting for about 20%. There is every reason to believe that such a course correction is in Iran's long-term interest for a number of reasons. First, if the Iraqi state disintegrates as a result of al-Maliki's policies, Iraqi Kurdistan, currently an autonomous entity, will be emboldened to declare itself a sovereign, independent state. This would run contrary to Iranian state interests, since Iran is also home to a restive Kurdish minority whose demands for autonomy border on independence. An independent Kurdish state next to Iranian Kurdistan would not only be a bad example (from the perspective of the Iranian state) for Iranian Kurds, it would also become a center for Kurdish irredentism, stoking demands for pan-Kurdish unity that would have deleterious consequences for both Iran and Turkey. Second, Iran has regional ambitions not only in the Persian Gulf, but also in the broader Middle East region. The Iranian regime is fully aware of the fact that one of the major hurdles in its path toward regional pre-eminence is its Shia character. Much of the rest of the Middle East is predominantly Sunni Muslim. This was a major, if not the primary, reason that Iran's post-revolution leaders emphasized the ""Islamic"" rather than the Shia nature of the Iranian revolution, thus enhancing its appeal among the Sunni majority in the Middle East. Iran's support to Muslim causes -- the Palestinian cause foremost among them -- regardless of the sectarian composition of the affected Muslim populations has added greatly to the popularity of the Islamic Republic, particularly among the Arab public. Al-Maliki's sectarian policy is bound to hurt not only Iraqi interests, but also the image of Iran in the Middle East, and adversely affect its ambitions to act as a major player in the region, especially since Iran is perceived as the principal supporter of the al-Maliki government. It is, therefore, in Iran's interest to rein in al-Maliki's sectarian proclivities and to maneuver to have him replaced as Iraq's leader if he is not amenable to Tehran's advice. Muqtada al-Sadr can be used by Iran to pull the rug from under al-Maliki's feet, since al-Maliki is now dependent upon the 40-member Sadrist group in Parliament to keep him in office. (The Iraqiya -- the coalition of Sunni and secular Shia groups to which al-Hashimi belongs -- withdrew its support from the governing coalition.) That the Sadrists, one of the three main Shia groups in the Iraqi Parliament, may be contemplating such a move themselves is indicated by their demand on Monday that Parliament be dissolved and new elections held. The Sadrist agenda may, in fact, coincide better with the Iranian one, given al-Sadr's visceral anti-Americanism, which stands in sharp contrast to al-Maliki's ambivalence toward the United States. But regardless of this fact, it is becoming increasingly evident that al-Maliki's current policy runs contrary to Iran's interests. It is also clear that only Iran is in a position to force him to reverse course and thus to save Iraq from disintegration and civil war. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mohammed Ayoob.","Iraq is facing a sectarian crisis with Shia, Sunni and Kurd factions .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- U.S. and South Korean troops began a 10-day military exercise around Seoul on Tuesday, maneuvers the U.S. commander called ""defense-oriented"" during a period of heightened tensions with the communist North. The annual ""Ulchi Freedom Guardian"" exercise involves about 530,000 troops from South Korea, the United States and seven other countries, as well as computer-aided simulations, the U.S. command in Seoul reported. The joint U.N. command has notified its North Korean counterparts of the exercise, American military officials announced. No peace treaty has formally ended the 1950-1953 Korean War, only an armistice that has left the peninsula split by the world's most heavily fortified border. The secretive, economically stunted North Korea tested nuclear weapons in 2006 and 2009, while sporadic artillery duels and sea clashes still rattle the region. Last week, South Korea fired at North Korea after it said northern gunners fired three shots close to its maritime border. No casualties were reported.","The annual exercise involves about 530,000 troops .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- If you're a big ""The Hunger Games"" fan like I am, you were probably crazy excited to watch the movie's first trailer, which recently debuted. For those of you who aren't as familiar with the popular trilogy of books turned major motion pictures, here's a quick synopsis. The story takes place during an unidentified time in the future in a post-apocalyptic nation called Panem. Panem consists of a wealthy Capitol and 12 surrounding Districts. Each year, as punishment for past revolts, the Capitol hosts a gladiator-like competition called the Hunger Games, where one boy and one girl are chosen from each District as tributes and must fight to the death until just one remains. Protagonist Katniss Everdeen lives in District 12, and in the first book, Katniss's younger sister is picked as tribute. Fearful that her sister would never make it out alive, Katniss volunteers to take her place. As I watched the trailer for the 14th time (as research for this post ... I swear), I started thinking about the work lessons that could be gleaned from the story. Sure, your workplace may not resemble a Roman gladiator arena, but given how competitive it is these days to land and keep a job, it can at times feel like you're just trying to keep your head above water. Here, some lessons on surviving a stressful work environment, courtesy of ""The Hunger Games"": . Know what you're good at and hone that skill . While training for the Hunger Games, Katniss is told to identify and strengthen a special skill. Katniss, who spent many-a-day hunting in the woods, is an ace with the bow and arrow, so she focuses on perfecting her archery prowess. This is not unlike the workplace, where having a key skill can set you apart from the competition. Let's say you work at an advertising agency but happen to be good at math; volunteer to help with the numbers side of the business. By mastering a job in which others on your team may not be as proficient, you position yourself as an indispensible employee. Learn to easily adapt to changes . In the Hunger Games arena, things can change in an instant — one second it's hot and humid, and the next second the temperature plummets and snowflakes begin to fall. These environmental changes are meant to throw off the competitors and make them more vulnerable to attacks. Given today's volatile economy, things can change pretty quickly in the workplace. If you are willing to adapt — taking on extra projects to overcompensate for a staff shortage, doing work that's not traditionally part of your job — you'll show your boss you can handle anything that's thrown your way. Seek out an untraditional mentor . In preparation for the Games, the tributes are assigned a mentor — someone from their District who fought, and won, a previous competition. Katniss's mentor is an aging, washed out, often-drunk man named Haymitch. At first Katniss worries that he'll do more harm than good, and he does have some untraditional training methods. But at the end of the day he turns out to be an intelligent, clever guide and an advocate for Katniss and her other District competitor, Peeta. Apply this knowledge to your own work situation. Oftentimes it's hard to talk to your manager, because you don't want to compromise your working relationship. Instead, seek out someone in your office whom you admire and can learn from but don't necessarily work with on a day-to-day basis. Invite him or her to coffee, and explain that you're looking to expand your internal network and learn from others who have different roles within the company. Chances are he or she would be happy to serve as your mentor and would likely find the relationship mutually beneficial. Having someone outside of your team that's on your side and willing to advocate for you may prove valuable, should you have issues with your boss — or your job — down the road. Stand up for what you believe in (Caution: Spoiler alert!) As mentioned earlier, Katniss volunteers to take her younger sister's place as the female District 12 tribute. Further along in the trilogy, Katniss spearheads a rebellion against the Capitol. While I'm not suggesting you stage an uprising against a nasty boss or slimy co-worker, don't be afraid to blow the whistle if you see something unethical occurring in the workplace. Speaking up is never easy, but you should feel comfortable confiding in a HR manager who can help develop a course of action. If handled the right way, you'll be helping yourself, your teammates and ultimately the company. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Spanish side Atletico Madrid have named former player Diego Simeone as their new coach in succession to Gregorio Manzano, who was dismissed after this week's Spanish Cup defeat by Albacete. Former Argentina international Simeone, who will be officially presented to the media on Tuesday, returns to the Vicente Calderon stadium after two previous stints there as a player. The Atletico board turned to the 41-year-old after losing patience with Manzano, whose last game in charge was Wednesday's 1-0 home loss to third division side Albacete. Is this Barcelona team the best of all time? That defeat saw Atletico crash out of the Spanish Cup 3-1 on aggregate, while they are also trailing in 10th place in the Primera Liga, 21 points behind leaders and city rivals Real Madrid. Director of football Jose Luis Caminero told the official Atletico website: ""The results have not been good and we decided that to change the direction of the team, we had to change the coach. ""Diego has signed a contract for the remainder of this season and for next season. He knows the demands of the fans because they understand, like us, that this club must always be near the top. ""Our goal must be to be among the top four clubs, Diego is aware of this requirement and we are confident that we will achieve it under him."" As a player, Simeone starred for Argentina in the 1994, 1998 and 2002 World Cups -- gaining notoriety in the 1998 tournament in France when David Beckham's kick at him resulted in the England midfielder's dismissal. He retired as a player in 2006 and has coached Italian club Catania, as well as Argentine sides Racing Club, Estudiantes, River Plate and San Lorenzo. Meanwhile, Holders Real Madrid and Barcelona are in line to meet in the quarterfinals of the Spanish Cup, if both sides win their last 16 matches next month. Jose Mourinho's side face a tricky two-legged encounter with Malaga, while Barcelona take on Osasuna, with another El Clasico clash lying in wait should they both progress. The Spanish giants met in last season's final, with a Cristiano Ronaldo header in extra-time securing victory for Real, the only Madrid victory in seven matches against their rivals in 2011.","Atletico Madrid name Argentine Diego Simeone as their new first team coach .

"(CNN) -- With recriminations and accusations flying in the wake of riots that left 79 football fans dead in the northeastern city of Port Said, the immediate future for Egyptian soccer looks particularly bleak. Three days of mourning have begun for the victims of the violence that erupted after local team Al-Masry had beaten Cairo-based Al-Ahly 3-1 on Wednesday, but it will take far longer than that to understand how such a tragedy could have occurred. The domestic league was suspended indefinitely after the deaths just hours before Prime Minister Kamal al-Ganzuri sacked the entire leadership of the Egyptian Football Association -- a move that is sure to warrant attention from FIFA. Soccer's world's governing body stipulates that governments should not tamper with a national soccer federation's affairs, and an international ban for the Egyptian team could follow. Deadly Egyptian riots go beyond football . FIFA president Sepp Blatter has expressed his sympathy to the victims' families and also asked for a detailed report on what happened. Given the current confusion about exactly what did take place, he may be waiting a while. According to Al-Ahly board member, Khaled Mortagy, the security forces present in the stadium at Port Said have a lot to answer for. ""There were huge, even massive security breaches at the game -- the police showed total ignorance,"" he told CNN. ""The fans moved like a tsunami, and quickly we were looking at a massacre. We believe that this is something that has been well organized. ""I'm sure there are some hidden hands behind this. But we can't really see or we cannot really confirm who is behind all that."" In the wake of the tragedy, a number of Al-Ahly's players have said they are going to retire from the game, but Mortagy hopes they change their mind. Anger flares in Egypt after 79 die in soccer riot . ""(The players) are in a very bad shape in terms of morale. They've seen people die in the dressing rooms, which normally doesn't happen in the sports world. I think they have been under a lot of stress. ""Al-Ahly has over 60 million fans and supporters. And I don't think that the players will leave these fans because again the fans need them, and they need the fans."" Blame has also been attached to the aging Port Said stadium, which hosted the fateful game between two of Egypt's biggest clubs. James Montague, author of ""When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone,"" a book about football and politics in the Middle East, says many arenas in the country are not fit for the purpose. He told CNN: ""I've been to many football grounds across Egypt. We're talking about stadiums built in the 1920s and 1930s, big crumbling concrete bowls that have few exits. ""They are death traps, and this is something that has been waiting to happen. ""There might be 70,000 allowed in a football stadium but 100,000 people come in, or 40,000 are supposed to be there and 70,000 people get in."" Eyewitnesses: Police stood idle in Egypt football massacre . There were flashpoints between fans when the teams played each other back in April, and Montague says it is inexplicable the authorities on hand at the stadium did not do more to protect fans. ""At the moment everybody is wondering how and why the police allowed this to happen,"" he added. ""In any country in the world, if you have a rivalry between two football teams, and you don't police it, there's likely to be a high degree of violence and probably deaths involved. ""In this case, for some reason, the police stood back and didn't police the match properly. ""Obviously the soccer ultras (hardcore fans) had a key role in the revolution, fighting the police and trying to bring down Hosni Mubarak (former Egyptian leader) -- many people are questioning if that is the real reason this wasn't policed properly. ""The league is a mess and I can't see it resuming anytime soon.""","Egyptian football's future looks bleak after nearly 80 people died in a soccer riot .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich moved level on points with Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, beating Wolfsburg 3-1 while the German Bundesliga leaders were held 1-1 at Bochum. The two teams are three points clear of third-placed Schalke, who were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw at Freiburg. Bayern were 3-0 up after an hour against ailing champions Wolfsburg as Dutch forward Arjen Robben scored in the second minute from Thomas Muller's left-wing cross and defender Daniel van Buyten headed his sixth goal this season from Ivica's Olic pass on 26. Robben hit the post after the break and then second-half substitute Franck Ribery was credited with the third goal in the 57th minute, though it seemed possible that Wolfsburg's Andrea Barzagli had the final touch. Wolfsburg striker Grafite had a penalty saved by Hans-Jorg Butt, his first miss since moving to the Bundesliga in 2007, after Ribery fouled Sascha Riether but the Brazilian added a late consolation from Edin Dzeko's deflected cross. The result gave Bayern 45 points from 21 matches after a seventh successive victory, while Wolfsburg are now 20 points off the pace and just six above the relegation zone. Leverkusen remained undefeated in the league this season but saw their four-match winning run come to a halt as Zlatko Dedic scored a second-half equalizer for 14th-placed Bochum. Eren Derdiyok put the visitors ahead on the stroke of halftime with a low shot on the turn after a pass from Stefan Kiessling, but Dedic leveled in the 68th minute when he poked the ball past oncoming goalkeeper Rene Adler and in off the post. Schalke failed to take advantage of Leverkusen's lapse despite extending their unbeaten run to seven matches, as Marcelo Bordon controversially had a goal disallowed soon after halftime when his header hit the underside of the crossbar and appeared to cross the line. Teammate Kevin Kuranyi also headed against the post in the first half, while Mohamadou Idrissou nodded against the bar for Freiburg, who ended a four-game losing run to move up to 15th. Fourth-placed Hamburg remained nine points behind the leaders after also dropping two points in a 3-3 draw at Cologne. Hamburg led 3-1 with 15 minutes left after an early goal from Marcell Jansen and two from Croatia striker Mladen Petric, but Milivoje Novakovic pulled one back with a fine free-kick on 75 minutes and Adil Chihi equalized two minutes from time with a shot that deflected in off defender David Rozehnal. Stuttgart continued their climb up the table with a 2-1 win at second-bottom Nuremburg that lifted them to eighth thanks to Roberto Hilbert's 87th-minute winner. Seventh-placed Hoffenheim also have 28 points following a 2-1 win at home to bottom club Hannover, ending a four-game losing streak as first-half goals from Carlos Eduardo and Sejad Salihovic were the club's first of 2010. Hannover pulled one back through Arouna Kone in the 67th minute but remain rooted to the foot of the table, five points below Nuremburg. In Italy, Juventus continued their miserable run with a 1-1 draw at lowly Livorno, the second in a row for new head coach Alberto Zaccheroni. Livorno, who moved up to 15th place and also held AC Milan 1-1 last weekend, took the lead in the 26th minute with a header from diminutive striker Antonio Filippini before Juve defender Nicola Legrottaglie nodded in off the post to level four minutes before halftime. Juve then had Brazil midfielder Felipe Melo sent off for a second booking with eight minutes left. The result left Zaccheroni's team in sixth place, 14 points behind leaders Inter, who host Cagliari on Sunday. Palermo moved up to fifth place, two points above Juve, with a 2-1 victory at home to Parma. Edison Cavani headed in Fabrizio Miccoli's free-kick to put Palermo ahead after 63 minutes, but Jonathan Biabiany leveled nine minutes later with a controversial goal which came while the hosts called for treatment for their scorer. Former Palermo coach Francesco Guidolin, who has had four stints at the Stadio Renzo Barbera, was denied a point on his first return with an opposing team as Brazilian Fabio Simplicio smashed an 87th-minute winner.","Bayern Munich beat Wolfsburg 3-1 to move level on points with German leaders Bayer Leverkusen .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Andy Murray has turned to former great Ivan Lendl as he bids to win an elusive first grand slam title. The World No.4 made the surprise announcement Saturday, appointing the Czech legend as his coach ahead of the 2012 season. The 51-year-old Lendl is an eight-time grand slam winner and long-time World No.1, but has never worked as a full-time coach on the circuit. But Murray, who has lost in three grand slams finals and got to the semifinals of all of all four majors this year, believes his experience will prove invaluable. ""Ivan's impact on the game is unquestionable and he brings experience and knowledge that few others have, particularly in major tournaments,"" Murray told his official website. Lendl, who spent 270 weeks at the top of the rankings, is relishing the challenge: ""I am really excited to have the opportunity to work with Andy. ""He is a unique talent and I look forward to trying to help him reach his goals."" He is to take up his role immediately as Murray starts his new season with a first-round match against Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin at the Brisbane International Tuesday. But his first big target will be the Australian Open where Murray made his last grand slam final appearance, losing in straight sets to World No.1 Novak Djokovic earlier this year. In March, Murray dispensed with Spanish Davis Cup captain Alex Corretja as his coach and has worked without one until the appointment of Lendl.","Andy Murray appoints Ivan Lendl as his coach .

"(CNN) -- The man that prosecutors say is behind the stabbing deaths of four homeless men in Southern California now stands accused of the brutal killing of a mother and brother of an old friend, authorities said. The latest allegations against Itzcoatl Ocampo, 23, were made public Friday, shortly after authorities dropped charges against the friend, Eder Herrera, in the killings. Ocampo will be arraigned Monday on charges he stabbed to death 53-year-old Raquel Estrada and her 34-year-old son, Juan Herrera, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told reporters. ""This case has expanded from murdering random, vulnerable strangers to murdering people he knew,"" he said. Authorities say Estrada was stabbed more than 30 times and Herrera more than 60 times on October 25, their bodies left in pools of blood inside their Yorba Linda home. Herrera, 24, was arrested a day later in large part because of eyewitness statements and surveillance video from a nearby store that showed someone resembling Herrera in the area at the time of the killings, Rackauckas said. But the brutality and similarity of the attacks caught the attention of a law enforcement task force created to investigate the homeless killings. It is the latest twist in the case that began on December 20 when the body of a homeless man who had been stabbed more than 40 times turned up in Orange County. Herrera and Ocampo, an Iraq war veteran, had been friends since their high school days, Rackauckas said. The two lived about a mile apart, he said. The district attorney did not comment on a possible motive in the murders of Estrada and her son. While charges against Herrera were dropped, he remained in custody at the Orange County jail late Friday on an immigration hold, authorities said. Ocampo has been in custody since his January 13 arrest on suspicion of killing 64-year-old John Berry outside a Carl's Jr. in Anaheim, authorities said. His arraignment in the homeless killings has been postponed until February 17. Ocampo is also accused of killing James McGillivray, 50, who was killed December 20; Lloyd ""Jimmy"" Middaugh, 42, who died December 27 and Paulus ""Dutch"" Smit, 57, killed on December 30. Ocampo served in the Marines from July 2006 until July 2010, and was deployed to Iraq for six months in 2008, according to Marine service records. He completed his service, with the rank of corporal, with the 1st Marine Logistics Group at Camp Pendleton, south of Orange County. CNN's Greg Morrison and Rosalina Nieves contributed to this report.","Itzcoatl Ocampo will be arraigned Monday on the new charges, the district attorney says .

"(CNN) -- With the holiday season upon us, what better time to take a luxury break and get away from it all -- and relax with a few rounds of golf. From volcanic islands to tropical paradises, wildlife sanctuaries and stunning mountain vistas, CNN has sought out courses that cater for the high end of the market. Here are five of the best resorts around -- let us know if we have missed off your favorite luxury golfing retreat: . Mission Hills Hainan Resort (Haikou, China) Situated in the volcanic region of Hainan Island, the resort houses a remarkable 10 golf courses, each incorporating the native lava rock formations. There are 518 guest rooms and suites, a three-story clubhouse, 12 restaurants, a fully-equipped sports and recreation center, an aquatic theme park, therapeutic volcanic mineral springs, a spa oasis and a shopping arcade. The Blackstone Course is earning a reputation as one of the world's finest, and hosted the 2011 World Cup of Golf in November. A premiere suite will set you back a cool $500 a night, while a round of golf is $200. St. Regis Princeville Resort (Kauai, Hawaii) Perched on the northern shore of the island, this resort reopened in 2009 after a $100 million refurbishment. There are 252 rooms, of which 51 are ocean-view suites, and the resort incorporates 9,000 acres, providing stunning views of Hanalei Bay and its towering cliffs -- the setting for the movie South Pacific. On the golf front, there are 27 holes on the Makai course, with 18 having been completely renovated in 2010. Rooms at St. Regis begin at a cool $375 per night, while the Makai course costs $220 per round. WaterColor Inn and Resort (Santa Rosa Beach, Florida) Located in the Gulf of Mexico and recently named ""Best Hotel in Florida"" by the readers of Travel + Leisure, the U.S. resort offers luxurious waterfront accommodation, restaurants, a full-service spa, and two of the sunshine state's most celebrated golf courses. One of these is Shark's Tooth, designed by golfing legend Greg Norman, which is a private course only open to guests at the resort. It costs a whopping $525 a night to stay in a beach-view room, with a round of golf at Shark's Tooth setting you back another $95. Pristine Bay Resort (Roatan, Honduras) Located on a tropical island 35 miles off the coast of Honduras, the new Pristine Bay Resort is situated on a 400-plus-acre site adjacent to the Caribbean Sea. The world's second-largest barrier reef provides a stunning backdrop to the Black Pearl Course, with the 120-room resort scheduled to open January 2012. Residents and guests will have access to the ocean-front Bay Village with boutiques, art galleries, restaurants, cafes and other entertainment options. The cheapest rooms start at $300 a night, with a round of golf coming in at $150. Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge (Alberta, Canada) Set in the heart of the Rockies, this beautiful course is rated by SCOREGolf Magazine as the number one golfing resort in Canada. Elk, deer and wildlife are able to roam free on the UNESCO World Heritage Site, which opened in 1925. Between May and October, the resort offers the ""Ultimate Buddy Trip"" for eight or more people. At $3,125 per person it isn't cheap, but for your money you get a three-day/two-night stay in Milligan Manor -- the largest luxury cabin at Jasper Park Lodge -- two rounds of golf, a fly fishing excursion, whiskey tasting and a private outdoor barbecue with your own chef.","Pristine Bay Resort is situated on a 400-plus acre site adjacent to the Caribbean Sea on Roatan .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams has revealed she is not in love with playing tennis, despite an impressive straight sets victory on her return to action at the Brisbane International tournament. Playing in her first match since losing the U.S. Open final to Samantha Stosur in September, Williams brushed aside South African Chanelle Scheepers 6-2 6-3 with consummate ease. The 30-year-old American, who is seeded fourth in Brisbane, fired down seven aces in a 68-minute victory -- but later told reporters that she will cut back her schedule even further in 2012. Clijsters returns with convincing victory . ""I just want to be able to do other things that I'm doing and expand on that. I think that helps keep my motivation up,"" said the 13-time grand slam winner. ""I don't love tennis today but I'm here. I can't live without it -- there's a difference between not loving something and not being able to live without it. ""It's not that I've fallen out of love with it. I've actually never liked sports and I never understood how I became an athlete,"" Williams continued. ""I don't like working out, I don't like anything physical. If it involves sitting down or shopping, I'm excellent at it."" In other matches, top seed and local favorite Stosur beat Anastasiya Yakimova of Belarus 6-2 6-3 and is on course to face Williams again in the semifinals. Second seed Andrea Petkovic of Germany defeated Israeli Shahar Peer 7-6 1-6 6-3, while former world number one Ana Ivanovic saw off Austrian Tamira Paszek 6-3 6-3 and now faces Kim Clijsters.","Serena Williams reveals she does not love tennis after Brisbane victory .

"(CNN) -- Why Indianapolis? Super Bowl visitors will enjoy the fabulous Super Bowl parties and the very best of this Midwestern city's arts, music and food festivals tailored specially for this sports-filled week. And when the Super Bowl party-goers leave and the confetti has been cleaned up, the locals will return to enjoying their city. Whether you're traveling to Indianapolis for the Super Bowl or taking a trip later, here's where the locals have fun -- and where they recommend you go, too. A music scene that covers all the bases . Indianapolis has some world-class music talent that music writer Ryan Williams is always eager to share with out-of-towners. Williams focuses his music blog on the Fountain Square neighborhood but loves music all over the city. Check NUVO.net and do317.com for band schedules and times. Williams' favorite venues include: . The Melody Inn is Indy's version of CBGBs with a line-up that heavily favors punk and louder sounds, except for more roots and country material on Friday evenings. Radio Radio is a smoke-free space that puts together an eclectic blend of indie rock, rockabilly and touring artists. The Vogue hosts dance nights most nights, but larger touring acts make their way through here as well (and those shows are usually smoke-free as well). Locals Only really does welcome everyone to their line-up of local rock, blues and hip-hop. Jazz fans can choose the small club feel of the Chatterbox  or the larger dinner/show feel of the Jazz Kitchen. The latter choice also features R&B, soul and hip-hop. Local, sustainable food with a kick . Although the Midwest has a reputation for meatloaf and casseroles, there's a burgeoning food scene in Indianapolis. When Brad and Nancy Royal opened City CafÃ© downtown in 2000, residents didn't focus much on local, independent restaurants. And their downtown neighborhood pretty much closed up after work. So they decided to offer breakfast and lunch with a sustainable bent at their 15-table restaurant and skip dinner so they could focus on family life at night. Over a decade later, their restaurant is part of a growing independent restaurant and arts scene downtown, where artists are making their mark and chefs are using local and sustainable food in their menus. Even in winter, Chef Brad Royal's special always features local ingredients. And don't worry if there's a wait. Nancy Royal, who runs the front of the house, promises the tables turn quickly. The restaurant will serve dinner during the Super Bowl week, so call for special hours. Indianapolis is home to some great Greek food. To get some of the best Greek food in the country, longtime residents often recommend Santorini Greek Kitchen in Fountain Square. To get off the beaten path, turn to IndyEthnicFood.com for its recommendations. (It also has a Super Bowl week guide.) For dessert, head to the Flying Cupcake Bakery on Mass Ave with at least 12 choices daily (and extended hours and specials for Super Bowl weekend). Try its ugly but delicious Red Velvet Elvis cupcake, with extra added chocolate chips turning the cupcake into a brownie-cake. There will also be cupcakes for each Super Bowl team and a special ""snack food"" cupcake made of pretzel crust, chocolate cake, peanut butter cream cheese filling and topped with icing and chocolate covered pretzel bits. To step back in time, head to the L.S. Ayres Tea Room at the Indiana State Museum, which recreates the historic Tea Room (open 1906-1990). A proper lunch is served Monday through Saturday and high tea is served on Sunday. Reservations are required on Sunday and are recommended the rest of the week. For the history buff, and the shopper . Art history and Civil War buffs alike will enjoy the Herron-Morton Place historic district, which is named for two institutions: Camp Morton, a Civil War prison camp, and the John Herron Art Institute. After soaking up some history, head to Minx to delve into store owner Jennifer Mentzer's collection of mostly vintage clothing, purses and other accessories -- including some designer pieces. ""My mission is to encourage people to care about what they wear and maybe try something different,"" says Mentzer, who opened her most recent shop in August. ""We do have a few modern things, but they are highly curated."" For children, or people who act like children . Often rated one of the best children's museums in the country, locals say the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, with a Dale Chihuly blown-glass permanent sculpture and working carousel, is not to be missed. For a louder experience, try a hidden gem downtown: the Rhythm! Discovery Center, a hands-on project of the Percussive Arts Society. Get ready for some volume -- the center has more than 150 instruments for children and adults to play as well as interactive learning exhibits. To buy some unusual gifts for your child (no Disney or Barbies here), head to Mass Avenue Toys, where children, their parents and people acting like children can play with a carefully selected collection of European and other toys. Then head to the nearby Flying Cupcake Bakery (see more information in the food section above). For the wanderer . Indianapolis has become friendly to people who like to walk and wander, as long as you're ready for temperatures ranging in the 40s during the day and the 30s at night. Bustling walkable areas include the Broadripple District's nightlife and shops, Mass Ave's galleries and theater and the music scene in Fountain Square. The Canal and White River State Park, which has lovely walking paths, also features the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art and the Indiana State Museum. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay's collection at the state museum houses some of Irsay's NFL collection, Jack Kerouac's original manuscript for ""On the Road"" and musical instruments from Grateful Dead founder Jerry Garcia and others. If you're from Indianapolis or live there now, what's your favorite restaurant, art gallery, independent store or place to hear music? Share your recommendations in the comments section below.","Indy's music scene ranges from punk to jazz to jams .

"(CNN) -- At his son's 11th birthday party, just before everyone was about to sing ""Happy Birthday"" and cut the cake, 46-year-old Dr. Carlos Zayas stepped on to the porch of his Atlanta home to take a call from another doctor about a particularly sick patient. While on the phone, Zayas reached up absent-mindedly and touched his neck. He felt a lump on the right side. Then he felt a lump on the other side. Feeling a bit panicky, he unbuttoned his pants and felt for lumps in his groin. They were there, easy to feel. In just seconds, his ""doctor's mind,"" as he calls it, added it all up. The fatigue he'd been feeling recently, the weakness, the lumps all meant one thing: cancer. When he went to the doctor, he found out it was peripheral T-cell lymphoma, one of the rarest and most aggressive blood cancers there is. Twenty-four rounds of chemotherapy with 18 different drugs couldn't stop its spread. A transplant with Zayas' own bone marrow did nothing. He needed a transplant with someone else's marrow or he would die. As chairman of the department of transplantation at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta, Zayas had helped countless patients find donors. Now it was his turn. Zayas' search failed, and there's one major reason for that: He's Hispanic. The search for the perfect donor . If you're looking for a kidney, finding the perfect match isn't absolutely crucial -- there's considerable wiggle room. But with blood cancers, there's little wiggle room. You need a perfect -- or nearly perfect -- bone marrow match, and you're much more likely to find that with someone of your own ethnicity. Hispanics have only a 33% chance of finding a perfect match on Be The Match, the national bone marrow donor registry, according to Dr. Willis Navarro, the medical director for transplant medical services for the registry. Partly that's because relatively few Hispanics sign up to donate: They represent 10% of people on the registry, yet 16% of the U.S. population. Language barriers explain the low rate to some extent, and so does the fact that Hispanics who are in the United States illegally are often reluctant to sign up, even though the registry doesn't share their information with the government. The other reason for the difficulty is that Hispanics often have a varied genetic background that can include European, African and Native American roots. ""I'm Spanish, French and Portuguese. That's why it's so hard to match me,"" Zayas says. ""And a lot of Hispanics are like me, with a weird combination of genes."" Through a long series of medical interventions, few of which his doctors thought would work, Zayas lived, and today he's devoted himself to helping other Hispanics looking for donors. Zayas' story: A 10% chance at life . After discovering the lumps that February night in 2009, Zayas ended his phone call and went inside his house. He tried not to look panicked as he sang ""Happy Birthday"" to his son, also named Carlos. After the party guests left and Carlos and his two sisters had gone to bed, Zayas closed their bedroom door and told his wife, Rita, what he'd found, and that he knew it was bad news. The next year was filled with the aggressive chemotherapy and the transplant with his own bone marrow, both of which failed. An international search for a marrow donor yielded no perfect matches and one nearly perfect match -- nine out of 10 antigens matched -- but that donor backed out. ""My doctors gave me a 10% chance of living,"" Zayas said. ""Then I thought about my brother, Hector, who was an eight out of 10 match. But a transplant with a match like that can kill you faster than the actual cancer."" Zayas was out of options. ""I made my plea to my doctors to use Hector's marrow,"" he remembers. ""I said, 'I know my chances. Please consider it.' "" His doctors agreed. In June 2010, they destroyed Zayas' immune system so it would accept his brother's cells and then they gave him Hector's marrow. Throughout that summer, Zayas and his family waited to see if Hector's cells would work in his body. ""Please don't leave me,"" Rita would say to him every night. ""I'm not planning on leaving you,"" he would reply. ""I'm going to fight and God is going to help me."" Zayas did develop graft-versus-host disease, the dreaded consequences of a poorly matched transplant. Hector's cells attacked his cells. Already too slim, he lost 30 pounds. Tumors grew in places where they hadn't been before. Then, just when it looked like he was at a low point, Zayas started to get better. Today, he's back full time at his job at Piedmont Hospital. A second chance . Zayas attributes his recovery to excellent medical care at Piedmont, the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, but he also credits his faith. ""I thank God all the time for this second chance,"" he says. Zayas first trained as a priest in his native Puerto Rico before he made the difficult decision to leave the seminary and go to medical school. ""I studied theology, but my call really was to serve others through the gift of medicine,"" he says. ""I was born to be a doctor."" Now he takes time to help other Hispanics find bone marrow donors, including Isaac del Valle, a teenager who lives not far from Zayas in Alpharetta, Georgia . Isaac's story . Like Zayas, Isaac, 16, has a mixed background -- his father is Mexican and his mother is of Irish descent -- and like Zayas, his road has been long. Found to have leukemia in March 2006, Isaac was treated and went into remission. In May, his family and friends gathered at a local Mexican restaurant to celebrate five years of survival. ""Five years is such a huge milestone, and we felt like the world had been lifted off our shoulders,"" says his mother, Linda del Valle. But then a few days later, they got a call from the teen's doctors. They'd found something suspicious in his last blood test, and Isaac needed to come back in for a spinal tap and a bone marrow biopsy. Those tests revealed the leukemia had returned. ""It was just devastating, and that's not even a strong enough word,"" del Valle says. Isaac immediately joined a clinical trial with an experimental chemotherapy drug, and the search for a bone marrow donor began in earnest. They found one perfect match through the registry, but that donor, for reasons the del Valles don't know, didn't work out. Now they have no choice but to proceed with a transplant from either his parents or his two sisters, who, like Zayas' brother, are far from perfect matches. When Zayas heard about Isaac through an e-mail that had been forwarded several times over, he went to a recent bone marrow drive for him. He couldn't donate to Isaac himself since he's had lymphoma, but he brought with him test results from his wife, three children, four brothers and three half-sisters in hopes that they might be matches for Isaac. ""It's extremely heartwarming -- it's just amazing,"" del Valle says. ""It just kind of leaves you in awe that people who don't even know your son would step forward and help."" At the drive, Zayas spoke with Isaac. ""I told him, I understand how you're feeling, how it is to wait and not have a donor,"" Zayas remembers. ""I told him there's light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm here to do all I can for you."" It turned out none of Zayas' relatives was a match for Isaac. Now both, doctor and patient, or actually patient and patient, wait to see if anyone can save Isaac. For information on joining the national bone marrow registry, visit bethematch.org.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spain's El Gordo, or ""the fat one,"" annual Christmas lottery paid a hefty $3 billion in prize money on Wednesday to thousands of people testing their luck in Spain's deep economic crisis. The top single prize was about $4 million, and many of the winning tickets in that series were sold in Barcelona and the nearby town of Cerdanyola in the northeastern region of Catalonia, where the big prizes have often landed over the years. Despite a widespread sense that money isn't flowing and bank loans are hard to get in Spain's financial crisis -- with nearly 20% unemployment and a deep deficit that has prompted government austerity measures -- Spaniards and others from abroad ""invested"" about $4.3 billion into the Christmas lottery this year. Seventy percent was paid out as prizes, or $3 billion, while the remainder went for lottery adminstration and the national treasury, according to the national lottery website. The winning number was 79.250. Most Spaniards buy just a one-tenth portion of a numbered series, and for Wednesday's top prize, it meant someone could have paid about $25 for a tenth portion and won $400,000 in return. That's why champagne, or the Spanish bubbly called cava, flowed at lottery offices, restaurants, and stores which had sold the winning numbers, often to Spanish families, or a group of co-workers. Spaniards on average spent about $80 for lottery tickets. Despite the economic downturn that was almost as much as last year. Spanish news reports said a bar owner in the town of Palleja, near Barcelona, had purchased a large number of what turned out to be winning tickets, and in turn sold them to his customers. Some $235 million in prize money was to be distributed among them. Other winners included a group of truck drivers from southern Spain who had purchased some of the winning tickets at a lottery office in central Barcelona, Spanish media reported. The lottery started in 1763, or 247 years ago. It has become such a deep tradition in Spain that even people who don't buy lottery tickets usually end up with some tiny fraction tickets given away by their local butcher shop or pharmacy. The three-hour lottery draw was nationally televised and followed closely on radio and the internet, with Spaniards continually checking their ticket numbers. Numerous smaller prizes, such as $60,000 for a series, were also awarded. The lottery draw was held at a convention center in central Madrid this year, moving from its previous location at a school for the first time in 47 years, because officials said, more space was needed due to increased interest.","Ticket buyers poured $4.3 billion into Spain's lottery known as El Gordo .

"(CNN) -- The Shining Path, the Maoist terrorist group that wreaked havoc in Peru in the 1980s, has admitted defeat and seeks to negotiate an end to its war with the government, one of the group's top leaders told a nongovernmental organization. Reporters working for Legal Defense Institute on Wednesday published a far-ranging interview with ""Comrade Artemio,"" who said his real name is Jose Flores, though the government has disputed that. At its peak, the Shining Path spread terror in the country through a bombing campaign that targeted buildings and infrastructure such as electricity towers. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the government fought a campaign that greatly reduced the capacity of the terrorist group, but it made a resurgence in recent years. But the government has responded forcefully to the resurgent Shining Path, and the leader said that the time for armed conflict is over. The Shining Path has been defeated, Artemio said. ""Yes, that's a fact. We are not going to deny it,"" he said. The insurgents have not given up their ideology, he said, but in practice, a war with the government is no longer an option. What the group wants is to negotiate with the government a deal that would result in members' laying down their arms in exchange for the release of prisoners. ""We don't have the smallest intention to brandish the weapons of war, of armed conflict. Sincerely ... we want a political solution; we want this to end, but through the methods of a negotiation,"" he told the reporters for the Legal Defense Institute, known as the IDL, the initials for its name in Spanish.. Artemio suggested a truce as a first step toward demobilization, and suggested a group like the Red Cross or the church to act as a mediator with the government. Since as early as 2003, the Shining Path has sent feelers out to several Peruvian administrations in an effort to begin negotiations, he said. In recent months, the group has invited the government of President Ollanta Humala to enter into talks. But the answer the terrorists have been met with -- unconditional surrender, laying down of arms, and coordinates for stockpiles -- is untenable, Artemio said. The government even offered him reward money for turning himself in, so that he could leave the country after he disbands the group, he said. ""By principle, I cannot accept that,"" he said. For the Shining Path, its leader remains Abimael Guzman, who has been imprisoned since 1992 and is serving a life sentence. Any truce that does not include his freedom would be a ""betrayal,"" Artemio said. No concrete steps have materialized with Humala's government, but the terrorist leader has not given up hope, he said. The group's intentions are for a lasting peace, Artemio told the IDL interviewers, but it wasn't clear that meant forever. ""By principle we are Marxist. We believe that the only way to change a capitalist system is with a socialist system. But that is not possible at the moment. And if it's not possible, what corresponds in this moment is to end"" the armed conflict, he said. The ""moment,"" one presumes, could change. Indeed, Artemio said he believes that class struggle will continue, though the war will not. For now, the group's ideological fight will be political, he said, noting that it meant accepting, to a degree, participation within the confines of a democratic system that Shining Path opposes. ""That is the political trend we have as a nation, (and) as Peruvians, we have to accept it,"" he told the IDL. Don't expect the Shining Path to field candidates for Congress, Artemio said, but there exists the possibility that other political organizations, representing its views, could participate in the system. According to him, the one thing that's definite for now is that ""there will not be any type of attacks. This I can guarantee. "" Peruvians with memories of the turbulent '80s will no doubt take that guarantee with skepticism.","""Artemio,"" a leader of the Peruvian terrorist group, says it's lost long war .

"(WIRED) -- Dropbox is trying out a neat new feature that will give it magical Photo Stream-like abilities. Everybody's favorite cloud-storage app has added photo and video import. In a new ""Experimental Forum Build"" of the app for Windows, Mac and Linux, photos and videos will be slurped up from any memory card or camera connected to the computer. These will then be sent spinning off to the DropBox servers, ready for access by all your other Dropbox-connected devices. There have already been some well reasoned complaints over in the Dropbox forums. For instance, some people might take so many photos that they don't want them all clogging up their limited cloud storage. This feature also adds complexity to the Dropbox application itself, when it's already pretty easy to have a third-party app store selected photos inside your Dropbox folder. On the other hand, anything that makes backing up photos easier can only be a good thing. And as most nerds are at home right now enjoying Mom's home cooking, mightn't it be a good idea to make sure Mom's precious photos are also stored somewhere a little safer than the hard drive of her rickety old PC? I think it's a great idea, although I won't be recommending the feature to my parents until it makes it into an official non-beta build.

"(CNN) -- A fourth infant has been discovered to have been infected with a rare, sometimes fatal form of bacteria that can come from baby formula, but there is no evidence the cases are related, federal health authorities said Friday. ""Based on test results to date, there is no need for a recall of infant formula and parents may continue to use powdered infant formula, following the manufacturer's directions on the printed label,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said in a joint update. The latest case of Cronobacter infection occurred in Florida, the update said. After cases occurred in Missouri and Illinois, authorities looked for other cases, and found an Oklahoma case and the one in Florida. The Florida and Missouri infants died this month of their infections. The Missouri case prompted retail giant Wal-Mart to pull all cans of the same size and lot number of baby formula from its shelves. But DNA fingerprinting of the bacteria from the Missouri and Illinois cases found the bacteria differed, suggesting they were not related, the agencies said. Bacteria from the other two cases were not available for testing, they said. In the Missouri case, Cronobacter bacteria were found in an opened bottle of nursery water and prepared infant formula, but it was not clear how they became contaminated, the update said. Tests on factory-sealed containers of powdered infant formula and nursery water with the same lot numbers turned up no Cronobacter bacteria, it said, adding, ""There is currently no evidence to conclude that the infant formula or nursery water was contaminated during manufacturing or shipping."" Formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition said the agencies' test results corroborated its own. ""We're pleased with the FDA and CDC testing, which should reassure consumers, health care professionals and retailers everywhere about the safety and quality of our products,"" Tim Brown, senior vice president and general manager for North America, said in a statement. ""These tests also reinforce the rigor of our quality processes throughout our operations."" Cronobacter infection typically occurs during the first days or weeks of life. In a typical year, the CDC said, it learns of four to six such cases. This year, with increased awareness of the infection, it has tallied 12 cases. The bacteria can cause severe infection or inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain. Symptoms can start with fever, poor feeding, crying or listlessness. ""Any young infant with these symptoms should be in the care of a physician,"" the update says. The bacteria can be found in the environment and can multiply in powdered infant formula once it is mixed with water, said the CDC, which recommends breastfeeding whenever possible. Cronobacter is fatal in nearly 40% of cases, according to the CDC. Infection survivors can be left with severe neurological problems. CNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","""There is no need for a recall of infant formula,"" federal health officials say .

"(CNN) -- A decision by Massachusetts prosecutors to subpoena the Twitter records of an Occupy Boston activist, as well as records linked to two Twitter hashtags, has free speech advocates up in arms, calling the move a violation of the First Amendment. Suffolk County prosecutors demanded that Twitter hand over information posted on the social media website by user ""Guido Fawkes,"" whose Twitter handle is @p0isAn0N, as well as information from the user behind @OccupyBoston and those who Tweeted #BostonPD or #d0xcak3, according to the document. The ACLU gave CNN a copy of the subpoena. ""There is a constitutional right to write things on the Internet,"" said Peter Krupp, an attorney with the ACLU of Massachusetts who is representing the person using the Twitter handle Guido Fawkes. ""There is a constitutional right to do that anonymously."" A Suffolk County Superior judge held a private hearing Thursday and impounded all documents pertaining to the case, according to Krupp, who said he could not divulge what happened during the session. Krupp said he had requested that the meeting be open to the public. ""Secret court proceedings, particularly proceedings involving First Amendment issues, are troubling as a matter of both law and democracy,"" said Carol Rose, executive director for the ACLU of Massachusetts, in a statement. Suffolk County District Attorney spokesman Jake Wark said that, since Thursday's court proceeding was not public, prosecutors could not comment on the hearing. ""We investigate and prosecute criminal acts,"" Wark said. ""We have no interest in investigating political speech or political opinions."" In the subpoena, which was issued on Dec. 14, prosecutors requested that Twitter release to them ""all available subscriber information,"" including IP address logs for the time period between Dec. 8 and Dec. 13 as part of an ""official criminal investigation."" Those dates coincide with clashes between protesters and police in Boston's Dewey Square. Dozens of protesters were arrested after refusing to leave the public space after being ordered to do so by Boston's mayor, Thomas Menino. Wark would not elaborate on the nature of the criminal investigation, but said Thursday that ""no charges have been brought against any individual."" Prosecutors had requested that Twitter keep the subpoena confidential, but it was posted online last week and has been viewed by more than 20,000 people, Krupp said. Subpoenaing Twitter records is becoming more common, according to lawyer Ethan Wall, of the Richman Greer law firm in Miami. Wall, who specializes in intellectual property litigation, said the practice could have ""a chilling effect on free speech."" ""We are in this information-accessible age where we can post anything and everything from anywhere on any device,"" Wall said. ""Because it's so easy I don't think that people put the thought into how this might affect them personally, professionally or legally."" Henry J. Cittone of Cittone & Lindenbaum LLP, an intellectual property law firm in New York, said the most troubling part of the case is that prosecutors are subpoenaing hashtags, meaning that anyone who Tweeted or re-Tweeted #BostonPD or #d0xcak3 could be exposed during the investigation. ""It looks like authorities are trying to build lists of protestors by using hashtag information, as opposed to going after actual criminals -- which would have been the proper focus of such an investigation,"" Cittone said. Krupp called the subpoena ""wildly over-broad,"" pointing out that requesting records of two Twitter handles -- @p0isAn0N and @OccupyBoston -- could affect thousands. ""That's not just subscriber information for those accounts, but presumably followers,"" he said. Twitter did not respond to requests for comment. A posting on its website says: ""We may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Twitter's rights or property.""","Massachusetts prosecutors seeking Twitter records of Occupy activist .

"(CNN) -- The United States is looking for new ways to regain its strength, to shake off the recession blues and fortify its position of international leadership. But Washington is missing the obvious, neglecting its closest neighbors. Big mistake. With America's European partners struggling, with China's economy powering ahead, and the Middle East simmering with uncertainty, Washington has decided to ""pivot"" from its decade-long post-9/11 wars and look to Asia and the Pacific. But the United States is overlooking the most logical, natural place to build strong friendships, partnerships and alliances: Latin America. In recent years, attention focused on two places. First, the perennial center of global turmoil, the greater Middle East shook under armed conflict and ideological clashes, with major wars in Iraq and Afghanistan happening simultaneously with an escalating confrontation between Iran and the West over Tehran's nuclear program. At the same time, nervous attention turned to China, whose dazzling growth propelled a once-minor economy into the world's second largest in a few short years, making it clear that the China-U.S. rivalry will become one of the dominant features of this century. But while Washington paid little attention, something rather spectacular happened to the south, in Latin America. A region that had become a caricature of itself -- the place that gave us words such as junta and banana republic -- attained a new level of political and economic maturity. Most countries found a workable economic formula, addressing poverty without repelling investors. In most nations, democracy grew strong roots. Not everybody ignored the Latin American miracle. China and Iran, the two countries the West most worries about, have been busy developing diplomatic relations and increasing economic ties. During years when the United States paid little mind to relations with Latin America, home to 600 million people with economies worth $5 trillion, Beijing and Tehran set their sights on the American hemisphere. Beijing engaged in an aggressive economic push, becoming a top customer for Latin American natural resources, loaning billions, developing infrastructure and building trade ties. And Iran found in Latin America a way to dodge Western economic sanctions and break its diplomatic isolation. In the last few years, Tehran has opened new embassies in Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua. In addition, it is opening Iranian cultural centers in 17 countries in the region. Political and economic ties are blossoming, while Washington pays little attention. And this is happening just as Latin America has developed in a direction that could make it easier to build ties with the United States. Most people in the continent live in democracies, having strongly rejected the right of the military to seize power and rule by force. Most Latin countries now have free market economies that seek, with some success, to raise the bottom for the millions who still live in poverty. Latin America and the United States have much in common. With the exception of Cuba, Venezuela, and two or three Venezuelan acolytes, the hemisphere, including the United States, is made up of countries that share easily compatible ideologies. With 50 million people of Latino heritage living in the United States, personal ties also help create a steady foundation for a more powerful hemispheric alliance. To be sure, not every country has seen stronger democratic and economic growth in recent years. Venezuela has seen its economy falter and its president, Hugo Chavez, has amassed a dramatic concentration of power. That model, in which the president grows so powerful that it undermines democratic institutions, has been imitated to different degrees in Bolivia, Nicaragua and Ecuador. But the model embraced with the greatest enthusiasm is unabashedly democratic, market-friendly, with a social conscience, as seen in Brazil. The results have been spectacular. China wows the world with double-digit economic growth, but Brazil has suddenly become the world's seventh largest economy, on its way to displace the U.K.  as the sixth. Brazil's Gross Domestic Product grew 7.5% last year. Argentina's soared 9.2%. Others expanded just as fast. Paraguay's GDP climbed a stunning 15% and Uruguay's more than 8%. Much of that came from trade with China. And if China's economy falls into recession, Latin America will hurt. But Latin economies are pulling tens of millions out of poverty and into the middle class. That means they are becoming consumers who could keep the economy moving even if trade falters. In a region where the United States has long been the unrivaled principal trading partner, trade with China is exploding, totaling $180 billion last year, up 160% since 2006. Suddenly, China has become Brazil's main commercial partner, topping the United States. Just when it most urgently needs to regain its footing, the United States is ceding ground through neglect, missing out on the chance to expand markets in a way that could benefit the United States and Latin America, and losing diplomatic and political ground when it can least afford it. Washington will inevitably continue to focus on the Middle East. And Asia will surely garner growing attention. But neglecting Latin America is simply foolish. The United States is overlooking a natural alliance. A respectful partnership, not one where one country dictates to others, could help the United States build a stronger diplomatic presence on the global arena, help it shake the blues and get ready for the tough challenges the young century has already thrown in its path. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: As U.S. starts to look to Asia, it overlooks the opportunities in Latin America .

"Jos, Nigeria (CNN) -- A government official condemned Monday the series of Christmas Day attacks on churches in Nigeria that killed 35 people, blaming an extremist group that has claimed responsibility for similar attacks in the last two years. ""The latest mindless and cowardly attacks by Boko Haram members specifically directed at churches were premeditated,"" said retired Gen. Andrew Azazi, the national security adviser to President Goodluck Jonathan, in a statement. ""Only last week, five improvised explosive devices were recovered in five churches at Mubi in Adamawa State."" The Boko Haram sect claimed responsibility for the attacks, government officials said. In the past, the group has targeted Christians and Muslims it considered insufficiently Islamic. In the bloodiest of Sunday's attacks on churches in five cities, 32 people were killed as services ended at St. Theresa's Catholic Church in Madalla in Niger State, Azazi said. Two people have been arrested, he added. Olusegun Okebiorun, controller-general of Nigeria's fire service, said that, in addition to the fatalities, 65 people were wounded in Madalla, which is located west of the capital city of Abuja. Attacks in the central Nigerian city of Jos in Plateau State northeast of the capital followed the same pattern, Azazi said. Two blasts targeted the Mountain of Fire Ministries church in Jos, said journalist Hassan John, who witnessed the carnage. No one was killed in the bombings, but a police officer who got into a gun battle with attackers died of his wounds, John said, citing officials. Police arrested four people and recovered four unexploded devices, Nigerian state television reported. The cities of Kano, Damaturu and Gadaka were also struck Sunday, John said. Officials said three people were killed in the blast in Damaturu, a northern town in Yobe state, John said. Also in Damaturu, a police station and a state security building were bombed, said an aid worker who, citing security concerns, asked not to be identified. In Yobe, security forces stopped a vehicle that was carrying a bomb, which detonated, killing ""the criminals"" and three security operatives, Azazi said. ""We renew our appeal to all Nigerians that this is not a fight between security forces and some dissident elements,"" he said. ""It is a conflict between some misguided extremists in our midst and the rest of our society, because the victims are not confined to any ethnic boundary. We must cooperate to fish them out. And because our cause is just and our collective resolve is stronger, together we shall prevail."" The blasts mark the second consecutive holiday season that bombs have hit Christian houses of worship in the west African nation. In 2010, five churches in Jos were attacked on Christmas Eve. The blasts killed dozens in Jos, which lies on a faith-based fault line between the Muslim-dominated north and the mainly Christian south. CNN.com: Al Qaeda-linked group claims responsibility for bombing . In a statement issued late Sunday, Jonathan called the bombings ""a dastardly act that must attract the rebuke of all peace-loving Nigerians."" In Washington, the White House said U.S. officials would help Nigeria pursue those behind ""what initially appear to be terrorist acts."" ""We condemn this senseless violence and tragic loss of life on Christmas Day,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement. ""We offer our sincere condolences to the Nigerian people and especially those who lost family and loved ones."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the acts ""in the strongest terms,"" his office said in a statement. He expressed his condolences to the Nigerian people and reiterated a call ""for an end to all acts of sectarian violence in the country."" Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation and has the world's sixth-largest Christian population -- about 80.5 million people as of 2010, according to a report published this month by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life in Washington. That makes the country just over 50% Christian, according to Pew. Boko Haram translates from the local Hausa as ""Western education is outlawed."" The group has morphed into an insurgency responsible for dozens of attacks in Nigeria in the last two years. Boko Haram's targets include police outposts and churches as well as places associated with ""Western influence.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The number of homicides in New York City rose about four percent in 2008 compared with the previous year, preliminary figures from the city's police department showed. There were 516 homicides in New York City in 2008, according to preliminary police figures. The NYPD's CompStat data showed 516 homicides in the city last year, up from 496 in 2007. That's still a dramatic change from 1990, when 2,262 homicides earned New York the title of ""murder capital"" of the nation. Though the figures are subject to change, the 2008 tally also represents a drop from the 596 homicides investigated in New York in 2006. The NYPD, which began compiling the report in 1963, cited its Operation Impact as a chief reason for the improvement in recent years. The operation places more uniformed officers in concentrated areas where crime rates are high, the NYPD said.","There were 516 homicides in the city last year, up from 496 in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Mohammed Bin Hammam has promised to reform FIFA's corruption-tainted top echelons if he is successful in ending the 13-year reign of its president Sepp Blatter in the June 1 elections. The head of the Asian Football Confederation threw his name into the hat on Friday to end the prospect of the 75-year-old Blatter being re-elected unopposed. ""I will always put in mind and consider among other things ... the demands from the public to keep FIFA and football organizations above accusations and suspicion of negative practice,"" Bin Hammam told reporters on Friday. ""I will always put into consideration the need of economically-underprivileged member associations to have more technical and financial support to enable them to close the gap between their nations and those of the advanced football nations."" Vote for Blatter -- or 'None of the Above'? The last time Blatter faced a battle was in 2002, when he defeated Africa's Issa Hayatou by 139 votes to 56 despite his campaign being run amid claims of corruption and financial mismanagement. FIFA's 24-man executive committee has again been mired in controversy, with two of its members suspended last November ahead of the decision on which countries would host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, following an investigation into alleged bribery for votes. Bin Hammam, in his third term as AFC president, said he will replace that committee with an expanded 41-member FIFA Board if he is elected, giving more representation to the world's regional confederations. ""I propose UEFA gets four more seats, CAF four more seats, Asia four more seats, CONCACAF three more seats, CONMEBOL one more seat and OFC one more seat,"" the 61-year-old Qatari said, adding that he had the support of the AFC executive committee. ""A new executive committee will be coming, 40 members plus the president is 41, and it will avoid as much as possible for the privilege of the casting vote going to the president."" Bin Hammam said he would also create a new ""executive office"" headed by the FIFA president and the six confederation leaders to implement the board's decisions. ""I will decentralize the activities of the FIFA administration. The legal matters, like the statutes and international transfers, and statutory issues can be handled directly by the confederations under the supervision of their executive bodies,"" he said. He also vowed to make football's governing body more transparent, with a new proactive body to replace the existing Ethical Committee, which presently rules only after acts have happened. Bin Hammam will face a difficult task to convince FIFA's 208 member nations that he should replace Blatter, who has presided over a $1.28 billion profit following the success of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Blatter's committee awarded Qatar the 2022 tournament despite serious concerns over the emirate's infrastructure and intensely-hot weather, while Russia was a surprise winner of the right to host in 2018.","Asian Football Confederation president decides to stand against Sepp Blatter .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Pop star Michael Jackson has sued to stop an auction house from selling millions of dollars of the iconic singer's property. Michael Jackson on Thursday announces a series of concerts in London, England. Jackson's company, MJJ Productions, filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court against Julien's Auction House. ""The conduct of the defendants was malicious, fraudulent, extreme, outrageous and without any legal justification whatsoever,"" the suit said. Julien's has scheduled a five-day auction for April to liquidate items from Jackson's former home, Neverland Ranch, including the gates, the singer's famous jeweled white glove and a stretch Rolls-Royce. The singer's suit contends the auction house can't sell any of the items without his permission. Word of the lawsuit is ""news to us,"" said auctioneer Darren Julien. ""We have been accommodating any requests made by Michael Jackson for the past eight months,"" Julien said. ""If it is true and he is stating that there are items he does not want sold, why would he have ever given us the items in the first place? We are an auction house, and that is all that we do.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Exiled Tibetan lawmakers are set to hold a historic debate on the Dalai Lama's offer to shed his political role, the speaker of their parliament said Monday. The statement came after the speaker read to the legislators the spiritual leader's proposals to accord greater powers to their elected representatives. ""The essence of a democratic system is, in short, the assumption of political responsibility by elected leaders for the popular good. In order for our process of democratization to be complete, the time has come for me to devolve my formal authority to such an elected leadership,"" the Dalai Lama said in his message to Tibet's parliament-in-exile, which is meeting at Dharamsala, India. ""The general lack of experience and political maturity in our democratic institutions has prevented us from doing this earlier,"" he added. Penpa Tsering, the speaker of the exile unicameral chamber, told CNN that its lawmakers would now debate the Dalai Lama's motion. ""We should get a sense of the house by tomorrow (Tuesday) afternoon,"" he said. The assembly, he explained, will primarily have three options -- accept all his proposals, reject them completely or recommend what he called a middle course by giving more executive powers to the elected leadership of Tibet exiles. In case the lawmakers agree to the Dalai Lama's proposals in totality, they will be required to set up a special drafting committee to amend their present constitution or the charter, he said. The whole process then may take months, possibly beyond the next session slated for June, Tsering added. ""But to me, the first option (of accepting all his proposals) seems difficult,"" the speaker cautioned. ""This will have many ramifications, including those related to the Dalai Lama-led dialogue with China."" According to Tsering, the Dalai Lama could be requested to retain political leadership of the community while devolving his ceremonial powers into elected representatives as a middle ground. In his message, the Tibetan community's global figurehead cited democracy as a key means to the success of his movement. ""No system of governance can ensure stability and progress if it depends solely on one person without the support and participation of the people in the political process. One man rule is both anachronistic and undesirable. ""We have made great efforts to strengthen our democratic institutions to serve the long-term interests of the six million Tibetans, not out of a wish to copy others, but because democracy is the most representative system of governance,"" he wrote. The final vote for a new prime minister of his government-in-exile is due on March 20. The Dalai Lama fled China 52 years ago on March 10, 1959, after a failed uprising. The exile group is headquartered in Dharamsala. He told CNN in October that he would like to retire at some point. ""I'm also a human being. ... Retirement is also my right,"" he said while on a speaking tour of North America. Without saying exactly when, he said, ""Sooner or later, I have to go. I'm over 75, so next 10 years, next 20 years, one day I will go.""","Parliament will consider Dalai Lama's plan to shed his political role .

"(CNN) -- The Afghan government will investigate reports of civilian casualties in a recent NATO bombing, the office of President Hamid Karzai said Thursday. Karzai has appointed a delegation to investigate the bombing in Kunar province. According to reports, four children, a woman and a man were killed in the incident, the president's office said. NATO forces led by the United States have been battling the Taliban and its al Qaeda allies in Afghanistan for a decade, since al Qaeda's 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. A U.S. invasion swiftly deposed the Taliban, which had ruled most of Afghanistan before the attacks, but the fundamentalist Islamic movement regrouped as a guerrilla movement battling allied troops and Karzai's government. Already-strained ties among Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United States were aggravated by a November airstrike that killed 24 Pakistani troops at border posts along the Afghan frontier. Karzai has chafed at American raids that have killed Afghan civilians, while his critics accuse him of overseeing a corrupt administration and a 2010 election that international observers said was riddled with fraud. International troops are scheduled to be withdrawn in 2014. Karzai said the allied force has been able to provide political stability for Afghanistan over the past 10 years, but security for individual Afghans ""is yet to come."" Afghan civilians have also been killed by militants deploying suicide bombers or roadside bombs.","Some reports say civilians were killed in a recent NATO bombing .

"(CNN) -- There's a bounty on the head of Moammar Gadhafi, three of his children have fled the country, at least one is dead, and two of his sons seem to be having a public argument over whether to keep fighting or surrender to rebels. Here is a look at the Gadhafi family -- a large, at times quarrelsome clan that helped the embattled strongman hold onto power for more than four decades. MOAMMAR GADHAFI . Leader of Libya since 1969, Gadhafi was last reported seen June 12, two weeks before the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest. An audio message purporting to be from him aired August 24, days after rebels overran the capital Tripoli. Gadhafi's son Saif al-Islam told Syria's Rai TV August 31 that his father was ""fine. We are fighting, and we are drinking tea and drinking coffee and sitting with our families and fighting."" The Algerian government announced earlier that week that Moammar Gadhafi's wife, Safia, and three of his grown children -- daughter Aisha and two of his sons, Hannibal and Mohamed -- had arrived in the neighboring North African country. But on September 1, Algeria's foreign minister denied that the leader had come with them. ""Of course not,"" Mourad Medelci told French radio network Europe 1 when asked whether Gadhafi was in Algeria. ""The hypothesis that Mr. Gadhafi could come knocking on our door was never considered."" SAIF AL-ISLAM . The most noted power player is Saif al-Islam. Once seen as a possible successor to his father and an advocate of reform, he became a vocal defender of his father's brutal regime. Saif is wanted by the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for him in June on charges of crimes against humanity. Although rebels claimed his capture when they rolled into Tripoli, Saif al-Islam later showed up at the Rixos Hotel in a convoy of armored Land Cruisers. Since then, his whereabouts have been unknown, but at the end of August he vowed ""Victory or martyrdom!"" in a call to Syria's Rai TV. Saif al-Islam, saying he was speaking from a suburb of Tripoli, urged Libyans to rise up against the rebels: ""Wherever you see the enemy, attack them. They are weak, they have suffered lots of losses and they are now licking their wounds."" He is the second-oldest son, the oldest of Gadhafi's second wife Safia. He was educated at the London School of Economics. He speaks fluent English, is a fastidious dresser and he paints. An exhibition of his work was displayed in Moscow. SAADI . Saadi offered to negotiate an end to the war with the rebels after his father's troops lost control of Tripoli, but later seemed to change his mind. In intermittent contact with CNN's Nic Robertson, he originally appeared willing to promise his father and older brother would stay out of the way of a peace deal. ""If (the rebels) agree to cooperate to save the country together (without my father and Saif), then it will be easy and fast. I promise!"" Saadi Gadhafi said in an e-mail to Robertson. He said the opposition cannot ""build a new country without having us in the table."" But he later said he would not surrender to the rebels. They, in turn, offered him safe passage to Tripoli and proper treatment, but said he would be put on trial rather than given a chance to negotiate. A businessman, Saadi ran the Libyan Football Federation before the unrest began. He played soccer for Perugia in Italy for one season. Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables posted on WikiLeaks claim that he had ""scuffles"" with police in Europe. AISHA . Moammar Gadhafi's only daughter, a former U.N. goodwill ambassador who has kept a low profile during Libya's violent uprising, crossed into Algeria with her mother and brothers Hannibal and Mohamed August 29. She gave birth to a daughter at the border, sources close to her family told CNN. Known in the Arab media as the ""Claudia Schiffer"" of the region, the striking blonde beauty was once considered her embattled father's best asset. But, unlike her brothers, Aisha Gadhafi has largely kept out of the public eye as rebels continue to quash the last pockets of resistance from her father's 42-year-old regime. Many observers expected her to show more support for her father's increasingly beleaguered regime, especially when a NATO airstrike in April killed her brother, Saif al-Arab Gadhafi, and her own daughter -- one of several Gadhafi grandchildren who died in the attack. In February, as Moammar Gadhafi called on the military to crack down on anti-government protesters early in the Libyan conflict, the United Nations terminated his daughter's stint as a goodwill ambassador in Libya for the U.N. Development Program. A lawyer by profession, she is also known to toe a very tough political line. She has been a longtime, loud supporter of anti-government groups -- except at home -- including the IRA and the insurgents in Iraq. She was famously part of Saddam Hussein's defense team when he was tried. He ultimately was convicted and hanged. When London's Telegraph newspaper asked her how she felt about Iraqis who say he slaughtered thousands of their countrymen, she replied, ""You are bound to meet people who may be against your policies."" HANNIBAL . Hannibal fled into Algeria with his mother, sister Aisha and brother Mohamed August 29. Rebels who picked through Hannibal Gadhafi's seaside villa a day earlier introduced CNN's Dan Rivers to his family's badly burned former nanny, who said she had been doused with boiling water by Hannibal Gadhafi's wife Aline when she refused to beat one of their crying toddlers. The nanny, Shweyga Mullah, is covered with scars from the abuse, which was corroborated by another member of the household staff. Hannibal has reportedly paid millions of dollars for private parties featuring big-name entertainers including Beyonce, Mariah Carey and Usher. Several of the artists now say they have given the money back. It's not just Hannibal's parties that make news. He has been implicated in a string of violent incidents in Europe. He was accused of beating his staff, although the charges were later dropped. He was accused of beating his wife, model Aline Skaf, in a London hotel. She later said her broken nose was the result of an accident. In a spectacular episode, Hannibal was stopped after driving his Ferrari 90 mph the wrong way on the Champs-Elysees in Paris. He invoked diplomatic immunity. MOHAMED . Mohamed is the son of Moammar Gadhafi and his first wife, Fatiha. Mohamed was one of three Gadhafi sons who had been reported captured as the rebels overran Tripoli last week, but the rebels said he had escaped the following day. He was among the family who crossed into Algeria at the end of August. Before the unrest, he was the head of Libya's Olympic committee and chairman of the company that operated cell phone and satellite services in Libya. MUTASSIM . Mutassim once allegedly helped plot a coup against his father and had to flee the country when it failed. He was eventually forgiven and became his father's national security adviser. Mutassim was involved in official talks with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2009 about improving U.S.-Libyan relations. His whereabouts are unknown. KHAMIS . Khamis was said to command a special forces unit known as the 32nd brigade, or the Khamis brigade, which protected the Gadhafi family. His troops were involved in much of the heavy fighting throughout Libya. Senior rebel commander Mahdi al-Harati told CNN Khamis was killed August 28 in a battle with rebel forces between the villages of Tarunah and Bani Walid -- near Misrata -- in northwest Libya. Khamis died from his wounds at a hospital, and was buried in the area by rebel forces, al-Harati said. CNN has not independently confirmed his death. SAIF AL-ARAB . Saif al-Arab was killed in an April 30 NATO airstrike. Moammar Gadhafi and his wife were at their son's house when it was targeted. Very little is known about him. MILAD . Milad is a nephew whom Moammar Gadhafi adopted. He is said to have saved Gadhafi's life in the U.S. bombing of his compound in 1986. Milad's whereabouts are unknown.","Gadhafi last reported seen June 12, two weeks before ICC issued warrant for his arrest.
Three of his children have fled the country, and at least one is dead.
Two sons seem to have public argument over whether to keep fighting or surrender ."
"(CNN) -- The Syrian vice president arrived Friday in Moscow to talk with Russia's foreign minister about the unrest that has roiled Syria for months, a Russian state news agency reported. Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa was to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ""to discuss ways for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in his country,"" the Itar-Tass news agency reported. His visit came on the same day that at least 23 people, including four children, were killed across Syria, according to the Local Coordinating Committees, a network of opposition activists that organizes and documents demonstrations. The dead also included four women, the group said. Ten died in Homs, four in Daraa, five in Hama, two in the Damascus suburbs and one each in Idleb and Deir Ezzour, it said. But the official Syrian Arab News Agency said its correspondents had quoted official sources as saying that no casualties had occurred during the day, ""although armed terrorist groups attacked law-enforcement members in some areas."" Are you in Syria? Share your experiences if you can safely . Russia has opposed sanctions on Syria on the grounds that such actions rarely yield results. Russia has also opposed calls for foreign intervention in Syria and has urged that country to accept international monitors. The United Nations says 5,000 people have been killed in months of unrest in Syria, where pro-democracy activists are calling for an end to the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian government's repression of unrest has triggered criticism from Western nations as well as from the Arab League, which expelled Syria last month and has been pushing to send monitors into Syria. At the United Nations, Russia introduced a draft resolution this week that, it says, ""considerably strengthens"" previous drafts ""with regard to the interest in violence, with regard to the need to uphold human rights, with regard to expediting reforms."" The resolution ""strongly condemns"" violence ""coming from all parties, including disproportionate use of force by Syrian authorities."" It also would ""give a strong message to the Arab League that we encourage them to continue their efforts, and working together with the government of Syria, and to carry out its plans to deploy the monitoring mission in Syria,"" Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Thursday at the United Nations. The draft does not include sanctions or an arms embargo. Germany's U.N. ambassador, Peter Wittig, described the Russian draft resolution as ""insufficient"" but said it could be improved.","NEW: 23 people have been killed in Syria on Friday, activists say .

"Washington (CNN) -- The only original copy of the Magna Carta in private hands worldwide has a fancy new display case at the National Archives, where the document goes on display next month. ""This 700-year-old document looks better than ever,"" said David Ferriero, the archivist of the United States. He said Thursday that the handwritten, fragile parchment will be unveiled February 17. The owner of the display copy was also at Thursday's preview. David Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle Group investment company, said, ""it is my privilege as an American to be able to give this back to the Archives and let them preserve it, as they have done, and to let them display it as they are going to do."" After an initial presentation to the public in 2008, when Rubenstein got the document at a Sotheby's auction for more than $20 million, it was taken off display for replacement of the old, unappealing box made out of aluminum and glass, with a green fabric liner. The new display box, crafted from aircraft-quality metal, is filled with argon gas to minimize deterioration of the parchment on which the handwritten Latin provisions of the Magna Carta were first inscribed in 1297. The document seems to float above the floor of the display case, just below special glass that blocks damaging ultraviolet light and minimizes glare from subdued external lighting that will be used to illuminate the display. ""If we could read medieval Latin, it would be perfectly legible,"" said Catherine Nicholson, one of the ranking conservators who led the yearlong restoration and re-encasement project at the National Archives. She said they were able to repair damaged sections of the parchment and have confirmed certain letters in the text by using special photography and lighting. ""We have every reason to believe that 800 years from now, they will still be in fabulous shape,"" she concluded. Engineers from the National Institutes of Standards and Technology carried out the specifications of the National Archives in building the display case. Rubenstein took the opportunity to explain the significance fo the Magna Carta and why he hopes the public display will help people understand American history. ""This became the law of the land of England and remains the law of the land in England,"" he began, noting that those who came to the colonies in America considered themselves Englishmen with the same rights as those at home. When royalty said the colonists did not enjoy equal rights, it set the stage for American independence. The founding fathers affirmed many elements of English law in establishing the United States. ""Our whole government is based on no taxation without representation,"" Rubenstein noted. ""We have the right to habeus corpus; we have punishment in proportion to the crime, trial by jury"" and other fundamental principles originally requested nearly 800 years ago by the lords of the king of England. ""If you read the early writings of Hamilton and Jefferson and Adams and Madison, many times, they say 'it's because of the Magna Carta that we're doing this,' "" he said. Only 17 copies of the Magna Carta are known to be in existence. Fifteen of them are in British institutions, one is in the Australian parliament, according to Rubenstein, ""and this is the only one in private hands,"" he said. ""Ross Perot bought this in the early 1980s,"" Rubenstein said, describing some of the previous ownership of his copy. He said Perot had purchased it from a family that held it for more than 500 years but had fallen on hard times and sold it to raise money. Rubenstein is well-known within philanthropic circles. In recent weeks, he donated more than $7 million to help repair the Washington Monument from last summer's earthquake. He also owns a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation, on display in the Oval Office of the White House, ""and I've lent a copy of the Declaration of Independence to the State Department,"" he said. ""Everybody in life has certain things that they like,"" he said, ""and I guess one of the things I like is buying these documents and owning them."" Rubenstein suggested that it is satisfying to have invested in history, ""but you can't be buried with these documents, as far as I know. So you can assume that the appropriate place will see these documents when I'm not on this Earth.""","Parchment document dating to 1297 gets new display box .

"(CNN) -- Residents of the Southwest are bracing for a blizzard to kick off the holiday week with heavy snows, strong winds and icy roads that could make driving across the region dangerous. The snow is forecast to start battering northeast New Mexico in the wee hours of Monday morning. State emergency personnel and transportation crews there are on call, officials say, ready to act if and when the storm hits hard. Residents, meanwhile, have made their own preparations -- even on an otherwise picturesque day on Sunday, with sunny skies and temperatures in the 60s in some locales. ""I went to the grocery store, and it was packed,"" said Kevin Mueller of Tucumcari, where he and his wife run the historic Blue Swallow Inn. ""People are out there, stocking up."" The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning for much of Monday and Tuesday in large swaths of northeast New Mexico, southeast Colorado, southwest Kansas, northern Texas and the Oklahoma Panhandle. Winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories are in effect for other parts of all those states as well. That means places like Santa Rosa, New Mexico, and Springfield, Colorado, could see up to 2 feet of snow, though 8 inches to 16 inches will more likely be the norm and lesser amounts may fall in other locales. That snow will combine with potent winds, which are expected to be between 25 and 45 mph in spots. The storm is the product of a ""sharp blast of cold air"" from the north that will turn rain into snow and possibly lead to ""white-out conditions,"" the weather service said. ""Travel will become dangerous, if not impossible across the region,"" the weather agency's New Mexico division predicts. Are you there? Share photos, video . About 700 New Mexico highway personnel are set to clear the roads, with plenty of road salt also on hand to deal with ice, said Manon Arnett, a spokeswoman for the state transportation department. Those crews will be out focusing first on interstates, then on other roads, she added. If visibility diminishes or the roadway gets too slick, it will be up to state police as to whether a given thoroughfare is temporarily shut down, according to Arnett. While the traffic management center opened at 7 p.m. MST (9 p.m. EST) Sunday, New Mexico had not activated its 24-hour emergency center as of then. State emergency management spokesman Nick Piatek said personnel are on call, with food and fuel sources ready to transport to those who need them. Private companies are trying to get ahead of the storm as well. Drivers have been prepped, trucks have been filled with fuel, and tire chains are available for those at All-Rite Towing and Repair in Tucumcari, according to a long-time employee there who asked only to be identified as Linda. ""It's going to be a big one for us,"" she said, warning that hard-to-see ""black ice"" may slip up drivers and electricity outages could close gas stations. Southeast Colorado is also expected to experience blizzard conditions, with the National Weather Service warning people to ""avoid traveling in the area."" ""Life-threatening winter weather conditions are expected,"" the agency said. No flights had been canceled as of Sunday night at Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport in north Texas, said aviation director Patrick Rhodes. But the officials there have talked about what to do next at a planning meeting Sunday, including getting the airport's six snow plows ready. ""We're on the dividing line between 3 inches and 9 inches (of snow),"" he said. Amarillo residents were told to expect rain overnight that will switch to snow Monday afternoon. In Tucumcari, Mueller said his inn has emptied, like many store shelves, ahead of the storm. He's hoping the wintry weather won't prevent his son, who is set to fly in from Kentucky on Tuesday, from reuniting with the family in time for Christmas. As for unexpected guests at the inn, Mueller said that he has a plow ready to clear the driveway and rooms are ready for snow-weary travelers. ""We plan to leave our lights on,"" he said. ""If we get calls, we're ready to help."" CNN's Greg Botelho, Jessica Jordan and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Transportation and emergency crews are on call in New Mexico, officials say .

"(Financial Times) -- France's Dassault has been awarded frontrunner status in the hotly contested $20bn race to supply 126 fighter jets to India, providing a much-needed boost for French economic and industrial prestige. The Indian government said the French Rafale fighter jet had beaten the four-nation Eurofighter Typhoon to become preferred bidder to equip India with the multi-role fighter jets in one of the world's largest military contracts. Dassault now enters exclusive talks with the Indian government. The contract, estimated to be worth $15bn-$20bn, will help shape India's air power for the next three decades and serve as the bedrock of a strategic partnership. It also has the potential to reinvigorate the French defence industry when military budgets are being slashed across Europe. The decision is a blow for Eurofighter, whose Typhoon aircraft was seen as the clear frontrunner. But it is a huge boost for Nicolas Sarkozy, France's president, and Dassault, which has yet to secure an export order for the Rafale. Shares in Dassault rose 18 per cent in Paris. Mr Sarkozy faces an election in May and the declining strength of French industry is expected to be a crucial campaign battleground, with the incumbent trailing his socialist rival in opinion polls. He seized on the announcement as ""a signal of confidence in the French economy"". The deal ""proves that if we have a good product France can win in extraordinarily competitive markets"". David Reeths, a consultant at IHS Jane's, said: ""It's of particular importance to Dassault as [this competition] is really their last, best chance to continue high-end fast jet production."" India's decision came after evaluating the life-cycle cost of the aircraft, the acquisition cost and so-called military offset considerations. The offsets include the level of technology that European companies will disclose to India and the share of investment they will bring to India's defence industries. The four companies in the Eurofighter consortium, led by the Franco-German EADS and including Britain's BAE Systems and Italy's Finmeccanica, have vowed to fight on given India's recent history of stripping companies of their preferred bidder status after long, drawn-out negotiations. ""We are disappointed, but it's not all over until the contract is signed. We don't yet know the final decision,"" one UK diplomat said. India's defence ministry said a final contract would be awarded in the financial year beginning April 2012. It said the Rafale was the cheaper of the rival bids. ""Rafale is the most competent contender,"" said a person close to the negotiations at India's defence ministry. After trials last year, India selected the Rafale and the multinational Eurofighter Typhoon to compete in the final stages of the competition. It had discarded bids from Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet, Lockheed's F-16 Super Viper, Sweden's Saab Gripen and Russia's MiG-35. The decision will be a setback to Eurofighter, which had strongly lobbied India to buy its aircraft and considered its bid stronger in terms of performance, security of supply and strategic alignment. It is also a blow for David Cameron, the UK prime minister, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who both lobbied on behalf of Eurofighter.

"(CNN) -- Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow was involved in the big game in Indianapolis, where he helped his team perform another miraculous comeback in the fourth quarter with time running out. But the action didn't take place at Lucas Oil Stadium, home of Super Bowl XLVI. It was a virtual gridiron battle at EA Sports' Madden Bowl XVIII played on Xbox 360s at the Bud Light Hotel. Tebow was part of the three-member ""Clutch Team,"" which also featured New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and his teammate and tight end, Jimmy Graham. The trio beat the ""Rookie Team"" 16-13 in a dramatic comeback, sending Justin Blackmon (wide receiver, Oklahoma State University), Robert Griffin III (quarterback, Baylor University), and LaMichael James (running back, University of Oregon) home without the coveted trophy. Brees admitted that Tebow ""brings the magic,"" although in a twist, it was Brees who played quarterback during that final drive with Tebow playing wide receiver. Tebow, who was on the cover of EA Sports NCAA Football 11, said he was just happy to be part of the video game tournament. ""It's humbling to be here with these other great athletes and football players, just to be around them, to be friends with them, to continue to build relationships is wonderful,"" said Tebow. ""And then all of the opportunities we have to be in the Madden game, to be in the Madden Bowl, it really is a privilege."" Even veteran players like San Diego Chargers tight end Antonio Gates are drawn to the virtual competition, which offers something much more important than that trophy. ""The Madden Bowl is popular because it's still a competition,"" said Gates. ""We're built on competition. Our characteristics are about competing and winning. When you come here, you get to see other players and enjoy the festivities. But in the back of everybody's mind, you still want to win the Madden Bowl. Even if it's not all over the news, you still want the bragging rights."" Gates said he and Jacksonville Jaguars running back Maurice Jones-Drew, who won Madden Bowl XVI, spent time talking about this year's competition while in Hawaii at the Pro Bowl last weekend. ""It's something like the Super Bowl,"" said Miami Dolphins wide receiver and Pro Bowl MVP Brandon Marshall. ""A lot of guys take pride in their Madden game and wagers are made. And it's always fun to watch."" EA keeps NFL's biggest names involved in the tournament, even after they hang up their cleats. The Madden Legends team featured Hall of Famers Barry Sanders and Deion Sanders and Warren Sapp, who retired in 2008. ""When they came out with the four buttons on the front, that's when I quit playing Madden,"" said Sapp, laughing. ""It was just too much. It was just too much."" The competition, which Sapp said is a whole new brand from when he used to play in the NFL, was too much for this trio. But they enjoy the focus the video game puts on the sport they still love to watch. With a constant influx of new talent, the rookies typically have an edge with video game skills, as many have been weaned on the intricate controllers that the Atari and Nintendo generation have had to learn. But just as fans see on the real field, nothing beats experience and football knowledge. ""Playing in the Madden Bowl is a tremendous experience,"" said Houston Texans veteran running back Arian Foster, who played on the All-Madden Team in the tournament this year. ""Guys come into the locker room and say, 'Hey, I just got through killing with you in Madden.' So it's an awesome feeling and Madden helped me get the name that I have today. I appreciate that."" Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller came to the party to check out the high definition gridiron action, which has become ""the game before the game"" during Super Bowl week. ""It's crazy to be in Madden,"" said NFL rookie Miller. ""That's another dream. I always dreamed of playing in the NFL and to be in Madden is just amazing. I only play Madden, so it's a big deal."" Not everyone was happy with the outcome of Madden Bowl XVIII. Perhaps no player takes the video game tournament more seriously than Jones-Drew. He said he plays Madden every day and is constantly preparing himself for the competition. He wasn't happy with the format change from player versus player to three-man teams last year. ""I can beat anyone here one-on-one, which is the way Madden is supposed to be played,"" said Jones-Drew, who was part of the All-Madden Team with San Francisco 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis and Foster. As for Tebow, he doesn't have as much time since going pro to play video games. But he is just as competitive as he is on the real field when it comes to Madden Bowl, as were his teammates. ""I enjoy playing Madden,"" said Tebow. ""I stay pretty busy, so it's not like I can play it a lot. But I have a good time playing with my brothers and teammates and we get pretty competitive on it."" That competitive nature has already started with Madden NFL 13. EA Sports announced at the Madden Bowl that 64 players -- two players from each NFL team -- will compete for the chance to be on the cover of the new game. Fans will have the final say once again, after picking Cleveland Browns running back Peyton Hillis for this year's game. Can Tebow work his magic again and grace the cover of this August's football game? Don't count him out.","Tim Tebow was part of a three-member ""Clutch Team"" at EA Sports' Madden Bowl XVIII .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- The Bangladesh army said Thursday it foiled a military coup plot aimed at toppling the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Brig. General Muhammad Masud Razzaq said a group of serving and retired army officers ""with extreme religious views"" was behind the plot. The plot was instigated by Bangladeshis living abroad, Razzaq told reporters. One of the conspirators was ""probably staying in Hong Kong,"" the army spokesman said. An investigation was continuing. Razzaq said two retired officers â€” Lt. Col. Ehsan Yusuf and Maj. Zakir â€” were arrested. Officials are looking for a retired officer, Maj. Ziaul Haq, he said. Razzaq did not specify when the two officers were arrested. The army said it had evidence that some 16 officers, both retired and serving, were involved in the ""heinous conspiracy."" Hasina's party, the Awami League, came to power in 2009 in a landslide victory after a military-backed unelected interim government ruled the country for two years following political violence over polls in January 2007. Just two months after Hasina took office, 74 people, including 57 army officers serving the paramilitary border force, were killed in a mutiny over pay and perks. Hasina's government is trying more than 800 border guards on charges of killing, arson and looting during the mutiny. Born as an independent country on December 16, 1971, Bangladesh has seen a series of military coups over the years. Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding leader of Bangladesh, was assassinated in the country's first military putsch in 1975. An army general-turned-president, Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in another coup in 1981. Zia's widow, Khaleda Zia, who served as prime minister for two times, is now the leader of the opposition in parliament. A political ally of Hasina, Gen.Hussain Mohammad Ershad usurped the state power in a bloodless military coup in 1982 and ruled the country until December 1990, when he was overthrown.","Army in Bangladesh says it foiled military coup .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from the suspected attack on the Dutch royal family has continued to rise as more details emerged about the man who slammed his car into a crowd during a holiday parade. A car is pictured after crashing into the crowd waiting for the visit of the royal family in Apeldoorn. The Dutch defence ministry announced late Friday that a military policeman, 55-year-old Roel Nijenhuis, had died in hospital -- bringing the death toll to seven, including the suspected attacker. Twelve people were also injured in the attack. The driver, who has not been officially identified, died in hospital in the early hours of Friday from head injuries, as it was revealed that he had lost his job as a security guard and was about to lose his home. ""Recently, he informed me that he had been dismissed and could no longer pay the rent,"" landlord Sem Bosman told De Telegraaf newspaper. ""He was due to have come today to transfer the keys to a new tenant."" The 38-year-old was described by his former landlord and neighbours as quiet, solitary, friendly, soft-spoken and a ""dark horse,"" according to AFP news agency. The man, whose name was not released, had been seriously injured in the crash Thursday in the town of Apeldoorn, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) east of Amsterdam, police said. He had been charged with trying to attack the royal family, authorities said. Were you there? Send us your video, images . Police searched the man's house but found no weapons, explosives, ""or any other clues that could lead to the involvement of other people,"" police said.

The crowds were behind barriers off the road, but security officials and journalists, including many cameramen, were in the road as the Suzuki car went by. The car crashed into the low metal railing around a column on the side of the road. The vehicle appeared heavily damaged even before the crash, but the reason for that was unclear. There was no one other than the driver in the car at the time, police spokeswoman Esther Naber said. Members of the royal family saw the crash and gasped, then quickly sat down as the bus continued driving. The attack caused outrage in the Netherlands, newspapers Friday widely expressing disbelief and suggesting the monarchy would have to change. ""Queen's Day will never be the same,"" the Trouw newspaper said. ""The Netherlands always has been proud of their no nonsense royal family. With this comes a queen who not only cycles a bike, but also mixes with people without obvious security measurements. Is that still possible now the royal family has been the target of an attack?"" The Algemeen Dagblad newspaper agreed. """"What is going to happen on the 30th of April next year? And will we continue to see the members of the royal family cycling through the canals of Amsterdam or hunting for bargains in the Bijenkorf in The Hague?"" Queen's Day is a national holiday in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, and Aruba. The tradition started in 1885 and celebrates the birthday of the queen. Although Queen Beatrix's birthday is January 31, she officially celebrates her birthday April 30, according to the Dutch government. Queen's Day is known for its free market all over the country, where anybody is allowed to sell things in the streets. Other activities include children's games and musical performances. The day is marked with the color orange all over the country as a reference to the colors of the royal family, who come from the House of Orange-Nassau.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Three people were shot amid celebrations surrounding the New Orleans Saints' Super Bowl win, police said Monday. The shootings occurred at about midnight, at the intersection of Iberville and Bourbon streets, in the Crescent City's French Quarter, authorities said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Alberto Contador has criticized the two-year suspension he received for doping -- and has vowed to return to cycling in August even stronger than before. On Monday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) found Contador guilty of taking banned substance clenbuterol, although they also ruled that the Spaniard did not ingest it intentionally and was likely a victim of a contaminated food supplement. But the 29-year-old, who addressed a packed press conference at a hotel in his home town of Pinto, just south of Madrid, said he was disgusted with the outcome and protested his innocence. ""I am going to continue cycling,"" said Contador. ""I am going to continue practicing it cleanly, the way I have my entire life. ""My mood right now is not the best but I know this will make me stronger in the future,"" added Contador, who blamed contaminated steak for his positive test. He continued: ""Anyone who reads the decision will clearly see that I did not take drugs. The hardest thing has been to see the suffering my family has been through."" Contador's positive test related to the 2010 Tour de France, which he won by just 39 seconds ahead of Luxembourg's Andy Schleck. It was made public by Contador himself in August 2010, with the two-year ban backdated to that announcement, meaning he can resume racing in seven months. However, Contador has been stripped of all his victories from that period, with Schleck now awarded the 2010 Tour de France title and Italian Michele Scarponi named the winner of the 2011 Giro d'Italia. He will miss this year's Giro, Tour and Olympic Games. However, he will be eligible for the 2012 Tour of Spain, a race he won in 2008, and for the world championships in Limburg, Netherlands. Contador would not elaborate on his future racing plans, saying: ""I still don't know what my program will be after my suspension. ""I have to organize my future but that does not depend only on me. What I know for sure is that I want to continue to win the biggest races in the world.""","Alberto Contador has vowed to come back stronger after his two-year drugs suspension .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemeni Vice President Abdurabu Mansur Hadi kicked off his presidential campaign Tuesday, announcing he will run in the February 21 election. In a large gathering with hundreds of senior government officials representing all political factions, Hadi said he is seeking a new direction for Yemen. The nation has been wracked by unrest, including protests against current President Ali Abdullah Saleh, since early last year, when pro-democratic uprisings spread across the Arab world. Hadi promised Tuesday a national dialogue involving all political forces would happen immediately after he takes power, saying that will serve as an oasis for effective dialogue based on openness, equity and mutual respect. The Yemeni people are not able to exercise more patience, he said, as they have already borne more than they can stand in the crisis. Demonstrators have continued their protests against Saleh, despite a power transfer deal that is supposed to lead to his departure. Under the plan forged by the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saleh -- who's been in office for 33 years -- will step down after the February 21 elections and will receive immunity from prosecution. Executive powers have already been transferred to Hadi. The power transfer deal, signed in November, states that Saleh's deputy would succeed him in power for a term of two years. However, Hadi insisted on running for election, saying his presidency is not official unless he is chosen by the people. The vice president stressed there will be no red lines when it comes to solving Yemen's crises. Other priorities include stabilizing the country, and striving for a civil nation where rights and freedoms are recognized, he said. Hadi praised the demonstrators, most of whom are youths, saying they all along had hoped to see a new future for the country. In a move that surprised experts, Hadi did not mention Saleh in his speech. ""Hadi made it clear that the Saleh regime is over and he is seeking to be looked at as a president for a nation and not for a political party,"" said Abdul Salam Mohammed, director of the Sanaa-based Abaad Strategic Center. Saleh is currently seeking medical treatment in the United States for wounds he suffered in an assassination attempt in the presidential palace in June 2011. A number of leading youth movements welcomed the elections and called them a step in the right direction for Yemen. But not all youths consider their revolution over yet. Activists were cautious in openly accepting Hadi as the country's next ruler. ""Our main goal during our revolution is to oust Ali Saleh from power. This will be accomplished in two weeks, but his family is still in control of the country's military,"" said Sanaa youth activist Mohammed Hashem. He added, ""Saleh's corrupt inner circle are still allowed to be involved in politics, so we are long from calling it over.""","President Ali Abdullah Saleh is set to step down after February 21 elections .

"(CNN) -- Scotland's Paul Lawrie carded a final round seven-under-par 65 on Sunday to win the Qatar Masters by four strokes, his second victory in the tournament. The 43-year-old -- who also won in Doha in 1999, the year he went on the lift the British Open -- recorded a 15-under-par aggregate of 201, clear of Australian Jason Day and Sweden's Peter Hanson, in an event reduced to 54 holes because of high winds. Holding a one-shot lead after Saturday's second round, Lawrie produced a bogey-free 18 holes, with a brilliant eagle on the par-five ninth the highlight of his round. Day matched Lawrie's 65, and briefly threatened after opening with four successive birdies, but two dropped shots soon afterwards halted his charge. Meanwhile, Hanson posted a 67 to follow up consecutive 69s to ensure he shared second place. ""I don't think I can play much better than that,"" Lawrie told the official European Tour website. ""I've been playing well for a long, long time, but it's just nice to come out one ahead and shoot seven- under-par. ""When you've got a chance to win a tournament you don't sleep as well the night before and things go racing through your mind,"" he added. ""You've got to get back to basics and I did that. I hit some nice shots coming in.""

"(CNN) -- A Wyoming attorney representing a convicted murderer recently pardoned by Mississippi's outgoing governor says his client will not attend a Mississippi Supreme Court hearing this week on the constitutionality of his and some 200 other pardons. ""He's not going to go,"" Cheyenne, Wyoming, attorney Robert Moxley said of his client, Joseph Ozment. ""He's not a fugitive and there's no valid order that says he needs to appear,"" Moxley told CNN. On Thursday, the Mississippi Supreme Court will hear arguments brought by Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood challenging the legality of scores of pardons issued by outgoing Gov. Haley Barbour. Ozment was one of four men convicted of murder who were pardoned by Barbour in January and released from state custody. The four had been working as ""trusties"" at the governor's mansion. The releases were quickly challenged by Hood, who contends that the pardons are unconstitutional because most of the inmates involved did not fulfill all of the requirements to get a pardon. Specifically, they did not file legal notices in newspapers local to where their crimes were committed for a 30-day period as required by law. Ozment's whereabouts were unknown after his release until he was located last week in Laramie, Wyoming, and served with papers telling him to appear in court in Mississippi. Hood's office said last week that if Ozment does not comply, a judge has the authority to hold him in contempt. But CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin had a different opinion on the case as a civil -- not criminal -- matter at this point. ""He (Ozment) probably safely could ignore that piece of paper,"" Toobin said last week on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" But if the attorney general succeeds in having the pardons declared invalid, ""his (Ozment's) pardon is no longer valid. Then, the attorney general can get an arrest warrant and -- if (the attorney general) can find him at that point -- bring him back."" Added Ozment's Wyoming attorney, ""He hasn't even been required to file an answer in the civil case. There's no use in him being a spectator. It's just legal arguments."" ""The question is if there is any jurisdiction for a court to review a pardon in the first place,"" Moxley told CNN. A spokesman for the attorney general told CNN that Hood would not have any comment on the case until after the Thursday hearing. Ozment was sentenced to life in prison in 1994 after he admitted he was part of a gang that robbed a convenience store in DeSoto County, Mississippi. The store clerk was killed in the robbery. Ozment entered a plea to avoid the death penalty, admitting that he entered the convenience store and after one of his accomplices shot the clerk, Ricky Montgomery, three times, Ozment walked up to Montgomery, who was crawling from behind the store counter, and shot him twice in the head. Ozment said that he did that so that the clerk could not later identify him. The Mississippi Supreme Court is expected to make a ruling on whether the pardons can even be challenged. If the court rules against the pardoned criminals, a lower court would be asked to hold hearings on each individual case. ""If the thing goes back to the trial court and resumes again, we're going to litigate these issues on whether there is extradition -- if it comes to that -- but it's a long way away,"" said Moxley. Last week, at a news conference, Attorney General Hood said that if the court finds in his favor, he will have Ozment arrested ""as soon as we can lay hands on him."" But Hood said he hopes Ozment will turn himself in. ""We'll see what kind of man he is,"" Hood said.","Joseph Ozment was one of some 200 Mississippi inmates pardoned .

"(CNN) -- Fidel Castro has released a previously unannounced two-volume memoir of his life, Cuban state-run media reported Saturday. In a six-hour presentation Friday, the leader of the Cuban Revolution and former president was jovial as he spoke about the 1,000-page work, the Granma newspaper reported. Castro, 85, spoke together with a panel of cultural and literary officials at the unveiling of the books. ""They are going to talk to you about two books that you had no idea about,"" Castro said, according to Granma. The two volumes, titled ""Fidel Castro Ruz: Guerrilla of Time,"" is based on conversations with the writer and journalist Katiuska Blanco. The books cover his life from infancy to December 1958, on the eve of victory of the Cuban Revolution. In photos published online, Castro is seen at the unveiling, wearing a dark blue workout suit over a checkered button-down shirt. A Cuban writer, Graziella Pogolotti, said she encouraged Castro to continue writing, despite the challenges of recalling the past, Granma reported. ""I have to take advantage now, because memories fade,"" Castro was quoted as saying.""I am willing to do everything possible to share everything I remember well.""

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- His is one of the most famous faces in the world -- a symbol of dignity and reconciliation for many. Those protecting Mandela's image want him remembered as more than just a face on a T-shirt . But those now trying to protect his image say Nelson Mandela is also in danger of becoming an exploited brand, emblazoned on clothing, smiling from unauthorized paintings and commemorated in a proliferation of tacky memorabilia. ""What we don't want is for him to become another Che Guevara, another face on a T-shirt,"" says Achmed Dangor, head of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, which organizes charitable projects on behalf of the former South African president. Dangor and the Mandela Foundation have been aggressive in clamping down on what they say is an illegal use of Mandela's image. Artist Yuill Damasso, one of 200 people worldwide who have been warned against exploiting the Nobel laureate's iconic status, says the Foundation is being heavy handed. ""The people around him, trying to protect him, are being overprotective. He is widely regarded as the father of freedom now, yet we are not allowed to depict his image,"" he says. Problems protecting Mandela's image stand in contrast to the 27 years he spent in prison when photographs of him were outlawed, althought this didn't stop him becoming a poster star of overseas anti-apartheid campaigns. But playing policeman is not just about protecting his image from overexposure, says Verne Harris, archivist with the Nelson Mandela Foundation. ""Legacy is not something you receive in pristine form and your role is to hold it over time. We believe legacy is made, constantly remade,"" he says. The Foundation says it is aware that Mandela will exist as a brand long after he is gone. But it says it wants to make sure he's instantly remembered as a man who helped changed history -- a man whose qualities of reconciliation, forgiveness and hope can be emulated by all. ""For us, our role is about fostering that process. South Africa has a stake in that legacy. Arguably, the world has a stake in that legacy,"" says Harris ""It's not about ownership -- custody -- but creating spaces for this to continue growing.""","200 people worldwide warned against misuse of Mandela's image .

"(CNN) -- American golfer Webb Simpson expects a close battle with world No. 1 Luke Donald this week as both seek to top the PGA Tour's end-of-season money list for the first time. Both will line up in Florida for the final event of the U.S. circuit's Fall Series, with $846,000 on offer for the winner from a total prize purse of $4.7 million. Donald had been in pole position in his bid to become the first golfer to top both the U.S. and European money lists in the same season, but Simpson went $363,029 clear in the PGA standings despite suffering a playoff defeat to fellow American Ben Crane at the McGladrey Classic on Sunday. Englishman Donald, who went to a friend's wedding instead, will now need to finish second or higher at the Children's Miracle Network Classic at Disney World starting on Thursday to usurp Simpson. Simpson has won $6.2 million so far from 25 events, while Donald is on almost $5.84 million from 18. The 26-year-old Simpson is seeking to cap an incredible breakthrough year in which he won his first title at Wyndham Championship in his home state of North Carolina in August, then triumphed in the second event of the FedEx Cup playoffs and narrowly missed out on the $10 million jackpot when he faded to 22nd at the Tour Championship. ""I think coming in, finishing second is going to make it a lot harder for Luke,"" world No. 12 Simpson told the PGA Tour's official website. ""But I'm sure he's going to play well. He's played well most every week this year. I still wouldn't be surprised if I have a little work to do next week. ""It would be nice to run away with it, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's going to be pretty close. Winning would take care of a lot, I think."" Crane said his form over Sunday's final round was ""as good as I can play"" after claiming his fourth title. The new world No. 50 carded eight birdies in the final 11 holes to finish on 15 under par, before Simpson bogeyed at the second additional hole to hand Crane victory. ""Is that right?"" Crane said when he heard the statistics from his impressive round. ""What the heck? Wow. That's as good as I can play. ""I just said, 'Well, if I'm going to have a chance, I'm going to have to birdie two of the last three holes.' ""Newsflash: If you don't birdie the first one and you're dormie with two holes to play and you've got to make two birdies, it gets harder. I read it perfectly and the ball went right in the middle and I was just thrilled."" Despite the win, his first since the Farmers Insurance Open in January 2010, Crane had little time to celebrate, with his wife Heather due to give birth to their third child on Monday. ""I told my wife, 'I don't even know if I should -- what am I doing here? You're about to go into labor ... Should I even be playing this week?' "" he said . ""I was driving, bringing the car down after the playoff was over, and someone said, 'Well, you've got to name the baby -- the baby's middle name has got to be McGladrey or Frederica ... Sea Island.'"" American Michael Thompson mised out on the playoff by one shot as he finished third ahead of 2010 British Open winner Louis Oosthuizen. Oosthuizen's fellow South African and 2008 Masters champion Trevor Immelman was fifth on 12 under, two shots clear of a five-way tie for sixth place which included two-time major winner Angel Cabrera. Jim Furyk, the 2003 U.S. Open champion who topped the PGA Tour money list in 2010, tied for 11th on nine under.","Webb Simpson moves ahead of world No. 1 Luke Donald on PGA Tour money list .

"(CNN) -- As though there were not enough tumult in Egypt. A year after revolution felled a longtime dictator, a new crisis has soured its strongest Western ally and threatened to sever military aid. Egyptian authorities had been investigating civil society organizations for a while but they stunned U.S. officials by announcing this week that 43 foreigners, including 19 Americans, working for civil society organizations would face prosecution. Egyptian officials blamed ongoing unrest in their country on foreign interference. Authorities carried out 17 raids on the offices of 10 organizations including the U.S.-based Freedom House, National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute. Among those going to court is Sam LaHood, son of Ray LaHood, the transportation secretary. Not a wise decision by the Egyptians, said journalist Ashraf Khalil, author of ""Liberation Square: Inside the Egyptian Revolution."" ""You never ever mess with the son of a (government official),"" Khalil said. ""I never expected foreigners would be sent to trial. I started to think that maybe they really believe these people are spies."" Khalil was not alone in his reaction. Several analysts said they were surprised the Egyptians chose to provoke America at such a critical juncture in their post-revolutionary journey; to bite the proverbial hand that feeds them. What makes this crisis even tougher is that there are no easy solutions to stave off tensions. The Egyptians say the pro-democracy organizations had received illegal foreign financing and were operating without a proper license. But some of the groups had been tacitly operating for some time in Egypt without permission, even under Hosni Mubarak. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the groups targeted did not fund candidates or parties. ""There is nothing new in their activities,"" she said. Washington viewed the move as a crackdown on democracy and threatened to cut off more than $1.3 billion in military aid that was conditioned on Egypt's progress in transitioning to democracy. Top officials including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta lashed out. And 41 members of Congress urged the administration to withhold further aid to Egypt until authorities allow the offices of the targeted organizations re-open. ""We have underscored how serious a problem these actions are. We have said clearly that these actions could have consequences for our relationship, including regarding our assistance programs,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday. Nuland declined to speculate about possible consequences but said the dispute ""is a very, very difficult situation in terms of the support we want to provide Egypt."" The drama continued Tuesday when Sen. John McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CNN that an Egyptian military delegation visiting Washington had canceled meetings with senior American lawmakers at the last moment and returned to Egypt. McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, did not give a reason why the Egyptians backed out but it wasn't hard to guess. ""What is happening now is that both sides have painted themselves in a corner and they don't have an easy way to get out,"" said Marina Ottaway, a senior associate at the Middle East Program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The Egyptians have now made a legal case and the Americans will find it difficult to tell them to interfere with the work of the judiciary when they are trying to push democracy, Ottaway said. One Egyptian official told the Al-Ahram newspaper: ""Americans cannot preach to us night and day about the need to abide by the rule of law and then ask us to break the law to serve their interests."" The United States entree into Egypt is through its military leadership -- Washington has no relationship with the political leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has a majority in Egypt's parliament. So it cannot afford to simply cut off Egypt, Ottaway said. At the same time, Egypt must find a way to expedite legitimate trial and release the Americans to protect its relationship with Washington. Ottaway said the military often blames foreign forces in having a hidden hand in anti-government protests. ""This is what the military is doing,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, they are not blaming some nebulous group. It's a big mess."" The crisis may also have been fueled in part by the a great sense of nationalism on the government's part, said Isobel Coleman, a senior fellow at the Council for Foreign Relations. ""It's better in the short term to be seen as standing up to the Americans,' she said. In recent days protesters have returned to Cairo's Tahrir Square, demanding an end to military rule. Some of those protests, in the wake of soccer riots that killed 79 people, have turned deadly. ""As the situation continues to be very unsettled in Egypt, the powers that be will look for a scapegoat,"" Coleman said. ""Blame your problems on outside powers. That's how it has been throughout history."" Accusing activists of receiving foreign funds is not new, either. Under Mubarak, dissident Saad Eddin Ibrahim was accused of using European Union money for election monitoring. He was tried twice before a higher court dismissed the case. Khalil, who covered Ibrahim's trial, said he believes the Egyptian courts will back down on the foreigners. ""I think the Egyptians understand the depth of the hornet's nest,"" he said. But what Khalil fears most are the consequences for a half-dozen Egyptian pro-democracy groups that have also been accused of receiving foreign money. They are not the ones in the spotlight, he said. But they are the ones who will feel the wrath of authorities the most. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","Egyptian authorities crack down on foreign organizations .

"LONDON, England (SuperYachtWorld) -- It may be named after the high-octane James Bond thriller, but does the latest offering from enthusiastic owner John Staluppi hit the jackpot? Bond style: Casino Royale is the latest in a series of 007-inspired super-yachts. ""Casino Royale"" was the first action-packed novel by Ian Fleming, paving the way for 11 more spy novels, and a catalogue of iconic films charting the adventures of secret service agent James Bond. But it is also the name of the very latest in a line of yachts owned by renowned yachtsman John A. Staluppi -- all of which have been named after one of the Bond tales. They may well be tributes to 007, but Octopussy, Moonraker, Thunderball and The World is Not Enough are also some of the fastest super-yachts in the world. Octopussy was built in Holland and Moonraker in Norway, both from plans drawn by the innovative Dutch naval architect Frank Mulder, and Thunderball was designed and built by Dennison Yachts in Fort Lauderdale. To build The World is Not Enough, John created Millennium Superyachts in 1998, a company that will be a vehicle for future builds. It was the 43.5 meter Octopussy, which broke the 50-knot barrier 18 years ago, that first brought the name of New York-born John Staluppi to the attention of super-yacht aficionados. The self-made millionaire left school when he was 16 and worked as a mechanic in Brooklyn before going on to start up one of the most successful car dealerships in North America -- a business that enabled him to indulge his passion for racing fast boats, and then later for super-yachts. To build Casino Royale, Millennium Yachts has teamed up with the U.S.-based Christensen Shipyard, describing the new launch as the first of its ""Millennium editions."" Joe Foggia, president of Christensen Yachts, explains: ""She has over 650 square meters of space on board -- that's a lot in a yacht of her length."" There is no doubt that John's vision and passion bring fervor and excitement to a sometimes conservative industry. There are, after all, few super-yachts aboard which you will be greeted by frosted-glass panels sweeping down the central staircase, delicately etched with the silhouettes of Bond girls. And then there's the hand-crafted marble roulette wheel set into the deck of the main saloon, made by master-craftsman John Homchick at Christensen's dedicated marble shop. Casino Royale isn't a speed machine to match his previous yachts but, as we chatted on the deck of his latest creation, it's very clear that John Staluppi is an owner who knows just want he wants. ""So what is a super-yacht? To me, it has to be at least 120 feet overall with a master suite and four guest cabins, room for six crew and somewhere to carry the tender. ""And oh, one more thing, there has to be no teak. It adds weight, it's a pain in the butt to clean, and the oil gets all over my carpeting!"" he says with a smile. We look around and notice the acres of teak decking -- it's stunning, so perhaps this is one fight he's better off not winning. The yacht's interior can best be described as richly ornate, yet it remains tasteful and has the softer touch of John's wife Jeanette in many of the living areas. Atop the divide sits a figurine of Vesper Lynd, the heroine from Casino Royale. In terms of accommodation, John has achieved the optimal use of space he was looking for. The master stateroom is accessed through the owner's study with its dark, leather-topped mahogany desk and cream leather office chair. As you may expect from a James Bond fan, a gargantuan double bed dominates with a mirrored deck head above. Below, the guest cabins are equally well-appointed and appear to be larger than the standard on most yachts of this size. Forward are two twin cabins; astern of them two suites with king-size bunks and further aft is a stunning full-beam VIP suite. Two decks above is the elegant sky lounge -- a party room if ever we saw one.

"(CNN) -- There's a pretty good chance that you missed Madonna's first film as writer-director, the low budget London comedy ""Filth and Wisdom."" Her second will be harder to avoid -- it's a handsomely produced British heritage picture with James D'Arcy as King Edward VIII and Andrea Riseborough as Wallis Simpson -- but nevertheless you should make every effort to do so. This flimsy vanity project cruelly exposes the Material Girl's limitations. It's a tedious, vapid, threadbare movie that only a superstar could get made -- or would want to. For reasons we can only guess at, Madonna evidently identifies with Mrs. Simpson, the American divorcee vilified by the British press in the late 1930s when she stole the heart of the world's most eligible bachelor, Edward Windsor, the Prince of Wales and heir to the British throne. (Despite his laddish demeanor, Madonna's second ex-husband, ""Sherlock Holmes"" director Guy Ritchie, came from a line of blue-bloods and baronets.) The Brits had no shortage of reasons to dislike Wallis; some valid, some pure snobbery. Not only was this foreigner married when the affair got started, and already a divorcee, she was also rather unattractive by conventional standards. A plain Jane with mannish features who was inappropriately frank about her social-climbing aspirations. As if that wasn't enough she was also on chummy terms with members of Hitler's inner circle and, salacious gossip suggests, an expert in the Oriental arts of lovemaking (though Madonna's having none of that, the movie is perversely sexless). A less suitable match was hard to imagine, and in the constitutional crisis that followed, Edward was forced to abdicate in favor of his stammering sibling, Bertie. In other words, Mrs Simpson's hardly your typical ""cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre,"" though that doesn't stop Madonna from painting her as a feminist heroine in ""the greatest love story of the 20th century."" In this high-gloss version of events, Wallis is an abused woman (viciously beaten by her boorish first husband), who compensates for her physical shortcomings with her sense of style, quick feet on the dance floor and candid American wit (not that we hear any). As for Edward, history's naÃ¯ve, racist and foolhardy womanizer is recast as a debonair sophisticate and improbable champion of the working classes. In the film's most egregious line, Wallis greets her royal suitor with an oh-so-casual, ""I've been reading that book you recommended about social reform."" Right, and they dedicated the rest of their days to helping the orphans in Africa too. In a parallel modern-day story that manages to be even more dramatically suspect, Abbie Cornish is Wally Winthrop, the neglected wife of a handsome, philanthropic doctor (Richard Coyle) who won't sleep with her and drives her to futile in-vitro fertilization injections (filmed in wobbly shlock-horror close-ups). Obsessed with her namesake, Wally spends several eons wandering through a Sotheby's exhibition of the Duke and Duchess' artifacts, catching the eye of a studly security guard (Oscar Isaac), an ex-Russian intellectual who borrows the royals' dinner service for an impromptu date dressed in a kilt and a bearskin hat. In superstar circles this is what passes for romance. Despite these absurdities, ""W.E."" is nicely packaged and photographed. Andrea Riseborough miraculously makes Wallis Simpson more interesting than this hagiography allows, especially when she starts to regret her great conquest as the trappings of wealth turn claustrophobic. There are inklings of a real movie in this somber coda, but the interminable modern scenes remain desperately trite, and just because Madonna thinks it's OK to turn a blind eye to fascism, there's no reason to follow suit. As Queen Victoria is supposed to have said, ""We are not amused.""","This flimsy vanity project cruelly exposes the Material Girl's limitations .

"(CNN) -- World number one Novak Djokovic beat Croat Ivan Dodig 6-4 6-3 at the Paris Masters on Wednesday, a win which earned the Serb a check for $1.6 million. A shoulder injury had cast doubt over Djokovic's participation in the French tournament, with the 24-year-old having already pulled out of last month's Shanghai Masters. The top seed would have been entitled to a $2m bonus for ending the year at number one in the world rankings, but that figure is subject to the player having featured in all eight of the Masters 1000 events on the ATP Tour. The bonus had already been reduced to $1.6m due to Djokovic's absence in China, and would have been wiped out altogether had he failed to play in France. But Djokovic was fit to take to the court at the indoor tournament, revealing his pleasure at being able to play in front of the Paris crowd. ""I think it's one of the most entertaining indoor tournaments,"" Djokovic told the ATP Tour's official website. ""People are coming in numbers here to watch matches. I like playing it."" World No. 3 Andy Murray is also safely into the third round courtesy of a 6-2 6-4 defeat of home-crowd favorite Jeremy Chardy in the French capital. The victory was second seed Murray's 16th in-a-row, a run which stretches back to his U.S. Open semifinal defeat to Rafael Nadal and has seen him move above 16-time grand slam winner Roger Federer in the world rankings. Murray converted three of his six break points to seal a fifth career win over world No. 110 Chardy and set up a last-16 clash with American Andy Roddick. Federer continued his recent revival with a 6-2 6-3 win over French wildcard Adrian Mannarino. The Swiss clinched his fifth career triumph at the Swiss Indoors in Basel earlier this month, and was in fine form as he dispatched Mannarino in 56 minutes. Fourth seed David Ferrer also earned a straight-sets success against French opposition, advancing beyond qualifier Nicolas Mahut 6-4 6-4. The Spaniard, who is already assured of his place at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London later this month, faced only two break points on his way to victory in one hour and 27 minutes. Serb Janko Tipsarevic continued his bid to reach the World Tour Finals with a crushing 6-1 6-0 triumph over American Alex Bogomolov Jr. World No. 13 Tipsarevic, who must reach the final to stand any chance of competing at the O2 Arena, now faces Tomas Berdych, the Czech who can seal his World Tour Finals berth with victory in the third round clash.","Novak Djokovic will collect a $1.6m bonus check for finishing 2011 as world No.1 .

"(CNN) -- The Philippine authorities have significantly revised down the death toll from a strong earthquake that shook the country's third-largest island on Monday. The state-run Philippines News Agency had reported Tuesday that the number of people killed by the 6.7-magnitude quake off the coast of Negros had climbed to 48. It cited the Philippine Army, which was basing the figure on information from local government units. But PNA later reported that the army had reduced the total to 22 confirmed dead after it ""learned that not all believed dead in various towns and cities were accounted for."" The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council on Wednesday put the official death toll at 26, with 71 people still missing. The quake in the central Philippines on Monday damaged houses, churches and many other buildings. It also set off landslides and has left at least 10 bridges unusable. The area near the quake continued to be rattled by aftershocks Wednesday. The Philippines is situated in the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. CNN's Karen Smith contributed to this report.","State media had cited the Philippine Army as saying the death toll was 48 .

"(CNN) -- While several high-profile actors and directors have rallied around Roman Polanski, not everyone in Hollywood believes he should be freed and forgiven. The case surrounding the arrest of director Roman Polanski has both supporters and critics. In the face of a  petition signed by notables such as Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese and John Landis calling for the immediate release of Polanski following his detainment in Switzerland, a backlash is building against such support. ""I can't believe that Hollywood has separated itself so completely from American morality,"" said Paul Petersen, a former child actor and president of A Minor Consideration, which advocates on behalf of young performers. ""It is yet another case of Hollywood being out of sync with most of America."" Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, but fled the United States before he could be sentenced. In the years since, the director known for ""Chinatown"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"" settled in France and avoided authorities until he was arrested Saturday while on his way to the Zurich Film Festival. In the aftermath of Polanski's arrest last weekend, a number of performers -- including Penelope Cruz, Tilda Swinton and Monica Bellucci -- appear as supporters on a petition which states, ""Roman Polanski is a French citizen, a renown and international artist now facing extradition. This extradition, if it takes place, will be heavy in consequences and will take away his freedom."" Polanski's detention has stirred debate over whether he should be returned to the United States to face possible imprisonment. Supporters make note of his age, the years that have passed, his talent and the victim's own assertion that pursuing the case opens fresh wounds for her as reasons the director should be left alone. But critics observe that Polanski's supporters might be downplaying his crime. ""I don't think a lot of people take the sexual assault of children very seriously at all, and it's something we battle everyday,"" said Grier Weeks, executive director of Protect, a national organization to protect children. ""We say at Protect that we are the most bipartisan group in America because we've got everyone from Hollywood liberals like Alison Arngrim [Nellie Oleson] from 'Little House on the Prairie' to extremely conservative people. ... But I will say with the notable exception of a few people from Hollywood, we get blank stares from some of that crowd."" Weeks pointed to the example of a discussion on ABC's ""The View,"" in which panelist and actress Whoopi Goldberg made the comment that she didn't believe the original charges against Polanski were for ""rape-rape,"" as what he views as a pervasive attitude. ""I assume [Goldberg] regrets saying what she said, but she really didn't say anything that is not under the surface anyway,"" Weeks said. ""This is just the attitude, that children are property and crimes against them are not real crimes.""  Watch a discussion of about Polanski's supporters » . Goldberg's fellow panelist, Sherri Shepherd, said during the show that she believed Polanski should still be punished. On Twitter, she tweeted, ""Whew... long day at 'The View'... two shows today... hot debate over the Statutory Rapist Polanski. 45-year-old man plies a 13-yr-old w/drugs & Liquor and anally & orally penetrates her w/o her consent is a RAPIST. We hunt down 75-year-old Nazis. We must protect our children."" Actress Kirstie Alley wrote on Twitter ""JUST FOR THE RECORD....RAPE IS RAPE...this is one HOLLYWOOD STAR who does not CELEBRATE or DEFEND Roman Polanski..his ART did not RAPE her."" ""The Biggest Loser"" trainer Jillian Michaels said ""If she's [the victim] OK and feels that they are resolved then who are we to say"" referring to the now adult victim, Samantha Geimer. Despite that, Michaels said, ""If somebody drugged and raped my 13-year-old I'd shoot them.""  Watch stars discuss Polanski's arrest » . Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, said it is understandable that Geimer would want to move on given what has occurred. ""I think that it's deplorable that some celebrities, and I emphasis the word 'some,' are supporting rape, supporting the destruction of the life of a 13-year-old girl,"" O'Neill said. ""You look at what happened to the victim in this case and how she was re-victimized over and over again. First by [Polanski] himself when he claimed it was consensual, then by his pals all powerful, wealthy celebrities who supported him, then by the media who characterized her as the little Lolita, the 13-year-old temptress."" Petersen, who played son Jeff Stone on ""The Donna Reed Show,"" said he believes there are many in the industry who would like to speak up against the support Polanski has received. ""They are afraid of the Hollywood power structure that is tilted distinctly to the left and plays favorites,"" Petersen said. Thomas J. Reese, S.J., a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University, wrote a piece for The Washington Post's ""On Faith"" column titled ""Father Polanski Would Go to Jail."" Reese said Hollywood might learn a lesson from the scandals involving pedophiles and the Catholic Church. ""I think that perhaps there is a sense of entitlement that comes with being a celebrity and a star and part of that whole industry where people are always fawning over them and idolizing them,"" Reese said. ""I think that kind of goes to your head and makes you think that you are special and above the law. The clergy used to think that at one time, inaccurately, and it's just not a healthy attitude."" On Wednesday, the BBC reported that the French government had dropped its public support for the release of Polanski stating that the director ""is neither above nor beneath the law.""","Some stars speak out against Roman Polanski's crime .

"(CNN) -- The author of a new tell-all book claims she lost her virginity to President John F. Kennedy when she was a 19-year-old White House intern, and that the affair lasted 18 months. The book, ""Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath,"" will be available Wednesday, but CNN was able to buy a copy Monday. The alleged affair began in the summer of 1962, while Mimi Alford worked in the White House press office. She met Kennedy four days into her internship, and was invited for a personal tour of the residence a day later by the commander-in-chief after being served daiquiris, she says in Chapter 4 of the book. ""Slowly, he unbuttoned the top of my shirtdress and touched my breasts,"" Alford said in the book. ""Then he reached up between my legs and started to pull off my underwear. I finished unbuttoning my shirtdress and let it fall off my shoulders."" ""After he finished, he hitched up his pants and smiled at me"" pointing her to the bathroom. ""I was in shock,"" she writes. ""He, on the other hand, was matter-of-fact, and acted as if what had just occurred was the most natural thing in the world."" The White House arranged for a car for her, she said. On the ride home, it ""kept echoing in my head: I'm not a virgin anymore."" ""In an era when women in the workplace were still considered 'girls,' Mimi was literally a girl herself -- naive, innocent, emotionally unprepared for the thrill that came when the president's charisma and power were turned on her full-force,"" according to the website of the book's publisher, Random House. ""She was also unprepared for the feelings of isolation that would follow as she fell into the double life of a college student who was also the secret lover of the most powerful man in the world."" Fifty years later, Alford is now a 69-year-old grandmother and retired New York City church administrator, the Post reported. Following Kennedy's assassination, Alford ""grieved in private, locked her secret away and tried to start her life anew, only to find that her past would cast a long shadow -- and ultimately destroy her relationship with the man she married,"" Random House said. In 2003, a Kennedy biographer mentioned ""a tall, slender, beautiful 19-year-old college sophomore and White House intern, who worked in the press office"" when referencing one of the president's affairs, the publisher's website said. ""The disclosure set off a tabloid frenzy and soon exposed Mimi and the secret that she had kept for 41 years."" The publisher describes the book as ""a new and personal depiction of one of our most iconic leaders and a powerful, moving story of a woman coming to terms with her past and moving out of the shadows to reclaim the truth."" CNN's Dominique Dodley contributed to this report.","Mimi Alford is now a 69-year-old grandmother .

"(CNN) -- Kim Clijsters returned to competitive action on the WTA Tour with a convincing straight sets win over Simona Halep in Brisbane Sunday. The Belgian has not played on the circuit since August after a 2011 ruined by a series of injuries, but showed no sign in a 6-1 6-4 victory. ""I felt that I was playing aggressively and moving well. I was pretty satisfied,"" Clijsters told the official tournament website. Clijsters, the 2010 champion in Brisbane, is using the tournament as build-up to her defense of the Australian Open crown. The 28-year-old claimed her fourth grand slam title in Melbourne last January, but an ankle injury hampered her French Open campaign, where she was beaten in the second round, and she missed Wimbledon. Returning ahead of the U.S. Open, Clijsters then suffered an abdominal problem, which ruled her out of her title defense. After beating Romanian Halep, she said that the injury was no longer hampering her service. The curse of women's No.1? ""I felt confident with my serve. I think that's something that, in the past, wasn't always the case."" Four breaks of service always had her 47th-ranked opponent on the back foot and she will next play either former World No.1 Ana Ivanovic or Austria's Tamira Paszek in the second round. 13-time grand slam winner Serena Williams is also on the comeback trail at the joint ATP/WTA tournament, playing for the first time since her dramatic September 11 loss to Samantha Stosur in the U.S. Open final. Williams opens Monday against South African Chanelle Scheepers and could face home hope Stosur in the semifinals. In men's action Sunday, third seed Alexandr Dolgopolov of the Ukraine eased past Alejandro Falla of Colombia 7-6 6-2.

"Charlottesville, Virginia (CNN) -- Jurors at the trial of a University of Virginia lacrosse player accused of fatally beating his ex-girlfriend were asked by a defense attorney Wednesday to consider only an involuntary manslaughter conviction. Attorney Francis Lawrence, in his opening statement, contended that would be appropriate because the death was an accident. George Huguely currently faces charges including first-degree murder in the death of Yeardley Love, who also was a lacrosse player for the university. University of Virginia law professor Darryl Brown told InSession that involuntary manslaughter in the state carries a maximum 10-year sentence. Huguely has been held for two years. But prosecutors, in their opening statement, said Huguely made an e-mail threat against Love, 22, before her May 2010 death. Prosecutor Warner D. Chapman read e-mails exchanged between the two after Huguely learned Love had allegedly slept with someone else. The defendant wrote, ""I should have killed you"" and Love responded, ""You should have killed me?"" according to Chapman. Huguely responded that the pair should talk, Chapman said. Chapman also told jurors Love's death was slow and painful and that she could have remained alive for a couple of hours after Huguely left her apartment. The defense also claims Love was alive when Huguely left. Charlottesville Police Detective Lisa Reeves wrote in a sworn statement used to obtain a search warrant in the case that ""George Huguely admitted on May 3, 2010, that he was involved in an altercation with Yeardley Love and that during the course of the altercation he shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall."" But defense attorney Lawrence said there was no evidence that Love's head hit a wall. Lawrence said Huguely refused to believe Love was dead when questioned by police. Police were initially called to Love's off-campus Charlottesville apartment by a roommate who reported ""a possible alcohol overdose,"" Police Chief Tim Longo said at the time. ""It was quickly apparent to them this young lady was the victim of something far worse,"" Longo said. A medical examiner ruled that blunt force trauma killed Love, and authorities allege Huguely caused it during the altercation. Love had ""a large bruise on the right side of her face which appears to have been caused by blunt force trauma,"" according to the police sworn statement. Huguely admitted he kicked open the door to Love's bedroom after he found her apartment door unlocked, according to the detective's affidavit. He also admitted he took her computer from her apartment, Reeves wrote. It was later found by police after Huguely told them where he disposed of it, she said. The trial is expected to last two weeks. InSession's Lena Jakobsson contributed to this report.","Jurors hear differing accounts of Virginia student's 2010 death .

"Mountain View, California (CNN) -- Meet Evernote CEO Phil Libin, who runs a software company based here in Silicon Valley that has been on a hot streak. Last month, the company launched an iPhone application, called Evernote Food, that lets users keep track of favorite recipes and restaurants. It was an instant hit. Evernote also released an iPad app, called Skitch, for drawing and annotating on images. It has skyrocketed from 200,000 to 5 million users since Evernote acquired the startup behind the technology in August. All of Evernote's apps tie into its online note-taking and file-storage service. It has 21 million users, of which nearly a million pay for access to more storage space and capabilities, Libin said. The company's major growth left executives scurrying for a place to fit all of its new employees. They will move into a much larger headquarters in nearby Redwood City, California, in the next few months, Libin said. ""We want to be the Zynga of getting stuff done,"" Libin told CNN, referring to the maker of such hit social-network games as ""FarmVille"" and ""Words with Friends."" ""I think that's really what we're becoming."" Despite the successes, Evernote's most ambitious recent project hasn't immediately taken off. Evernote Hello, a quirky iPhone app for exchanging contact information that launched at the same time as the Food app, has not gotten off to a terrific start. It's billed as a replacement for business cards and address books, asking users to hand their phones over to strangers who then input their e-mail addresses and phone numbers and snap head shots to help them pair a face with the name. CNET, the CBS-owned technology website, covered it under the headline, ""Evernote Hello shares cooties and contacts."" Another tech blog, ReadWriteWeb, called it ""an app only Sheldon Cooper would love,"" a reference to the fictional nerd from the CBS show ""The Big Bang Theory."" Libin, who does bear some resemblance to the TV character played by actor Jim Parsons, said Evernote is making changes in response to user feedback. For example, the app should allow users to snap a picture of a business card using the iPhone's camera and automatically input the information from it -- like LinkedIn's CardMunch, Libin said. It may also let two people who have the app running exchange contact info wirelessly in a process similar to the Bump app, he said. Users will also have the option of inputting the data themselves manually, rather than handing the phone over to a new acquaintance, Libin said. However, he defended his original concept, saying that people take better pictures of themselves when they are controlling the camera. ""Your photo booth instincts kick in,"" Libin said. ""You just get better photos. But whatever."" During an interview at Evernote's headquarters last week, I handed Libin my phone and asked him to input his contact information into the Hello app. He winced and observed that the app has already advanced so far beyond the publicly available version I was using that it was barely recognizable to him. Libin describes the alphabetical organization of most contact lists as outdated, a remnant from when people's names and numbers were printed on linear pages. Perhaps the last mainstream innovation in address books came in 2007 when Apple introduced a favorites list to the iPhone. Evernote Hello shows contacts in a mosaic of people's faces. ""Your brain doesn't remember things alphabetically,"" Libin said. A new version of Evernote Hello will be available in the next few weeks, Libin said. It should bring the product closer to Libin's original concept of supplanting the address book by giving it a 21st-century update and merging it with your calendar. ""It's sort of as if your address book, your calendar and your camera had a love child,"" Libin said. Part of the inspiration for Evernote Hello came from Libin's own inability to remember people by name, he said. Still, the app has a long way to go. As Libin tweaks his pet project, Evernote developers are working on at least two more apps to be released this year. One is for keeping a to-do list, and another is for organizing travel tips, Libin said. ""Hello is really ambitious, and it's going to take us a long time to get it right,"" Libin said. ""But it's the one I think has the most potential to change things.""","Evernote's CEO sees his new app as a replacement for address books .

"(CNN) -- A ticker tape parade awaits the New York Giants this week when the team returns home as Super Bowl champions after defeating the New England Patriots 21-17 on a last-minute touchdown. The Super Bowl victory Sunday night was the fourth for the Giants; the team defeated the Patriots 17-14 in the 2008 title game. New England fans who had hoped their team would avenge the 2008 loss were left crestfallen. But for Giants supporters, the celebration was just beginning. Early Monday, the Empire State Building was bathed in Giants blue. Later in the day, New York City will conduct a public giveaway for 250 winners for a post-parade ceremony on Tuesday at City Hall Plaza where the team will be given keys to the city. ""After nearly missing the playoffs, the Giants have made history by becoming the first NFL team to win the Super Bowl after going 9-7 in the regular season,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said after the Sunday night win. ""I look forward to celebrating this victory with all New Yorkers."" Clutching the championship trophy, Giants quarterback Eli Manning, the MVP award winner, said ""I just stayed positive"" during the seesaw struggle. Assisted by crucial late receptions by Mario Manningham, Manning marched the Giants down the field in the closing minutes of the game. The go-ahead touchdown was scored by running back Ahmad Bradshaw from 6 yards out with 52 seconds remaining. But the Patriots and Tom Brady, who was vying for his fourth championship ring, weren't quite done. They moved the ball, but had only enough time for a ""Hail Mary"" pass that bounced away from receivers in the end zone. After trailing the Patriots 17-9 early in the third quarter, the Giants put up the last 12 points of the game to win 21-17. In the final three minutes of the game, Twitter saw an average of 10,000 tweets per second, the company said. An estimated 111 million U.S. TV viewers were expected to tune in to the game. Exact figures were not available early Monday morning. As in years past, many watched as much for the ads and the halftime show as for the game itself. Halftime entertainer Madonna provided an eclectic set, morphing from a Roman Empire theme to a high school cheerleader, complete with pom poms and a marching band. She led a collection of performers through a medley that included ""Vogue,"" ""Music,"" ""Like a Prayer"" and ""Give Me All Your Luvin.'"" But it was a guest performance by artist M.I.A. that generated most of the show's buzz. She gave network cameras a middle finger salute, while rapping ""I don't give a sh*t."" The apologies from the NFL and the broadcaster, NBC, came quickly -- they blamed each other. ""There was a failure in NBC's delay system,"" said Brian McCarty, the league's vice president of communications. ""The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans."" ""The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show,"" NBC said. ""Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers."" The episode was reminiscent of the 2004 Super Bowl when singer Janet Jackson's nipple was briefly exposed during a performance with singer Justin Timberlake. The American president who saved football . A bevy of celebrities, including Jerry Seinfeld, Clint Eastwood and Elton John, showed up in commercials during this year's broadcast. David Beckham provided eye candy in an H&M underwear ad, which tended to spend more time on his chiseled and tattooed looks than the briefs he was wearing. Another commercial featured a slimmed-down dog chasing after a Volkswagen Beetle. The ads went for a record $3.5 million per 30-second spot. Pop singer Kelly Clarkson started off the festivities with a rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" managing to get through the lyrics without a hitch, unlike Christina Aguilera, who caught flak after botching the words at last year's game. What does Indianapolis have to offer? The city itself strove to prove it could be a major player. It kept one key goal in mind. ""I honestly think the best report would be people saying, 'The game was great and -- oh yeah, by the way, Indianapolis was really nice. I had a really good time,' "" said Tom Griswold, longtime co-host of the Indy-based syndicated radio program ""The Bob & Tom Show."" CNN's Thom Patterson and Dan Moriarty and HLN's Jonathan Anker contributed to this report.","The Empire State Building is bathed in Giants blue .

"London (CNN) -- Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, the son of Libya's deposed leader Moammar Gadhafi, could go on trial ""within weeks or months,"" the country's interior minister said Sunday. The investigations into the death of Moammar Gadhafi after his capture last year could also be completed soon, Fawzy Abdilal said. Saif al-Islam's case will be handed to the courts as soon as the prosecutor general completes his investigations, Abdilal told CNN in an exclusive interview. Separately, military trials of those who ""committed criminal acts under the Gadhafi regime"" began Sunday in the city of Benghazi, National Transitional Council member Mohammed El Sayah said. He did not name those who were being tried, but said ""even civilians who had guns and fought under the Gadhafi regime"" would be tried before military courts. Trials elsewhere in the country will start later, he said. Benghazi was the center of resistance to the Gadhafi regime last year. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, once his father's heir apparent, was captured in November and has been held in the Libyan city of Zintan since then. Human Rights Watch said after visiting Saif al-Islam in custody last year that he should have a lawyer, but Abdilal implied he had not asked for one. ""He may have a lawyer if he asks for a lawyer,"" the interior minister said. ""Should Saif demand a lawyer, then a lawyer would be provided."" He also brushed aside accusations that authorities are torturing detainees under the new government. There are ""not systematic violations as there were under the Gadhafi regime,"" he said, even as he conceded that ""there may be cases of individuals who take the law into their own hands."" ""There is no comparison whatsoever between the situation prevailing under Moammar Gadhafi and the situation now,"" he said. Moammar Gadhafi was killed in October, two months after he was deposed by rebel fighters. Abdilal said the circumstances of his death were complicated. ""It was a battlefield, he was carrying weapons, there were fighters around, no one was controlling those fighters,"" Abdilal said. And, he said, ""Many people claim that they are the ones who killed Gadhafi, and that is complicating matters."" Abdilal acknowledged that the interim government had not yet succeeded in integrating militias from different cities into a national security force, saying his visit to Britain was partly to seek help with that task. Fighters from Zintan still control the international airport, he said, adding that he expected them to hand control over to the Ministry of the Interior ""within two weeks.""

"(CNN) -- The Chinese government has barred the country's airlines from complying with a European Union charge on carbon emissions, escalating a dispute that officials have warned could turn into a trade war. Chinese airlines had previously said they would not pay the EU carbon tax, but the formal prohibition by the State Council, or cabinet, puts Beijing in direct opposition to Brussels. The announcement, published on Monday by Xinhua, the official news agency, comes a week before Chinese and European leaders are to meet at a summit and just days after Wen Jiabao, China's premier, said Beijing was looking to provide more financial support to help Europe out of its debt mess. The Civil Aviation Administration of China has notified all Chinese airlines that, without government approval, they cannot join the EU emissions trading scheme or charge customers extra because of it, Xinhua said. The impact on Chinese airlines with routes to Europe was unclear. Although the EU's carbon scheme went into effect for airlines on January 1, Brussels has not started charging them yet. But all airlines using EU airports have been brought into the scheme. Those that do not comply face fines while persistent offenders could be banned from EU airports. ""China hopes that Europe will directly address our concerns, in light of the overall situation of global climate change, the sustainable development of international aviation and Chinese-European relations,"" the Chinese aviation authority said. It also said the EU should adopt a ""practical and constructive attitude"" to come up with a solution that would be acceptable to both sides. It added what appeared to be a veiled threat: ""China will consider additional measures to protect the interests of our citizens and our companies"". The China Air Transport Association, an industry group, said last year that Beijing might sue the EU over its carbon plan. But the prospect of a legal battle dimmed after the European Court of Justice ruled against a challenge brought by US airlines, saying the carbon trading scheme did not infringe on the sovereignty of other nations. Although the aviation industry only accounts for about 3 per cent of global carbon emissions, its share is growing quickly and the EU believes its carbon trading scheme is an important part of the fight against climate change. Chinese state media have called it a ""trade barrier in the name of environmental protection"" and the foreign ministry has upbraided the EU for its ""unilateral"" imposition of the carbon scheme. When German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Beijing last week, Premier Wen said China might contribute more to rescue funds that are aimed at resolving the European debt crisis. Premier Wen is scheduled to meet JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, European Commission president, and other European leaders at a bilateral business summit next week in Beijing.","The Chinese government has barred the country's airlines from complying with a European Union charge .

"(CNN) -- Did you hear that? It's a door busting open in Washington, unblocking a huge backlog of airline issues that will directly affect America's millions of air travelers. For the first time since 2007, after 23 extensions, Congress has finally passed a long-term funding bill for the FAA. It costs $63 billion and will last through 2015. President Obama is expected to sign it into law. For the millions who fly commercial airlines yearly in the United States, here are five reasons why you should care: . 1. Airline tarmac delay rules to be the law of the land . Many of the tarmac delay rules for commercial airlines -- like reporting flight delays and cancellations and providing passengers with adequate food, water and ventilation in planes stuck on the tarmac -- will be more than just rules. They'll be the law of the land, backed with the full enforcement and authority of the federal government. Somehow, not included in the legislation is the three-hour limit on the amount of time planes can remain on the tarmac before they must return to the gate. It's still a regulation. ""There's a concern it might lead to more flight cancellations or delays, so it may need more study before it becomes law,"" said Charlie Leocha of the nonprofit Consumer Travel Alliance. Consumer advocate group FlyersRights.org blames the exclusion on politics. ""House Republicans, in the end, sided with their friends the airlines by forcing removal of the [three-hour tarmac delay limit] in the newly codified law for airline passengers, with total disregard for what's best for the flying public,"" wrote executive director Kate Hanni in an email to CNN. 2. Investigation into cell phone use on planes . Is there really a good reason why we can't use our phones on planes? The arguments have long raged on both sides. The new law requires a government study within 120 days to look into the issues surrounding aircraft cell phone use. Speaking of studies: Would airlines lose or damage fewer bags if they had to pay for them? The law orders a study, due in 180 days, to find out. 3. Better information about child safety seats, insecticides . Traveling with small children and their safety seats may be a little easier. The new law requires airlines to post on their websites the maximum dimensions of child safety seats that can be used aboard their aircraft. Also, the Department of Transportation must post online a list of countries that force airlines to spray cabins with insecticide. 4. Better access to the halls of power . Airline travelers who feel powerless against the system may like the DOT advisory board created under the new law. The Advisory Committee for Aviation Consumer Protection will include appointed officials from airports, airlines, the government and a member specifically to represent consumers. Also, the law creates a DOT phone line and website for consumers to lodge complaints. 5. High tech air traffic control systems . The legislation clears the way for the FAA's highly anticipated satellite-based air traffic control system, which promises to make air travel more efficient, less air-polluting and less time-consuming. That system, part of a massive air-traffic overhaul called NextGen, is expected to be put into place about 2020. Other stuff: . -- Federal subsidies for rural airports . The bill trims the embattled $200 million Essential Air Service airport subsidies program, which opponents say is a waste of money. Small rural airports that handle fewer than 10 daily passengers and are less than 175 miles from a major hub airport will no longer qualify for federal operating subsidies. Alaska and Hawaii are exempt from the cuts. -- Smoking . Fourteen years after smoking was banned on domestic flights for U.S. commercial airlines, the law shuts the door on the last bastion for mile-high smokers. Lighting up will no longer be allowed aboard any charter aircraft or other for-profit flights, foreign or domestic, says Leocha. -- Special exemptions for military . The law includes a message to the airlines called a Sense of Congress that nudges industry leaders to consider offering special travel exemptions for military members. Congress is hinting that airlines should cut troops a break on airline rules surrounding luggage and traveling family members. Overall, says Leocha, the new FAA law could end up saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars -- perhaps billions -- ""if only for the ability to plan ahead and coordinate projects in the future.""","New FAA bill, expected to become law, offers consumer protections and information .
Tarmac delay rules now become law, but three-hour delay regulation is not included .
$63 billion bill creates aviation consumer protection committee .
Studies will look at cell phone use aboard aircraft and compensation for lost bags ."
"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's High Court ordered the immediate release Tuesday of six former army officers accused of plotting to topple President Robert Mugabe. The alleged coup plotters have been in prison since 2007, despite several attempts by their lawyers to have them released. Treason carries a death sentence in Zimbabwe. After reading a seven-page ruling, Justice Yunus Omerjee said it was apparent that the defendants should not have been commuted to custody and he said a declaratory order will be issued to that effect. Justice Joseph Musakwa concurred. In July, the High Court dismissed the case because the alleged coup plotters had not been brought to court for trial within six months, as required by law. State prosecutors responded by re-indicting them. The defendants appealed to the High Court to throw out the re-indictment. The man accused of being the ringleader of the alleged coup plot, Albert Matapo, was arrested in 2007, as were six other suspects: Nyasha Zivuku, Oncemore Mazivahona, Emmanuel Marara, Patson Mupfure, Shingirai Mutemachani and Rangarirai Maziofa. They were accused of plotting to violently topple Mugabe and replace him with the country's defense minister, Emerson Mnangagwa. The suspects denied the allegations against them, and one was later released. Their attorneys said if the state wished to pursue the matter, their clients would not be detained. It was not immediately clear what action the state would take.","The men were accused of planning a coup in 2007 .

"(RealSimple.com) -- Save on Entertaining . Tips from an anonymous caterer . Besides asking friends for recommendations, the best way to find a caterer is to go to a cooking store, like Williams-Sonoma or Sur La Table, and speak to the employees running the demonstrations. Many of them do catering gigs as well, for less than standard local rates. An independent caterer will often be more wallet-friendly than a large company, which can have high minimum requirements (as much as $2,500 per event) and more operating costs, like paying full-time staffers. In contrast, independents are usually amenable to negotiation. So ask for a 10 to 20 percent break, or see if they'll toss in a few more appetizers or another entrÃ©e for the same dollar amount. RealSimple.com: Your guide to saving money . If you're having a dinner party, opt for a buffet. Sit-down dinners are more labor-intensive and therefore expensive, as they usually involve multiple courses and preplating. Or host a brunch -- it's up to 40 percent cheaper than dinner, since foods like French toast and crepes are generally low-cost. Or think about throwing a party where you serve just appetizer-type bites and sweets. You'll save at least 30 percent on the overall bill by skipping the entrÃ©e altogether (and your guests will be just as happy). Save on Flowers . Tips from an anonymous florist . Stretch your holiday budget with arrangements that contain greens, like fir, pine, and juniper. They're wonderfully aromatic and seasonally appropriate, and they can be half the cost of fresh flowers, since the trees grow in most states and are therefore readily available. Plus, they will probably last around three weeks or more, compared with flowers, which wilt after five to seven days. If you want to include flowers, skip red and white ones (roses and lilies, for example) -- you might pay 30 percent more in December because those are popular holiday colors. If you have your heart set on white flowers, gardenias make attractive holiday decorations. A single stem can run about $10, so buy the entire plant, which could have 10 to 12 blooms, from a nursery for around $25. If you're feeling crafty, head to a nursery that sells Christmas trees. You might score free greenery, because many nurseries cut off the bottoms to reduce the trees' size. The leftover pieces can be ideal for making wreaths, centerpieces, or door decorations. RealSimple.com: Spend money to save money . Save on a Tree . Tips from an anonymous Christmas-tree seller . Yes, you may be in a hurry to start decorating your Douglas fir, but don't forget to negotiate a good price first. You might save 30 to 40 percent, especially if it's the day before Christmas and a lot of stock remains. (Be sure to ask when the last shipment came in, so you get a fresh tree. If it arrived before December 10, that evergreen might not make it through New Year's.) Don't be afraid to ask the seller, ""Can you do better?"" It's all about how nicely you ask. If you sound stubborn and inflexible, many merchants will say no -- and may even mark up the price another 10 percent (prices can change, since they aren't always posted). So keep your Christmas spirit alive and you'll be more likely to bring home a bargain. RealSimple.com: How to save $5,000 this year . Save on Wine . Tips from an anonymous sommelier . People tend to stock up on wine and spirits at the closest store, but that place may not have the best deals. Go to wine-searcher.com (an inventory database of several thousand stores nationwide) and enter the vintage or the wine's name and your ZIP code to find the cheapest retailer in your area. Or fill your ""cellar"" with wines from affordable online retailers, like Zachys.com and Winelibrary.com. Both have a huge inventory and e-mail specials to customers on a weekly basis; you may be able to get discounts of up to 40 percent off or free shipping. Also consider buying bottles from somewhat less prestigious wine-growing regions, such as Oregon; Santa Barbara, California; and France's Loire Valley. These wines are priced up to 50 percent less than their more famous counterparts. A high-quality Bordeaux, for example, costs between $20 and $50, whereas a comparable bottle from the Loire Valley might cost as little as $10. RealSimple.com: How to live on less . Save on Mailing Gifts . Tips from an anonymous shipping-company representative . Shipping rates are often determined by three factors: a package's size, weight, and destination. So if you can fit something into a small box, you could spend less. Use a small to midsize flat-rate U.S. Postal Service priority box ($5.20 to $11) to send compact, heavy items (up to 70 pounds). To keep any shipment as light as possible, use inexpensive packing peanuts or popcorn for cushioning instead of paper, since they're almost weightless.

Also, if you're sending a box from one destination to another that's reasonably close -- say, from Long Island, New York, to Scotch Plains, New Jersey -- during the final week before Christmas, you may not have to send it next-day delivery to have it arrive quickly.

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's parliament has ratified a 20-year $98 million loan from China to build a defense college, despite objections from members of Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's party that the poverty-stricken country should prioritize the spending in other ways. Zimbabwe's upper and lower houses of parliament passed the deal late Tuesday after heated debate. Shepherd Mushonga, a member of parliament from Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change party, said he was surprised that Chinese companies including Anjin Investments Private Limited -- which has interests in diamonds - had been contracted to construct the college that is being built about 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Harare. ""We are talking of a law which says 51% of any business transaction must be for Zimbabweans, but in this deal Chinese have become Zimbabweans,"" said Mushonga in an interview Wednesday, repeating what he had said when opposing the passing of the loan facility in parliament the previous day. Other members of parliament said the country needed to first address the ailing economy before constructing the college. Zimbabwe's minister of defense, Emmerson Mnangagwa, told parliament that the college would offer ""specialized military training and learning of security issues"" taught by senior officials in defense forces and civilians both in the country and from abroad. China has become a close ally of Zimbabwe, standing by it while the West ostracizes President Robert Mugabe for the long-term leader's poor human rights record. In 2008, China vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution seeking sanctions against Zimbabwe. Chinese companies have made inroads in Zimbabwe especially in construction industry. Earlier this year, the visiting Chinese vice premier, Wang Qishan, signed about $700 million in loan agreements with Zimbabwe. The loan was the biggest international deal in years for Zimbabwe, which continues to be shunned by the West for its failure to service its external debt which is about $7 billion.","The money will go to building a defense college .

"Washington (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of hurried passengers trying to check in at some of the busiest U.S. airports could soon find themselves in the fast lane. The Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration are expanding their expedited screening initiative known as PreCheck to 28 additional airports this year, it was announced Wednesday. Seven airports across the country have already started the procedures, which allow travelers a faster screening process if they volunteer information about themselves prior to flying. In making the announcement at a news conference at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Homeland Security officials said PreCheck will enable TSA to focus its efforts on passengers the agency knows less about in a more risk-based approach to screening. If the TSA determines a passenger is eligible for expedited screening, ""information will be embedded in the barcode of the passenger's boarding pass,"" according to the department. Passengers who qualify may only rarely have to remove their shoes, jackets and belts, and extract laptops or liquids from bags. ""Good, thoughtful, sensible security by its very nature facilitates lawful travel and legitimate commerce,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. ""The expansion of TSA PreCheck to the nation's busiest airports will increase our security capabilities and expedite the screening process for travelers we consider our trusted partners."" The ""trusted traveler"" program won't guarantee expedited security screening, officials say. Participants will still be subject to random and unpredictable security measures. PreCheck will be implemented at the busiest U.S. airports throughout the year including, Baltimore/Washington, Boston Logan, Charlotte Douglas, Cincinnati, Denver, Fort Lauderdale, George Bush, Honolulu, Indianapolis, JFK, LaGuardia, Lambert-St. Louis, Louis Armstrong New Orleans, Luis Munoz Marin, Newark Liberty, O'Hare, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix Sky Harbor, Pittsburgh, Portland, Ronald Reagan Washington National, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Seattle-Tacoma, Tampa, Ted Stevens Anchorage and Washington Dulles. The TSA says it will continue expanding to additional airlines and airports beyond those already announced. Officials say more than 336,000 passengers have already been screened through PreCheck lanes affiliated with American Airlines in Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, Las Vegas and Minneapolis, and with Delta Air Lines in Atlanta, Detroit, Las Vegas and Minneapolis. US Airways, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines will begin operations later this year. ""TSA PreCheck moves us closer to our goal of delivering the most effective and efficient screening by recognizing that most passengers do not pose a threat to security,"" said TSA Administrator John Pistole in a written statement. ""We are pleased to expand this important effort, in collaboration with our airline and airport partners, as we move away from a one-size-fits-all approach to a more intelligence-driven, risk-based transportation security system.""","The expedited screening initiative PreCheck expands to 28 additional airports this year .

"Charlottesville, Virginia (CNN) -- A man testified Thursday that he saw former University of Virginia lacrosse player George Huguely with his arm around the neck of Huguely's then-girlfriend -- an incident that occurred a few months before she was found beaten to death. Michael Burns' testimony highlighted yet another emotional day in the murder trial of Huguely, which began this week. Huguely was arrested in May 2010 on several charges, including first-degree murder, in the death of Yeardley Love. Both the suspect and the victim played lacrosse on nationally ranked Cavaliers' teams. A lacrosse player himself at the University of North Carolina and a friend of Love's, Burns admitted he'd ""hooked up"" a few times with Love, but denied the two had ever dated. On the stand Thursday, Burns recalled being in an off-campus Charlottesville apartment complex where Huguely lived in February 2010 for a party. While there, he said he heard somebody yelling, ""Help me! Help me!"" When he went into a nearby bedroom, Burns testified that he saw Huguely with his arm around Love's neck. ""George was on his back, and Yeardley was on her back ... trying to pull his arm off of her,"" he testified. Soon after Burns came in, he said that the young woman got free and ran out of the room, while Huguely turned to face the wall. ""She said to me ... 'Thank you so much,'"" Burns said. ""She also said she couldn't breathe. She was hysterically crying."" Several others took the stand to say they'd also seen Love run out of the room, in apparent distress. A couple of days later, Love phoned Burns and told him, ""Everything was OK. George was just being crazy,"" the witness testified. On Wednesday, the first full day with testimony, Huguely's attorney asked the jury to consider only an involuntary manslaughter conviction, saying Love's death was an accident. Huguely has been held for nearly two years. If he's convicted of involuntary manslaughter, the most time he could serve is 10 years. Prosecutors, for their part, said Huguely made an e-mail threat against Love, 22, before her May 2010 death at her residence. Prosecutor Warner D. Chapman read e-mails exchanged between the two after Huguely heard Love had allegedly slept with someone else. The defendant wrote, ""I should have killed you"" and Love responded, ""You should have killed me?"" according to Chapman. Huguely responded that the pair should talk, Chapman said. Chapman also told jurors that Love's death was slow and painful, claiming she could have remained alive for a couple of hours after Huguely left her apartment. The defense also claims Love was alive when Huguely left. Charlottesville Police Detective Lisa Reeves wrote in a sworn statement used to obtain a search warrant in the case that ""George Huguely admitted on May 3, 2010, that he was involved in an altercation with Yeardley Love and, during the course of the altercation, he shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall."" But defense attorney Francis Lawrence said there was no evidence that Love's head hit a wall. A medical examiner ruled that blunt force trauma killed Love, and authorities allege Huguely caused it during the altercation. The trial resumes Friday with a new prosecution witness.","NEW: A man says he heard cries of ""Help me!"" while at a Virginia apartment complex .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Illegal diamond mining by Zimbabwean troops is leading to bloodshed and attacks against civilians, said a global watchdog group formed to cut the flow of so-called ""blood diamonds."" The armed forces also are accused of funneling money from diamond fields to President Robert Mugabe's party. Residents and workers contributed accounts of attacks detailed by the interim findings of the Kimberley Process after a weeklong investigation in Zimbabwe. The probe started days after a Human Rights Watch report accused the nation's armed forces of violently taking over the diamond fields in Marange district and killing about 200 people since last year. Some victims of the clash were buried in mass graves, the report said. Lameck Chiso, 29, said he was stopped at a police checkpoint on his way from work in the diamond fields. ""Three men in army uniform jumped into my car and asked me to drive them back to the mining area,"" Chiso said. They took his money and urged him to praise the ""wonderful job"" the army was doing of restoring order to the Marange diamond area, Chiso added. ""I complied, but they responded by assaulting me with the back of a gun on my back,"" he said. Kimberly Process officials urged the government to demilitarize the diamond fields and investigate the accusations against the military. Tapiwa, 32, who declined to give his last name, said he has scars on his back and head from beatings he got when troops found him in the mining area. Such stories are common, said Georgette Gagnon, director of Human Rights Watch. The organization said more than 100 witnesses, including soldiers and children, were interviewed for its report. ""The police and army have turned this peaceful area into a nightmare of lawlessness and horrific violence,"" Gagnon said. ""Zimbabwe's new government should get the army out of the fields, put a stop to the abuse and prosecute those responsible."" The money from blood diamonds can end up funding rebel violence, the Kimberley Process group said. Separately, Human Rights Watch has accused the armed forces of funneling money from the fields into ZANU-PF, President Robert Mugabe's party. The government decried some aspects of the report, saying the critics were trying to smear the Mugabe's party. ""I can confirm that there has been illegal mining taking place in Zimbabwe, but we seem to be getting on top of the situation now,"" said Kembo Mohadi, Zimbabwe's co-minister of home affairs. The government has not been able to verify allegations of deaths and mass graves, Mohadi said. ""As a responsible government, we have started investigating these reports,"" he said, adding that mining proceeds in the cash-strapped nation are not being distributed to any particular group. ""The money will not be handled by any party but by the Treasury,"" he said.","Probe finds illegal diamond mining by Zimbabwe troops leads to attacks on civilians .

"CNN -- The number of cholera deaths in Zimbabwe is now approaching 3,000, the World Health Organization says. Two men rest in a cholera rehydration tent on the South Africa-Zimbabwe border in December. Latest, WHO statistics show 2,971 deaths since the outbreak began in August, with 56,123 cases reported. The epidemic has swept through a country wracked with political and economic crises. Cholera is an intestinal disease caused by bacteria in contaminated water. The epidemic has been aggravated by erratic water supplies, shortages of water purification chemicals, broken water and sewer pipes and uncollected garbage. On top of that, the waste-disposing system has collapsed. Children can be seen playing on heaps of uncollected garbage in the suburbs of most urban areas in Zimbabwe. Last month, the government led by President Robert Mugabe declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency. The country already was wracked by an enormous economic crisis, with a hyperinflationary economy and shortages of all essentials including food, fuel, cash, foreign currency and electricity. Zimbabwe's rainy season peaks in January or February and ends in late March, and Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa warned the epidemic could get worse during the rainy season.","WHO figures show 56,123 reported cholera cases in Zimbabwe .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Zimbabwe's prime minister believes the driver of the truck that struck his car, killing his wife, deliberately drove toward them, his party told CNN. Morgan Tsvangirai leaves the hospital Saturday after being treated for injuries from a car crash. Members of his political party, the Movement for Democratic Change, and former U.S. diplomat also say the crash raises suspicions of foul play. The prime minister left a hospital Saturday, a day after his wife, Susan, was killed in the collision, officials said. A ball cap covered Tsvangirai's bandaged head. Tsvangirai was taken to a hospital in Gaborone, Botswana, on Saturday for medical treatment, a Botswanan government source and a source with the prime minister's party. ""He's badly bruised and is receiving treatment,"" the Botswanan government source said. The source with the prime minister's party said Tsvangirai will return to Zimbabwe on Wednesday to attend the funeral of his wife. The couple, who were married in 1978, have six children. The crash happened on a two-lane highway between Tsvangirai's hometown, Buhera, and the capital, Harare. It comes only weeks after the start of a power-sharing agreement between Tsvangirai and his political rival, President Robert Mugabe. Tsvangirai's political party said Friday that it was too early to tell whether the crash was anything other than an accident. But on Saturday, MDC members told CNN that Tsvangirai thought the crash was deliberate. Tendai Biti, the MDC secretary-general, speaking during a tearful press conference, said Tsvangirai should have had better security.  Watch how the accident threatens to derail the unity government » . ""If there had been a police escort maybe what happened yesterday could have not have happened,"" Biti said. ""(A) police escort would have warned oncoming vehicles of a VIP arriving. I think authorities must understand the omission. ""We hope that this omission will be rectified, that the prime minister must be given the protection that ought to be accorded to a prime minister."" Biti said the MDC would launch its own investigation. Analysts say the crash raises suspicions of foul play. One former U.S. diplomat called for an outside investigation, saying it was not the first time one of Mugabe's political foes had been killed or injured in a car crash. Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe's main opposition leader, took office last month under a power-sharing deal with Mugabe following a contentious election. The MDC reached the agreement with Mugabe in September after months of angry dispute that included violence. More than 200 deaths, mainly opposition supporters, were reported leading up to and after the election. ""I'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in Zimbabwe involving an opposition figure,"" said Tom McDonald, the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe from 1997 to 2001. ""President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone lo and behold dies -- it's sort of his M.O., of how they get rid of people they don't like.""  Watch more on the fatal crash » . McDonald cited the car crash deaths of Defense Minister Moven Mahachi in 2001, Employment Minister Border Gezi in 1999 and Elliot Manyika, a government minister and former regional governor, last year. ""So when I hear that Tsvangirai was in an accident, it gives me pause,"" McDonald said. Now an attorney with the Washington law firm Baker Hostetler, he urged a full independent investigation. However, he added that traffic accidents are common in Zimbabwe. The highway Tsvangirai was traveling on was only two lanes and tractor-trailers were common, McDonald said. Vehicles in the country were often in bad shape and drivers inexperienced. ""It's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things,"" he said. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report.","NEW: Morgan Tsvangirai in Botswana for medical treatment on Saturday .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- The ""humanitarian situation remains serious"" in Zimbabwe amid cholera, starvation and a continuing economic crisis, a United Nations official said Wednesday at a World Humanitarian Day ceremony in Harare. The cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe resulted in nearly 100,000 cases, 4,288 of them fatal, the U.N. said. ""Although Zimbabwe is not facing armed conflict, humanitarian threats such as food shortages and outbreak of diseases such as cholera pose a significant challenge,"" said Agostinho Zacarias, U.N. Development Programme representative in the country. ""The recent [cholera] epidemic resulted in 98,592 cumulative cases, including 4,288 deaths between August 2008 and July 2009."" Cholera  thrives in areas without clean water and proper sanitation, and the United Nations has said 6 million people in Zimbabwe -- more than half the population -- have limited or no access to safe water and sanitation in rural and urban areas. It also estimates more than 5 million in the nation face starvation. Although the cholera epidemic was declared under control last month, a renewed outbreak is likely, international health officials have said. Zimbabwe's humanitarian situation was worsened by its economic collapse last year. The nation's coalition government, formed six months ago by former political enemies President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, is seeking more than $8 billion to aid its recovery. A U.N. appeal launched earlier this year has so far raised only 44 percent of its goal of $718 million for humanitarian assistance. But Rueben Marumahoko, a Zimbabwe junior minister and an appointee of Mugabe, said the country is no longer in crisis. ""There is need for Zimbabwe to move from the humanitarian support stage to the recovery stage,"" he said. ""Zimbabwe is no longer a country in crisis but a country in recovery."" The comment drew laughter from many journalists covering the event. Among the nation's problems is a strike by doctors that is almost a month old. The doctors are demanding housing and car allowances and a monthly salary of $1,000 [U.S.] -- a sharp rise from the current $170 a month paid to all public servants. Nurses joined the strike this week, saying that doctors have a genuine case that needs urgent attention. The action is threatening the country's ability to deal with H1N1 influenza, also known as swine flu, and to prepare for the possible resurgence of the cholera epidemic.","U.N.: More than 5 million Zimbabweans face starvation .

"(CNN) -- A blizzard that roared through much of the southern Rockies and central Plains tapered off Wednesday, but several states were still expected to deal with heavy snow. Winter weather watches, warnings and advisories were in effect Wednesday for much of the West, according to the National Weather Service. The higher elevations of the Rocky Mountains were expected to get hit the hardest, with some likely to be coated with up to 15 inches of snow in the coming days. Other areas could get eight inches, the weather service said. The storm could make travel on some roads ""very hazardous or impossible,"" the weather service warned. Are you there? Tell us about it . This was the case on some roads Tuesday as blizzard warnings stretched from southeast Colorado through western Kansas, the Oklahoma panhandle and far northern Texas. Interstates and highways were shut down Monday night as at least five states contended with heavy snow, fierce winds and ice. New Mexico State Police shut down Interstate 40, a major east-west artery from Albuquerque to the Texas state line, saying there was zero visibility because of blowing snow. Interstate 25 was shut down from just north of Albuquerque to the Colorado state line because of the blizzard conditions, which included snow-packed and icy roads. One of the many stalled by the storm Tuesday was Linda Martinez, who had planned to take the interstate into New Mexico with her husband and daughter, according to CNN affiliate KXRM. Instead, she was stuck in her car at a gas station in Colorado City staring at the heavy snow gusts. ""We've traveled in storms like this before, but looking at it now, I don't want to chance it,"" Martinez said.

"(CNN) -- Germany is expelling four members of the Syrian Embassy, citing the arrest this week of two men suspected of spying on Syrian opposition groups in Germany, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement released Thursday. ""After the arrest of two persons suspected of spying for Syria, I have ordered the expulsion of four members of the Syrian Embassy in Berlin,"" Westerwelle said. The Syrian ambassador was called to the Foreign Office on Monday where the ""German government made clear its position to not accept actions against Syrian members of the opposition in Germany,"" according to the statement. The expulsion comes at a critical time for the Syrian government, which is under fire for a brutal crackdown on anti-government demonstrators calling for the end of the regime. Earlier this week, the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (the GCC), a politically and economically aligned group of countries bordering the Persian Gulf, announced it would expel their Syrian ambassadors and withdraw its Gulf State envoys from Syria. Tunisia also announced plans to expel the Syrian ambassador from Tunis in response to the recent killings in Homs, Syria's third-largest city that has become a flashpoint in the 11-month long uprising. In Germany, federal prosecutors announced the arrests of Mahmoud El A., a 47-year-old with German and Lebanese citizenship; and Akram O., a 34-year-old Syrian, who they accused of having ""systematically gathered information on Syrian opposition groups in the Federal Republic of Germany for years."" Acting on arrest warrants issued January 31, some 70 federal and state police officers also searched the apartment of six other suspects, prosecutors said. The Berlin Prosecutors' Office denied any connection between the suspects arrested Tuesday and those involved in an attack on the Syrian opposition activist and Green Party politician Ferhad Ahma in Berlin last December. The Syrian government has been accused of seeking retribution against relatives of Syrian activists working against the al-Assad regime from abroad. The U.S. State Department announced last year that it had received reports that Syrian mission personnel had been conducting video surveillance of people participating in peaceful demonstrations in the United States. Other Syrian activists living abroad have also declined to be named or appear on camera for fear of reprisals against their families at home. In August, a rebel military leader living in exile in Turkey disappeared from a refugee camp and reappeared days later in Syrian government custody. Evidence also suggested that the government carried out reprisal attacks against the man's family.

"(CNN) -- The Indiana Department of Labor on Wednesday announced penalties totaling $80,800 following a worker-safety investigation into a stage collapse last summer that fatally injured seven people and injured dozens of others before a scheduled concert at the Indiana State Fair. The largest fines -- totaling $63,000 for what the agency said were three ""knowing violations"" -- were levied on Mid-America Sound Corp., which built the stage structure and leased it to the fair. Metal scaffolding supporting the stage lights fell onto a crowd of fans and workers as a storm swept through the Indianapolis fairgrounds on August 13, 2011, right before country music group Sugarland was to perform. Mid-America Sound, based in Greenfield, Indiana, was cited for ""failure to develop and implement an Operations Management Plan, the failure to develop a risk assessment plan, failure to maintain and use current engineering calculations and documentation, and failure to provide appropriate, qualified supervision,"" the labor department said. The company strongly disputed those findings in a statement to CNN Wednesday night. The citations come as the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration (IOSHA) released the findings of a six-month investigation focusing specifically on employee safety standards. Two workers were among the people killed. Labor Department Commissioner Lori A. Torres said the citations of Mid-America Sound indicated ""the most serious safety violation."" ""The evidence demonstrated that the Mid-America Sound Corporation was aware of the appropriate requirements and demonstrated a plain indifference to complying with those requirements,"" Torres said during a morning news briefing at the state capitol in Indianapolis. Also, the Indiana State Fair Commission was cited for failing to evaluate and assess ""all conditions and the related appropriate safety measures"" at the fair's concert venues. The ""serious violation"" resulted in a $6,300 penalty. And the local chapter of the stagehands union (IATSE) and Theatrical Payroll Services Inc. were cited for four violations and fined $11,500 for failing to make sure the load-bearing roof was properly secured. State Fair Commission Chairman Andre Lacy issued a statement Wednesday saying the organization has created a new position of emergency management officer ""to assist with improving emergency action plans, and completed emergency evacuation training for all employees."" He also noted that two independent investigations are ongoing ""regarding the structural collapse and decision-making analysis."" ""Our hearts continue to go out to the victims and families of those whose lives were forever impacted by the events of Aug. 13,"" Lacy said in the statement. ""We also appreciate the due diligence of the Indiana Department of Labor in compiling its report."" An attorney for the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees told CNN Indianapolis affiliate WTHR that the state fair was making ""scapegoats"" of the stagehands union. ""(This is) an attempt to deflect attention away from themselves,"" WTHR quoted attorney Bill Groth as saying. ""The State Fair Commission and State Fair personnel are ultimately responsible here. And they're looking for scapegoats and we happen to be first in line."" Byra Borshoff Cook, a spokesperson for Mid-America Sound, said the company disagrees with the investigation's findings ""and strongly object to their classification as knowing violations."" ""Mid-America Sound was consistent and clear with the Indiana State Fair Commission about the limitations of the temporary roof structure in high winds or severe inclement weather,"" she said in an e-mailed statement. ""Each year for nearly a decade, we warned the Commission, in writing, that 'The roof or top shall not be used in high winds and or severe inclement weather. High winds meaning 25 MPH and above,'"" Cook said, quoting a clause highlighted on a ""conditions of contract"" page that also was attached to the e-mail sent to CNN. ""In the case of the structure used for the Sugarland concert, the threshold was 40 mph for evacuation,"" Cook's e-mail stated. ""On the evening of the incident one of our employees reconfirmed with State Fair leadership that if there was lightning or wind speeds of 40 mph or more, the area should be evacuated. ""Despite these warnings, the Indiana State Fair Commission, who controlled the venue, and Sugarland, who controlled the concert, refused to postpone the concert and failed to implement an evacuation plan away from the temporary roof structure."" The National Weather Service estimated winds of 60-70 mph were raking the area when the incident occurred. Forecasters had warned that heavy rain and strong winds would hit the fair nearly two hours before the storm moved through. Video shows the blue canvas top fraying and flapping just seconds before the steel scaffolding gave way and fell onto the ""Sugarpit,"" a section usually occupied by Sugarland's most ardent fans. Authorities had gone onstage just four minutes earlier to warn the crowd to seek shelter, according to a timeline of events released by investigators the day after the accident. Sugarland, the Atlanta-based duo of Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, escaped injury since they had not yet come onstage. They later posted a message on Twitter saying they were ""stunned and heartbroken for the fans."" In November, the families of four people who were killed filed a lawsuit against Sugarland, contending it was the performers' responsibility to decide whether the show would go on and that they had ""ultimate control over the lighting"" that fell on many of the victims. Sugarland's representative has said the group would offer no comment about the lawsuit.

"(CNN) -- Zambia will face pre-tournament favorites Ivory Coast in Sunday's final of the Africa Cup of Nations after both countries won their semifinals 1-0 on Wednesday. Substitute Emmanuel Mayuka scored the only goal 12 minutes from time as Zambia shocked another one of the title favorites, Ghana. Meanwhile, a superb individual goal from Arsenal striker Gervinho proved enough for Ivory Coast to see off Mali in Gabon's capital Libreville. World Cup quarterfinalists Ghana, who lost to Egypt in the 2010 African final, squandered a host of chances, missed a penalty and had a player sent off in Bata, Equatorial Guinea. And the Black Stars were made to pay for not taking advantage of their superiority when 20-year-old striker Mayuka fired home from outside the penalty area. Four-times champions Ghana started the match strongly and should have taken an eighth minute lead when Davies Nkausu fouled Kwadwo Asamoah in the area. But Asamoah Gyan wasted the resulting penalty when his poorly-struck spot-kick was pushed away by goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene. Soon afterwards, Gyan shot straight at Mweene after being put through by Andre Ayew, whose younger brother Jordan also fluffed a great chance to score. Ghana continued to have the majority of the possession after the break, but Mayuka's superb strike gave Zambia a lead they held onto. Ghana's woes were compounded by the dismissal of Derek Boateng with seven minutes left for a second bookable offense. A contender for the goal of the competition from Arsenal striker Gervinho against Mali put Ivory Coast into the final for the first time since losing to Egypt in 2006. Picking the ball up on the halfway line, Gervinho left a host of Mali players in his wake as he sprinted down the left wing before firing a shot past goalkeeper Soumaila Diakite into the far corner of the net. Looking to avoid the same fate as Ghana earlier in the day, the Elephants nearly took a fifth-minute lead when Didier Drogba's shot struck the crossbar. And, just seven minutes later, African player of the year Yaya Toure also struck the bar after being set up by Drogba's Chelsea clubmate Salomon Kalou. Moustapha Yattabare had Mali's best chance in the 72nd minute, but his attempt from the right narrowly whistled over the crossbar.","Zambia stun favorites Ghana 1-0 to reach the final of the Africa Cup of Nations .

"(CNN) -- The diplomatic fallout over this week's attack on Britain's Embassy in Iran deepened Saturday as France temporarily reduced its embassy staff and Italy's ambassador Iran was summoned home. A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said the reduction is for ""security reasons."" ""Some of their diplomatic staff and their families will leave Iran and return to France,"" said the spokesman, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. He couldn't say how many people are leaving, when they are departing and for how long. Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi received Italy's envoy to Tehran in Rome after he was recalled for consultations, said Italian Foreign Affairs spokesman Maurizio Massari. The ambassador, Alberto Bradanini, will not return to Tehran until Italy has received assurances on the protection of its diplomatic mission. ""There has been no decision to close the embassy,"" Massari told CNN. ""We have received some assurances from the Iranian ambassador to Rome, but we would like to get more full guarantees of the security and protection of our diplomatic mission according to international law before sending our ambassador back to Tehran."" The spokesman went on to say that Italian officials are ""staying in close contact with our European partners and allies."" Meanwhile, 25 Iranian diplomats and embassy employees arrived in Tehran Saturday morning after Iran was ordered to close its embassy in London, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency, the country's official news agency. The group was greeted by a crowd of university students at Tehran's Mehrabad airport, the agency reported. Relations between the nations have been strained in recent days after the United Kingdom levied new sanctions against Iran. The sanctions were announced in late November and mandated that British credit and financial institutions end their business relationships and transactions with all Iranian banks, their branches and subsidiaries. The move came after an International Atomic Energy Agency report highlighted new concerns about Iran's allege moves towards producing a nuclear weapon. The sanctions prompted protests in Iran and the attack on the British embassy in Tehran on Tuesday. British authorities responded on Wednesday, by closing Iran's embassy in London and ordering Iranian diplomats to leave the country. One senior ayatollah said protesters ""must not act above the law."" IRNA quoted Ayatollah Naser Makarem-Shirazi as saying that ""sometimes some of our dear young people become emotional and do things that gives an excuse to to our enemies and we have to pay a great price."" He urged young people not to ""take any action without the permission of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei.""

"(CNN) -- If there's one thing Quincy Jones can't stand, it's people without a sense of history. Music producer and composer Quincy Jones says he wants to encourage arts education in the United States. Particularly musical history. ""I was in Seattle about a month ago, and I asked a kid [at a local high school], 'What do you think about Louis Armstrong?' And he said, 'I've heard the name,' "" Jones says in a phone interview from Washington, D.C. ""I said, 'What do you think about Duke Ellington and Charlie Parker and Coltrane?' He said, 'I've never heard of them.' ""And that hurts me a lot. Because it's easier to get where you're going if you know where you came from."" Jones, who was in Washington to accept yet another honor in a life that's been filled with accolades -- in this case, an Inspire Award from AARP The Magazine for his work as a poverty fighter -- knows exactly how he got to be where he is. The producer, composer, arranger and music industry eminence grise has made versatility and hard work his life's guiding principles. When he was 14, Jones met a 16-year-old Ray Charles. By the time Jones was 18, he was playing in Lionel Hampton's band. He produced Lesley Gore's hit records, including ""It's My Party,"" and arranged for Count Basie and Frank Sinatra. He was nominated for an Oscar for his ""In Cold Blood"" score (one of seven Academy Award nominations), wrote music for ""Roots"" and then produced Michael Jackson's ""Off the Wall,"" ""Thriller"" and ""Bad."" All this and charitable work through his Quincy Jones Foundation. Even today, at 75, he has a number of projects brewing, including a miniseries on Armstrong, a film on Brazil's Carnival, a Tony Bennett-Stevie Wonder duets album and an entry in Las Vegas, Nevada's restaurant business. One look through Jones' new book, ""The Complete Quincy Jones: My Journey & Passions"" (Insight Editions), shows how Q -- the nickname Sinatra gave him -- found his way.  See some of the season's other great coffee-table books » . The book, which arrives seven years after Jones' revealing autobiography, is practically a Q scrapbook. There's a photo of Jones recording Dinah Washington; a copy of the lead sheet of ""We Are the World""; a map of Jones' exhausting trip through Europe in 1960, a tour that left him almost $150,000 in debt. The material is richly packaged and cleverly designed, with some in the form of replicas of record covers and correspondence. Ironically, given his sense of history, it wasn't Jones who saved this treasure-trove. He gives credit to his brother and sister-in-law, who ""saved everything."" ""I used to write a log every day when I was starving to death in New York in the early '50s -- every little arrangement, because we were surviving on that,"" he says. ""They had all of that material. I had no idea they saved all that. I move too fast to do all that,"" he laughs. But he remains passionate, particularly about music and history. He has hopes Barack Obama will appoint a secretary of the arts. ""Our music is the most widely imitated music on the planet, and we're the only country without a minister of culture. ... All over the world they understand our music better than we do."" For his part, he's doing the best to pass on his knowledge -- and keep moving. Looking at ""The Complete Quincy Jones,"" he says, was eye-opening. ""It startled me. It still does. [You look at the index], and you say, how did all this happen? ... It's an astounding experience. ""And what's strange about it,"" he adds, ""is I feel like I'm just starting.""","Quincy Jones' new book is coffee-table tome showcasing life, memorabilia .

"(CNN) -- In a year rife with films styled after the classic gritty and morally ambiguous cinema of the 1970s (""Moneyball,"" ""Shame"" and ""The Ides of March""), the best of the lot arrives Friday with Tomas Alfredson's brilliant ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy."" Adapted from John Le Carré's 1974 novel of the same name, the film is an exceptional treat for those who like to give their brains a little bit of a workout from time to time. The year is 1973: The Cold War is raging around the world, and Britain's security apparatus is split into two branches: MI5 for domestic operations (much like the FBI) and the Secret Intelligence Services, aka MI6 (the CIA equivalent). It's not really that simple, but go with it. Code-named The Circus, MI6 is run by a small group, led by a man known only as ""Control"" (John Hurt). A grizzled Cold War veteran, Control is convinced a Soviet agent is embedded at the top of The Circus, and he has authorized a clandestine operation to convince a Hungarian general with knowledge of the mole to defect. Alas, the mission goes disastrously wrong, and agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) is killed. In the aftermath, Control is hung out to dry and forced to leave the service, taking with him his loyal lieutenant, George Smiley (Gary Oldman). In his involuntary retirement, Control suffers a heart attack and dies. Shortly thereafter, amid increasing evidence that Control's fears were right, Smiley is secretly rehired by the British government and tasked with uncovering the double agent. Control has done some of the work for him and narrowed the suspects down to five men, all nicknamed after characters from a children's nursery rhyme: . Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) is ""Tinker,"" Bill Haydon (Colin Firth) is ""Tailor,"" Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds) is ""Soldier,"" Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) is ""Poor Man"" and Smiley himself is codenamed ""Beggarman."" So distinct are these men that they each might as well have their own adjectives: ""snippy"" Percy (aren't they all?), ""sardonic"" Bill, ""menacing"" Roy and ""unctuous"" Toby. If there were ever to be a remake of ""Casablanca"" (and I should probably be struck dead for even imagining it), Dencik would make an excellent Ugarte (Peter Lorre). Due to the clandestine nature of his task, Smiley is forced to recruit his team from the ranks of junior agents or the recently fired, including Peter Guillam (the always excellent Benedict Cumberbatch from the BBC's ""Sherlock""), who in one ingeniously staged sequence, must steal documents from The Circus. Cumberbatch also has the single most emotionally affecting scene in the film, illustrating the sacrifices the intelligence community must pay in the service of secrecy. As Smiley, Oldman does more with his eyes and subtle facial expressions than most actors do with histrionics and yelling, and he doesn't say a word for what seems like forever at the start of the film. Not only that, he's the perfect example of hiding in plain sight. With a sloppy suit and giant owl-eye glasses, he looks old and worn, almost befuddled. But he's the fox in the chicken house, wearing a chicken disguise, and when he speaks, it's clear that his is by far the brightest bulb in the room, and you ignore him at your peril. Smiley is a master spy in the real-world sense. James Bond is great fun but realistically, you wouldn't want your espionage experts to be dashing, recognizable extroverts. You want them to be the everyday schmuck who's reading the paper across from you on the subway or the random briefcase-toting CPA that lives down the hall. Le Carré was an MI6 officer in the 1960s (real name David John Moore Cornwall), and his books have that air of authenticity detectable by even those who have no such experience themselves. As for the novel, those familiar with it will notice quite a few departures, omissions and location changes from the original (and the big one, an MI6 holiday party, was approved by Le Carré), but for all these differences director Alfredson et al. have nailed the important stuff: They have made a great film with the feel of the source material. There's not a false note in the film. Alfredson (""Let the Right One In"") told the screenwriters (Peter Straughan and his wife, the late Bridget O'Connor) and designers he wanted the film to look and feel ""like the smell of damp tweed,"" and if it's possible to pattern visuals after a smell, Alfredson, cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and the rest of the crew pull it off brilliantly. The flared collars and trousers in various shades of brown, tan and beige scream mid-1970s, and you can practically hear the rustling of the corduroy slacks as they wade through piles of fallen leaves. If I were a betting man, I'd put my money on Oldman joining George Clooney (""The Descendants""), Brad Pitt (""Moneyball""), Jean Dujardin (""The Artist"") and Michael Fassbender (""Shame"") as a best actor nominee. I consider only Clooney, Pitt and Dujardin as locks, but Oldman's performance is the equal of any on this list, and these five could make for the strongest competition in this category for years. For those of you expecting Jason Bourne or James Bond, please adjust your expectations. There is no gadgetry, no Parkour, no sexy villains with silly names and no absurd doomsday devices. There is, however, a meticulously crafted thriller with complex characters, some great vintage Cold War espionage, plot turns you won't see coming and some magnificent acting. ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is rated R. It contains some off-color language, brief nudity and a few short, sharp bursts of violence. It opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles and expands throughout the country this winter.","""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy "" is adapted from John Le Carré's 1974 novel .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Four thousand women are running for office in Iraq's provincial elections Saturday, and many of them will be guaranteed seats under an electoral quota system. Iraqi women show off their ink-stained fingers after voting Saturday in Baghdad. Regardless of the votes their candidates receive, parties are required to give every third seat to a woman,  according to a report this week from the International Crisis Group. The ultimate share of seats held by women will depend on the distribution of votes among parties, the report said. Some women candidates say these elections -- only the second provincial elections since the fall of Saddam Hussein -- are a chance to improve their standing in Iraqi society. Nibras al-Mamuri is a secular female candidate who argues that fundamentalists have taken over the country. She says it was the 2005 elections that brought them into power and tarnished Islam's image in Iraq. Al-Mamuri, who is running for the Baghdad provincial council, says it's time for a change.  Watch how women are trying to bring change to Iraq » . ""Although a woman's role in the Arab world is mainly that of a mother and child bearer,"" she said, ""I want to prove that women are just as capable as men when it comes to challenging arenas."" At first, al-Mamuri said, she thought just participating in the elections as a woman was enough. But now, she says she is running to win in order to defy men who believe a woman's place is in the home. ""I've entered a battlefield where women have to prove they are competent,"" she said. ""I have to forget about fear."" In recent years, Iraqi women have been targeted by extremists for a variety of reasons -- from not covering their hair to entering the political arena. Under Hussein, Iraq was one of the more secular Arab countries, but the 2003 U.S. invasion unleashed extremist militias. Now, many activists say women have been forced back to the Dark Ages, forced to be submissive, anonymous and fully veiled. Al-Mamuri said she believes Saturday's vote can help women improve their position in society. ""An Iraqi woman can be an equal. She can participate in change,"" she told CNN. The image of a woman posing a public and direct challenge to fundamentalists and their beliefs was not seen in the 2005 vote. ""Iraqi women form the core of society,"" said Rissala Khalid, another female candidate in Baghdad. Passing out her campaign card, Khalid told young women that she will fight for their rights, and told young men that she will try to provide jobs for Iraq's largely unemployed youth.

"(CNN) -- The roadside bomb that smashed into Army Sgt. Brian Saaristo's Humvee in northern Iraq two years ago ripped off both legs below the knee. Retired Army Sgt. Brian Saaristo, who lost both legs to a roadside bomb, meets with a doctor in Minnesota. Now he's 45, living in retirement in Minnesota and confronting the rest of his life without the use of his legs. Yet he worries mainly about the thousands of younger U.S. service members who also have been maimed by makeshift bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""Younger ones are taking it harder,"" Saaristo said. ""They feel they don't have the rest of their lives."" Roadside bombs and other homemade explosives have been a deadly staple of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, killing or wounding thousands of U.S. service members and civilians. Such improvised explosives devices -- ""IEDs"" to the military -- are the ""weapon of choice"" for insurgents, U.S. officials say. They're mostly cheap, easy to build and triggered by simple remote control. Protecting U.S. troops from such bombs is a top priority at the Pentagon. It has spent $14 billion in the past four years to fight homemade bombs. It even created an agency for that purpose -- the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization. That agency has had some success, a new report says, but insurgents continue to kill and maim U.S. service members with homemade bombs, in part because the bombs fulfill their purpose and it is easy to acquire the materials used to construct them. The report came from a subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. It followed two years of hearings and study. The number of IED attacks has dropped in Iraq and gone up in Afghanistan, said Irene Smith, a spokeswoman for the IED organization. Yet there are more than 1,400 such attacks a month in Iraq and Afghanistan and an additional 350 elsewhere, a sign that insurgents continue to rely on them. ""We are in a long war, a persistent conflict with a group of insurgents who want to wear down our will so we quit -- the purpose of an IED,"" she said. ""The enemy recognizes IEDs as the weapon of choice."" The IED agency has developed and fielded electronic jammers that prevent the bomb's trigger signal from reaching the explosive, the congressional report said. It also has pursued better vehicle armor. The agency has been developing intelligence, fostering police work, funding surveillance and attacking insurgent networks that produce and set up the bombs. It has been involved in training troops on how to confront and look for the weapon. Yet the report said the group needs to improve the way it measures its performance, because it isn't clear in many cases whether the group's actions or other factors have led to various strides in confronting roadside bombs. The report also said the organization needs to widen its authority to include other agencies that confront roadside bombs, and get better oversight. Smith, the spokeswoman for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, agrees with these conclusions. She said the organization appreciates the opportunity to work with the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, ""to identify and resolve any problem areas in our processes."" She said the cooperation among agencies is crucial. ""Global terrorism will continue to manifest itself through use of IEDs,"" she said.","Number of homemade bomb attacks down in Iraq, up in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Libya is expelling Syria's diplomats because of the escalation of the government's crackdown on its people, Libya's Foreign Ministry announced Thursday. The Syrian charge d'affaires was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Tripoli on Wednesday and told to leave with his staff within 72 hours, ministry spokesman Saad Elshlmani said. ""The reason for this is the position of the Syrian regime towards the Syrian people,"" he explained. ""After this escalation and the Arab League meetings in Cairo and the draft resolution ...

A number of other nations have expelled Syria's ambassadors over the violence. They include Tunisia and the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait.

It appears to have no opposition. Even the United States Olympics Committee thinks the idea is not betting, technically, and wouldn't fly in the face of Olympic rules. ""On the surface, it seems to be a site dedicated to helping charities raise money, which we would obviously have no problem with,"" USOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky said. When Khadevis Robinson agreed to participate, the four-time U.S. running champion who competed at the 2004 Olympic Games spent a long time doing his homework about the organization. ""The more I learned about this idea, it just seemed like a win-win,"" he said. Starting in June, anyone can bet on whether Robinson will score a spot at the Olympics when he competes at qualifying trials in Eugene, Oregon. Here's how it works: You could bet any amount (say, $75) that Khadevis will make the team or that he'll go ""vver."" Or, you can bet any amount (say, $10) on the ""under,"" meaning he won't make the team. If Khadevis qualifies, all $75 goes to his charity, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. If he has a bad day, his charity will get only the amount you wagered against him. Don't feel like betting anything if he doesn't make it? Put a zero in that ""under"" wager box. ""It would be nice if no one bet against me, but no matter what -- for or against -- it's the same motivation because I know people are involved in my performance,"" Robinson said. ""The Boys & Girls club in Fort Worth, Texas, helped me out a lot growing up. I didn't have much, and I really depended on that place to keep me focused. I feel like it's almost something I couldn't turn away from if I had the chance, and it's innocent betting."" Other Olympic hopefuls who've signed up with Charitybets.org include sprinter Walter Dix, who finished second to Usain Bolt in the 100 and 200 meters in world championships this summer, and runner Justin Gatlin, who took gold at the 2004 Olympics. Gamblers will be able to bet whether they'll make the Olympic trials in Oregon as well, Charitybets co-founder Dave Maloney said. The 32-year-old started Charitybets with Marc Hodulich, 31, a fellow former Auburn track teammate; both are the sons of breast cancer survivors. After graduation, the two took jobs in New York and worked with a lot of Wall Street go-getters with well-worn gym memberships who did triathlons and other weekend amateur events. They began brainstorming about how to inspire pros and weekend warriors to raise money for worthy causes. The friends started Charitybets in November. The first competitor who signed with them was Michael Stember, a former NCAA All-American runner from Stanford University who represented the U.S. at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. Stemper is a retired runner but agreed to run a Thanksgiving 5K last year to raise money for a charity he selected. ""We saw from Michael that we had interest and concept that worked logistically,"" Maloney said. ""Naturally, we wanted to take it to the biggest playing field possible."" 2004 Olympic silver medalist Meb Keflezighi worked with Charitybets in January before competing at U.S. marathon trials in Houston. Keflezighi set a place-based goal. The over/under on him was based on whether he finished the marathon in the top three. The 36-year-old won the trial with a time of 2:09:08, setting a personal best by 5 seconds. He signed up with Charitybets about two weeks before competing. Few people knew about it, but he still raised $1,000 for the Meb Foundation, which promotes health and fitness, according to his brother and manager, Merhawi Keflezighi. The American distance star is considering teaming again with Charitybets at the London games. ""Anytime you can get spectators to invest in the race, in any way, it's exciting,"" Merhawi Kaflezighi said. ""Once people understand the idea, I can't imagine anyone not getting behind it.""","CharityBets.com lets anyone bet on an Olympic athlete's performance .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spain's best-known judge, Baltasar Garzon, refused to answer questions from a prosecutor as he took the stand Tuesday in his trial on charges of abusing his judicial authority. Garzon sat and listened in silence as lawyer Joaquin Ruiz Infante read out all his questions to put them into the court record. The case centers on Garzon's investigation of human rights abuses under Gen. Francisco Franco, the dictator who ruled Spain for four decades, until his death in 1975. A seven-judge panel at Spain's Supreme Court Tuesday rejected requests from both state prosecutors and Garzon's defense to throw the case out, clearing the way for private prosecutors to press forward. Spanish law allows for private prosecutions, and it is the lawyers for these parties that are pressing the charges against Garzon. Garzon, however, did answer questions from his defense lawyer, Gonzalo Martinez Fresneda, explaining that his investigation started in December 2006 after people came forward with complaints about those still missing from the Franco era. Garzon testified that he searched but could not find any national census of how many people disappeared or their identities. So he decided to investigate because he considered those to be ""permanent crimes"" which still affect their descendants, since the remains have never been found. He said he began to see evidence that there was a ""systematic plan"" against Franco's opponents, which he said included forced disappearances, illegal detentions and assassinations. About 20 supporters applauded the judge in a hallway of the courthouse before the trial began Tuesday, while outside, dozens more demonstrated in his favor, some holding placards with just one word: justice. Judges began hearing the Franco-era case last week, a week after a different seven-judge panel at the same court conducted another trial against Garzon, for allegedly abusing his judicial authority in a high-profile financial corruption case known as Gurtel. That trial lasted three days and a verdict is pending. Garzon, 56, was suspended from his post in 2010, pending these trials. If convicted, he would not go to jail but could lose his right permanently to be a judge in Spain. Many observers said the second trial is the more important one against Garzon, who became known internationally in 1998 when he sought the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who was in a London hospital. Garzon accused him of the murder of Spaniards in Chile and crimes of genocide. Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch was in the courtroom on Tuesday along with other international observers and later said, ""Garzon showed today that his decision to take up the investigations of the crimes of the Franco era was fully supported by international law."" ""But the spectacle of a judge as a criminal defendant, having to justify his investigation into torture, killings and 'disappearances,' was itself an affront to principles of human rights and judicial independence,"" Brody added. The private prosecution is led by a small civil servants union called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands. It brought charges against Garzon, saying he ignored a 1977 amnesty law approved in Spanish Parliament, two years after Franco's death. ""Parliament unanimously approved the amnesty law. Judge Baltasar Garzon takes a stance as if they're crazy. What does he think? That he's better than them?"" said Miguel Bernard, leader of Manos Limpias. Bernard denies critics' charges that his group is a tiny far-right front, but he recently told CNN he was proud to receive an honor just last month from the Francisco Franco Foundation. Just before the trial began on Tuesday, Bernard told CNN outside the courtroom that he had heard the judges would deny the motion to stop the trial and instead proceed. ""A first victory,"" Bernard said. Garzon said in May 2010, at the time of his suspension from his post as investigating magistrate at the National Court, ""I face this calmly, with the tranquility of knowing that I am innocent of these charges."" Franco's military uprising in 1936 triggered the three-year Spanish Civil War. The war ended when Franco's forces emerged victorious over Republican and leftist fighters. Franco's dictatorship continued until his death. Mass graves from the regime are still being unearthed, including one this week in the southern Spanish village of Gerena, said Emilio Silva, from a group called Historical Memory. Silva said the excavations are being done with permission from the landowner, whether public or private, and with permission from local health authorities, who must ensure that the potential discovery of bones or other remains does not pose a current public health risk. Just outside the courtroom before the proceedings began January 24, Garzon told CNN he was ""okay"" as he headed into this second trial. He talked with his lawyers and supporters, smiled broadly and appeared relaxed. Garzon spent 22 years as an investigating magistrate at the National Court, which handles cases of terrorism and other delicate cases. He has investigated the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the Basque terrorist group ETA, and drug traffickers. At times in the past, Garzon has been considered a darling of the Spanish right or the Spanish left, depending on the cases he was investigating. His critics say he is too flamboyant and grandstands in front of the cameras. Since his suspension in 2010, Garzon has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues, including in Latin America.","Baltasar Garzon refuses to answer prosecution questions .

"(CNN) -- Keegan Bradley rounded off a triumphant rookie season by claiming the PGA Tour's Grand Slam of Golf in Bermuda Wednesday. Bradley held off a charging Charl Schwartzel of South Africa to win the prestigious end-of-season title by a shot after carding a level-par 71 on the Port Royal Golf Course. It left the American on four-under 138 for the two-round tournament which brings together the season's four major winners. Masters champion Schwartzel produced a best of the day six-under 65 but was ultimately undone by his first round three-over par 74. U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy started the day in the joint lead with Bradley after their first round 67s, but fell away in blustery conditions to card a four-over 75 to finish in third place on level-par 142. McIlroy's Northern Ireland compatriot Darren Clarke was way off the pace as the British Open winner closed out a second round of 74 for nine-over 151. The 25-year-old Bradley, who turned professional in 2008, has enjoyed a remarkable first season on the PGA Tour, claiming the Byron Nelson Classic before his triumph in the PGA Championship where he beat Jason Dufner in a playoff. Remarkably, it was his first appearance in a major, only one of three golfers to achieve the feat. He kept his nerve as Schwartzel drew level through the turn after picking up five straight birdies. Bradley, who had bogeyed the opening hole, birdied the 10th to open up a one-shot lead over Schwartzel which he kept to the finish to claim the $600,000 first prize. ""It was a lot more intense than I thought it was going to be,"" Bradley told gathered reporters after his victory. ""Coming down the stretch, it felt like any other tournament that I played in. It was very, very intense, and I was nervous over that 5-footer to win.""","Keegan Bradley wins PGA Grand Slam of Golf in Bermuda .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is asking lawmakers to withdraw confidence from his deputy after Saleh al-Mutlaq made controversial comments this week over American forces withdrawing from Iraq, state media reported late Saturday. In a recent interview with CNN, al-Mutlaq accused al-Maliki of amassing dictatorial power. ""There will be a day whereby the Americans will realize that they were deceived by al-Maliki ... and they will regret that,"" said al-Mutlaq, a leader within Iraqiya movement. The request followed word that the Iraqiya coalition was boycotting the country's parliament -- a move that would threaten Iraq's fragile power-sharing arrangement. The crisis pits al-Maliki, a Shiite, against Iraqiya, a powerful political bloc that enjoys support from Sunnis and more secular Iraqis. Also at issue were reports that an arrest warrant had been issued for Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi for masterminding a recent car bombing targeting the parliament. Ali al-Mussawi, al-Maliki's media adviser, said there were confessions that linked the Sunni vice president to the bombing. Al-Mussawi dismissed the notion that linking al-Hashimi to terrorism was politically motivated. He would not confirm whether an arrest warrant had indeed been issued, saying that was a matter for the judiciary. The Iraqiya bloc, headed by former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, made its move Friday night. The bloc is one of the largest and most powerful political groups in Iraq and boasts among its members the speaker of the parliament. The bloc had been in a power-sharing deal with al-Maliki's State of Law Alliance, backed mostly by Shiites. Iraqiya accuses al-Maliki of trying to consolidate his own power rather than share it. His rivals say, for example, that he still controls the country's security ministries and all decisions go through him. They also say that the hundreds of people seized by the government in October for backing terrorism and supporting the banned Baath Party are Iraqiya supporters. Iraqiya spokesman Haider al-Mulla said the bloc has always warned about the deal's risks and says the State of Law Alliance has been violating the law. ""Iraqiya has always expressed its rejection to the policy of exclusion and marginalization, lack of power sharing, politicization of the judiciary, the lack of balance within the government institutions,"" al-Mulla said. Al-Maliki won a second term as prime minister in 2010 after a months-long dispute among the leading parties in the country's parliamentary elections. The largely secular Iraqiya movement won two more seats than al-Maliki's party, but a merger of the premier's Shiite Muslim slate with a smaller Shiite bloc put him first in line to form a government. There had been fears of renewed bloodshed between Iraq's majority Shiite and minority Sunni populations and that prompted U.S. officials to work out a power-sharing agreement, bringing the Iraqiya movement into the government. Al-Mutlaq told CNN that Washington is leaving Iraq ""with a dictator"" who has ignored a power-sharing agreement, kept control of the country's security forces and rounded up hundreds of people in recent weeks. He said he was ""shocked"" to hear U.S. President Barack Obama greet al-Maliki at the White House on Monday as ""the elected leader of a sovereign, self-reliant and democratic Iraq."" ""America left Iraq with almost no infrastructure. The political process is going in a very wrong direction, going toward a dictatorship,"" he said. ""People are not going to accept that, and most likely they are going to ask for the division of the country. And this is going to be a disaster. Dividing the country isn't going to be smooth, because dividing the country is going to be a war before that and a war after that."" Neighboring Iran, predominantly Shiite and led by a Shiite regime, views al-Maliki as its man in Baghdad and has dictated the shape of the current government, al-Mutlaq said. But he said al-Maliki is playing games with both Washington and Tehran. The last U.S. troops are scheduled to be out of Iraq by the end of December, nearly nine years after the 2003 invasion that topped Saddam Hussein. More than 4,000 Americans and an estimated 115,000 Iraqis died in the invasion and the years of insurgency and sectarian warfare that followed. A Sunni who was originally barred from running because of allegations that he supported Hussein's Baath Party, al-Mutlaq said he has no authority within the government. He said al-Maliki has flouted the power-sharing deal's provisions by refusing to name permanent ministers to lead the defense and interior ministries, which concentrates control over the military and police in the prime minister's hands. He said U.S. officials, who brokered the power-sharing deal, either ""don't know anything in Iraq and they don't know what is happening in Iraq, or because they don't want to admit the reality in Iraq, the failure in Iraq, the failure of this political process that they set in Iraq."" Along with Shiites and Sunnis, Kurds are a major player in Iraqi politics. Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish member of parliament, said lawmakers discussed the Iraqiya move on Saturday and said it reflects ""a level of mistrust between the blocs, the government, Iraqiya and others. ""The problem is that Maliki isn't sharing any security decisions with Iraqiya, he doesn't trust them and this is a big problem,"" he said. ""Power-sharing was never power-sharing. We are in a government of conflict. Power-sharing was never successful. ""The Kurds don't want to take sides, we want them (Iraqiya and State of Law Alliance) to get together to solve their problems."" He is worried that the problem could morph into fighting between Sunnis and Shiites or violence against the government. ""This isn't just political,"" he said. ""It's sectarian.""","NEW: Nuri al-Maliki's spokesman links the vice president to a bombing .

"(CNN) -- Two bombs went off at separate locations in the Northern Ireland city of Londonderry, police said Thursday. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said people had been moved from both areas after telephone warnings and there were no reports of injuries. One of the blasts was on Strand Road, near government offices and police headquarters. The other was near a tourist office at Foyle Street. The police commander for the city, Chief Superintendent Stephen Martin, branded the attacks ""reckless."" He praised his officers for quickly evacuating businesses and homes, including many elderly residents. ""Thankfully we are not dealing with mass casualties or worse this evening,"" said Martin. ""The people of Derry do not want this - it is cowardly and callous."" Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second largest city, has a Catholic majority and is known as Derry by many residents. Local politicians are blaming Irish Republican Army splinter groups for planting the bombs. There have been several attacks by so-called ""dissident republicans"" in the city during recent years since the mainstream IRA declared a cease-fire. The IRA for decades fought against British authorities in Northern Ireland, but has since renounced violence. The former Social Democratic and Labour Party mayor of the city, Irish nationalist Colum Eastwood, condemned Thursday's attacks. ""This was an attack on the people of Derry by the enemies of Ireland. Those behind this are engaged in a futile and morally bankrupt campaign."" Leader of the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party, Tom Elliott, said, ""I have no doubt the bombs are the work of so-called ""dissident"" republican terrorists. ""We have seen this type of attack before during the troubles when the IRA blitzed Londonderry on a regular basis,"" Elliott said. ""Those attacks failed to break the will of the unionist people and these attacks will fail, too. These attacks further no cause."" Elliott called for a security crackdown by British authorities and urged anyone with information on the bombers to give it to police. ""This type of fascism was part of our past. It has no place in our future,"" he added.","Two bombs rock locations in Londonderry .

"(CNN) -- Allegations surrounding a U.S. investigation that may have involved laundering money for Mexican drug cartels are causing concern on both sides of the border. In Mexico, lawmakers say they are furious and are demanding an investigation. In the United States, a congressman is broadening the oversight of a previous inquiry to include the most recent allegations. Felipe Gonzalez, a federal senator with Mexico's ruling PAN party, says they will demand an investigation to determine whether the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration allowed its agents to launder money, possibly even on Mexican soil, as part of an investigation into the inner workings of Mexican drug cartels. Gonzalez called the situation ""really, really bad"" and said that ""this is not increasing the trust among countries to work together against crime. Furthermore, you can't fight crime by committing criminal acts and violating the law."" Last weekend, the New York Times reported that DEA agents ""have handled shipments of hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal cash across borders."" Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, announced Monday an investigation into the allegations in his role as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. In a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Issa said, ""These allegations, if true, raise further unsettling questions about a Department of Justice component engaging in a high-risk strategy with scant evidence of success."" Furthermore, Issa wrote that the existence of such a program again calls Holder's leadership into question. Tensions stemming from law enforcement actions have long troubled relations between Mexico and the United States. Samuel Gonzalez, a security analyst in Mexico City, says Mexicans are especially sensitive when it comes to their territory. ""Of course there's a jurisdiction problem and, in the end, maybe a violation of sovereignty. That has to be determined and find out where the operations were carried out,"" Gonzalez said. Robert Strang, a former DEA agent, says infiltration of Mexican drug cartels is not only happening, but it's essential in investigations aimed at dismantling Mexican criminal organizations by targeting their finances. ""There's only one way really to catch these major drug cartels, the leaders of these cartels, and that's to follow the money, because these leaders don't go anywhere near the drugs themselves. They hire people to do that,"" Strang said. As an answer to he allegations published by The Times, the DEA issued a statement Tuesday saying, ""We do not discuss the operational aspects of law enforcement activities."" The statement also said that the DEA has been ""working collaboratively with the Mexican government to fight money laundering for years. As a result of this cooperation, we have seized illicit transnational criminal organization money all around the world through our partnership with law enforcement."" For Strang, the former DEA agent, the bottom line is whether these actions produce results. ""The real question here is whether or not undercover agents need to sell drugs, buy drugs, and launder money. And I've got to tell you, there's no way to make these kinds of great international, sophisticated conspiracy cases unless you're going to do that,"" he said. Last month, a small group of Mexican legislators requested the extradition of American agents involved in Operation Fast and Furious. This operation, run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, allowed the illegal smuggling of firearms from the United States into Mexico in an effort to learn about smugglers. Many weapons were lost and likely ended up in criminal hands. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is expected to answer key questions about Operation Fast and Furious as he appears Thursday before a congressional panel including Issa, who also is leading the congressional investigation into the flawed gun sting program.","Mexican and U.S. lawmakers call for investigations .

"(CNN) -- Sports seasons come and go, but a long-running debate about the use of a Native American nickname and logo by University of North Dakota athletic teams appears nowhere close to a final outcome. A flurry of activity this week highlights the wide divisions over the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo. Those supporting the nickname -- including some Native Americans -- filed petitions asking for a vote this summer on the issue. The university announced Wednesday it is required to resume using it because of the filing of the petitions. The North Dakota Board of Higher Education, which agreed five years ago to retire the nickname, and the state's attorney general will hold a conference call next week to discuss legal options in the imbroglio. The board of education and university system want an end to the whole matter. ""We've heard from all sides. There certainly are people who said they want to keep it,"" John Irby, public affairs consultant for the university system, told CNN Thursday. ""But the position again is, we should focus on education and this is robbing and stealing too much from the focus. It (education) is becoming collateral damage."" More damage comes in the form of sanctions by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which has a policy against mascots ""deemed hostile or abusive toward Native Americans."" In 2005, the NCAA sought to end the controversy surrounding such mascots by ordering some 20 schools whose nicknames and mascots they deemed ""abusive in terms of race, ethnicity or national origin"" to either get Native American permission to use their name and likeness, or to come up with new ones. North Dakota is the last holdout in the NCAA's campaign. The NCAA reiterated its stance on sanctions Wednesday, saying the ""university is subject to the terms of the policy if it uses the logo and nickname."" ""Those terms include not being able to host NCAA championship events and a prohibition against using the nickname and imagery on uniforms for student-athletes, along with cheerleaders, (the) mascot or band members, in any NCAA championships,"" said Erik Christianson, NCAA director of media relations, in a written statement. ""The NCAA sanctions are not a good thing,"" Irby said. ""I have never seen the NCAA back down."" In 2007, the North Dakota Board of Higher Education agreed to drop the Fighting Sioux nickname by August 15, 2011, in accordance with the NCAA's policy. But that move was met with opposition. The state Legislature in early 2011 passed a law requiring the university to use the Fighting Sioux nickname. That law, however, was repealed in November 2011 when legislators approved a bill that allowed the school to stop using the moniker. North Dakotans who favor the mascot responded with a two-pronged strategy. On one had they are calling for the state constitution to be changed to stipulate the use of the Fighting Sioux name. If certified, that proposal would be on the November ballot. Supporters have until August to submit signatures to gain certification. The other effort calls for voters to decide in June whether to repeal the law that permitted the school to drop the name. Petitions backing that move were filed Tuesday with Secretary of State Al Jaeger. The state requires 13,452 certified signatures to put a law repeal issue before voters. North Dakota has about 684,000 residents. Petition supporters said they turned in more than the minimum number of signatures. ""By filing the petitions last night, the law as passed in early 2011 is now again in effect,"" Jaeger told CNN on Wednesday. ""The law passed in November 2011 is now suspended. I have 35 days to review the petitions. If I find the petitions sufficient, it will be certified for the ballot. If not, the bill passed in November will again become the law."" In the meantime, university President Robert Kelley said the school, located in Grand Forks, is resuming the use of the name and logo. ""I want to reaffirm our respect for the laws of the state and the processes guaranteed under the North Dakota Constitution,"" he said in a statement. There are still vestiges of the nickname on campus, including an ice hockey arena featuring a statue and hundreds of Fighting Sioux logos. While fightingsioux.com still links to the athletics department, the website now goes under a different web address and does not have the previous logo, a profile of a Sioux warrior. Doug Fullerton will be paying close attention to how the issue plays out. As commissioner of the Big Sky Conference, he is overseeing North Dakota's ascent from Division II obscurity to the far more lucrative stage of Division I. ""When we invited (North Dakota's football team) into the conference, this was not an issue,"" he said last summer. Citing the conference's ""close, close ties to Native American tribes"" and the threat of boycotts, Fullerton said he has been on 'heightened alert' Wednesday, North Dakota's conference membership -- slated to begin July 1 -- could be rescinded if the college presidents within Big Sky so decide, he said. The 13 college presidents -- including Robert Kelley of North Dakota -- are scheduled to meet in early June, according to Fullerton. The NCAA requirement on Native American nicknames has resulted in varied responses among the targeted schools. The Arkansas State Indians became the Red Wolves; the Indiana University of Pennsylvania Indians became the Crimson Hawks. Other schools satisfied the mandate by tweaking their name, such as Southeastern Oklahoma State, where the Savages are now known as the Savage Storm. Others, like the Bradley University Braves, whose name does not affiliate with a specific tribe, were allowed to keep their name so long as Native American logos and imagery were eschewed. Schools with higher-profile athletic programs fared better. The Florida State Seminoles, University of Utah Utes and Central Michigan University Chippewas each obtained permission from their respective namesake tribes to stay the course. But the North Dakota Fighting Sioux -- winners of seven national championships in men's ice hockey -- were denied such an endorsement from the Tribal Council of the Standing Rock Sioux. But another tribal body, Spirit Lake, has expressed support for the nickname. A website, savethefightingsioux.com, calls for keeping the nickname and logo. It lists the Spirit Lake Committee for Understanding and Respect, whose members were among those who filed the petitions. ""We ask you to boldly 'Stand Up' with us, the Dakota Sioux Nation, as we stand on principle against an injustice attempting to rid UND of its traditions and customs,"" the website reads.","U. of North Dakota is the last holdout over an NCAA policy on Native American nicknames .

"(CNN) -- World number one Novak Djokovic has pulled out of the Paris Masters with a shoulder injury. The 24-year-old moved into the last eight of the competition on Thursday with a three-set over fellow Serbian Viktor Troicki but said he was not fit enough to face Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Friday's scheduled quarterfinal. Djokovic has been struggling with shoulder and back injuries since winning the U.S. Open in September, and was forced to withdraw from the Shanghai Masters as he missed the ATP Tour's Asian leg. ""Sadly I have to inform you that I have withdrawn from the tournament,"" he said on his official website on Friday, raising doubts that he will be fit to play in the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London this month. ""I have pushed myself to the limit by playing, and after the match yesterday my shoulder got worse. ""For this reason, I have to put my health first and withdraw even though my urges as a professional player are making me want to play until the last drop of energy. ""I am very sorry for all of you who bought tickets and wanted to come and watch me play. My season has been long and tiring, I played all of my matches at my highest level, and now my body is aching for recovery. Hoping for your understanding and support."" Earlier in the week Djokovic rejected claims that he had played in Paris just to collect a year-end $1.6 million bonus check for finishing top of the rankings, saying they were ""ridiculous."" The tournament lost another big attraction in quarterfinal action Friday as second seed Andy Murray crashed out to Czech Tomas Berdych. Murray was bidding to extend his unbeaten streak to 19 matches, but was beaten 4-6 7-6 6-4 by sixth seed Berdych, who will be joining him at the ATP Tour Finals in London later this month. Berdych leveled with superb play in the second set tiebreak and a crucial break in the ninth game of the decider left him to serve out for victory and his third win in four matches with Scot Murray. His reward is a semifinal clash against Roger Federer after the third seed saw off Juan Monaco of Argentina 6-3 7-5. It was the 800th win of the Swiss maestro's remarkable career and was wrapped up in just under 90 minutes at the Bercy Arena. Tsonga will play John Isner of the United States for a place in the final after he upset fourth seed David Ferrer of Spain 6-3 3-6 6-3 in the final quarterfinal of an eventful day in the French capital.","Novak Djokovic pulls out of the Paris Masters with a shoulder injury .

"(CNN) -- In October 2011, actor Hugh Jackman launched a new company called Laughing Man. Initially, the business offered a variety of coffees and teas, sold online and in a small cafe in the Tribeca part of New York City. This week, Jackman's expanding his line of offerings into the world of chocolate, just in time for Valentine's Day. While it's certainly commonplace for entertainment professionals to dive into other business opportunities, Jackman's new business may seem a bit curious if viewed through the lens of his offering items tied to the little pleasures and relaxations of life. Jackman seems to always be shooting a film or booking theater work. The guy can't slow down. CNN recently spoke with the actor from London about the evolution of his new business, the inspiration behind it and who in his family is helping out. He's currently rehearsing for the upcoming film adaptation of ""Les MisÃ©rables"" and later this year will begin shooting ""The Wolverine,"" reprising his role as Logan/Wolverine in the latest comic adaptation. CNN: Some people claim that chocolate is an aphrodisiac. Some people don't. Does your chocolate guarantee good loving? Jackman: That's a good question. I would definitely say -- because I eat a little bit of dark chocolate every day -- I'd definitely say that it makes you feel good. I don't know if it makes me feel like ""getting it on."" I suppose I could see the connection. It definitely makes you feel good. CNN: You launched Laughing Man last fall. In the general sense, what's the business plan? Jackman: Laughing Man worldwide is going to incubate different companies. One of them is coffee and tea, one of them is chocolate. Who knows where we'll go from there. Each of these companies that we create, 100% of the profits go to charities. It's first and foremost about creating good products that people really want. Not that they feel like they should want it, but because they genuinely want it. And then being able to create jobs and support entrepreneuralism. I was mainly inspired by Paul Newman on the business level and what he did. I read his book about 10 years ago, ""Shameless Exploitation in the Pursuit of the Common Good."" It's a great book and that's probably where the idea incubated. CNN: The Newman line, and sorry for the pun, started very organically. Jackman: That's what inspired me, and I was waiting for the right opportunity. I was in Ethiopia as a part of World Vision and I met and worked with a coffee farmer, Dukale; at the time I was living with them, and it was pretty amazing. It had a great effect on me. So the urgency for me to do something was growing, but I didn't know what. Now, we actually buy coffee from Dukale where I stayed. Our Espresso blend is actually called Dukale's Dream. CNN: And everything is sourced with fair trade guidelines and all that? Jackman: Absolutely. Organic, fairly traded, the chocolates are kosher, you name it. We wanted to be win-win all around. The environment, the growers and the purchasers. CNN: There's a lot of political aspects surrounding food, not only in the U.S. but on a global level. But there's a market out there for people that care about that stuff. Jackman: Oh, yeah, hugely. And what's important for us to know who we are buying from. There's some organizations that you're buying from that are like a co-op and you can't really guarantee who you are buying from. We really want to encourage people that you can get a really fair price for quality products, wherever it's grown. That's what we're doing. Business done well is a win-win all around. It doesn't have to tax the environment or quality or the workers or people. There is a way, under the natural law, for this to work for everybody. CNN: As an actor, you're constantly busy with work. How much are you involved in the day-to-day or month-to-month of this? Jackman: Every weekend, I go down [to the store in New York City] with my son and do some work. He's 11. I figure it's good for him to start doing some work. Most of the business is done online. I'm involved as much as I can without it being my full-time job. For a long time, I've been looking to focus my profile on and this somehow ... I've always been interested in economics and business -- my wife always jokes that I should be taking a briefcase to work -- it's something I genuinely enjoy and it doesn't feel like a burden. CNN: You're rehearsing ""Les MisÃ©rables"" right now. What's the adaptation going to be like? Jackman: It's a musical adaptation. Obviously, it's a 1,500 page book, but don't worry, it's not going to be 15 hours long. It's an epic, and we'll be musically close to the musical. Today, I was working on a brand new song that Claude-Michel [SchÃ¶nberg] wrote with Alain Boublil, which was a great thrill for me. CNN: What's the sound like? Is it modern in any way? Jackman: Oh, no, the music is largely as it is from the musical. So there's no rap version or blues version. It's going to be what people expect in that way. CNN: 20th Century Fox just announced a release date for ""The Wolverine."" What's the game plan? Jackman: Shooting later this year. ""Les Mis"" finishes around the beginning of June so we'll take a month down and we'll get started. It's a Japanese saga, I'm very excited about it. It's looking good.","Hugh Jackman's expanding his Laughing Man line into the world of chocolate .

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney has won the New Hampshire primary. That much was clear as soon as the polls closed Tuesday night. It took a little while longer to sort out exactly where the other candidates finished behind him, but that barely matters. Regardless of the other candidates' performances in New Hampshire or even what happens in the South Carolina primary next week, Mitt Romney is extremely likely to be the Republican nominee. How can we know this so early, after only one primary election and the Iowa caucus? The dominant political science explanation of the presidential nominating process is contained in the book, ""The Party Decides"" by Marty Cohen, David Karol, Hans Noel, and John Zaller. They point out that candidates need support from their party's politicians and activists across the country. From 1980 to the present, no candidate who significantly trailed in party endorsements has won the nomination. A few candidates have been nominated in years when no candidate took an early endorsement lead. These include Mike Dukakis in 1988 and Barack Obama in 2008. But no candidate has succeeded when significantly trailing by that measure. There are reasons to believe that this pattern is not a coincidence. Your party's politicians and activists can help you organize and raise money as you hopscotch to primaries and caucuses across the country. On top of this is the effect of national media figures on TV, radio and the Internet closing ranks around the candidate most leaders in their party support. We got an excellent example of this in December when Newt Gingrich opened up a fairly large lead in Iowa and national polls. Romney's supporters used his fundraising advantage to pummel (through a sympathetic super-PAC) Gingrich with negative ads. On top of this, Republican pundits almost universally condemned Gingrich. As Ben Smith of Politico noticed, on December 14, just about all columnists on the Washington Post op-ed page, regardless of their ideologies, criticized Gingrich. On his morning show on MSNBC, former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough, who served with Gingrich in the 1990s, called him a ""bad person"" who ""will destroy our party."" This would continue if someone like Gingrich had initial success in the primaries and caucuses. As chronicled by Nate Silver, Mitt Romney now has a big lead in Republican Party endorsements, giving him a huge advantage moving forward. Through the end of November, Romney had 55% of all Republican endorsements and his share has only increased in December and after his slim victory over Santorum in Iowa. The only other person with a non-trivial number of endorsements is Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Consequently, Perry remains the only candidate who could somewhat plausibly challenge Romney in a drawn out fight for the nomination. How did this happen? How did a candidate who relatively recently supported abortion and gay rights, and who as governor passed a health reform bill remarkably similar to the president's, manage to lock up the Republican establishment's support? It wasn't inevitable. The most plausible alternatives were former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Perry. Pawlenty likely miscalculated by dropping out after weak performances in debates and in the Iowa straw poll. Pawlenty's campaign was low on cash. But many Republican endorsers were late in deciding to go with Romney. If Pawlenty had laid off campaign staff but stayed in the race, he might have benefited from a late surge in endorsements and in the polls. (Pawlenty's mediocre debating performances would have evoked Cicero in comparison to Perry.) Which brings us to the second candidate who could have won support from Republican elites: Perry. Right after he announced, it appeared that he might be able to match or even surpass Romney in establishment backing. But he has been hurt by his extremely weak campaign skills, including disastrous performances in debates and on the stump. In Republican eyes, he may be a reliable conservative, but he appears to be someone incapable of running a competent campaign against Barack Obama. Still, Perry remains the only candidate besides Romney with nontrivial support from Republican elites. If he could somehow manage to run a respectable campaign and win a substantial number of votes in South Carolina, he would be Romney's only halfway plausible threat. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan Ladd.","Jonathan Ladd: It's a good bet that Mitt Romney will win the GOP nomination .

"Budapest, Hungary (CNN) -- A former Hungarian prime minister was briefly detained Friday during a demonstration outside the Parliament building, police said. Ferenc Gyurcsany, now a member of parliament, was protesting the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose center-right party, Fidesz, is dominant in Parliament. Gyurcsany was among 43 people detained at the demonstration, staged by the LMP opposition party. He was among 15 lawmakers, including members of Parliament from the LMP and Gyurcsancy's former Socialist Party, who were picked up by police. The people were taken into custody for blocking entrances and exits to the Parliament building and violating ""personal freedom."" Police said the 15 parliament members eventually were released but it's unclear whether the remaining people have been freed. Opposition members were protesting votes by Parliament on several contentious bills and wanted more debate about them before the vote. Parliament approved several new bills, including a measure keeping elections to a single round, another cutting in half the number of lawmakers, and one that redraws voting districts. Later, the LMP held a demonstration, attended by about 1,000 people. Speakers called for a national referendum on the job of the government. Concern in financial markets has brought the issue of Hungary's government and economy to the forefront. The nation has been stripped of its investment grade status by ratings agencies. Critics have accused the ruling Fidesz Party of undermining democracy and making constitutional changes more suited to an authoritarian regime. Hungary is a member of the European Union and NATO. Orban is accused of tightening his grip on power by redrawing election boundaries, installing loyal judges in the country's courts and curbing media freedom. Matyas Eorsi, a Hungarian politician, said this process began a year and a half ago ""when the current government got into power and since then they are systematically dismantling checks and balances and independent institutions. Recently, there was a bill introduced to the Hungarian Parliament to curb the independence of the central bank that was most alarming."" But one senior Hungarian official has blamed opposition parties for bringing the country to the brink of economic and political collapse. Zoltan Kovacs, state secretary for government communications, said the government is trying to resolve a problem spawned by the previous Socialist government. ""There is a visible and very well-orchestrated effort on behalf of the opposition parties to put together this kind of democracy deficit problem in the last couple of months,"" Kovacs said. ""We have to deal with those major economic and social problems that the previous Socialist government have created. So we are basically finishing in about year and half ... the kind of process that should have been started 20 years ago."" In 2006, Hungarian radio played a leaked tape where Gyurcsany admitted that his Socialist Party lied to the public to win that year's general election. Gyurcsany left the Socialist Party last year and has formed a new party, the Democratic Coalition. CNN's Matthew Chance contributed to this report .","43 people had been seized, including 15 MPs .

"(CNN) -- A 22-year-old Virginia man stole a Mercedes SUV at gunpoint the day before he shot dead a Virginia Tech police officer and then took his own life, police said Friday. Virginia State Police on Friday identified Ross Truett Ashley, 22, as the man who killed Virginia Tech Police Officer Deriek Crouse and then himself about 30 minutes later. A part-time student at Radford University, 15 miles southwest of Blacksburg, Ashley had no connection to or contact with Crouse before Thursday's shooting, according to a news release from state police. ""State police investigators are continuing their work to establish a motive in the killing and to re-create Ashley's movements in the days and hours leading up to the murder-suicide,"" police said. Ashley entered a real estate office in Radford with a handgun Wednesday and demanded the keys to a white 2011 Mercedes SUV, according to police. He drove off in the car, which was found the next day on the Virginia Tech campus. That's where and when Ashley and Crouse were found dead, about a quarter mile away from each other. Ballistics evidence shows that both were fatally shot with the same gun, state police said Friday. Police have said they believe Ashley matches the description of the man who shot the officer. Thursday's double shooting conjured memories from April 16, 2007, when student Seung-Hui Cho killed 33 people at Virginia Tech in a mass shooting. ""Once again, the campus and the community that we love so well have been visited by senseless violence and tragic loss,"" Virginia Tech President Charles W. Steger said in a statement. ""Tragedy again struck Virginia Tech in a wanton act of violence where our police officer, Deriek Crouse, was murdered during a routine traffic stop."" The scale and facts of Thursday's shooting differ significantly from the incident four years ago. Still, it served as a test of the policies the school has implemented since that tragedy. The latest incident began about 12:15 p.m. Thursday, when Crouse, who had been a Virginia Tech officer for four years, pulled over someone during a routine traffic stop in the Cassell Coliseum parking lot near McComas Hall. Cassell Coliseum houses athletic facilities. McComas Hall houses exercise facilities. Shortly before 12:30 p.m., police received their first call from a person who said he'd seen the suspect -- not the driver of the car that had been pulled over -- approach the officer's vehicle and open fire. The shooter ran from the area. Police said Ashley changed out of his wool cap and pullover at the Virginia Tech greenhouses and put them in a backpack. A Montgomery County deputy sheriff who was on-site because of the first shooting eventually spotted a man who was walking toward the on-campus ""Cage"" parking lot. The deputy sheriff temporarily lost sight of this man as he drove toward him, according to the state police chronicle of events released Friday. ""When the deputy finally reached the subject, the man was on the ground and deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound,"" police said. This person didn't have any identification on him and was wearing clothing different from that worn by the person who had shot Crouse, police added. But that clothing was recovered later Thursday in the backpack Ashley had left behind. Maj. Rick Jenkins of the Virginia State Police said a video camera mounted inside the slain officer's car captured footage of a man with a weapon who matched the description of the man they'd found dead. In addition to the law enforcement activity, Virginia Tech's updated communications efforts -- which received criticism in 2007, for not letting students know quickly or extensively enough what was happening then -- were also put in focus during Thursday's incident. Campus officials put out six alerts to students and faculty about the shooting. On Thursday, law enforcement and school officials said the alert system put in place in recent years worked well, from technological and communications standpoints. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, whose daughter attends Virginia Tech, lauded the communications effort. McDonnell said his daughter was confined to a basement classroom during the four-hour episode. ""Like so many parents who had children on the Virginia Tech campus, I felt a lot of that angst and uncertainty,"" he said. ""Again, I want to express my gratitude to law enforcement for making sure that they kept the faculty (and) parents regularly informed."" Crouse, 39, joined the Virginia Tech police force six months after the 2007 mass shooting, according to a release on the school's website. A U.S. Army veteran who had worked at the New River Valley jail and with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department, the Christiansburg resident is survived by his wife, as well as five children and stepchildren. The man who killed Crouse is from Partlow, a town about 45 miles north of Richmond in Virginia's Spotsylvania County. Radford University said Friday in a statement that Ashley was a business management major at the school. Citing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the university said ""no additional information on Mr. Ashley can be provided."" Radford President Penny Kyle said counseling would be made available to that university's students, akin to services offered at Virginia Tech. Already, members of the Virginia Tech community have come together since the shootings. For instance, scores of people came together on the Blacksburg campus for a candlelight vigil on Thursday night, one day after a similar, smaller event was held. A student-organized group that calls itself Hokies for Crouse said at 9:40 p.m. Friday on its website that it had raised more than $31,734 for the slain officer's family. CNN's Greg Botelho, Athena Jones, Vivian Kuo, Eric Fiegel and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .","NEW: More than $31,700 is raised for the slain police officer's family .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- She's only 34, but Drew Barrymore has spent a lifetime in Hollywood. Since her acting debut aged seven the petite star known for her free-spirited energy and girl power credo has acted in and produced more than 40 films -- all of which she has drawn on for her directorial debut, ""Whip It."" Hollywood actress, producer and now, director, Drew Barrymore on the set of debut feature ""Whip It."" ""I've learned a lot in the time that I've been in this business and I wanted to apply all those lessons in the first film I directed,"" she told CNN at the movie's Los Angeles premiere Wednesday. ""Whip It"" tells the story of Bliss Cavendar, a misunderstood Texan teenager forced to follow in the footsteps of her beauty pageant mother. Should actors direct films or should they stick to the day job? Tell us below in the SoundOff box . But life takes a turn when Bliss, played by Ellen Page of ""Juno,"" discovers the rough and tough world of female roller derby. She joins a team called the Hurl Scouts, rechristening herself Babe Ruthless. Page -- who Barrymore has called the ""angel"" of her story -- leads a cast of wild women on skates, including Juliette Lewis and Barrymore herself, who plays Smashley Simpson, a hippie with anger issues. Barrymore, who has led a varied Hollywood career since ""E.T."" launched her as a child star in the 1980s, said directing her first film was a dream come true. ""I've been waiting to make this film my whole life and to tell this story,"" she told CNN last month at the comedy drama's world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Based on the novel ""Derby Girl"" by Shauna Cross, who also wrote the screenplay, ""Whip It"" continues the girl power spirit of earlier Barrymore projects like the ""Charlie's Angels"" franchise. Over the years Barrymore has become a bankable actress, with roles in a stack of frothy rom coms like ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""50 First Dates"" under her belt. Barrymore has also explored more serious fare, most recently earning critical acclaim for her portrayal of eccentric Little Edie Beale in the TV movie ""Grey Gardens,"" as well as moving into producing. Her production company, Flower Films, produced both ""Charlie's Angels"" movies. Barrymore has said that, naturally, she was nervous about making her first feature film. She was unsure of whether she'd be able to pull it off, but didn't let fear stop her from taking on the challenge. She was drawn to the varied elements of the ""Whip It"" screenplay, which covers themes of love and friendship, as well as a conflict, between Bliss and her mother, played by Marcia Gay Harden. Barrymore may have been a newbie at directing, but actress Page was impressed with her skills. Page told CNN that working with Barrymore was ""absolutely mind blowing"" and called it one of the best experiences she's had. What does Barrymore attribute her success to? ""I think if you respect the people you work with and you show up prepared and confident, then what you give is the room to have fun and give them the floor.""

"(CNN) -- The grandmother of a missing Maine toddler says no family members in the home the night the girl vanished had anything to do with her disappearance. ""I feel violated. Somebody came into my home and took my granddaughter who was sleeping,"" Phoebe DiPietro said during her first television interview about Ayla Reynolds, the now 21-month-old toddler. Ayla disappeared December 17. Police have said they believe foul play was involved. They also say the DiPietros have fully co-operated in the investigation. Sitting in her living room, steps away from Ayla's bedroom, DiPietro said she heard nothing while she slept that night. She wasn't the last one to go to bed that night and wasn't sure whether the doors were locked. She and her son suspect the child was abducted. Update: Grandmother changes story . ""I'm sure that eventually they will be able to let us know how someone go into the house whether it was an unlocked window, an unlocked door, I don't know,"" DiPietro said. 'If I knew, it wouldn't have happened,"" she added. Investigators have said there were several adults in the DiPietro home that night, including DiPietro and her 24-year-old son. Police won't identify the others, nor reveal much else. Neither will Phoebe DiPietro. She says detectives have asked her and her son not to divulge details of what happened that night to avoid possibly hindering the investigation. ""I can tell you there was not a party here at the house. Just beyond that, I can't answer any questions."" She says her son put Ayla to bed every night. DiPietro says it was her son Justin (Ayla's father) who told her Ayla was missing. She would not say what time, where she was when she heard or elaborate. Police have said the little girl was put to bed about 8 that night and that her father reported her missing the next morning just before 9. DiPietro revealed she told investigators about ""oddities"" in the house after Ayla disappeared. She would not describe what they were. She added that she doesn't think police want her to disclose that information. Ayla's grandmother also said she allowed police to immediately search her house without a warrant, and that she and her son have undergone several interrogations. She says she answered all their questions and prepared several written statements of what happened that night at their request. The police had full access to the house for about three weeks from mid-December until the end of the month. DiPietro says police searched everywhere, fingerprint dust was all over the place. They left her a list of what was removed, including laptop computers and cell phones that belonged to her and her son. The phones and computers have now been returned. Ayla's room, she says, has been turned upside down by investigators searching for clues. Maine State Police took the lead in the investigation, at the request of the Waterville police, because they now consider it a criminal investigation based ""on evidence gathered by investigators."" The FBI and Maine Warden Service are also involved in the case. Ayla was last seen wearing pajamas that said ""Daddy's Princess."" DiPietro says she believes investigators are doing all they can to find Ayla. She also discounted claims by Ayla's mother that Justin DiPietro may have abused or mistreated his daughter. The toddler's parents don't live together. Ayla's mother previously has been in rehab. Ayla had been wearing a soft sling on her left arm. Her grandmother says Ayla's arm was injured during an accidental fall. At the time, she says her son was coming home with Ayla. DiPietro says she heard a thud at the back door. It was dark at the time, and she says her son had slipped on the stairs outside the side door and fell with Ayla in his arms. DiPietro ran to help them both. The youngster was crying but didn't immediately appear injured. The next morning, one of her hands swelled and she was taken to an emergency room for treatment. She says her son would never harm Ayla. ""Justin is a great dad. He truly, truly is. And I know he loves Ayla,"" his mother said. Ayla's grandmother gently stroked a sparkly red dress with a sales tag still hanging on it. it was supposed to be a Christmas present for Ayla. Tears rolled down her cheek. ""I'd give everything I owned if we can have her back.""","Ayla Reynolds disappeared on December 17 .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Thousands gathered in the Egyptian capital on Friday in a mass demonstration against the country's armed forces and its heavy-handed treatment of protesters, which has since drawn international condemnation. Protesters could be seen erecting tents in Cairo's Tahrir Square, a location widely considered the epicenter of an uprising that brought down Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak earlier this year. The move marks the latest in a series of protests around the capital, where at least 16 people were killed in recent days amid clashes with Egyptian authorities. The unrest appears to largely stem from a stretch of assaults by police and defiant protests by demonstrators demanding that Egypt's ruling military cede power to a civilian government. Protesters on Friday could be heard singing the country's national anthem and chanting slogans, such as ""The honor of Egyptian women is a red line."" They also put up a large projector screen in the city's square, which showed videos of violence against protesters and included testimonials by the injured and family members of those recently killed. Days of clashes were further stoked last weekend by the beating of a woman at the hands of military officers, prompting Tuesday's so-called ""Million Women"" march, billed as an attempt to highlight regime violence against female demonstrators. Egypt's ruling military council later expressed ""great regret"" to the women over recent attacks and vowed to hold accountable those responsible. Security forces, meanwhile, on Friday appeared largely absent from the demonstration, according to CNN personnel at the scene. But political groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party, as well as the Salfi Islamic Movement, said they were boycotting the events. The country's Islamic Wasat Party, however, has decided to participate. Elsewhere in Cairo, hundreds of protesters converged on the city's Abasya Square, chanting slogans such as ""No to Destruction."" Large crowds also gathered in similar demonstrations in the Egyptian cities of Alexandria and Suez, according to state television. On Wednesday, Egypt's military announced on Facebook that they had acquired information of a ""plan to vandalize government buildings and topple Egypt on January 25, 2012."" The date would mark the one-year anniversary of the start of Egypt's uprising that largely began in Tahrir square on January 25, 2011. Demonstrators have also called for the country's presidential elections, scheduled to take place in June, to be moved ahead to instead take place on the anniversary. A Ministry of Health spokesman, meanwhile, said that some 30 ambulances have been stationed near Tahrir Square and a field hospital has been set-up in anticipation of possible clashes.","Thousands gathered in Cairo in a mass demonstration against the country's armed forces .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (Reuters) -- The skull of a female Homo erectus -- the first-ever discovery -- suggests the upright ancestors of humans may have been physiologically closer to modern gorillas and chimpanzees. Frederick Kyalo Manthi holds the Homo erectus complete skull he discovered in 2000 near lake Turkana in Kenya. Homo erectus, long viewed as a crucial evolutionary link between modern humans and their tree-dwelling ancestors, may have been more ape-like than previously thought, scientists said Thursday. Unveiling newfound fossils, a team of Kenyan scientists said they were surprised to find that early female hominids were much smaller than males. Gorillas and chimpanzees also exhibit big differences in size between males and females. The fossils, an ancient skull and a jawbone from two early branches of the human family tree -- Homo erectus and Homo habilis, were revealed at Kenya's National Museum. Both fossils were found in 2000 east of Lake Turkana. But the Homo erectus skull, dating back 1.55 million years, was slightly older than the Homo habilis jawbone, which was found to be 1.44 million years old, the scientists said. ""Prior to the discovery of the new specimens, scientists did not know that Homo erectus males were far larger than the females,"" said Dr Emma Mbua, one of the team. ""This sexual dimorphism [two forms of the same species] is considered a primitive character because it occurs in other apes,"" she said, standing in front of the bones at the museum. She said this could also mean the sexual behavior of Homo erectus was more like that of apes, where individuals, especially males, mate with several partners, sometimes in a few hours, than that of its more monogamous human successors. The fossils, discovered in east Africa's Rift Valley, regarded as the ""cradle of humankind"", challenge the idea that human prototypes evolved one after the other in a linear fashion from Homo habilis to Homo erectus, ending with modern humans. This means they must have co-existed in different habitats at the same time, the scientists added. ""They were kind of sisters, if you like,"" said Frederick Manthi, the scientist who discovered the fossils. ""Homo habilis never gave rise to Homo erectus. These discoveries have completely changed the story."" The research, first published in the journal Nature, was conducted by nine scientists including well-known paleontologist Maeve Leakey and her daughter Louise Leakey. The scientists think both Homo erectus and Homo habilis must have evolved from a common ancestor 2-3 million years ago. The most famous such ancestor is Ethiopia's ""Lucy,"" a fossil more than 3 million years old that set off this week for a tour of museums in the United States. The basic evolutionary story -- that all humans came ""out of Africa"" after evolving from apes in the Rift Valley around 5 million years ago -- remains unchanged and may even be strengthened, the scientists said. ""The more fossils we find in Kenya, the more we justify the story that east Africa is the cradle of mankind,"" Manthi said. ""These hominids tell us there was a large diversity within this species, which strengthens that convention."" The researchers said Homo habilis was largely a herbivore, likely to have foraged for fruits in greener, more heavily forested areas than Homo erectus, who is thought to have been a hunter who thrived in east Africa's open savannah. Manthi said the team would have to find more fossils to confirm the findings. ""The story of human evolution has not yet been [told],"" said Kenya Museum director Farah Idle. ""There are many missing links. The more discoveries you make, the more questions you raise."" E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- The story of their deaths -- hacked with hatchets, doused in gasoline before the home they were in exploded, according to police -- has been well documented. Six days later, hundreds packed a Tacoma, Washington, church to remember the lives of young Braden and Charlie Powell, describing them as intelligent, compassionate, joyful boys who made big impressions in a short time. ""This moment is about two beautiful boys,"" Dean Curry, lead pastor at the Life Center church, said to open Saturday's memorial service. Authorities say the boys' father, Josh Powell, snatched them from a social worker who was delivering them for a supervised visit Sunday, locking the doors before killing them, as well as himself, just minutes before his Puyallup, Washington, home exploded. The children's mother, Susan Cox-Powell, hasn't been seen since December 2009. Law enforcement authorities in West Valley City, Utah, had identified only one person, Josh Powell, as someone they were investigating in relation to her disappearance. Members of both the Powell and Cox families attended Saturday's service. ""Mark this moment. These two families, who have had so much pain, have come together, have set aside very dark and hurtful moments to celebrate children,"" Curry said. ""May each and every one of us remember their example."" The memorial featured snapshots of the boys, as well as tributes from their teachers. Tammy Oughton recalled Charlie Powell, a former student in her kindergarten class who turned 7 last month, as an ""amazing young man"" who displayed a ""keen intellect and a compassionate heart."" Within Carson Elementary School in Puyallup, ""Charlie was known as the little scientist"" -- due to his love of nature and vast knowledge, Oughton said. She also noted how much the first-grader loved to write, as well as how ""classmates liked the silly little things that he did to make them laugh."" ""We will miss him, but he will not be forgotten,"" she said. Charlie's younger brother, Braden, who also celebrated a birthday in January, turning 5, was remembered as a ""budding puzzlemaster,"" ""tickle monster"" and loving boy in remarks from one of his pre-kindergarten instructors, Kristy King. At the YMCA program he attended, Braden was known for the ""huge smile on his angelic face,"" as well as his ""contagious, joyful energy."" King described him as affectionate, always quick to hold a teacher's hand and reluctant to let go. ""Braden had an enthusiasm for life and took pleasure in everything,"" she said. ""He had a heart of gold."" The boys' grandparents Charles and Judith Cox, who were engaged in a long and bitter child custody battle with Josh Powell, took the stage briefly. Charles Cox said that the support they've received since their daughter went missing ""helps us to be strong, and helps to know that there are good people."" He also expressed thanks for the support his grandsons had received, saying, ""All their teachers, their social workers, the police: Everyone was doing everything they possibly could to keep them safe, and to help them and love them."" While Susan Cox-Powell has not been found, her father suggested that he believes she is dead -- and that she is now reunited with her sons in heaven. ""We know that they are with their mother,"" he said.","A memorial service is held in Tacoma for Braden and Charlie Powell .

"(CNN) -- The bodies of two ATV enthusiasts missing since Sunday in California's Mojave Desert were found Thursday after a massive search, authorities said. Kern County, California, sheriff's Lt. Steve Hansen said the bodies of Daniel Preddy Carbonaro, 27, and Chris Wayne Rice, 29, were found and the search was ended. He had no additional details. Carbonaro and Rice, both of Santa Barbara, California, had traveled to a remote corner of the desert with their girlfriends, hoping to test out Rice's new 2011 Polaris ATV, family members said. The area is popular with ""off-roaders,"" campers and recreational enthusiasts. ""I am so sad to report it is official, Dan and Chris were found deceased,"" said the search's Facebook page, ""Friends of the Chris Rice and Dan Carbonaro search."" A memorial fund was set up on the site. The two young men left a Randsburg, California, hotel about 2:30 a.m. Sunday, telling their girlfriends where they were headed and saying they'd be back within a few hours. The two planned to travel by ATV about 15 miles to the Cuddeback Dry Lake Bed in San Bernardino County, an expansive and popular ""off-roading"" area. It was a ""dark, moonless night,"" said Carbonaro's father, Robert Carbonaro, who worried as the search was under way that the two ""may have gotten disoriented."" Carbonaro said he was worried about abandoned gold mine shafts in the area. But Kern County authorities said the bodies were found in a ravine area with rugged, steep terrain. Agencies participating in the search for the two men included the Kern County Sheriff's Office; the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department; the California Highway Patrol; the Bureau of Land Management; and the Indian Wells Mine Rescue Team. Relatives of the two men were out searching alongside authorities as well, Robert Carbonaro said.","NEW: The two men are found dead Thursday .

"New York (CNN) -- The actress' appearances on the silver screen transformed men with hearts of stone into quivering masses during Hollywood's Golden Age. On Tuesday night, the simple fact that they were once worn by Elizabeth Taylor transformed the silver, the stones and the gold themselves -- into fortunes. If the prices commanded by Christie's auction house are any indication, the British-American actress' luster appears to have rubbed off on the jewels she once wore. The items in her collection rocketed far beyond their original estimates. For example, the 50-carat pearl known as La Peregrina, given to her in 1969 by actor Richard Burton and once part of the crown jewels of Spain, went for $11.8 million, which Christie's said was the highest recorded price ever of pearl jewelry sold at auction. Its value had been estimated at $2 million to $3 million. The pearl was mounted onto a specially commissioned diamond-and-ruby Cartier necklace. A diamond tiara given to Taylor by her husband, Mike Todd, estimated at $80,000 pre-auction brought in a surprising $4.2 million. The Taj Mahal, an Indian diamond and jade pendant sold for $8.8 million. Its initial estimate was a range of $300,000 - $500,000. An emerald and diamond necklace went for $6.1 million. And the sale of the Elizabeth Taylor Diamond fetched $8.8 million more, capping a spectacular night of bidding that included other jewelry. The auction continues through Friday with sales of clothing and film memorabilia. More than 400 people filled the bidder seats and more than a dozen Christie's staffers were on the phone with buyers. Before the bidding started, the auction house played a two-minute video showing clips from some of Taylor's movies, including ""Giant,"" ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" and ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf."" Also included was an undated clip showing the actress clad in a white swimsuit at poolside, her head wrapped in a towel, bidding for jewelry by phone. ""It's now $120,000,"" says an unidentified male voice from the other end of the line. ""Do you want me to bid?"" ""Yes!"" says Taylor, holding a cigarette, then leaning into the speakerphone. ""Darling, it sounds like things that are really desirable are going to go for 10 times what expected, right?"" ""That's the way it works,"" a male voice responds from the other end of the line. ""Holy cow!"" she says. At that, the Christie's audience breaks into laughter and applause. Her dazzling collection of jewels, many of which were given to her as presents by husbands, were referred to in September -- as the auction was being planned -- by Jonathan Rendell, deputy chairman of Christie's Americas, as ""the crown jewels of Hollywood."" Keith Penton, head of the jewelry department at Christie's, said then that Taylor's taste in jewels was ""extraordinarily refined. She really understood her gemstones (and) she had a passion for design and workmanship, quite a rare combination."" According to Nancy Schoenberger, co-author of the book ""Furious Love: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, The Marriage of the Century,"" Taylor developed her taste for jewels from a young age. ""Her father was an art and antiques dealer,"" Schoenberger said. But it wasn't until Taylor's marriage to Todd that her passion for collecting serious jewels took hold, Schoenberger said in September. Todd, Taylor's third husband, bought her a 29.4-carat diamond ring as well as a diamond tiara, which she wore to the 1957 Academy Awards. Schoenberger believes that when Burton bought Taylor the 33.19-carat Krupp Diamond ring in 1968 -- possibly the star piece in the exhibition at Christie's, estimated to fetch between $2.5 million and $3.5 million -- he was trying to out-do Mike Todd, who had died unexpectedly just over a year into his marriage with Taylor. ""I think that was a big deal for Richard, to buy her a diamond as big as Mike Todd's. And he liked showing that the son of a Welsh coal-miner could buy his lady love these extravagant jewels,"" she said. The actress, who died this year at age 79, eulogized her love of gems in her 2002 memoir, ""My Love Affair With Jewelry."" In it, she wrote: ""I never, never thought of my jewelry as trophies. I'm here to take care of them and to love them. When I die and they go off to auction I hope whoever buys them gives them a really good home."" In memory of the actress's life-long devotion to humanitarian causes, a portion of profits generated by admissions, events and select publications related to the sales will be donated to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation (ETAF), which she set up in 1991.

"(CNN) -- A 4.0-magnitude earthquake struck eastern Ohio on Saturday, one week after a similar but smaller tremor rattled the region, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake was centered 5 miles northwest of Youngstown and 6 miles southeast of Warren, the agency said. The quake's epicenter was 55 miles east-southeast of Cleveland, and 145 miles northeast of Columbus. According to the preliminary estimate, the earthquake struck 1.4 miles deep. There was a lot of shaking ""and a rumbling sound,"" said Jimmy Hughes, a former Youngstown police chief running for sheriff of Mahoning County. ""I could see the house move... It seemed like the ground was moving. "" The quake struck one day after Ohio Department of Natural Resources Director James Zehringer announced that work would be halted on a fluid-injection well in Youngstown, due to fears it could be contributing to a recent apparent spike in seismic activity in the area. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, an injection well ""is a device that places fluid deep underground into porous rock formations, such as sandstone or limestone, or into or below the shallow soil layer."" The decision came after the state of Ohio invited experts from Columbia University to collect more information about seismic activity in the area. The well is owned and permitted to North Star Disposal, a Youngstown company, according to the state. ""While conclusive evidence cannot link the seismic activity to the well, Zehringer has adopted an approach requiring prudence and caution regarding the site,"" the department said in a press release. Ben Lupo -- CEO of D&L Energy, an independent natural gas and oil exploration, production and marketing group that oversees the North Star well -- recently told CNN affiliate WKBN that there's full cooperation with experts, though he expressed grave doubts that the injection wells were to blame for the quakes. ""We have approximately 1,000 wells between Ohio and Pennsylvania and we've never had a problem ... with an earthquake or spill,"" Lupo said. One of the Columbia University experts, Dr. Won-Young Kim, said that a problem could arise if fluid moves through the ground and affects ""a weak fault, waiting to be triggered."" He explained the underground waste ""slowly migrates"" and could cause issues miles away, adding that the danger could persist for some time as the water travels and seeps down toward the fault. ""In my opinion, yes,"" the recent spate of earthquakes around Youngstown is related to this fluid-injection well, Kim claimed -- though there has been no definitive determination, by the state or authorities, indicating as much. There have been ""moderately frequent"" reports of earthquakes in northern Ohio since the first one was reported in 1823, the federal agency noted. A 1986 tremor, measuring magnitude 4.8, caused some damage. Another in 1998 measured a 4.5 and was centered in northwestern Pennsylvania. According to the Ohio Seismic Network, a 2.7-magnitude earthquake struck around Youngstown around 1:24 a.m. on December 24. ""No damage was reported,"" the network said on its website. The state of Ohio has documented 11 ""seismic events"" in 2011 -- each of them, at that point, of magnitude 2.7 or lower. The Department of Natural Resources Director noted that a 4.0 magnitude quake, like the one on Saturday, releases approximately 40 times more energy than a 2.7 magnitude tremor. Youngstown police Sgt. Michael Kawa said that the latest tremor ""shook the whole building we were in,"" but that there were no signs of significant damage in the city. That appeared to hold true elsewhere in the eastern Ohio city, based on early post-quake surveys. ""A lot of house alarms, it shook the buildings,"" Kawa said of the aftermath. ""The fire department hasn't reported any major damage."" Within just over three hours of the quake, nearly 4,000 people from 357 zip codes and 23 cities -- including one as far as Salem, Massachusetts, 515 miles from the epicenter -- had submitted reports to the U.S. Geological Survey's ""Did you feel it?"" form on its website. Ohio is far from the Earth's major tectonic plates, with the nearest ones in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, the U.S. Geological Survey explains on its website. Still, there are many known faults in this region, with the federal agency noting that it is likely there additional ""smaller or deeply buried"" ones that haven't been detected. ""Few, if any, earthquakes in the seismic zone can be linked to named faults,"" according to the geological survey. CNN's Dan Verello contributed to this report.","NEW: An expert says he thinks an injection well is related to the spate of Ohio quakes .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Novak Djokovic saved a match point before finally overcoming Tomas Berdych in his opening match of the ATP World Tour Finals in London on Monday. The Serbian triumphed 3-6 6-3 7-6 (7-3) against the seventh-ranked Czech in two hours and 40 minutes, after an injured Andy Murray went down to 2007 runner-up David Ferrer in the day's first Group A fixture. ""Throughout most of the match he was the better player, I was just hanging in there and I managed to get the win,"" Djokovic said. ""You have to be top of your game in order to win the matches in this event. I wasn't on top of my game but I managed to take my chances."" Berdych beat Djokovic in the 2010 Wimbledon semifinals but had lost their seven other encounters on hard courts. He raced to a 4-0 lead in the first set as his opponent looked rusty after pulling out in the Paris Masters quarterfinals due to shoulder problems which have worried him since winning the U.S. Open in September. Nadal edges Fish in Group B marathon . Djokovic came back strongly in the second, and had to battle back from 4-2 down in the decider and then escaped at 6-5 on his own serve as Berdych hit the net with a forehand. The 26-year-old made more nervous errors in the tiebreak as Djokovic went 5-1 clear, inexplicably hitting another forehand wide and then smashing a volley long. It was Djokovic's 70th win in 74 matches this season, in which he has won three of the four grand slam events and toppled Rafael Nadal from the top of the rankings. He won the season-ending championships in 2008 before it moved from Shanghai to the UK capital. The 24-year-old is second in the group after Ferrer's straight-sets win, but can redress that when he meets the Spaniard on Wednesday. Can Federer make finals history? World No. 3 Murray said he will decide on Tuesday whether he will be fit enough to continue against Berdych after struggling with a groin injury during his 6-4 7-5 defeat by Ferrer. ""You've got to sometimes do the right thing. I didn't know exactly how it was going to feel on the court today,"" the Scot said after his second defeat in 19 matches since the U.S. Open -- the other one came against Berdych in Paris this month. ""I haven't been able to do too much training this week. I played, I didn't feel particularly great. I'll see if I feel any better tomorrow."" Fifth-ranked Ferrer was delighted after ending a run of four defeats to Murray. ""I'm very happy. I beat Andy, in London, in his home. It is not easy. I played very consistent all the match,"" he said. ""I think it was important to start winning the match, and if you win in two sets it is better with the group. You know you need to win one more match, because it is very difficult to reach the semifinals winning only one match. I think this tournament is very, very special. It is very important."" Top doubles seeds Mike and Bob Bryan won their opening Group A match, with the Americans beating seventh-ranked U.S. Open champions Jurgen Melzer of Austria and Philipp Petzschner of Germany 6-7 (4-7) 7-5 10-7.

"(CNN) -- Vice President Xi Jinping of China, the man set become the country's next paramount leader, is scheduled to meet with President Barack Obama and other officials on Tuesday during a U.S. visit that is likely to help burnish Xi's statesmanly credentials at home and abroad. The planned meetings have thrust Xi, who is expected to become head of the ruling Communist Party later this year, onto center stage in both the American and Chinese news media. Hu undertook a similar visit 10 years ago as he was being groomed for the top job. But beneath the carefully choreographed presentation of the high-profile meetings lies a range of contentious issues on which Xi has little incentive to give ground, including trade and China's growing military presence. ""I think he's going to be be tough with a smile on his face,"" said James McGregor, senior counselor for the communications firm APCO Worldwide in China. ""He's gonna appear to be a very friendly man. But he has to be tough because he's still talking to an audience back here."" The subject of Xi's five-day trip and what it portends for U.S.-Chinese relations in the coming years has received heavy coverage in state-run media in China. ""The U.S. has never met a competitor like China before,"" the Global Times, an English-language newspaper run by the Communist Party, said in an editorial published Monday that noted China's global clout in manufacturing and exports. The Obama administration, under pressure from stubbornly high unemployment figures in an election year, has already taken steps concerning China's role in global trade. Obama mentioned China by name when he announced in his State of the Union address last month that he was creating a trade enforcement unit to bring cases against other countries. There is also persistent tension over China's efforts to control the level of its currency, the renminbi, which U.S. officials say make it undervalued. Xi, 58, is very well versed in these issues, according to Jon Huntsman, the former Republican presidential hopeful who was U.S. ambassador to China between 2009 and 2011. ""He's gone out of his way in recent years to bone up economics and trade, knowing full well that these are the issues that are going to determine whether or not the United States and China are able to get through the years to come,"" Huntsman said. Chinese officials are aware of U.S. concerns, but Xi and other leaders face the challenge of keeping China's hundreds of millions of workers content as economic growth starts to ease from the torrid levels of recent years. Policy makers in Beijing are grappling with how to tackle rapidly rising prices and the widening gap between rich and poor. ""I want a job,"" said Xie Yingling, an unemployed welder in the coastal province of Fujian, where Xi used to be governor. ""Our local economy is just bad. I find even a bowl of noodles too expensive here."" Xi's engagements in the United States began Monday with a dinner in Washington attended by the former U.S. secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright. He was given a less cordial welcome by activists advocating Tibetan independence who started unfurling a banner on Arlington Memorial Bridge in Washington on Monday afternoon. The activists were detained by the police before being released. Beijing has been struggling in recent weeks to contain unrest among ethnic Tibetans in the southwestern province of Sichuan. It has sent additional security forces to the region after Tibetan protesters set themselves on fire and clashed with police to express frustration with Chinese rule. On Tuesday, Xi was scheduled to meet with Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He will also attend a round-table discussion with U.S. and Chinese business executives. After Washington, Xi will travel Wednesday to Iowa, a state he first visited as a local official in the 1980s. He is visiting the United States amid the rhetoric and political uncertainty of presidential election campaigning. But upheaval is also under way in China through the leadership transition that is set to result in Xi's taking charge later this year. With about 70% of the country's top 200 officials expected to be swapped out during the process, Huntsman said Xi is ""stepping into the forefront of China's political leadership structure at a time of enormous change.""","The Chinese vice president is in the United States for a five-day visit .

"Palo Alto, California (CNN) -- The Internet doesn't have a flag or a national anthem, but it does have a government. For the most part that would be the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers , which faces near-constant scrutiny from countries, corporations and netizens. Think of ICANN as the head referee of a heated sporting event, under fire from all sides and rarely able to please everyone. Last week, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission wrote a letter saying ICANN has long failed to provide safeguards that protect consumers from online swindlers and help cybersecurity officials catch such crooks. In the letter, the FTC also criticized a major ICANN initiative that would let Internet users run their own domain-name extensions, to accompany .com, .org and others. The federal agency fears that a quick expansion of domains, a project that has been several years in the making, would increase the likelihood that scammers could trick people who enter common misspellings, such as Amazon.comm. The government is also concerned that it will have a more difficult time getting information about website owners after the switch. ""The potential for consumer harm is great, and ICANN has the responsibility both to assess and mitigate these risks,"" four top FTC officials wrote in a joint memo. The FTC's criticisms are just another in a series of legal battles, political pressures and public name-calling that comes with being the most visible party overseeing the global Internet. There are several other governmental gatekeepers for the Web, but ICANN gets the most attention, and ire. As for the domain expansion, ICANN officials say they are working to improve the data they can provide to governments and police, and that they have stringent rules in place for who can register which extensions. Another ongoing controversy, the .XXX extension for porn sites, was initially resisted by ICANN's board of directors. But the organization now supports it and may have to defend that stance in court against adult-entertainment companies who fear the .XXX domains will marginalize their sites. How ICANN works . At the helm of this 23-year-old organization is ICANN president and CEO Rod Beckstrom, a confident and excitable executive with a helmet of long blond hair. Beckstrom and his 130 or so employees receive a lot of guff, but they aren't afraid to give some back. He says he has serious concerns about a bill in the U.S. Congress called the Stop Online Piracy Act, which shifts much of the blame for carrying illegal content onto website publishers. ICANN, based near Los Angeles in Marina del Rey, California, was once closely tied to the U.S. government. Although it must keep its headquarters in the United States by contract, it has bases in Belgium and Australia. The United States has sometimes reluctantly loosened its grip over Internet governance. Proposals for new Internet initiatives are often handed to ICANN by various Internet registry organizations, and the ICANN board votes on each. The organization has to consider recommendations from a committee of national governments, and many countries have strong opinions. With the Stop Online Piracy Act in the United States or systems in China and other Asian countries proposing major changes to who is responsible for what information is posted online, ICANN has to pick its battles and juggle hundreds of competing interests. Its critics often overpower its allies. As Internet access begins to reach practically every part of the world through the proliferation of smartphones, the network is at risk of being pulled in many different directions -- or splintering, as it has behind China's Great Firewall. No government wants to be the next victim of a so-called social-media coup, in which the freewheeling nature of the Web becomes a target for censorship. ""ICANN stays neutral, and it has to keep running,"" Beckstrom said in a recent interview from his office here in Silicon Valley. ""We're a lot like Switzerland."" A frequent target . In international politics, Switzerland is typically neutral but rarely controversial. On the other hand, ICANN receives plenty of blowback for its policies, including for those with which it has little or no direct involvement. For example, ICANN has been criticized for being slow to respond to a shortage of Web addresses that could make certain websites inaccessible to some people. However, ICANN has a fairly small role in this transition from Internet Protocol version 4 to 6, ICANN chairman Steve Crocker said in a phone interview. ""ICANN's role in all of this is very restricted, but we often get looked at as the center of these things,"" Crocker said. ICANN officials say its own initiatives, such as .XXX and the global domain expansion, are controversial but necessary as the Internet keeps growing. ""Any time you take a system that started out small and expand it hugely, you get a lot of changes,"" said Crocker, who was a member of the team that posted the first message to ARPANET, the Internet's predecessor. Like any government, ICANN is said to make decisions slowly. Crocker defends ICANN's process as thorough and sufficient. After a change has been implemented, it is generally up to each country's government to enforce the rules or systems set up by ICANN. ""We don't have the authority of being a government,"" he said. ""If we did, that would create more problems."" The Internet's governmental bodies say they are more effective at getting things done than America's political system, which is often seen as polarized and gridlocked. The Internet has an effective system of checks and balances, said John Curran, the president and CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers. The registry is one of five international groups that propose new initiatives to ICANN. ""If people (in national government) would take time to listen as much as they postulate their views, then we would have progress,"" Curran said by phone last week. ""We have people actually discuss the issues. We don't have people showing up with fixed positions."" The Interplanetary Internet . In the efficiency-obsessed technology sector, ICANN has streamlined its system of yearly goals under Beckstrom, a former finance executive for Morgan Stanley who transitioned to high tech and cashed out at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. Beckstrom, who has also served as a director for the U.S. National Cybersecurity Center, plans to step down in July. ICANN said last week it is searching for a replacement. Vint Cerf, a sage-like founding father of the Internet, has discovered ways to continue contributing to Internet governance since stepping down as ICANN chairman in 2007. He is a vice president for Google with the unusual title of chief Internet evangelist. ""The Internet doesn't just happen,"" Cerf said by phone. ""It's a continued battle to keep it as open and accessible and free as possible. And it's hard to do."" Some of Cerf's attention has shifted to something called the Interplanetary Internet. As its name implies, the plan involves designing a network that can work in outer space. Light speed is fine for the Earth's Internet, but it is an obstacle when sending an e-mail to Mars. But the Internet still faces major hurdles on its home planet. Cerf said he believes governmental organizations, like ICANN, will need to continue to adapt. ""These institutions got created in response to the forces in the ecosystem,"" Cerf said. ""I would not say that this was top-down architected. I don't think it could be, because these institutions got created as the demands made themselves apparent."" As new demands and stakeholders emerge, the Internet and its stewards will find obstacles, whether it's an overzealous government or the speed of light.","ICANN is an international organization that governs the Internet .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams could have been banned from her home U.S. Open after Sunday's final outburst, but the three-time champion has escaped with a $2,000 fine from the United States Tennis Association. The American, on a two-year probation after a similar attack on a match official at the same tournament in 2009, verbally lashed out at umpire Eva Asderaki at the start of the second set of her defeat by Australia's Samantha Stosur on Sunday. The 29-year-old was penalized for ""intentional hindrance"" after celebrating winning a point before it was over, and then remonstrated with the Greek official. Tournament officials ruled that Williams' comments did not constitute a major offense. Has Serena Williams been judged too harshly? ""U.S. Open Tournament Referee Brian Earley has fined Serena Williams $2,000 following the code violation issued for verbal abuse during the women's singles final. This fine is consistent with similar offenses at Grand Slam events,"" the U.S. Tennis Association said in a statement on Monday. ""After independently reviewing the incident which served as the basis for the code violation, and taking into account the level of fine imposed by the U.S. Open referee, the Grand Slam Committee Director has determined that Ms. Williams' conduct, while verbally abusive, does not rise to the level of a major offense under the Grand Slam Code of Conduct.""

"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney has defended himself from criticism by Roberto Mancini following Sunday's Manchester derby, in which the United striker scored two goals but appeared to play a role in City's captain being sent off. City manager Mancini has officially appealed against Chris Foy's decision to dismiss Kompany in the 12th minute of the 3-2 home defeat that ended his side's English FA Cup title defense at the first hurdle, and blamed Rooney for influencing the referee. Kompany slid in with two feet to win the ball off United winger Nani, who did not appeal for a foul -- but Rooney ran straight to the official and Foy ruled that it was a dangerous tackle. ""It was not a red card. Rooney told him his decision,"" Mancini told reporters after the match, before referring to an incident last week when he gesticulated from the touchline to have an opposing player punished. ""When I did this against Liverpool, people told me not to do it. I said I was sorry and made a mistake."" Who are football's top January transfer targets? Rooney, however, insisted on his Twitter account that he had done no wrong. ""Funny how people think i got kompany sent off. Im not ref. i didn't give red card. But it was a clear red card. 2 footed tackle,"" he wrote on the social networking website on Monday. United boss Alex Ferguson agreed with Rooney that Kompany deserved to be sent off. ""I think so, I've seen him do it before -- he maybe got off in the past. I think if he catches Nani then he's got a problem."" Scholes in shock return as Man Utd beat FA Cup holders Man City . City's appeal will be heard ahead of Wednesday's first leg of the English League Cup semifinal against Liverpool. If it fails, Kompany will miss that home match, the second leg and Premier League games against Wigan and third-placed Tottenham due to it being his second red card this season. His absence would be a blow to City's hopes of winning a first league title since 1968, with the league leaders already lacking central defensive cover as Kolo Toure is away at the African Cup of Nations along with his brother, key midfielder Yaya. That could mean a recall for 21-year-old Dedryck Boyata, who is on loan at Premier League strugglers Bolton, or Nedum Onuoha -- who had been expected to leave in the January transfer window as Mancini seeks to free up funds to make new signings.","Wayne Rooney insists that he did not influence the referee's decision to send off opponent .

"(CNN) -- Wales went to the top of rugby union's Six Nations Championship with a 27-13 win over Scotland Sunday at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. It was the second straight victory for the Welsh, who beat Ireland 23-21 in their opener in Dublin. They next face England, who have also won their first two matches, at Twickenham where a victory will give them the Triple Crown. Scotland, beaten by England at Murrayfield last weekend, battled to hold Wales to 3-3 at halftime. But the home side dominated the second half with two tries from full-back Leigh Halfpenny, with wing Alex Cuthbert also crossing. Halfpenny ended with a tally of 22 points while Scotland had the consolation of scoring their first try in five Tests as they battled bravely to stay in the match. New fly-half Greig Laidlaw, in for the retired Dan Parks, crossed for the Scots, but they suffered for losing backs Nick de Luca and Rory Lamont to the sin bin after the break. Down to 13-men, the Welsh took full advantage to take control and Scotland were left contemplate the wooden spoon after two straight defeats. ""Yellow cards are always crucial in this day and age so everybody has to work on their discipline,"" Wales flanker and man-of-the-match Dan Lydiate told BBC Sport. ""Once we go through the phases we know we're dangerous, but fair play to Scotland they came back into it."" Wales played without captain Sam Warburton, who pulled out just before the start of the match through a niggling injury. England scored a narrow win over Italy Saturday in the only other Six Nations match played this weekend. The clash between France and Ireland was called off due to a frozen pitch at the Stade de France.","Wales beat Scotland 27-13 in Cardiff in Six Nations .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy is enjoying the best year of his fledgling golf career, but the U.S. Open champion is already making plans to spread his wings further. The 22-year-old announced on Friday that he is leaving the manager who helped turn him into potentially the next Tiger Woods, as he seeks to push himself to a new level. The world No. 3 is departing Andrew ""Chubby"" Chandler's International Sports Management, which looks after second-ranked Lee Westwood, Masters winner Charl Schwartzel and British Open champion Darren Clarke. He will link up with fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell, the 2010 U.S. Open champion, at Dublin-based sports agency Horizon as he rejoins the PGA Tour next year. ""I am now keen to move onto the next stage of my career and I feel this will be facilitated by a fresh view and a new structure around me,"" McIlroy said in a statement. ""Therefore I am delighted to be joining Horizon and I look forward to working with my new team. ""I would like to sincerely thank Andrew 'Chubby' Chandler and his team for their guidance, representation and management over the past four years since turning pro. ""Chubby and his team have played a very important role in my success to date. I have made great progress under their management and for that I will always be grateful."" McIlroy joined ISM after being the best-finishing amateur at the 2007 British Open, and the company wished him future success. ""It has been an honour representing Rory and we take great pride in the role ISM has played in guiding him successfully through his formative years as a professional golfer,"" it said in a statement. ""Under our management he has grown into an international figure, and he leaves us as a major champion."" Meanwhile, former world No. 2 Sergio Garcia was in contention to win his first title in three years after taking the halfway lead on his home course at the Castello Masters on Friday. The Spaniard, now ranked 49th, shot a sizzling eight-under-par 63 in the second round to go two shots clear at the Club de Campo del Mediterraneo club where he has played since he was a child. Sweden's Alexander Noren matched that score to be second on 10-under 132, two strokes clear of England's first-round leader Ross McGowan (70), Scotland's Gary Orr (67) and Australia's Marcus Fraser (64). ""It's getting there,"" Garcia told the European Tour website.

"(CNN) -- More than 1,000 people are missing in the aftermath of a tropical storm that wreaked havoc across the southern Philippines last weekend, the country's government said Friday, as it grappled with the mounting humanitarian crisis in the region. A total of 1,079 people remain unaccounted for, the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said in a statement. Earlier in the week, the disaster council said it had lost count of the number of missing as it tried to assess the scale of the destruction. The death toll from Tropical Storm Washi, which set off landslides and flash floods that swept away whole villages, has risen to 1,080, according to the council. The United Nations said Wednesday that the storm has created ""huge"" humanitarian needs on the island of Mindanao, the scene of the worst devastation. It has made an appeal to raise $28 million to deal with the immediate problems in the area, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced in and around the port cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro. ""I was shocked by scale of destruction I saw,"" David Carden, the head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Philippines told CNN on Thursday after visiting the region. He said it looked as if an ""inland tsunami had struck the area."" Around 675,000 people have been affected by the storm, the disaster council said Friday, with more than 300,000 of them being taken care of at evacuation centers at the moment. President Benigno Aquino of the Philippines has declared a state of national calamity following the storm. The disaster council said it estimated the cost of the damage caused by the storm at more than one billion Philippines pesos ($23 million).","A total of 1,079 people remain unaccounted for after Tropical Storm Washi, the government says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States has seen no unexpected moves by the North Korean military since the announcement of Kim Jong Il's death, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday. Gen. Martin Dempsey said the United States is remaining ""vigilant"" in the wake of the death of the North Korean leader. In the first extended on the record comments from a senior U.S. official, Dempsey told a small group of reporters he was awakened overnight to receive the news and immediately joined in an inter-agency phone call of high levels officials to discuss the situation. Dempsey said the call centered on identifying the key military and intelligence indicators that the U.S. would need to watch for any early warning of instability in the regime. Though Kim died on Saturday, U.S. officials only learned of his death from North Korean television on Sunday night . ""The chain of command military and civilian very quickly coalesced around the fact that Kim Jong Il had died,"" Dempsey said. ""We quickly established a network of leaders to discuss this issue and to determine what we could do to contribute to understanding what might happen next."" U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta spoke with his South Korean counterpart, Kim Kwan-Jin, on Monday morning, said Pentagon spokesman George Little. ""He made it clear that the United States stands with the Republic of Korea in this time of uncertainty,"" Little said. ""Both men agree it is critical to remain prudent in regards to all matters relating to our security posture there, and pledge to keep one another informed in the coming days. Both men agree this is a delicate time, and they need to closely monitor developments in North Korea."" So far there are no signs of movement of troops or weapons by the North Koreans, Little said. This summer, the commander of American troops in South Korea told Congress that the United States does not believe Kim Jong Un will differ much in decision making from his father or in adjusting the country's strategic priorites. However, Gen. James Thurman warned of the wildcard of having such a young, inexperienced leader. ""Kim Jong-un's youth and inexperience increase the likelihood of miscalculation, as does the imperative for him to establish credibility with the military hardliners he needs to support succession,"" Thurman told the Senate Armed Services Committee in a written answer. Dempsey said Monday that the U.S. Pacific Command has reported it has sufficient intelligence assets in the area to keep surveillance on North Korea, but it may shift some capabilities to the peninsula from where they are currently located in the region. U.S. troops in South Korea are not on any heightened state of alert, U.S. military officials said. ""The commander continually assesses our security level and makes adjustments as necessary. But we're operating under what's called 'normal armistice conditions.' In other words, the level of readiness is as it is on any given day,"" Jennifer Buschick, spokeswoman for U.S. Forces-Korea, told CNN. U.S. Forces-Korea's official website lists the current Force Protection level as ""Bravo,"" with some selected measures at a more heightened ""Charlie"" level. That means they've stepped up patrols of bases, tightened gate security and ordered troops to pay special attention to ""designated vulnerable points"" both on and off base. But these measures were in place before Kim Jong Il's death, along with a recent reinstatement of an overnight curfew for U.S. troops in South Korea. Separately, a senior American military official says the test-firing of two short-range missiles by North Korea was expected and not considered related to the current situation. ""There are strong indications (the missile test) was pre-planned, and there is no nexus to the death of the North Korean leader,"" the military official said.","No sign of movement of troops or weapons, general says .

"(CNN) -- The coffin of former Czech President Vaclav Havel went on display in St. Anna's Church in central Prague Monday for people to pay their respects, the Czech News Agency reported. Havel died Sunday at the age of 75, and his funeral has been scheduled for Friday, the Czech president's office said. Admirers poured into the streets of Prague Sunday night with candles and flowers in memory of Havel, people on the scene said. The former dissident playwright helped topple communism in eastern Europe through the power of his words, insisting, ""Truth and love triumph over lies and hate."" His longtime friend and translator Paul Wilson remembered him as a ""a very shy and gentle man with a will of steel, who was fearless when confronting a regime that tried, relentlessly, to crush his spirit."" Havel, a puckish, absurdist playwright turned political activist, spent four and a half years in prison for opposing Czechslovakia's communist government before emerging as a leader of the Velvet Revolution that swept it aside in 1989. He went on to become president of Czechoslovakia and of the Czech Republic when the country split in two at the end of 1992. He died peacefully in his sleep Sunday morning in the presence of his wife, Dagmar, according to his spokeswoman Sabina Tancevova. A deeply serious thinker given to long, rambling statements in presidential speeches and conversation, Havel also had an impish sense of humor, reportedly whizzing through the long corridors of Prague Castle on a scooter after becoming president. It was his love of rock and roll as much as his moral outrage at the communist system that brought him to prominence. He co-wrote the influential Charter 77 anti-communist declaration in protest at the arrest of a Czechoslovak rock band, the Plastic People of the Universe. A perennial contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, Havel never won, but he remained active in anti-communist causes from Cuba to China until his death. He urged Chinese authorities to release dissident Liu Xiaobo, whose Charter 08 call for greater political freedom in China was inspired by Czechoslovakia's Charter 77. Havel and other Czech dissidents attempted to deliver a letter to the Chinese Embassy in January 2010, before Liu won the Nobel Peace Prize, but they found the doors closed and no one to receive it. It was an absurd scene that could have come out of one of the plays he wrote in the 1960s, poking fun at the Soviet-backed authorities who ruled his country at the time. Theater proved a potent weapon against Czechoslovakia's communist rulers, who stepped down without a shot being fired in the weeks after the Berlin Wall fell, signaling the defeat of the region's authoritarian Moscow-backed regimes. Havel was unanimously elected president by the last communist-run parliament of Czechoslovakia 22 years ago this month, and two months later delivered a speech to a historic joint session of the U.S. Congress. The trip to Washington as president of his country came less than four months after Havel was last arrested by the communist authorities, leading him to tell Congress dryly: ""It is all very extraordinary indeed."" His country joined NATO and the European Union under his stewardship, but he lost out on many of the major domestic political battles of his presidency, including his effort to keep Czechoslovakia together. He resigned as president of Czechoslovakia after national politicians agreed to divide it in two, declaring, ""I will not be president of a self-liquidating nation."" He went on to be elected president of the Czech Republic twice before writing one final play, ""Leaving,"" about a politician preparing to hand over power to a successor he despises -- widely considered one last dig at his perennial political opponent Vaclav Klaus, his successor as president. Klaus Sunday called Havel a ""symbol of our renewed nation."" Havel spoke to CNN's Jim Clancy in March, reflecting on links between the Arab Spring and the fall of communism in eastern Europe. ""What is also sleeping under the surface and is invisible is a longing for certain elementary freedoms and that doesn't usually break out just like that, by itself,"" Havel said. ""The snowball is created, it's rolling and rolling and, very often, it turns into an avalanche."" ""Like millions around the world, I was inspired by his words and leadership. ... Vaclav Havel was a friend to America and to all who strive for freedom and dignity, and his words will echo through the ages,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement. Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Havel as a ""dignified, charming, humble, determined man"" who ""suffered much in the cause of freedom and became one of its greatest heroes."" But in his typically understated way, Havel expressed more modest wishes for how history would remember him. ""I would be glad if it was felt that I have done something generally useful,"" he said. ""I don't care much about personal fame or popularity. I would be satisfied with the feeling that I had a chance to help with something in general, something good. That history gave me that chance.""","Former dissident and playwright Vaclav Havel's funeral will be Friday .

"(CNN) -- Gareth Bale scored both goals as Tottenham Hotspur bolstered their burgeoning title challenge in the English Premier League with a 2-0 win at Norwich Tuesday night. The comfortable victory lifted Tottenham four points clear of fourth-placed Chelsea in the standings and within seven of Manchester City and Manchester United at the top. Harry Redknapp's men also have a game in hand over all their nearest rivals and while qualification for next season's Champions League remains a more realistic expectation, the manner of their win in East Anglia would have again raised even greater hopes among their supporters. The home side have surprised a number of teams on their return to the top-flight but had few sights of goal on their home ground and did not win a corner until deep into the second half. Welshman Bale, who wasted opportunities in the first half, finally found the target in the 55th minute at Carrow Road as Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor set him up to fire past home goalkeeper John Ruddy. His second displayed his individual brilliance as sent away by Luka Modric, the flying winger outpaced Zak Whitbread before chipping Ruddy for this seventh league goal of the season. More might have followed as Tottenham kept a stranglehold on possession but they will go into their next two fixtures over the seasonal period against Swansea and West Bromwich Albion with great confidence. ""We've learned a lot from last year being in the Champions League,"" man of the match Bale told Sky Sports. He added: ""As long as we are creating chances that's the main thing. ""We were confident we would get one whoever it fell to and lucky enough it was . me."" Earlier Tuesday, Tottenham's north London rivals Arsenal were held to a frustrating 1-1 draw by 10-man Wolves at the Emirates Stadium. It left Arsene Wenger's men in fifth place, 12 points behind Manchester City and Manchester United and five adrift of Spurs. Gervinho put Arsenal ahead in the eighth minute after being put through by Israeli international Yossi Benayoun. But Wolves, again battling relegation, leveled just before halftime as Steven Fletcher reacted quickly to head home. In the second half, Arsenal thought they should have had a penalty when Christophe Berra appeared to handball and the visitors were reduced to 10 men when Nenad Milijas was sent off for a foul on Mikel Arteta. With a man advantage, the prolific Robin van Persie was kept out by Wolves keeper Wayne Hennessey, who also saved superbly from Thomas Vermaelen as Wolves held out for a point. ""It is very frustrating,"" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told AFP. ""You won't play many draws like that in a season but sometimes it can happen."" In Tuesday's other match, promoted clubs Swansea and QPR shared the points in a 1-1 draw at the Liberty Stadium. Swansea took a 14th-minute lead through striker Danny Graham, with QPR appealing for handball. The visitors leveled in the second half when Jamie Mackie latched on to Swansea midfielder Jamie Britton's misjudged back header and shot under Michel Vorm to score.","Tottenham Hotspur win 2-0 at Norwich in English Premier League .

"Washington (CNN) -- Setting up a showdown with the White House and Senate Democrats, House Republican leaders Thursday proceeded with plans to vote next week on a proposal to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits while easing the path for approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Meanwhile, the Senate blocked competing Democratic and Republican proposals to extend the payroll tax cut from proceeding Thursday, with both failing to get the 60 votes necessary. Senate Republicans halted the Democratic proposal on a 50-48 vote. It included a surtax on income over $1 million to help pay for the lower payroll tax rate. Republicans seeking to shrink the size of government oppose such a tax increase. Opposition from both parties blocked the Republican measure, with only 22 votes in favor and 76 against it. The measure would have been paid for by freezing federal pay as well as reducing the federal work force by 10%, provisions rejected by President Barack Obama and Democrats. The outcome means party leaders and Obama must work out a compromise by the end of the year, when the payroll tax cut is set to expire, or face the wrath of Americans facing higher taxes in the election year of 2012. On the House side, Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told a closed-door meeting of GOP members that he was ready for a ""fight"" with Obama over the pipeline issue, according to two senior Republican leadership aides in the meeting. Cheers went up in the room after Boehner's comment, the aides said. On Wednesday, Obama said he would reject any attempt by Republicans to tie the pipeline project to the payroll tax extension issue. The House proposal would shift authority from the State Department to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approving the proposed pipeline from Canada's oil sands production in northern Alberta to Texas. It also would shorten the time frame for a decision. The State Department recently said its decision would be delayed until 2013 to examine environmental issues raised by critics, a move Republicans labeled as political to put off the issue until after next year's presidential election. Boehner told reporters after Thursday's meeting that the pipeline project would generate ""tens of thousands of jobs immediately."" He also noted that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper supports the plan. The State Department puts the jobs figure at 5,000-6,000, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, slammed the House GOP proposal on Thursday as a ""partisan joke that has no chance of passing the Senate."" The impasse sets up another countdown clock on congressional action, this time before the end-of-year holiday recess scheduled to begin at the end of next week. Obama told reporters Thursday that he was willing to stay in Washington ""as long as it takes to make sure that the American people's taxes don't go up on January 1st and to make sure that folks who desperately need unemployment insurance get that help."" ""There is absolutely no excuse for us not getting it done,"" Obama said, adding that his response to efforts by Republicans ""to see what can they extract from us in order to get this done"" was ""just do the right thing."" Referring specifically to the Keystone project, Obama said that ""however many jobs might be generated by a Keystone pipeline, there are going to be a lot fewer than the jobs that are created by extending the payroll tax cut and extending unemployment insurance."" The House proposal, which Boehner and other leaders outlined to GOP members at Thursday's meeting, was largely similar to one they discussed last week, according to several aides. It would extend the payroll tax cut for one year, continuing savings of $1,000 for families earning $50,000. It also includes unemployment assistance but gives states the ability to reform the program -- including removal of a federal ban from the 1960s that prohibited states from drug-testing those who apply for unemployment benefits. The GOP legislation would also shorten the time period for receiving jobless aid benefits from the current level of 99 weeks, phasing it down to 59 weeks by the middle of 2012. In addition, the bill would avoid a scheduled cut in payments for Medicare physicians for two years -- the so-called ""doc fix."" Boehner noted that the bill is ""fully paid for,"" and aides said the bulk of the cost would be offset from a freeze on salaries of federal employees and members of Congress through 2015. The measure would use funds from health care programs to pay for the Medicare ""doc fix"" provision. Last week, GOP leaders encountered significant resistance from conservatives when they outlined their plan, with a bloc of members opposing any renewal of the payroll tax cut because the bill uses spending cuts over 10 years to pay for a one-year extension. Some of those critics later said that after they talked through their concerns with leaders, they don't want to see a tax increase during the tough economy, even though they don't support the structure of the payroll tax cut. Republican leaders also added a couple of new spending cuts to help attract conservative support. One would eliminate the child tax credit for those in the country illegally, and another would not renew a research-and-development tax credit focused on energy programs. Some Republicans noted that Obama's comments the day before opposing any effort to link extending the payroll tax cut to the Keystone pipeline helped rally support for the plan. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, leader of the fiscally conservative Republican Study Group, said he supports the bill, adding: ""Frankly, the fact that the president doesn't like it makes me like it even more."" Asked about overcoming divisions among Republicans, Boehner said feedback on the proposal was good and that ""I feel confident about our ability to move ahead."" The House is expected to vote on the bill early next week, according to several aides. Even though the Republican plan could muster a majority of votes in the House, it is likely to encounter major obstacles in the Democratic-led Senate. The payroll tax issue, a headache for Republicans already, threatens to become a major campaign theme for 2012. Obama touched on it Tuesday in a policy address in Kansas, saying Republicans protected wealthy taxpayers from a tax increase during deficit negotiations this year, but now threaten to block the payroll tax cut extension. Blocking it would cause most Americans to pay higher taxes next year. Republicans, who oppose tax increases in keeping with their push to shrink the size of government, argue that Obama and Democrats are forcing votes on proposals they know won't pass in order to score political points. So far, the public backs the Democratic position, with polls showing majority support for increasing the tax burden on wealthy Americans to help pay for the measure. Republicans are on the defensive due to their history of arguing that tax cuts end up paying for themselves because they stimulate economic activity by letting consumers keep more of their money instead of giving it to the government. Democrats are quick to point out that the mounting federal deficits dominating the Washington discussion were caused in part by reduced revenue due to tax cuts from the Bush administration. Now both parties agree that any measure to extend the payroll tax cut should include provisions to reduce spending or raise revenue to offset the cost. As part of a budget-cutting deal last December, Obama and Congress negotiated a reduction of 2 percentage points in the payroll tax rate -- from 6.2% to 4.2%. With the reduced rate expiring on January 1, Obama and Democrats seek to expand the provision by lowering the rate even further -- to 3.1% -- for another year. Republicans initially opposed the idea, saying the provision failed to create jobs last year. Republican leaders now say they support an extension, but they differ with Obama and Democrats on how to pay for it. The latest Senate Democratic plan calls for a 1.9% surtax on income over $1 million, as well as increased fees that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac charge mortgage lenders to guarantee repayment of new mortgage loans to cover the $180 billion cost. Republicans oppose the plan because they say it will increase the tax burden on small-business owners, a contention the White House says is false. In their compromise, Collins and McCaskill included a provision to exempt the income of small-business owners from the surtax. However, House Republicans questioned whether it was possible to legislate such a distinction.

"(CNN) -- The first of twin research spacecraft entered the moon's orbit Saturday, part of an effort to learn more about how it and other terrestrial bodies formed, NASA said. The GRAIL-A -- which launched from Florida's Cape Canaveral on September 10, along with its sister spacecraft GRAIL-B -- began a ""lunar orbit insertion burn"" at about 4:30 p.m. ET, NASA said on an associated Twitter feed. That burn was set to finish around 5 p.m. The second in the pair, GRAIL-B, will follow suit Sunday. ""Burn complete! #GRAIL-A is now orbiting the moon and awaiting the arrival of its twin #GRAIL-B on New Year's Day,"" NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced on Twitter. The two orbiters, each 3 1/2 feet high and 2 1/2 feet deep, are named for NASA's Gravity Recovery And Interior Laboratory. They will fly in tandem orbits, measuring the gravity field and ideally answering ""longstanding questions about the moon and (giving) scientists a better understanding of how Earth and other rocky planets in the solar system formed,"" according to NASA. The moon is about 250,000 miles from Earth, a distance that NASA's Apollo crews reached in about three days. But the GRAIL spacecrafts took much longer, namely 3Â½ months, because they covered more than 2.5 million miles ""reshaping and merging their orbits"" so that they could be better positioned and coordinated to study the moon, NASA said. The orbiters, whose mission was timed to miss lunar eclipses in December and June, are expected to collect data for 82 days. Maria Zuber, principal investigator for GRAIL, said the moon remains mysterious in many ways and little is known about the process of how it was formed. Scientists theorize that the moon formed when a Mars-sized object crashed into Earth. It remains unknown why the near side of the moon is so different from the far side. The basins are flooded with volcanic material on one side, and the other side has mountainous highlands. Why did these sides evolve differently? ""We think the answer is locked in the interior,"" Zuber said at a NASA news briefing Wednesday. A study published in the journal Nature over the summer suggested that there may have been a second moon moving at about the same speed as our moon, and in the same orbit. The second moon bumped into the original moon, the theory goes, and caused the formation of a mountain instead of a crater. This model predicts the whole exterior of the moon was once molten and cooled from the outside in such a way that when the second moon hit our moon, it pushed all of that molten material to the near side. GRAIL can help test this hypothesis. The spacecraft are designed to help scientists explore the interior of the moon indirectly by measuring the pull of gravity as they fly over the surface. With data about these changes in gravity and topography, scientists will be able to construct a map of what's inside our celestial neighbor. Scientists wanted the spacecraft to be as small as possible so they could launch in one rocket. But they weren't sure if the orbiters would make it through eclipses that happen at the moon every six months, since their technology depends on lithium-ion batteries and solar panels. A lunar eclipse occurred in early December, and the next one is in June. Based on the current performance, scientists think GRAIL can continue through the June eclipse. Should one of the orbiters completely fail, scientists could not get the high precision they would get from the two spacecraft; the mission depends on having both, Zuber said. If the lunar orbit insertion doesn't happen for one of the spacecraft, there would be another opportunity to try again in late April.","NEW: One of two NASA research spacecraft begins orbiting the moon .

""The attempted terror attack in Thailand proves once again that Iran and its proxies continue to operate in the ways of terror and the latest attacks are an example of that,"" said Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who issued the statement from Singapore, where he is currently traveling. ""Iran and Hezbollah are unrelenting terror elements endangering the stability of the region, and endangering the stability of the world,"" Barak added. Two Iranians are now in custody in Thailand and another person is at large, the government said. Five people were injured, authorities said. The first bomb went off in a rental house, believed to be leased by three foreigners, according to Thai Police Maj. Gen. Pisit Pisutthisak. The three fled after the blast. Two of the men left the scene, he said. The third man detonated two more bombs -- one when a taxi driver refused to give him a ride, and another when he tried to throw a bomb at police as they closed on him. The last bomb exploded near the man, blowing off one of his legs, Pisit said. He was taken to Chulalongkorn General Hospital for treatment. Thai government spokeswoman Thitima Chaisaeng said the man in the hospital is Iranian, and that Iranian documents were found on him. Another man arrested at the airport is holding an Iranian passport and is one of the three, Thitima said. He was identified as Mohammad Hasai, 42, and was about to leave for Malaysia, she added. Thitima told CNN that Thai intelligence agencies don't think the incident was an act of terror because it was carried out in a sporadic way. But, she said, police think that the men may have been selling weapons and drugs. Israeli Foreign Ministry personnel based overseas have been on alert in recent weeks to the heightened possibility of attacks at Israeli facilities by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Muslim militant group and political party backed by Iran. Sunday marked the fourth anniversary of the death of Hezbollah leader Imad Mugniyah in a car bombing in Damascus, Syria. Hezbollah holds Israel responsible for his death and has vowed revenge. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN that the level of alert in the country had been raised following a security assessment after the overseas incidents in New Delhi and Tbilisi, the capitals of India and Georgia. The alert means patrols will be heightened in and around various public areas inside Israel, and around Israeli embassies and offices worldwide. In the Monday incidents, a device attached to an Israeli Embassy van in New Delhi exploded and injured four people. Another device was found on an embassy car in Tbilisi, Georgia, but it was safety detonated. The Israeli government issued a travel advisory this year for citizens traveling to Thailand after Thai security officials arrested a man in January connected with a planned attack in the country. The police charged the man, Atris Hussein, after finding ""initial chemical materials that could produce bombs"" in an area just outside Bangkok. Police said Hussein, who also holds a Swedish passport, led them to the location. The authorities are accusing Hussein of trying to attack spots in Bangkok that are popular with Western tourists and say he is believed to belong to Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim group active in Lebanon that the United States views as a terrorist organization. Police could not confirm whether the Tuesday incident in Bangkok has any link with the Hezbollah suspect, who is still in Thai police custody. Officers found the explosive C-4 during the search of the rented house. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States condemns the incident and offered its condolences to the victims. Even as she noted that Thai authorities were investigating the incidents, she went on to draw a parallel between Tuesday's attacks in Bangkok and Monday's attacks against Israeli diplomats in India and Georgia, both of which are also under investigation. ""What I would say is that, with regard to this bombing, the incidents in Delhi, incidents in Georgia, while we will await the results of the investigations, these events do come on the heels of other disrupted attacks targeted at Israel and Western interests, including an Iranian-sponsored attack in Baku, Azerbaijan, and a Hezbollah-linked attack in Bangkok, Thailand, before this. ""So they serve as a reminder that a variety of states and nonstate actors continue to view international terrorism as a legitimate foreign policy tool, which we consider reprehensible."" While Nuland said the United States is ""not going to prejudge this,"" she added, ""We're just concerned that these come on the heels of other incidences that clearly had links back to Iran."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday blamed the Georgia and India incidents on Iran, calling it ""the biggest exporter of terror in the world."" ""The Israeli government and her security organizations are continuing to operate together with local security services against these acts of terror,"" Netanyahu said. ""We will continue to act in a strong way, systematically and steadfastly."" In an interview Tuesday with CNN's Piers Morgan, Israeli Vice Prime Minister Silvan Shalom said Iran has been trying to target Israeli and Jewish sites for ""a few decades now."" ""We knew that they are planning it, preparing it. We're in touch with local governments with a few countries in Asia and in other places and together we -- we're trying to prevent those attacks for a very long time,"" Shalom said. ""Unfortunately, they succeeded to do it in India and tried to do it in Georgia and Azerbaijan a few weeks ago. That's something Iran is responsible for."" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast blamed Israel, accusing it of having bombed its own embassies in New Delhi and Tbilisi ""to tarnish Iran's friendly ties with the host countries,"" Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency said. ""He brushed aside Israeli accusation on Iranian involvement in the bombing and said that Israel perpetrated the terrorist actions to launch psychological warfare against Iran,"" IRNA reported. ""Iran condemns terrorism in strongest term and Iran has been the victim of terrorism,"" Mehmanparast said. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said this month that Iran would support any nation or group that stands up against Israel. He said Iran doesn't interfere in other nations but has aided such militant groups as Hamas and Hezbollah in conflicts with Israel in Gaza and Lebanon. The modus operandi is not new. Last month, a mysterious explosion in Iran killed a man identified as a nuclear scientist -- the third such killing in the past two years in which someone placed a bomb on or under a scientist's car. A fourth survived an assassination attempt. The United States and Israel oppose Iran's nuclear program, although numerous countries have expressed concern as well. Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian energy purposes. Iranian officials, on state-run media, blame Israel and the United States for the killings of the scientists. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has denied ""any United States involvement in any kind of act of violence inside Iran."" While Israel generally refuses to comment on accusations and speculation, Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, said on his Facebook page, ""I have no idea who targeted the Iranian scientist but I certainly don't shed a tear.""

"(CNN) -- South Korea's Ji Dong-Won grabbed a dramatic injury-time winner as Sunderland stunned English Premier League leaders Manchester City 1-0 at the Stadium of Light Sunday. The upset result left City ahead of champions Manchester United on goal difference, having gone into the match hoping to open up a three-point lead after their neighbors were beaten 3-2 by Blackburn 24 hours earlier. Instead, Roberto Mancini's men were left to reflect on a wasted opportunity with cavalier defending in the dying moments costing them even a point. Sunderland, who had been penned in their area for much of the final few minutes, broke upfield and had a two-man advantage as Stephane Sessegnon played in Ji. Ferguson's birthday celebrations ruined . On as a substitute for Niklas Bendtner, he beat England goalkeeper Joe Hart with a composed finish. Moments before City substitute Micah Richards had thumped the crossbar after Simon Mignolet parried a David Silva shot. Edin Dzeko hit the woodwork in the first half as the leaders dominated possession, but the home side also had clear-cut chances. Bendtner wasted his before the break and Sessegnon screwed his effort wide in the second half. The three points lifted Sunderland, who have been revived under new manager Martin O'Neill, to 13th place, six points clear of the drop zone. City must now entertain Liverpool on Tuesday night as they look to get their title challenge back on firmer footing. Mancini bemoaned his side's luck after the surprise defeat. ""We deserved to win this game,"" he told Sky Sports. ""It's incredible. ""This is football. I don't know how many chances we had,"" the Italian added. ""We missed a big opportunity today because we had a chance to go three points on Manchester United."" It completed a weekend of upsets with none of the top five, bar Arsenal, winning. Tottenham stayed in third, six points behind the Manchester pair with a game in hand, after being held at Swansea. In Sunday's other game, Nigerian international Victor Anichebe came off the bench to score the only goal of the game in Everton's 1-0 win away to West Bromwich Albion.","Sunderland beat EPL leaders Manchester City 1-0 .

"(CNN) -- Gov. Mitt Romney got himself into a bit of a pickle Monday when he was quoted saying that he liked to ""fire people."" Many have jumped onto this line as evidence of the candidate's callousness toward working people in a bad economy. Even his Republican primary competitors latched onto the comment, especially as it might relate to his work at Bain Capital Ventures, to show that Romney is in the business of making people unemployed. There's much more smoke here than fire, but some of it, unfortunately, is Romney's fault. He was the one, after all, who tried to pitch his time at Bain as evidence of his success as a ""job creator."" Specifically, in the GOP candidates' debate on Saturday he said, ""In the business I had, we invested in over 100 different businesses and net-net, taking out the ones where we lost jobs and those that we added, those businesses have now added over 100,000 jobs."" Turns out this isn't entirely correct. When pressed, his campaign released figures that showed that a number of companies helped by Bain under Romney's tenure, such as Staples, the Sports Authority, and Domino's, have added more than 100,000 jobs since then. But there are two problems with that figure. The first is that it's the number of jobs in all the time since Romney started at Bain, including many years after he left. The second is that there are no figures that show how many jobs were added or lost at other companies Bain managed, so a claim of a ""net"" addition is unproven. Bain could release comprehensive figures, but it's not likely it will. Nor should it. Bain isn't running for office, and I'm sure it considers the information proprietary. The larger issue, though, is that many people were fired through Bain's work. That is what often happens when venture firms take over businesses through leveraged buyouts. These stories make for compelling campaign commercials and news pieces. They don't paint Romney in as nice a light. That's compounded when he claims to ""enjoy"" firing people. But let's be fair. The governor is having his words taken out of context. Here's the full quote: . ""I want individuals to have their own insurance. That means the insurance company will have an incentive to keep people healthy. It also means if you don't like what they do, you can fire them. I like being able to fire people who provide services to me. If someone doesn't give me the good service I need, I'm going to go get somebody else to provide that service to me."" Romney isn't talking about his time at Bain. He's talking about health insurance. Specifically, he's talking about how he'd like insurance to work. He would rather everyone be personally responsible for buying insurance, instead of getting it from the government. Then, he says, if the insurance company did a bad job, people could fire them. That sounds much better, right? Unfortunately, it's not. The first problem is that Romney ascribes motives to the insurance companies that make no sense. If you would just leave the insurance company if it did a bad job, then there is no incentive for it to keep you healthy. Healthy people are cheap for insurance companies, and sick people are not. If you go from being healthy to being sick, it's in an insurance company's best interest that you leave. That's an economic fact, not a moral judgment. It's only if you can't leave, if you have to remain on their books no matter what, that the company has an incentive to keep you healthy. The second problem is worse, though. Healthy people often don't know their insurance plans are bad until they get sick. Healthy people, after all, don't make as much use of their plans. Once they fall ill, though, it means now they have a pre-existing condition, which will make it almost impossible to them to get a new plan if they decide to fire their old insurance company. The way the private insurance market works today, almost no one has the luxury of firing the insurance company once he or she figures out it isn't doing a good job. That's not true in Massachusetts, of course. Thanks to Romney's legislation there, insurance companies can't deny you coverage and also can't charge you more for being sick. There, thanks to Romney, you can fire your insurance company and be assured of finding a better one. It will also be true for many more people once President Obama's Affordable Care Act gets fully under way in 2014. Since Romney seems so enamored of firing bad insurance companies, you might think he'd want to protect and promote other people's ability to do so. Instead, he opposes the Affordable Care Act, which would do the same thing nationally that his law did for the people of Massachusetts. Join CNN Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on Twitter.

"London (CNN) -- Heavy snow in recent weeks has already wreaked havoc across Europe -- now it is damaging some of the continent's most recognized historic monuments. The Colosseum in Rome has been forced to shut after small pieces of its walls crumbled away as a result of freezing temperatures. And buildings in the historic walled town of Urbino -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site -- are reported to be at risk of collapse under the weight of snow, following unprecedented blizzards in the area. In the Italian capital, thousands of tourists have been disappointed to discover the Colosseum, one of the city's most popular attractions, is closed to visitors, while checks are carried out to determine the extent of the damage and to help prevent further movement. Rossella Rea, archaeologist and superintendent of the Colosseum, told CNN: ""Tests and evaluation of the damage is still ongoing, especially on the second level of arches."" Rea said the enforced closure of the site would have a serious financial impact -- the Colosseum attracts some 7,000 visitors a day, paying 12 euros for a ticket -- but that it was necessary in the circumstances. ""At the weekend, some of the tourists didn't understand why the Colosseum was closed -- for people from northern countries, the snow is not a problem. ""But it's very unusual for us and it caused the detachment of dust, concrete and bricks. Little quantities but if they fall from a certain height they can be dangerous."" Cristiano Brughitta, spokesman for Italy's Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities, said the damage was caused by ice forming on the walls of the monument. ""When the temperatures drop below zero, and there is rain and snow, it causes ice to form which, with the increase in volume, pushes the external plaster masonry and causes small pieces to fall off,"" he said. David Pickles, senior architect at English Heritage, told CNN such damage was an extreme version of the natural wear and tear buildings face during everyday weather. ""There's a whole freeze/thaw cycle of damage to buildings where moisture gets into the stonework, into the pores of the stone, it then freezes and expands very significantly, it then breaks up the stone and then when it thaws, bits of stone will start falling off. ""That's happening all the time, of course, that's one of the major decay mechanisms in historic buildings anyway, because they're largely water permeable... You can't treat stone to stop it happening."" In Urbino, in the Marche region of Italy, partial collapses have been reported at the convents of San Francesco and San Bernardino, while the roof of the Church of the Capuchins outside the town center has reportedly caved in. The town's Duomo (cathedral) is also shut, because of water damage. Checks are being carried out on vulnerable buildings in the area. ""Our biggest worry is the buildings in the historic center, which have wooden joists and delicate roofs,"" said Gabriele Cavalera, a spokesperson for the local council. According to Cavalera, residents of some private homes in the historic center are adding extra support to the old roof beams in an attempt to prevent any further cave-ins. ""It's an enormous quantity of snow compared with what we normally get in winter and it's had a heavy impact, the equivalent of a flood,"" said Cavalera. Brughitta agreed that conditions were exceptional: ""Maybe every 30 years it gets this cold, but it's very rare."" A number of Italy's historic monuments, including the Colosseum and Pompeii, have suffered in recent years from damage and collapse. The Colosseum, which is scheduled to reopen to the public Thursday, is due to undergo restoration works later this year with sponsorship from luxury brand Tod's. In case of similar snowfalls in the future, Brughitta in Rome suggests using a type of cold-weather ""blanket"" for exposed monuments such as the nearly 2,000-year-old Colosseum. Though Pickles said such plans may be difficult, on a practical level: ""For a building like the Colosseum, I should think it would cost a fortune to cover it, because we're talking about a huge wall area."" And while delicate, these buildings are nonetheless tenacious when it comes to adverse weather and acts of god. After all, said Cavalera, The Ducal Palace in Urbino, which is around 500 years old and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, managed to resist collapse during the earthquakes of the 1990s and is so far holding out against the snow. Livia Borghese in Rome contributed to this report.","Snow has caused damage to the Colosseum in Rome and to historic buildings in Urbino .

"Washington (CNN) -- He was known only as A.J.A.-- a little boy at the center of a international custody fight that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The near decade-long dispute has now come to an end, not because of any judicial action, but simply because of time. Alex Abbott turned 16 recently and has officially ""aged out"" of coverage under The Hague Convention dealing with child abduction across borders. A U.S. federal judge this week signed an order dismissing the case between the boy's parents. Mother and son now live in Texas. She says the youngster seeks no further contact with his father. Jacquelyn Vaye Abbott said she was shocked when she heard the news Monday, never quite sure her case would ever be resolved. ""Alex is safe and his own country, that's the most important thing,"" she told CNN from her office in Austin. ""We're whole, we're here, we're safe. Everything else is inconsequential."" The Supreme Court in 2010 ruled the British father could continue his federal appeals in his effort to regain custody of his son, who was taken by his mother from Chile to Texas despite a Chilean court's decree prohibiting either parent from taking the child out of the country without consent from the other. The judicial appeal tested the power of federal courts to intervene when fights over children go global, and tackled the issue of the scope of international treaty, and whether one country's court order preventing a child from being taken overseas by a parent represented a ""right of custody"" enforceable in the United States. The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said Timothy Abbott had such a right of custody and could force the boy's return to Chile, even though courts in that South American nation had said that despite the earlier decree, the father enjoyed only limited power as a non-custodial parent. The case was tossed back to the lower federal courts. During one recent hearing, the boy told a federal judge why he did not want to live with or see his father. There was no immediate reaction from Timothy Abbott's Washington attorney to the judge's final order of dismissal. This custody fight involved a broad mix of nations and nationalities. The father is a British citizen and his estranged wife is an American. They married in England and their son, born in Hawaii in 1995, is a U.S. citizen. The family subsequently moved to Chile, and the couple separated in March 2003. The mother was later awarded custody of the boy, while the father was granted visitation rights. It was at that point that the Chilean courts issued a decree prohibiting either party from removing the child from the country without mutual consent. But Jacquelyn Abbott did just that, taking the then-10-year-old boy amid a fight over visitation by the father. She claimed that due to visa restrictions in Chile, she could not find work or rent an apartment. Timothy Abbott then hired a private investigator who eventually located the child in San Antonio, Texas. Abbott next went to federal court, asking that his son -- known in court papers as ""A.J.A."" -- be returned to Chile under provisions enforceable by international law. The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction grants parents in general a ""right of custody"" and a separate ""right of access,"" ensuring the laws of one country are respected in the others. More than 80 countries are a party to the treaty, including the United States and Chile. A federal appeals court in New Orleans concluded the father had only visitation rights, not formal ""custody, care and control."" It said he could not claim a ""right of custody"" under The Hague Convention. The judges noted, however, that he had a ""right of access,"" allowing him to see the child in the United States. But the U.S. Supreme Court later voided that ruling. ""To interpret the convention to permit an abducting parent to avoid a return remedy, even when the other parent holds a ne exeat (custodial) right, would run counter to the convention's purpose of deterring child abductions by parents who attempt to find a friendlier forum for deciding custodial disputes,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy said. In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said the father's rights were necessarily limited, and he lacked the ultimate power to say where the boy should live. Under the justice's reading of the convention, the father had authority only ""to seek assistance from this country in carrying out the Chilean family court's visitation order."" But the now-retired Stevens accurately predicted the Abbott child could, under Texas law, eventually have a vital role in deciding where he would live. ""So no matter what we do, the child may actually provide the answer to this case,"" he said when the case was argued two years ago. The Abbott case has been cited in other similar custody disputes involving the United States, Italy, and Mexico. Jacquelyn Abbott expressed frustration that her estranged husband used an international treaty and the federal courts to try to thwart earlier Chilean court decisions. ""My husband had threatened that he would do anything to leave me with nothing, including my child, despite the fact the (Chilean) courts had granted me full custody. So he tried to drag this out for as long as he could. And my son has been waiting for years for strangers to decide his future. The (Hague) treaty leaves too much room for abuse by a vengeful parent."" Jacquelyn Abbott has tried without success to get a divorce from her husband, who has long objected. She said her son has adjusted surprisingly well to all the personal turmoil in his young life. ""He's very relieved when I told him last night about the court order,"" she said. ""He just smiled and said, 'That's very good news, indeed.'"" The Supreme Court case was Abbott v. Abbott (08-645).","A case involving an international treaty and parental custody rights is closed .
Courts in Chile and the United States had issued different rulings in the case .
The question is left unresolved when the boy at the center of the case turns 16 ."

"(CNN) -- English football club Liverpool apologized Sunday after an opposing team's player complained of being abused by supporters. Oldham's on-loan defender Tom Adeyemi was visibly upset after an incident during Friday's FA Cup third-round tie at Liverpool's Anfield ground. A statement on the club's website read: ""Whatever the outcome of what is now a police investigation, all of us are deeply sorry for what happened on Friday night and players and our club pass on our sincere regrets to Tom Adeyemi for the upset and distress he suffered as a result of the matter at hand."" Merseyside police arrested a 20-year-old man from Aintree on ""suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offense"" and he was bailed Sunday. Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was last month banned for eight matches for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra, and his club made a big show of publicly defending the Uruguay international before finally accepting the punishment earlier this week. Chelsea and England captain John Terry has been charged by police for allegedly racially abusing Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand, and will face a court case in February. Before the arrest on Saturday, former Oldham player Reuben Hazell claimed on social networking website Twitter that it was a matter of racial abuse. ""After the game I went into the Oldham dressing room to catch up with my old mates and spoke to Tom Adeyemi directly about what the altercation with the fan was all about. He said he was racially abused by the fan. This is FACT,"" wrote Hazell, who now plays for Shrewsbury in the fourth division, one below that which Oldham competes in. Adeyemi, who has Nigerian ancestry, is on the books of his hometown team Norwich but the 20-year-old has yet to establish himself at the Premier League side. His loan at Oldham is due to expire this month, and he spent last season with fourth division Bradford. Oldham captain Dean Furman said Adeyemi's treatment during the 5-1 defeat at Liverpool was unacceptable. ""He was abused and I'll leave it to Tom and the police to investigate that,"" Furman told BBC Radio Manchester. ""What happened should not happen in the game.

"Washington (CNN) -- The federal government recovered almost $4.1 billion stolen in health care fraud schemes during fiscal year 2011, Obama administration officials announced Tuesday. The figure is up 58 percent from 2009. ""This is an unprecedented achievement -- and it represents the highest amount ever recovered in a single year,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder. The Justice Department reported more than 1,400 people were charged with fraud in 500 cases. There have been more than 700 convictions. ""We're regaining the upper hand in our fight against health care fraud,"" said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The numbers are contained in the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program Annual Report, which is sent to Congress. Holder and Sebelius credited their Medicare Fraud Strike Force teams for tracking down crime in areas with ""hot spots"" of unexplained Medicare billing. The strike forces include prosecutors and investigators from the FBI, the Justice Department and the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. In fiscal year 2011, new teams were created in Dallas and Chicago. They joined seven existing groups in Miami; Los Angeles; Detroit; Houston; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Tampa, Florida; and the Brooklyn borough of New York. Holder said recently strike forces have handled two large, multiple-city fraud takedowns. In one case, 115 people were arrested in nine cities for alleged false billing schemes amounting to more than $240 million. A second case involved $290 million in allegedly fraudulent bills in which 91 defendants were charged in eight cities. Health care fraud has attracted both organized crime organizations and street gangs, according to Kevin Perkins, the FBI's assistant director for the Criminal Investigative Division. Perkins said that through computer analysis the FBI can look at many thousands of Explanation of Benefit forms and detect hot spots showing excessive Medicare billing, which law enforcement can then pursue. ""We're making an impact,"" Perkins said. Officials say fraudulent schemes include illegal marketing of medical devices and pharmaceuticals for purposes not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, Medicare fraud by hospitals and other institutional providers, illegal pricing by makers of drugs, and violations of laws against self-referrals and kickbacks. Sebelius said aggressively pursuing health care fraud is a great investment. ""Over the last three years, for every dollar we've spent, we've put more than seven dollars back in the hands of American taxpayers,"" she said. The money goes into the Medicare Trust Fund, the U.S. Treasury and state treasuries. Officials said the Affordable Care Act helps in the fight against fraud in various ways, including providing $350 million in resources, increasing data sharing, and expanding efforts to get money back after overpayments.","The recovery of nearly $4.1 billion is called ""an unprecedented achievement""

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck early Wednesday off the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, the U.S. Geological Survey reported, but witnesses reported only minor shaking on land. The quake was centered in the northern Indian Ocean, more than 400 km (250 miles) off northern Sumatra and more than 29 km (18 miles) beneath the surface. Indonesian authorities initially issued a tsunami warning for the area, before lifting it a couple of hours after the first quake struck. The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no threat of a massive wave like the one that devastated the region in 2004. The quake hit at 12:37 a.m. Wednesday (1:37 p.m. Tuesday ET), according to the USGS. There were no immediate reports of damage, and hotel clerks contacted by CNN reported only mild shaking. One front desk clerk in Aceh said a few hotel guests went outside when the quake hit, but most weren't awakened. The region is highly active seismically, and a magnitude 9.1 quake in December 2004 generated a tsunami that killed people as far away as eastern Africa. The death toll from the combined disaster topped 280,000 in a dozen countries, most of them in Indonesia.

"(CNN) -- From the tsunami in Japan to famine in East Africa to the deadly tornado outbreaks in the United States, 2011 has been a historic year for natural disasters. A dozen weather-related disasters in the United States alone have caused more than $1 billion in damages each, breaking the record of nine billion-dollar disasters set in 2008, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Altogether, the damage from these events exceeds $50 billion. ""In many ways, 2011 rewrote the record books. From crippling snowstorms to the second deadliest tornado year on record to epic floods, drought and heat, and the third busiest hurricane season on record, we've witnessed the extreme of nearly every weather category,"" said NOAA spokesman Christopher Vaccaro. Dynamic 2011 events to shape world for years to come . Relief organizations have been working year-round to provide emergency aid when disaster strikes and long-term assistance in the months and years that follow. Oftentimes, help is needed long after the media attention subsides. ""Recovery is a very long process. People are so grateful for that temporary place to stay, that hot meal,"" said Jeff Jellets, territorial disaster coordinator for The Salvation Army. ""But we really look at how we can restore families back to their predisaster condition. ""Until those communities are rebuilt, the job just isn't done."" This year, there have been more than 1,000 weather-related fatalities in the United States, according to NOAA. Many of those occurred when deadly tornadoes ripped through the Southeast and Midwest this spring and summer. Vote for the top stories of 2011 . In late April, an estimated 343 tornadoes ripped through central and Southern states, killing 321 people, 240 of which were in Alabama. Tuscaloosa, Alabama, was particularly devastated. Then, less than a month later, 160 people were killed when a tornado with 200 mph winds struck Joplin, Missouri, making it the deadliest single tornado to strike the United States since modern tornado record-keeping began. Months later, many of these communities are still in need. ""People are starting the process of rebuilding, so we're helping them with things like appliances and rebuilding materials so they can get back in their homes,"" Jellets said. ""But then there are a number of people in places like Hackleburg, Alabama, which was really significantly damaged by a tornado, where people are still in the emergency assistance phase."" In August, Hurricane Irene made landfall over coastal North Carolina and headed north, killing 45 people and causing torrential rainfall and flooding across the Northeast. ""The real damage was inland flooding, particularly in places like upstate New York and Vermont. The Salvation Army still has distribution centers where we're handing out cleaning supplies and food boxes,"" Jellets said. ""But some of those communities were away from the media spotlight. What we can do is going to be very difficult over the long haul unless more donations come in for those events."" The American Red Cross has responded to 131 disaster relief operations in 44 separate states so far this year. ""We opened more than 1,000 shelters across the nation for disasters such as Hurricane Irene and the tornadoes,"" said Laura Howe, American Red Cross spokesperson. ""That's in comparison to 37 shelters that we opened across the nation in 2010."" Outside the United States, there have been several major disasters, including the massive earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the ensuing nuclear catastrophe, famine in East Africa and flooding in Thailand. The American Red Cross and other U.S.-based aid organizations joined international efforts to help Japan after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami killed 15,840 people, according to the most recent death toll, and set off a nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. ""A lot of the donations the American Red Cross has provided are supporting the rebuilding of hospitals and medical centers and providing social welfare programs for elderly and children,"" Howe said. ""Any time you have a large disaster, the recovery process is going to take a number of years."" The Salvation Army is helping Japanese fishermen get back to work. ""Just recently we provided funding to help many of the fishermen there get their boats and their wares back together so they can get back to the business that they know, which is commercial fishing,"" said Salvation Army spokesman Maj. George Hood. In the Horn of Africa, some regions are slowly recovering five months after the United Nations declared a famine in much of Somalia. The disaster has killed tens of thousands of people and 250,000 are still at risk of starvation. The World Food Programme is aiming to feed 11 million people in East Africa. The organization is currently reaching almost 8 million. ""It's crucially important that especially the children and nursing mothers get highly fortified supplementary foods.

"(CNN) -- A month ago, Google's three-year effort to push its Web browser, Chrome, took a major step when analysts said it had passed Mozilla's Firefox to become the second-most popular tool of its kind on the Internet. Today, that climb continues and has some tech observers wondering whether Chrome could do the unthinkable and topple perennial leader Internet Explorer from atop the browser rankings. According to Web analytics firm StatCounter, the most popular version of Google's browser, Chrome 15, edged out Internet Explorer 8 in early December to become the world's most used edition of a browser. (For those keeping score, the totals were 23.6% of worldwide browser usage compared to IE8's 23.5%.) When all versions are considered, Chrome accounted for more than 27% of all worldwide browser use at the beginning of December, an increase of about 1.5% over the previous month. That's compared to about 37% for Internet Explorer, which dropped 2% from November, according to StatCounter. Now in third place, Firefox remained mostly steady with about 25% of the browser market. Trailing far behind is Apple's Safari, with about 6%. The numbers can vary in the browser race depending on who is counting. Web surveying firm Net Applications still has Explorer at 52%, Firefox at 22% and Chrome at 19%. But that represents a 10-point drop by Explorer since 2010, while Chrome use more than doubled and Firefox remained flat. Gartner analyst David Mitchell Smith thinks Chrome has gathered momentum because it is a strong product. ""People like it because it's fast,"" he said. ""Google has done a nice job advertising it recently, so that's increased awareness."" Since its rollout, reviews have been generally positive about Chrome. While some call it a work in progress, many have praised its features and speed. ""Super-fast browsing performance, now with hardware acceleration. Excellent security through sandboxing and malware warnings. Instant site prediction and loading,"" PCMag wrote in a review of Chrome 15, giving it 4 1/2 out of 5 stars. The review also praised it for strong support for the emerging HTML5 coding system amd built-in Flash player, while dinging it for still not being compatible with a handful of sites. Smith also said people are more aware than ever that they have a choice of browsers. Internet Explorer has been the dominant browser for more than a decade, at least in large part because it comes installed on Windows machines. ""This was happening even more so when there was a real big difference between what you could get from someone else and what Explorer was,"" he said. ""Now, that's not the case. Explorer 9 is pretty competitive with the other browsers, so maybe there's not as much need to go away from it."" StatCounter CEO Aodhan Cullen attributed at least part of Chrome's rise to its increased use among businesses. ""Google announced Chrome for business exactly a year ago and IT administrators appear to have embraced it in a remarkably short time,"" he said. Chrome use already had overtaken Explorer on weekends, when personal use presumably trumps office use, since October. But Chrome 15 became the more popular from Monday to Friday on December 5, he said. Microsoft, putting a positive spin on the numbers, emphasized that Explorer's latest (and generally well-received) version, IE9, is rapidly gaining ground as use of IE8 drops. IE9 was released in March. (To its credit, Microsoft is also celebrating the demise of Internet Explorer 6. Widely reviled by Web developers and many users from the start, use of that version dropped below 1% in the United States last month, with Microsoft spokesman Roger Capriotti writing on the Windows blog that the company is breaking out the champagne and ""as eager as anyone to see it go away."") The statistics Microsoft used on its blog, which showed Chrome use mostly flat, only looked at browser usage on Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system. The rise of Chrome comes as Google has expanded beyond its core product -- its search engine -- into such areas as mobile operating systems (Android) and social networking (Google Plus). Chrome has been a high point for Google in what has developed into a two-front clash of tech titans with Microsoft. While Google tries to erode Explorer's browser share, Microsoft is taking aim at Google's longtime dominance in search. Launched in 2009, Microsoft's Bing has tried to make Web search a true two-way race. And while Google's stranglehold on that market is still strong, Bing has chipped away. In December, Bing captured about 15% of the search market, compared to 61% for Google, according to Experian Hitwise. One victim of Google's success (not to mention deep pockets) has been Firefox, long a favored browser among tech-savvy types. ""They (Mozilla) were not coming out with a lot of releases and new features for some time,"" Smith said. ""They've really tried to change that in the last year, but perceptions got made during that time frame. ""They were the ones that were the sole recipient of the browser change -- they were the alternative browser for most -- but now they have to split that role with Google."" Whether Chrome's rise will continue remains to be seen, he said. Web users only tend to seek out a new browser if the one in front of them is lacking, and Internet Explorer appears to have stemmed that tide somewhat. ""Three or four years ago, if you wanted tabs, you had to go to another browser. If you wanted something fast you had to go to another browser,"" Smith said. ""That's not the case any more.""","Google's Chrome browser continues to gain on market leader Internet Explorer .

"(EW.com) -- For the first time, a ""Twilight"" movie has ruled the box office for three weeks in a row. During what was one of the slowest weekends of the year, ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" held on to first, dropping 60 percent for $16.9 million, according to studio estimates. That's a smaller decline than what ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" experienced during the same weekend two years ago -- it fell 64 percent. Nevertheless, ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" is still trailing the past two Twilight movies. The fourth entry in the romantic supernatural series has so far grossed a stellar $247.3 million in 17 days. By comparison, ""New Moon"" had earned $255.4 million by this point, while ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" had collected $255.8 million. This will ultimately be a moot point when ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" comes out next November and likely destroys all of the franchise's records. Disney's ""The Muppets"" was the runner-up, plunging a sharp 62 percent -- more than any other wide release -- for a weekend tally of $11.2 million. It's too early to sound the alarm, especially since the movie has already grossed $56.1 million on its $45 million budget. And ""The Muppets"" will likely bounce back with a better hold next week. But it is surprising that a PG-rated family film with such endearing reviews and an ""A"" rating from CinemaScore graders would drop so much. One possible explanation is that after all the activities and shopping of Thanksgiving weekend, many families opted to take it easy this week. It's worth noting that such Thanksgiving releases as 2007â€²s ""Enchanted"" and last year's ""Tangled"" fell 52 percent and 56 percent, respectively, during their sophomore frames. But ""Hugo,"" ""Arthur Christmas,"" ""Happy Feet Two,"" and ""Puss in Boots"" all had smaller drops than ""The Muppets,"" so there might be something else at play here. Perhaps the film's solid $29.2 million opening weekend was driven more by nostalgic adults than by family audiences. (Disney reported that 65 percent of the picture's audience was over the age of 18.) If that's the case, then those muppety adults all rushed out to see ""The Muppets"" last week, thereby leaving the film somewhat front-loaded. Disney would be wise to release Miss Piggy out into the world to intimidate encourage more families to see the movie. The rest of the top five was occupied by other family films. Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo,"" a 3-D love letter to silent cinema, slipped 33 percent for $7.6 million. The movie's small decline can be partly attributed to the fact that it added more than 500 theaters this weekend. ""Hugo"" has so far taken in $25.2 million on a budget that's reportedly at least $150 million. In fourth place, Sony's ""Arthur Christmas"" declined only 39 percent for $7.4 million. The well-reviewed holiday comedy should continue to hold up well as we approach Christmas Day. And ""Happy Feet Two"" rounded out the top five by diving 55 percent for $6 million. In limited release, the George Clooney dramedy ""The Descendants"" once again posted impressive numbers, grossing $5.2 million from 574 theaters. Fox Searchlight will expand the Oscar hopeful to 850 theaters on Friday. The silent film ""The Artist"" also continued to make some noise with $206,000 from six locations. And, finally, the NC-17 drama ""Shame,"" about a New York sex addict (Michael Fassbender), debuted to a superb $361,000 at 10 theaters. The film may have trouble adding theaters beyond metropolitan areas because of its taboo rating. 1. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 -- $16.9 mil . 2. The Muppets -- $11.2 mil . 3.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. military will continue to use cluster bombs but will try to reduce the number of civilian casualties by redesigning them so there are fewer ordnances that detonate long after the weapon is fired, officials said Wednesday. Parts of a cluster bomb can explode on the ground long after the bomb is fired. The new policy requires that by 2018 the United States use only a new style of cluster bomb -- one with a 99 percent detonation rate for the hundreds of bomblets released from each of the scatter-style weapons. A cluster bomb, when dropped from an aircraft or missile, releases hundreds of smaller explosives each the size of a grenade. When the bomblets detonate, they send shrapnel over an area about the size of a football field. A number of the bomblets have remained undetonated until handled or stepped on by civilians -- often children. In 2006, the top United Nations aid official called Israel's use of cluster bombs in the last three days of that summer's war with Hezbollah ""immoral."" The U.N. said that 100,000 deadly bomblets dropped in 2006 were still lying unexploded across areas of southern Lebanon, where they are maiming and killing people. Under the new U.S. policy, cluster bombs in its arsenal will be destroyed if they don't meet the 99 percent requirement. In addition, the Department of Defense will begin disposing of excess cluster bombs in its inventory ""as soon as possible,"" according to a Pentagon statement released Wednesday. The policy change comes as international pressure builds for a ban on cluster bombs. The United Kingdom in May joined more than 100 other countries in signing an international treaty that would ban cluster munitions and require that stockpiles be destroyed within eight years. The treaty is expected to be ratified at the end of the year in Oslo, Norway. The United States, Russia, Pakistan, Israel, China and India, all makers of cluster bombs, boycotted the May talks. Pentagon officials have said cluster bombs save the lives of U.S. troops and have a legitimate role in its arsenal. ""They provide distinct advantages against a range of targets, where their use reduces risks to U.S. forces and can save U.S. lives,"" according to a Pentagon statement. Dud rates, the number of bomblets that fail to explode, can range from 3 to 16 percent, according to military watchdog groups. Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who opposes cluster munitions, in June sponsored a joint resolution calling on the Bush administration to sign the Convention on Cluster Munitions treaty. ""The Pentagon continues to insist that cluster munitions are necessary, but the country with the world's most powerful military should not be on the sidelines while others are trying to protect the lives and limbs of civilians in war,"" Leahy said at the time.","By 2018, the United States will use only a new style of cluster bomb .

"(CNN) -- Investigators in Thailand have arrested a Lebanese terror suspect who is accused of trying to attack spots in Bangkok that are popular with Western tourists, the Thai government said Friday. It came the same day the United States and Israel warned their citizens in Thailand of the possibility of imminent terrorist attacks in busy tourist areas of Bangkok. The Thai government said the terror suspect is believed to belong to Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim group active in Lebanon that the United States views as a terrorist organization. The United States had passed information to Thai authorities that caused the Thai government to be on high alert and to look for suspects, said Thitima Chaisaeng, a spokeswoman for the Thai government. Neighboring countries received similar information, Chaisaeng said. A U.S. Embassy statement spoke of ""foreign terrorists"" who may be planning attacks ""in the near future."" It urged U.S. citizens to exercise caution when visiting public areas where large groups of Western tourists gather in Bangkok. A U.S. official says the terror threat against U.S. and Western interests is ""very real"" and remains an ""active investigation, indicating others might be involved in the plot and are being sought. The official would not discuss any details of the nature and timing of any planned attacks. The embassy did not provide any further information on the source of the threat. Israel's Counter Terrorism Bureau issued a ""serious travel warning"" for Bangkok on Friday afternoon, saying there is a possibility of an attack against Israeli tourists ""in the immediate time frame."" The warning says said the Lebanese suspect who was arrested is a member of Hezbollah and part of a group planning an attack in the Thai capital. Thailand is a highly popular tourist destination, and Bangkok serves as a major transport hub for the Southeast Asian region. Analysts Friday were split on the possibility that Hezbollah, designated by the United States as a terrorist organization, is active in the country. ""Historically, Hezbollah hasn't had an active presence in Thailand,"" said CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen, who called the claim ""pretty surprising."" But Matthew Levitt, an expert on counterterrorism and intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said the group has acted there before. ""Hezbollah has been active in Thailand in the past, most notably the attempt to blow up the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok in 1994,"" said Levitt, the author of the upcoming book ""Hezbollah's Global Footprint."" ""It has retained most of the logistical activity in Thailand for many years, and if in fact this individual is tied to Hezbollah, this would not be something new,"" he said. Thailand has undergone periods of unrest in recent years. It experienced a spate of political violence during anti-government demonstrations in 2010. And Muslim separatists in southern Thailand have long battled government forces in a country that is overwhelmingly Buddhist, with a number of bombings taking place last year. The embassy said U.S. citizens should ""maintain a heightened awareness when out in public,"" advising them to be on the lookout for unattended packages and bags in public places and other crowded areas. It also suggested that they ""keep a low profile in public areas, particularly areas frequented by foreign tourists."" Fran Townsend, a national security analyst for CNN, reported that Thai officials at one of the airports serving Bangkok were conducting pat downs and bag searches on all passengers at the departure gate for U.S. air carriers. CNN's Michal Zippori, Pam Benson, and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","NEW: Analysts split on possibility of Hezbollah activity in Thailand .

"(RealSimple.com) -- ""I am leaving,"" I murmured to my husband. ""You cannot leave,"" he hissed back. ""It is 3 a.m. These are our friends."" ""Don't worry. I'll just find a hotel and be back here in time for breakfast. They won't even know I left."" ""You cannot do this again! People think we're mad. You cannot leave someone's house just because a doorknob is sticky."" Oh, but it wasn't just the doorknob. It was everything, at least in my mind. This was about 10 years ago, and my husband and I had been invited as weekend guests to the home of dear friends with a one-year-old son. This was before I had my own kids, before I realized that the essential condition of childhood is stickiness and that I would spend the first five years of their lives fearfully clutching wet wipes. RealSimple.com: How to be a good friend . Right then I knew only one thing: A doorknob was whispering to me, all Amityville Horror-like: GET. OUT. I have never been a good houseguest. And -- despite what this episode might imply -- it's not because I'm impressively fastidious. I am a complete slob in my own home, albeit one with dry, noncling surfaces. But after years of trying very hard to enjoy myself when other people invite me over for the weekend, I've basically given up. I like to think I'm the best kind of guest: one who doesn't actually stay with you. Oddly, people don't always see it my way. Particularly the house-proud, those who love their 1,000-count sheets and cunning window treatments and Viking stoves with the special tiny flame for heating chocolate or whatever the hell it does -- those people don't like me. They don't like me a lot. I have lost friends over my inability to just get with the program and bask in their hostessy generosity. Here's the thing: My husband -- a Brit whose love of staying at other people's homes could rival that of Bertie Wooster, from P. G. Wodehouse novels -- thinks I am rude. He is incorrect. What I suffer from is an overabundance of politeness, and a terror of all the ways I can fail to live up to my own standards. I am cursed with the knowledge of my impolitic nature, and if I have to spend more than a couple of hours being courteous, I become convinced I will get too cavalier and say whatever stupid thing is on my mind. And there are many stupid things on my mind. RealSimple.com: Small, helpful gestures with big impact . So I have to be eternally vigilant. I'm like a werewolf who, when espying a full moon, knows that the only way the people he loves will live to see tomorrow is if he locks himself in the closet and swallows the key. When I confessed this problem of mine to a friend, she immediately started listing all the wonderful times she's had in other people's houses: the hammocks she's lain in, the Pimm's she's sipped in tall, icy glasses while allowing herself to feel loved and nurtured. She is insane. Allow me to catalog The Many Ways Things Can Go Wrong When You Stay With People. People hide the items you need most. Where's the coffee? No, not that decaffeinated imposter; the real coffee. No wonder everyone in this house is still asleep at 6:30 a.m. Fine, I will just go out and buy coffee at the corner store.

"(CNN) -- Chinese media on Wednesday played up the positives in Xi Jinping's visit to Washington, avoiding mention of U.S. criticism of human rights but broaching issues of trade and U.S. discontent with the strength of the Chinese currency. A commentary in the official China Daily said U.S. President Barack Obama was deflecting criticism of his own domestic political problems by drawing attention to the rivalry over the currencies, but that the U.S. administration had little heart for an open fight over the issue. ""When the Senate was about to vote on a bill to punish 'currency manipulators' last fall, the White House put it off with strong words and possibly behind-the-scene political maneuvers,"" the newspaper said in a commentary. ""Senior economic officials in the Obama administration know that unless all the major Asian currencies increase in value, even a drastic revaluation of the yuan would simply mean U.S. imports from China would just switch to the other countries in the region."" The U.S. has long called for the Chinese currency, the yuan or renminbi, to be floated to gain its true value. The administration claim that an artificially suppressed currency is unfair to U.S. exporters, making it cheaper for suppliers to source Chinese manufactured goods. The timing of the visit was not lost on the pro-government Global Times which said the Valentine's Day meeting showed all the complexity of a romantic story. ""China is a newcomer on the diplomatic stage of major powers. It is still unfamiliar with how to use its power and how to deal with provocations from smaller countries,"" the newspaper said in an editorial. ""Facing giants like the U.S. and Europe, China is accustomed to acting with care. It never stirs up trouble willingly, instead, when a crisis occurs, China's first reaction is to seek to defuse tension."" A common theme in Chinese diplomacy and in its official media is that when backed into a corner, China must pursue its own interests. ""China does not need to satisfy the West at the expense of its own interests. China will not provoke the U.S. and Europe, but it has its own principles to follow,"" the editorial said. ""Chinese officials should take opportunities to make the world understand these."" While the Chinese also have trade complaints against the U.S., in particular U.S. export controls on high-tech exports, there was no mention of issues that have seen China excluded from U.S. preferential trade right status. Similarly, there was little mention of U.S. criticism of China's human rights record or its position on Syria, both of them sticking point in Sino-U.S. relations. Xi -- who is being groomed for the Chinese presidency - is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit since Obama launched a new U.S. policy in Asia in November designed to reassert its influence in the Pacific. Beijing has expressed misgiving about the U.S. ""pivot"" which is pushing for a new free-trade agreement with at least eight countries in the Asia region and has secured military basing rights in Australia.","Chinese media plays up positives of Xi's U.S. visit .

"(CNN) -- Chinese authorities in eastern Jiangsu Province have launched a massive manhunt for a suspect in a deadly armed robbery, according to Chinese media. The suspect allegedly shot and killed a man who had just withdrawn 200,000 yuan ($31,700) from a bank in Nanjing's Dongmen Street on January 6 and then fled the scene in a car, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Nanjing Public Security Bureau's Xuanwu district office told CNN that more than 80,000 police have joined the manhunt, while a reward of 150,000 yuan has been offered for information leading to the killer's arrest. Authorities believe the suspect -- a man in his early 40s from Sichuan province called Zeng Kaigui -- is also responsible for shooting dead six others in six robberies in Changsha and Chongqing municipality over the past seven years. Nanjing police have obtained two video clips of the suspect escaping the scene and published them online, and said Zeng is of medium build and wears black outfits during the robbery. Police have posted Zeng's profile picture in public places like subway stations and Internet cafes, and have handed them out to taxi and bus drivers throughout the c . Many big screens in downtown Nanjing are also showing the suspect's video clips hourly with police warnings to citizens.

"(CNN) -- As many as 32 tourists who were trapped in South Africa's Kruger National Park after torrential rains and flooding have been rescued, park officials said Thursday. At least 70 other tourists, including Italians and Britons, and 10 staff members who were trapped in the rising waters had already been evacuated from washed-away cars and flooded camps at the safari destination, the officials said. David Mabunda, the chief executive of South African National Parks, flew over the park Thursday to witness the extent of the damage. He says there were no serious injuries and no people or animals were killed. The most serious damage was to the infrastructure. ""Roads, bridges, culverts, water supply pumps have been washed away. Barring a few tents, there has been limited damage to the tourism facilities,"" he said. At least 1,800 people are believed to have been in the park when the rain and flooding began Monday. The park has been declared 80% operational and the repair work is expected to take less than six months to complete. ""The sun is shining now. The main roads are still accessible and that is where most of the highlights are, so people must continue to come to the park,"" Mabunda told CNN. This is not the first time the Kruger, as it is popularly known, has been hit by floods. It took 10 months to repair the damage caused by rains in 2000. Mabunda says this time, disaster management was more prepared and so were the park's buildings. ""Our tourism facilities stood the test of the floods. The embankments and walls withstood the impact. The only problem we have now is water supply to the camps, which is a problem we are working on. We are also limiting day visitors in order to cope better."" Visitors already in the park were ""urged to exercise caution around rivers as crocodiles are likely to be in flat areas,"" according to a statement on the South African National Parks website. The park plans to ask the government to help cover some of the repair costs. Kruger National Park, South Africa's flagship big-game park and a top destination of foreign tourists, was established in 1898. It covers more than 7,500 square miles and boasts hundreds of animal and plant species, according to the National Parks' website.","NEW: 32 trapped tourists were rescued at the park Thursday .

"Hanoi, Vietnam (CNN) -- Five years ago, Pham Binh Minh was a 15-year-old spending his nights on the streets of Hanoi, Vietnam's capital. With his father dead and his mother too poor to adequately feed or clothe him, Pham survived by collecting and selling scrap. ""I didn't have time to make friends,"" he said. ""The friends I did have ... would take me to do work that wasn't good. ... We would rob and steal from people. ... I was scared I would get arrested. I was scared people would hit me. I felt unsafe."" It's an all-too-common story in Hanoi, where many Vietnamese youth -- often poor children from outside the city -- seek opportunity. If they're lucky, they're able to get by working odd jobs such as shining shoes or selling trinkets. ""Kids come to the streets hoping that it'll be better than living in poverty in the countryside, but often they find that things are much worse for them here,"" said Michael Brosowski, whose nonprofit foundation helps Vietnamese street children turn their lives around. It was through Brosowski's Blue Dragon Children's Foundation that Pham was able to graduate high school and enroll in college. Since 2004, Blue Dragon has helped more than 350 Vietnamese children get off the streets and into school. ""(Our) job is to make sure that the kids are safe and protected, first of all,"" said Brosowski, 37. ""And then once they are, we've got to make sure they're working toward something, whether that's education or getting a job or improving their health."" A 2006 report from Human Rights Watch estimated that 23,000 street children were living throughout Vietnam. Brosowski said he has encountered children -- some as young as 6 -- sleeping under bridges and in trees. ""Mom's in prison, dad's a heroin addict. The kids (are) thinking, 'Well, that's my future as well,' "" Brosowski said. ""Our biggest challenge is to stop the kids from accepting that fate -- to fight their own fate and make their own future."" On the streets, children are susceptible to a wide range of threats and pitfalls: gang violence, bullying, child trafficking, the lure of a booming heroin trade. Blue Dragon tries to combat these issues by giving children what they need to get off the streets and stay off them. Some common examples include safe housing, food subsidies, school sponsorships, job training and medical attention. ""Our (initial) goal was just to get them back to school,"" Brosowski said. ""We realized that to do that ... we would have to take that place of providing an income, giving them money for food, providing the shelter. We would actually have to take care of all aspects of their life."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . In Hanoi, Blue Dragon's center offers food, clothing, classrooms, play space and a computer lab. There is also bed space for 20 in the group's nearby shelter. Each child who comes through the center is provided with a dedicated social worker and has access to a psychologist, counselors, teachers and lawyers. ""Child by child, we've got to work out what we can do and what they need,"" Brosowski said. ""And we've also got to be careful that if the child has a family, that the family is as involved as possible."" In addition to the Hanoi center, Blue Dragon also has three other locations throughout Vietnam that help street children and those living in extreme poverty. Funded by donations and grants, the foundation has assisted more than 2,500 children in all. ""I grew up in poverty,"" Brosowski said. ""I often used to think to myself, 'I could do something good with my life if only someone would come and give me that chance.' And then I was here in Hanoi ... and I realized now I'm the guy. I'm the guy who can help these kids and give them a chance."" Brosowski, an Australian, moved to Vietnam in 2002 to teach English at the university level. Within several months, he met a few street children shining shoes and was inspired by their untapped potential. He befriended the boys and began teaching them with the help of one of his university students, Pham Sy Chung. As he met more and more street children in need, Brosowski eventually decided to quit his job and devote himself full-time to Blue Dragon. Today, he has a staff of 44, several of whom have been helped by the foundation in the past. ""There really was no thinking at that time that this would become something big,"" he said. ""It was just a case of, here are these kids, there's no one else to help them, but I can."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- The South Korean government announced expanded sanctions against Iran Friday, blacklisting more than 100 firms and individuals. ""Ninety-nine companies and 6 individuals have been added to the list, all related to Iranian nuclear weapon development,"" said Kim Young-min with the finance ministry. Last year, South Korea blacklisted 102 organizations and 24 individuals. The government also warned South Korean companies that ""they may find disadvantages when doing business with the U.S. if they contribute to the Iranian petroleum industry or petrochemical maintenance expansion,"" Kim said. The latest sanctions are part of a U.S.-led, but international effort to tighten the screws around the Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program. Britain has cut all financial ties with Iran, the first time it has cut an entire country's banking sector off from British finance, the British Treasury announced in November. Similarly, Canada has implemented a series of tougher sanctions, prohibiting almost all financial transactions with the Iranian government.

"(Financial Times) -- When pop sensation Girls' Generation recently provided the grand finale to the Late Show with David Letterman, a top slot on US television, it signalled that South Korea's entertainment industry had broken out of Asia and is now looking to make it big in the west. Just days after making their first appearance on US network television with their hit single ""The Boys"", the band of nine telegenic women this week returned to France -- where tickets for a 2011 concert sold out in 15 minutes -- to sing on prime time television. Korean films, soap operas and ""K-Pop"" music idols, many of which were modelled on Japan's own sugary ""J-Pop"", have taken Asia by storm over the past decade. But the hallyu -- or ""Korean wave"" as the phenomenon is known in Asia -- is now spreading to Europe and the US, and spurring South Korea's export earnings. Cultural exports -- including films, comics and computer games -- hit a record $4.2bn last year, up from $2.6bn in 2009, causing the share prices of leading entertainment studios to soar. Even Korea's favourite cartoon character, the penguin Pororo, has appeared on television in 120 countries. Cho Hyun-jin, a government representative who coined the phrase K-Pop for Korean bands in a previous incarnation as a journalist, said the spread of Korean music had surpassed his highest hopes. ""It was my old heroes like Led Zeppelin who famously played Madison Square Garden. Now to see Girls' Generation there is amazing,"" he said. While Korea has been an export powerhouse for decades in electronics, ships and cars, manufacturing companies have rarely played up their Korean brand identity, fearing until recently they would be seen as inferior in quality to Japanese rivals. Cultural exports are, however, giving the once reclusive country a global cachet for the first time, shaking off the war-torn images of the US comedy M*A*S*H. Broadcasting exports such as television dramas hit $252m last year, up from $185m in 2009, according to government statistics. Music earned $177m, soaring from only $31m in 2009. Film exports earned $26m, up from $14m in 2009. Until recently, hallyu was seen as an Asian phenomenon. A 2003 drama called ""Jewel in the Palace"" about a female doctor at a 16th-century royal court proved a huge hit from Taiwan to Iran, and has more recently come to eastern Europe. Asia is still crucial and the most effective managers continue to target export markets there. Park Jin-young, the impresario who runs JYP Entertainment, created the band Miss A with two Korean and two Chinese singers, so they can record their hits in both Korean and Mandarin. Girls' Generation sing in Korean, English and Japanese. ""The next phase is for the music industry to introduce western singers to globalise the boy and girl bands further,"" said Han Koo-hyun, president of the Korean Wave Research Institute. Koreans have been surprised by the enthusiasm for K-Pop in the west, where Korean culture receives scant attention in mainstream media. Korean newspapers splash photographs of packed French concert halls or British fans greeting Girls' Generation with signs in Korean. These European fans have largely discovered K-Pop through social networking sites, Facebook and YouTube. Many commentators have also observed that K-Pop's novelty to outsiders comes from the years of training -- sometimes in tough quasi-boot camps -- that stars endure to ensure their songs are accompanied by immaculate group choreography that is rare in other pop music. While cultural exports are a source of national pride, Koreans are also calling for improved regulation of the industry. The suicide of Jang Ja-yeon, a soap starlet, in 2009, focused attention on hallyu's dark underworld where some performers are locked into slave contracts and are told to sleep with managers to win roles.

"Washington (CNN) -- At the end of another long and confusing day of political wrangling over extending the payroll tax cut, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi asked a question on everybody's mind. ""The public has to be concerned and wondering why on Earth are we not getting a payroll tax cut when everybody says they're for it?"" Pelosi, D-California, said at a news conference Tuesday. The answer involves the usual suspects of partisan divide in Congress and the politics of a coming election year. This time, though, there is another factor: disarray among congressional Republicans that has led to a public rift between GOP members of the House and Senate. On Tuesday, House Republicans pushed their call for further negotiations on a one-year extension of the payroll tax cut. They ridiculed a Senate plan for a two-month extension as irresponsible and unworkable, saying it would create uncertainty by failing to resolve the issue past February. However, the Senate agreement was negotiated by Democratic and Republican leaders and received strong GOP support in passing on an 89-10 vote. In effect, the criticism by House Republicans was directed at their Senate party brethren as well as Democrats, adding another twist to the reasons for the impasse. Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, spoke with disdain on the House floor Tuesday about what he repeatedly referred to the ""wisdom of the Senate"" and asked his House colleagues to ""look what the Senate did,"" calling the two-month extension plan ""really irresponsible on all levels."" Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, also took issue with the Senate plan, saying he had asked Senate leaders to send the House a proposal but when it arrived, ""the House disagreed with it."" Boehner's problem is that he initially urged his House colleagues to back the Senate measure, according to a GOP source who spoke of what happened in a conference call of the Republican House caucus Saturday. While Boehner referred to the Senate measure approved that day as the best deal the House would get, his top deputy -- House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia -- opposed it and urged the caucus to reject it, the source said. Boehner disputed that characterization of the caucus meeting, saying Tuesday he let Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell know of his disapproval of a short-term extension as the Senate negotiation approached finality. ""I expressed my displeasure in once again taking the convenient route and not doing the people's work,"" said Boehner, who now leads the House Republican opposition to the Senate plan. Democrats have seized on the Republican disunity, noting that GOP leaders have blocked votes in both the House and Senate on payroll tax proposals backed by their party. ""If we do not have a payroll tax cut, it's because the Republicans in the House of Representatives have chosen to paint themselves in a different place than Republicans in the country and Republicans in the United States Senate,"" Pelosi noted Tuesday. While House Republicans say they support a one-year extension of the payroll tax cut, the fact that they refuse to pass the Senate measure that would provide a two-month extension and more time to negotiate shows they have a different agenda, she said. 'Whatever they say is irrelevant,"" Pelosi said of House Republicans. ""What they do is what's important, and what they're doing is not giving a payroll tax cut to 160 million Americans."" President Barack Obama joined the Democratic chorus, noting that Senate leaders from both parties had agreed to the short-term extension in order to guarantee that taxes don't increase for working Americans while negotiations continue early next year on the one-year extension that House Republicans say they support. ""What they're really holding out for is to wring concessions from Democrats on issues that have nothing to do with the payroll tax cut,"" Obama said of House Republicans. Another problem for Republicans is that they have blocked votes in both chambers on payroll tax-cut proposals they crafted or endorsed. House Republicans pushed through a bill extending the lower rate enacted last year through 2012, but tacked on other provisions opposed by Democrats and some GOP senators. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, was against holding a Senate vote on the House plan, apparently because he knew it would fail. On Monday night, House Republican leaders ruled out a direct up-and-down vote on the Senate's two-month extension of the payroll tax cut. Instead, the House on Tuesday passed a procedural resolution that expressed disagreement with the Senate plan and called for a conference committee made up of members of both chambers to negotiate a compromise. Obama and House Democrats called for a direct vote on the Senate plan, with Pelosi saying the refusal by GOP leaders to bring it up showed they feared enough Republican members would join the Democratic minority to pass it. To CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, Republicans have been ""outmaneuvered"" on the issue. Obama and the Democrats have ""put the Republicans in the House into a position where they look like they are clearly obstructing,"" Gergen said. The unresolved dispute continued to pit Republican versus Republican on Tuesday. Five mostly moderate Republican senators have called for the House to support the Senate's two-month extension. One of them, Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, issued a statement after Tuesday's House vote that said House Republicans ""would rather continue playing politics than find solutions."" ""Their actions will hurt American families and be detrimental to our fragile economy,"" said Brown, who is facing a stiff re-election challenge in heavily Democratic Massachusetts next year. ""We are Americans first; now is not the time for drawing lines in the sand."" Veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who voted for the Senate's proposal, told CNN that the reality of the issue is that the payroll tax cut must be extended to help out Americans still struggling in the economic recovery. ""It is harming the Republican Party,"" McCain said of the continuing impasse. ""It is harming the view, if it's possible any more, of the American people about Congress.""","House Republicans criticize Senate payroll tax plan negotiated by GOP leaders .

"Berlin (CNN) -- An Italian anarchist group has claimed responsibility for a failed mail bomb attack on Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, German investigators said Thursday. A suspicious package sent to Ackermann contained a functioning bomb, law enforcement officials in the state of Hesse said. The package also contained a note from the Informal Federation of Anarchists, or FAI, the Frankfurt state prosecutor and Hesse investigators said in a statement. The note mentioned ""three explosions against banks, bankers, ticks and blood suckers,"" the officials said. The letter raises the possibility that two other letter bombs were sent out to other institutions, the statement said. The FAI an offshoot of the Italian Anarchist Federation.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has postponed his return from exile until the political situation in Pakistan and the court cases against him are resolved, a senior leader in his party said Friday. Another party source who is close to Musharraf but did not want to be named said Musharraf will not return in the next year and is stepping out of politics. Musharraf has lived in exile in London and Dubai since resigning in 2008. He has vowed to return to his home country and run in upcoming elections, though his party recently said he was reassessing those plans after Pakistan's upper house of parliament demanded his arrest. ""Musharraf didn't want to postpone it; the party forced him to do this,"" said Muhammad Ali Saif, a senior leader in Musharraf's All Pakistan Muslim League. He said the party made the decision after two days of meetings in Dubai. The party will decide Musharraf's plan for return once the political situation has been resolved, he added. The unnamed party source said there has also been talk within the All Pakistan Muslim League about whether to disband because Musharraf's supporters are ""disheartened and frustrated."" Pakistan's upper house of Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution this week demanding Musharraf be arrested and tried for treason for unconstitutional acts during his regime, Sen. Muhammad Ibrahim Khan said. Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said Friday that Musharraf will ""certainly"" be arrested if he returns to Pakistan. The charges against Musharraf are in connection with the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. A U.N. report in 2010 accused Musharraf's government of failing to protect Bhutto, who had returned to Pakistan from exile to run for office. Musharraf has denied the allegations, arguing that Bhutto had police protection and took unnecessary risks. Pakistan is facing its most serious political crisis in years, with rapidly escalating conflicts between the civilian government, the military and the judiciary against the backdrop of a faltering economy, widespread poverty, corruption and the bloody war with Islamist militant groups.

"(CNN) -- As plans for the weekend funeral of singer Whitney Houston took shape, investigators continued Thursday to look into the singer's prescription drugs and her actions in the days before her death. Investigators are aware of Houston's partying at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, and other venues ""even the night before she died,"" a source close to the death investigation told CNN's Don Lemon on Thursday. Hotel personnel have said Houston, 48, was ""partying the night before her death in the bar,"" the source said. Investigators are looking at video from Houston's television appearances and other reports as part of the investigation into her physical state and behavior leading up to her death, the source said. Houston died Saturday on the eve of the Grammy Awards. Hotel surveillance video could reveal Houston's activities in the common areas of the hotel, the source said. The source would not confirm such video exists, but said investigators have requested it. The anti-anxiety medication Xanax was among prescription drugs found in the room, the source said. Houston's family members and staff confirmed she used the medication, the source said, but investigators don't know whether she took it the day she died. No Valium or other drugs classified as benzodiazepines, or sedatives, were found in the room, according to the source. Houston also had a prescription for the antibiotic amoxicillin, the source said, but ""if taken as prescribed, it's not going to kill you."" Medicine and pill bottles found in Houston's hotel room are currently undergoing basic testing, but nothing so far indicates anything criminal occurred, the source said. Officials are trying to speed up toxicology testing, the source told CNN. The source also said any preliminary reporting that family members were told a deadly mixture of alcohol and drugs led to Houston's death is speculative. Investigators do not know what mixture, if any Houston, had in her body. When paramedics arrived in Houston's hotel suite, she was in the room, not in the bathroom, the source said. ""She was lying on the floor, wet, on her back"" and had already been removed from the bathtub, according to the source. ""No one official ever saw her in the bathtub or the bathroom,"" the source said. ""The assistant and a bodyguard reported to emergency personnel that Houston was removed from the tub."" Her body was initially discovered by her assistant, Mary Jones, who was often called ""Aunt Mary,"" a family source said earlier this week. The source said investigators have contacted physicians and pharmacies around the country for information. The Mickey Fine Pharmacy and Grill in Beverly Hills was one of the pharmacies subpoenaed, the source said. The pharmacy did nothing criminal and is not the focus of the investigation, the source said. One of the prescriptions found in Houston's suite was from Mickey Fine, according to Ed Winter, assistant chief coroner at the Los Angeles County Coroner's office. But ""the prescription that came from Mickey Fine is not something that would kill her,"" Winter has said. Mickey Fine is ""getting a bad rap from some in the media as if they're the ones doling out prescriptions,"" the source told CNN. ""They're actually the good guys and have been extremely cooperative with the investigation."" Winter has said that while prescription medication was found in Houston's room, the amount was less than that usually present in overdose deaths. A second source, briefed on Houston's behavior and activity in the days before her death, said she was seen ordering and consuming considerable quantities of alcohol at the hotel two mornings last week. Houston ordered the drinks before 10 a.m. last Wednesday and Thursday from the bars in the lobby and pool area, the second source said Wednesday. Guests both days overheard Houston loudly complaining about her drinks, accusing bartenders of ""watering down"" or ""putting too much ice"" in them, the source said. Other guests expressed concern about Houston's erratic behavior, according to the source. Her disheveled appearance, including mismatched clothing, suggested to them that she was intoxicated. The source said Houston was seen jumping in and out of the pool and doing somersaults in the pool area. Saturday, the day she died, Houston was seen drinking at the pool in the morning, although the source noted witnesses said her behavior did not appear erratic. Houston's death certificate, filed Wednesday, listed her cause of death as ""deferred,"" meaning a determination is delayed pending more information. Speculation has grown while authorities await the outcome of toxicology tests that could take weeks. ""I know there are reports that she maybe was drowned or did she overdose, but we won't make a final determination until all the tests are in,"" Winter said earlier. He ruled out foul play and said there were no injuries to Houston's body. Houston's battles with drug addiction had cast a shadow in recent years over her impressive singing voice and her talent. However, a close family friend told CNN Tuesday that Houston had not used ""hard drugs"" for several years, although she was taking medication for a throat infection and Xanax or a similar drug for anxiety and to help her sleep. The friend said Houston was also known to have a drink if she went out. In Newark, New Jersey, fans left balloons, candles and photographs of the singer in front of the church where her funeral will take place Saturday. At New Hope Baptist Church, the Newark house of worship where Houston sang as a child, preparations were under way for the private, invitation-only service. Actor Kevin Costner, who starred with Houston in the 1992 hit movie ""The Bodyguard,"" will speak at her funeral, according to a source with knowledge of the funeral plans. The ceremony will feature performances by Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys and Aretha Franklin, who is Houston's godmother, a Houston representative said. Singer Roberta Flack will attend, but it was not known Thursday whether she would perform. Houston's former husband, Bobby Brown will attend and perform later in the day with his group New Edition. Brown considers performing as therapy to get him through a difficult time, a source close to him said. Houston's funeral will be broadcast Saturday . Samuel DiMaio, Newark police director, told reporters Thursday his advice to fans and curious members of the public was to stay home and watch the ceremony on television, as they will not be able to get close to the church. The service is expected to be made available for television and web streaming, Houston's publicist said. A perimeter will be set up for four blocks in two directions, and two blocks in the other directions, DiMaio said. The closest the public will be able to get is a staging area two blocks away. Although the family is not commenting on Houston's burial location, her death certificate filed Wednesday in Los Angeles lists it as Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, New Jersey. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced earlier this week that he plans to have the state's flags fly at half-staff on Friday. Since then, Christie has been standing ground against critics who disagree with his choice to use a tribute typically used to honor fallen soldiers or first responders. One Twitter user weighed in, ""Our flag is to be used to honor true American heroes, the ones you just disrespected."" To that response, Christie seemed to agree to disagree. ""Many in the state are mourning the loss of a cultural icon in NJ's history,"" he wrote. ""We are recognizing her for those contributions."" Educators and Houston friends in East Orange, New Jersey, where Houston attended school. are firm in the their recollections. ""She was a beautiful little girl, very quiet,"" said Henry Hamilton, who was Houston's principal while she was at Franklin Elementary School. ""She was well-respected and never came to the office for discipline problems."" The school is now called the Whitney E. Houston Academy of Creative and Performing Arts. Childhood friend Erica Taylor said the Houston residence was popular in the summertime: It was the only one to have a built-in swimming pool. ""We would talk about boys and what we were doing over the summer and how it was just fun to be in the pool,"" said Taylor. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Kareen Wynter, Ross Levitt, Gary Tuchman, Stan Wilson, Alan Duke, Denise Quan and Deb Feyerick contributed to this report.","Investigators trying to speed up toxicology results, source says .

"Tegucigalpa, Honduras (CNN) -- The death toll from a prison fire in central Honduras rose to 382 Thursday, as new details emerged about what happened when flames tore through the overcrowded facility. Officials transported bodies from the prison in Comayagua to the capital, Tegucigalpa, where investigators worked to identify the victims. The cause of the fire remained unknown, and the federal government asked for patience during its inquiry. But desperate families said they didn't want to wait to recover the remains of their loved ones. ""What we are hoping for is that they give them to us so we can leave because we cannot stand the hunger, too,"" said Francisca Gomez, the sister of one of the victims. ""We have our children with us and you know that we've been here waiting and no one gives us answers."" The Comayagua fire department gave the new death toll, and said that it remained unknown if others escaped or would be added to the casualty list. The hypothesis that a mattress fire started the blaze was gaining traction, fire operations chief Jorge Turcios said Thursday. Comayagua's governor said she received a call from an inmate inside the prison reporting the fire. ""What I know, according to what I've been told, is that someone lit a mattress on fire and said, 'We're all going to die,'"" Gov. Paola Castro said. Inmates have also complained that guards were slow to open doors for them to escape. Prisoners broke out of the facility any way they could, one survivor said. ""The authorities should have opened the gates,"" said Odalis Aleyda Najera, a relative of a victim. ""It is preferable to face the responsibility for a mass escape of prisoners and avoid situations like this where there are more than 300 dead inmates."" Outrage over the fire increased after the president of the country's supreme court admitted that only 40% of the inmates in the prison had been convicted. The majority were awaiting trial or waiting for charges to be filed against them. ""Honduras passed an anti-gang law, and what it allowed police to do is to sweep anybody off the streets ... who they had a suspicion was a member of a gang, but really had no proof. So the prison population swelled,"" said Vikki Gass of the Washington Office on Latin America. ""And so in the case of Comayagua, you don't have enough magistrates or judges to process the people who are being detained."" Authorities have not determined what caused the fire, but the nation's electric utility will review wiring in all prison facilities as a ""preventative measure,"" Honduran President Porfirio Lobo said, ""because that can be one of the causes of these types of disasters."" The prison facility was well over capacity, said Rodrigo Escobar Gil of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. ""The prisoners slept on the floor and they had to share cells in truly deplorable conditions,"" he said. At the request of Honduran officials, arson experts from the United States were expected to arrive in Honduras Thursday to lend a hand, Turcios said. The team from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) will reconstruct the scene, conduct interviews and sift through debris to obtain evidence and determine the origin of the blaze, the agency said in a statement. Teams from El Salvador, Chile and Mexico were also expected to help Honduran authorities. Tuesday night's blaze was the third fatal prison fire in recent years in the country. In 2003, 61 prisoners were killed in a fire at a prison in La Ceiba. In 2004, 107 died in a fire at a San Pedro Sula prison. The U.S. State Department published a report last April criticizing conditions at Honduras' 24 prisons. Prisoners ""suffered from severe overcrowding, malnutrition, and lack of adequate sanitation,"" the report said, citing human rights groups. CNN's Carol Cratty, Brooke Baldwin and Camilo Egana contributed to this report.","NEW: A team from the ATF will help investigate the blaze .

"(CNN) -- Representatives of India and Pakistan on Tuesday will hold the second day of two-day talks on conventional and nuclear weapons, Indian officials said. No major developments were expected from the high-level talks, which are being held in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. But the discussions are aimed at building confidence between the two nuclear powers, according to a statement from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. Dialogue will help the countries understand each other's nuclear doctrine, Pakistan's state-run agency cited foreign office spokesman Abdul Basit as saying. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since the partition of the Asian subcontinent in 1947. Two of them were over Kashmir, which is claimed by both countries. Earlier this year, New Delhi and Islamabad agreed to resume peace talks frozen by the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. India blamed Pakistani militants for the strike that killed more than 160 people in its financial capital. In July, both nations vowed they would not allow their relationship to slide backward again. In 2004, the nations agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues, including Kashmir, terrorism and Pakistan's concerns over river dams on the Indian side of the border. Pakistan sees them as a threat to its water supplies. CNN's Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","No major developments are expected from the high-level talks .

"(CNN) -- Nature abhors a vacuum but terrorism relishes one. And Iraq appears to be offering new space for al Qaeda and other militant groups, as political rivalries and sectarian animosities deepen. The coordinated bomb explosions across Baghdad Thursday -- which killed more than 60 people -- bear the hallmark of Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), which is closely associated with al Qaeda. No other group in Iraq has shown itself capable of such synchronized suicide attacks. Some, but not all, of the bombings were in Shiite neighborhoods; frequently al Qaeda's targets appear indiscriminate as part of a strategy to sow fear and stir sectarian tensions. The attacks come as Iraq's Shiite Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, demands the surrender of Iraq's Sunni Vice-President, Tareq al Hashimi, on charges that he ordered bombings and assassinations. Hashimi has taken refuge in the northern Kurdish-administered part of Iraq, and the country's always-fragile tripartite balance now appears to be in grave danger -- with the restraining effect of a U.S. military presence gone. Ramzy Mardini, of the Institute for the Study of War, believes the presence of U.S. troops helped stabilize Iraq's political discourse, and ""their premature removal from the political space has altered the manner on which Iraq's actors interact."" But even before their departure, there were ominous signs, as two largely Sunni provinces declared their intent to become autonomous regions. Those moves appeared to have the support -- or at least sympathy -- of Vice-President Hashemi. Al Qaeda in Iraq has shown before that one of its aims is to spark sectarian bloodshed between Iraq's Sunnis and Shiites. Under the leadership of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, it carried out a double bombing of one of Shiite Islam's most holy places -- the Askariya shrine in Samarra -- in February 2006. The plan nearly worked: there were retaliatory attacks against Sunni mosques and for nearly two years Iraq was mired in sectarian bloodletting. In words that may apply equally today, Iraq's national security adviser at the time, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, said: ""The main aim of these terrorist groups is to drag Iraq into a civil war."" While political violence in Iraq is nowhere near its peak of 2006-07, it has never gone away. ISI regrouped after the death of Zarqawi, and after losing support within the Sunni community because of its vicious attacks on civilians. Iraqi officials speak of a ""third generation"" of al Qaeda in Iraq, with fewer foreign fighters and more battle-hardened Iraqi Sunnis. Analysts say ISI has turned to bank raids and other forms of crime to finance its activities, and is targeting police patrols in areas where it is strong, largely north of Baghdad. U.S. officials say that unlike al Qaeda under Zarqawi, the group no longer holds swathes of territory, but acts in smaller cells. It is strongest in the city of Mosul, 260 miles north of Baghdad and one of Iraq's many sectarian faultlines. The city is a base for ISI but rarely suffers from its violence. But it has shown it can operate across the country. On one day in August, 13 people were killed and dozens injured in attacks blamed on ISI. Two bombs in Baghdad killed 18 people at the end of October. U.S. officials expected ISI to step up its campaign on the heels of a U.S. withdrawal. The former spokesman for the U.S. military in Iraq, Major General Jeffrey Buchanan said: ""It's likely they will try to harbor their resources for a significant series of attacks after the U.S. military withdrawal if for no other reason than to demonstrate their relevance."" He added that ""since August al Qaeda has been working really hard to foment sectarian conflict,"" and warned that ""if the Iraqi security forces are not able to put pressure on them, they could regenerate."" But when the U.S. military left Iraq, it took its intelligence-gathering with it -- making the job of Iraqi counter-terrorism units more challenging still. ""Without all the enablers we provide, there's no doubt there will be less capability than there is right now,"" Buchanan said a few weeks ago. Shiite militias -- often supported by Iran -- have emerged to counter the threat of Sunni militancy. And as Iraqi security forces have gone after Sunni militants, the balance of power has tipped toward these Shiite militias -- groups like Asaib ahl-Haq and Kata'ib Hezballah. U.S. officials contend that Shiite groups sponsored by Iran were a greater danger than al Qaeda to the country's stability. Despite his good relations with Iran, Prime Minister Maliki is well aware that its influence is a double-edged sword -- and is anxious that Iraq does not become a battleground between the Islamic republic and the Sunni monarchy in Saudi Arabia. ""We do not allow Iran to use us against others that Iran has problems with, and we do not allow others to use us against Iran,"" he said last week. But Iraq has little control over its own borders, and a former U.S. military officer who served in Iraq told CNN last week that its security forces were still largely divided on sectarian lines. The situation in neighboring Syria adds another dimension to the situation. Thousands of Sunnis took refuge there after the fall of Saddam Hussein, but if the regime of President Bashar al Assad falls, they may need to return home. Maliki has already said that Assad's fall could set off a regional sectarian crisis -- one reason perhaps that his government has opposed Arab League sanctions against Syria. And some Iraqi Shiites see a Saudi hand at work in Syria. For its part, Iran has all the more reason to reinforce its influence in Iraq should its long-time Arab ally in Damascus be ousted. This regional volatility only adds fuel to an always combustible internal situation. Last week, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said after a visit to Baghdad: ""The leadership of Iraq is committed to a strong and sovereign and independent Iraq and for that reason I am confident they are going to succeed."" Al Qaeda and its enemies at the other end of the religious spectrum are doing their best to prove him wrong.","Bombings are an indication that terror groups in Iraq are finding space to operate .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City's unbeaten Premier League run came to an end on Monday as Chelsea blew the English title race wide open with a 2-1 victory at home to their 10-man opponents. City traveled to London seeking to re-establish a five-point lead over local rivals Manchester United, and made the perfect start when Mario Balotelli scored in just the second minute. But Raul Meireles equalized in the pouring rain on 34, and the visitors had defender Gael Clichy sent off for second booking just before the hour mark. Substitute Frank Lampard then condemned Roberto Mancini's men to a first defeat in 15 league games with an 83rd-minute penalty that lifted Chelsea up to third place above London rivals Tottenham on goal difference. Is Mancini the right man for Manchester City? ""The Chelsea players after the game were really happy to beat us. That shows we are a top team at this moment and that all the teams want to beat us, and this is important for us,"" manager Mancini said. ""We worked well up to now and now we should continue. I hope that we can go another 14 games without losing."" City went into the game having been eliminated from the European Champions League at the group stage despite beating Bayern Munich in Wednesday's final game. Balotelli was caught breaking a club curfew before this match, but the Italy striker showed his undoubted on-field class with the opening goal -- his 11th this season. Sergio Aguero showed great skill to turn inside Chelsea captain John Terry and thread a perfect pass for the 21-year-old, who held off Branislav Ivanovic and coolly slotted past goalkeeper Petr Cech for his eighth in the league. Chelsea's Anelka to join Chinese club . City could have had a 14th-minute penalty when Jose Bosingwa appeared to bring down David Silva, but the referee decided otherwise in a decision which manager Mancini later said was the turning point in the match. Chelsea went through to the last 16 of the Champions League last week with an emphatic win over Valencia which relieved the pressure on manager Andre Villas-Boas. However, he was on the defensive after that victory and accused the media of unfair treatment -- being unhappy with criticism of the form that left Chelsea 10 points adrift of City going into Monday's match. The return to form shown against the Spaniards continued as young striker Daniel Sturridge gathered a superb long pass from Terry and raced past Clichy down the left before cutting back to Meireles, and the Portugal midfielder volleyed the equalizer. Clichy's night ended in the 58th minute when the France international fouled Brazil midfielder Ramires, and Chelsea made full use of their extra man. Etherington double ends Tottenham's winning run . The 22-year-old Sturridge, who made his England debut last month, fired in a left-foot shot that struck the raised arm of City defender Joleon Lescott. Veteran midfielder Lampard, who sat out last Tuesday's European game and this time came on to replace Meireles in the 73rd minute, stepped up and smashed the resulting penalty past England goalkeeper Joe Hart. ""I went out and missed a penalty a few weeks ago and the next one is always hard to take,"" he said. ""You've got to be big enough and stand up and take them, and they're the moments. I was very relieved when it hit the back of the net."" The defeat means City can lose the lead on Sunday when United travel to Queens Park Rangers in the early match, then Mancini's side face another big test against in-form Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium later that day. Chelsea joined Tottenham on 31 points, having played one more game ahead of their clash on December 22 -- which follows Saturday's trip to lowly Wigan . ""Our objective was to shorten the distance to the leaders today, and we managed to do exactly that, but we don't take extra flavor from being the first team to beat them,"" Villas-Boas said. ""We needed to do our job to get our challenge back on track, and I think it's pretty much alive now.""","Chelsea climb to third place after beating 10-man Manchester City 2-1 .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- About 400 members of an exiled Iranian opposition group who are the first to leave a long-term camp in Iraq under a U.N. plan criticized their treatment and the conditions at the new temporary site Saturday. The group left Camp Ashraf at midnight following 12 hours of inspections and checks, Shahin Gobadi of the National Council of Resistance of Iran said in a statement. When they arrived seven hours later at the new site, a former U.S. military base near Baghdad International Airport called Camp Liberty, the group discovered a heavy presence of police. Another inspection was then demanded, prompting the residents to protest what they consider ""degrading, humiliating and inhumane treatment"" and the obstructive behavior of the Iraqi forces by refusing to leave the transit buses, Gobadi said. ""The preliminary reports indicate that Camp Liberty is a prison from all aspects,"" he added. The group's relocation to the new site was agreed between the United Nations, Iraqi authorities, the United States and the European Union. From there, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees will begin efforts to resettle the group outside of the country. Martin Kobler, the U.N. secretary general's special representative and head of the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), was at the temporary site to welcome the new arrivals. ""This is the first step towards a better future outside Iraq,"" he said. ""I look forward to their continued cooperation with the Iraqi authorities to complete the relocation without delay."" He also praised the Iraqi for having ensured the ""safe and secure relocation"" of the first group of residents and urged them to guarantee the human rights and safety of all those still to relocate. Camp Ashraf has been home to members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq, or MEK, for more than 25 years. More than 3,000 exiles, described as Iranian resistance figures and their sympathizers, live at the camp. The MEK has been on the U.S. terrorism list since 1997 because of the killing of six Americans in Iran in the 1970s and an attempted attack against the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992. However, since 2004, the United States has considered the residents of Camp Ashraf ""noncombatants"" and ""protected persons"" under the Geneva Conventions. Before moving, the Camp Ashraf residents had demanded a commitment that no Iraqi police would remain inside the new site, in order to ensure the security of the residents. The group believes the current regime in Iraq, under orders from Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, has previously staged deadly attacks against Camp Ashraf. Instead, there are several police posts inside the facility and residents must be accompanied by the police even to go to the dining area, Gobadi said. ""The most important of the Ashraf residents' demands is that the police must leave the camp area and stay outside the walls,"" a statement released by the group Friday said. ""This is a condition without which it will be impossible to have more people in Liberty as it will result in further confrontations, tensions and killing."" The residents also asked for guarantees with regards to the site's infrastructure -- and say these have not been met. ""In a nutshell, Camp Liberty lacks the most basic international humanitarian standards and human rights standards are not met,"" the statement said. The residents say the camp is much smaller than they were told it would be, and that they are being denied free movement and access to medical services. The U.N.'s refugee agency confirmed that the new camp's infrastructure and facilities were in line with international humanitarian standards at the end of January, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said earlier this week. Camp Ashraf was established in 1986 after former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invited members of the MEK to relocate to Iraq in an effort to undermine the Iranian government, which was then at war with Iraq. Iran also considers the group to be a terrorist organization. A U.N. commission on refugees has described the residents as ""formal asylum seekers"" from persecution by the regime in Iran. The temporary facility, at what was formerly the U.S.-run Camp Liberty, will remain open for an unspecified period of time, though a senior U.S. administration official said in December that there were plans to keep it open until all of the camp residents were resettled. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","NEW: ""This is the first step towards a better future outside Iraq,"" a U.N. official says .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Setting one species up to scare off or even kill another is nothing new. One of the world's most fearsome killers? Me? The heart-stoppingly infamous cane toad. Toads, bees, mongoose and even moths have all been utilized with varying degrees of success over the years in the hope that they could do the job humans couldn't. Sometimes it works, frequently it doesn't, and in some cases we are still waiting to find out. If any of these following examples teaches us anything at all, it is that if you are going to play with Nature, you do so at your own peril. Click here for gallery » . The Cane Toad . Who would have thought a humble toad could end up as the killer of one of the world's most fearsome creatures, the crocodile? It all started off so innocently, too. Introduced to Australia in 1935 from Hawaii, the cane toad, which is native to Central and South America, was supposed to kill off the scarab beetles that were decimating Australian sugarcane crops. Unfortunately, the toads failed to go after the beetles and decided to multiply at a very fast rate instead (they can lay between 8,000 and 30,000 eggs in one go) ending up as another pest the Australians were keen to see the back of. According to the Australian Department of the Environment and Heritage (DEH), the cane toad ""expanded through Australia's northern landscape at 27-50 kilometers a year"" and is now heading south at a rate of 1.3 kilometers a year. Cane toads not only eat pretty much anything that can fit in their mouths, but as of yet, no known predators or diseases have been identified that can take them on. The problem is that they are extremely toxic, with the DEH stating ""almost anything that eats the toad dies rapidly from heart failure"". And that includes crocodiles. According to the University of Sydney, crocodile populations that have come across these new pests have been dropping like flies, in some places by as much as 77 percent. Small Indian mongoose . The risk with hired killers is that sometimes they can be a bit too good at their job. Such is the case with the small Indian mongoose, which was introduced into Hawaii and some of its surrounding islands in 1883. The idea was the mongoose, a ""voracious and opportunistic predator,"" according to Columbia University, would keep rats out of the sugarcane fields, where they had been feasting on what was on offer. The mongooses came in and missed out on the rats, as the former happened to be day-lovers, while the latter was nocturnal. So they turned their attention to other species instead, including birds (specifically ground nesters), small mammals and reptiles (they particularly liked snakes and iguanas). Little did the Hawaiians know at the time, but the small Indian mongoose is one of the world's most fearsome killers, now listed by the World Conservation Union in the top 100 of the world's worst invaders. These tiny creatures have hunted several species to extinction, including, says Columbia University, at least seven types of amphibians and reptiles in the West Indies; and in Jamaica alone it has been responsible for the extinction of a lizard, a snake, a rat and two birds. In Hawaii, the endangered Hawaiian crow, the endangered dark-rumped petrel and the nene goose are now all at risk, thanks to the appetite of this tiny, furry creature. And to make matters worse, this particular mongoose is a vector for rabies too. The English sparrow . The early bird catches the worm, but if that bird is an English sparrow, it does a little more than that, as the Americans found out in 1850. It was then that the bird was intentionally introduced to the U.S. as a means of protecting trees from canker worms. But according to Cornell University, the sparrow also set about feasting on crops as well. The sparrow had a very varied appetite, feeding on wheat, oats, corn and barley, pretty much any vegetable or fruit it laid its eyes on and it had a taste for chicken feed too. Surprisingly for its size, the sparrow is also a fairly aggressive creature and proved a bit of a bully to the locals, ""displacing some native birds and harassing others"", says Cornell. To add insult to injury, it carried 29 diseases that infected both humans and livestock. While U.S. populations are now largely on the decline, according to the Global Invasive Species Database, Australia meanwhile is on high alert, with the bird now having been assigned as ""an extreme threat category"" there. The red Fox . Australia has an unenviable claim to fame: it is home to the most number of mammal extinctions in the world. According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), nearly half of all mammals that have gone extinct in the last 200 years, have been Australian. And much of the responsibility for these extinctions rests on the shoulders of introduced predators like the red fox. Just on its own the red fox could be responsible for ""dozens of small mammal extinctions"" in the country, according to Columbia University. The English brought the red fox with them to the country in 1855, not only introducing it for a spot of hunting, but also, it is thought, to control the brown hare populations. Unfortunately, the red fox was an excellent predator but it liked chasing after more types of creatures than just the brown hare. It had a ball, as Australian wildlife just wasn't equipped to deal with it. As a result, it freely preyed on birds, mammals of varying sizes and reptiles. It particularly seemed to like newborn lambs, goat kids and chickens, creating an economic headache for local farmers. And it didn't take them too long to spread either -- according to Australia's DEH, it took the red fox just 100 years to inhabit almost the entire continent. A natural scavenger, the red fox is incredibly adaptable too, which has meant not only has it proliferated on a massive scale, but with the absence of any real predators to speak of, they have proven very difficult indeed to kill. The European red fox is often described as Australia's number one predator; and as its also a ""key carrier of rabies"", says Columbia, the red fox is up there amongst Australia's most unwelcome guests.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Police and protesters clashed across Nigeria on Monday amid a nationwide strike and widespread protests over a government decision that more than doubled fuel prices in the largely impoverished country. Among other incidents, police reportedly fired on protesters in the northern Nigerian state of Kano, injuring at least 13 people, according to a physician who was among the protesters. Demonstrators were gathered listening to speeches when police ""suddenly came and some were shooting and some were throwing tear gas,"" Shehi Ali, vice chairman of the Nigeria Medical Association, told CNN. Ali said one protester, a 12-year-old boy, was shot in the neck. Another protester was shot in the groin, he said. ""We were trying to re-enact what took place in Egypt at Tahrir Square,"" Ali said of what had been peaceful protests. Kano Police Commissioner Ibrahim Idris denied that officers fired on protesters. He said that officers were forced to use tear gas on ""miscreants and drug addicts"" who had tried to storm the governor's residence. ""These people were trying to take advantage of the situation and loot, they are criminals,"" he told CNN. The protests have otherwise been largely peaceful, and officers were working alongside the Nigeria Labour Congress, one of the groups staging the nationwide strikes, Idris said. Elsewhere, Sanya Femi, a union official, said three union members had been killed by police gunfire during a peaceful protest in Lagos. But Sunday Salailo, a trade union president, said he had no reports of union members dying. There was no immediate comment from Nigerian authorities on those accounts of violence. Lagos, a city of nearly 8 million people, was eerily quiet Monday afternoon. With many businesses shut down amid a call for a nationwide strike, few cars traveled the city's normally teeming roads. Residents had packed stores on Sunday, laying in supplies in anticipation of the protests and strikes, The Guardian newspaper of Nigeria reported. The commander of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Ade Abolurin, deployed 43,000 members of the paramilitary force and 160,000 volunteers in response to the planned strike and protests, warning protesters ""against indulging in criminal activities,"" according to a notice posted on the organization's Facebook page. The protests and strikes follow the government's January 1 decision to remove fuel subsidies in the country, which is Africa's largest oil producer. Read about what is behind the fuel strike . Citizens of Africa's most populous nation have staged ""Occupy Nigeria"" mass demonstrations since the decision, with police responding forcefully in some cases. ""I am not an economist, but it is clear common sense that the removal of fuel subsidy, even if it seems to be the easiest solution, is not even an option,"" said Hadiza Halliru, an Abuja protester. ""The fuel hike, which has doubled and even tripled in some states, would affect not only transportation but the price of foodstuff, clothing, any form of direct labor, construction costs. But salaries still remain the same, which means everyone who directly pays bills will be affected, especially the middle class and the poor."" Many Nigerians view the subsidy as the only benefit of living in an oil-producing country that has little infrastructure, poor roads, high unemployment and intermittent electric power. Are you there? Share your story . ""Though we know that in the long run, removal of subsidy will help the economy, for now it is a high-profile lifestyle that is unbearable for most Nigerians, and soon the poorer ones will die out,"" said protester Diane Awunah, who lives in Abuja. Money saved by removing the subsidy will help improve public amenities and build much-needed infrastructure, said Reuben Abati, a spokesman for President Goodluck Jonathan. But there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure -- Nigeria is regularly voted among the most corrupt countries in the world. The nation produces around 2.4 million barrels of crude oil a day, but it imports roughly 70% of its gasoline from countries as far afield as the United Kingdom and Venezuela, because most of its own refineries are inoperative after years of corruption-fueled neglect. In a televised address, Jonathan urged citizens to avoid ""mindless acts of violence"" and said he empathized with those protesting against the government's decision to cut fuel subsidies. ""If I were in your shoes, I probably would ... hold the same critical views about government,"" the president said Saturday. The government has shunned calls to resume the subsidy, and it has ordered the distribution of mass transit buses to major cities. Jonathan said the decision to cut the subsidies will benefit the public in the future. The U.S. Embassy in Abuja warned Americans to stockpile food, conserve fuel and delay travel while the strike and protests are ongoing.

"(CNN) -- Paris St Germain have completed the signing of Barcelona's Brazilian left-back Maxwell on a three-and-a-half year contract for an undisclosed fee. The 30-year-old finalized his move on Thursday after passing a medical and agreeing personal terms with the big-spending French league leaders. Maxwell, who has never made a full international appearance for his country, joined Barcelona from Inter Milan in July 2009, and played 57 La Liga matches for the club without scoring a goal. Who are football's top January transfer targets? In his two full seasons with the Catalan giants, Maxwell collected a remarkable 10 trophies; three Spanish Super Cups, two European Super Cups, two League titles, two Club World Cups and one Champions League. However, he struggled to command a regular place in the Barcelona side, with compatriot Adriano and Frenchman Eric Abidal often selected ahead of him. PSG sporting director Leonardo told reporters: ""We're thrilled, he is a player I have always liked and who plays in the same position that I used to play in -- we have something in common."" Maxwell himself added: ""The main motivation for me to come here was the interest that PSG showed in me. The ambition the club has for the future also persuaded me to join."" Paris St Germain, who appointed Italian Carlo Ancelotti as their new coach late last year and are boosted by funds from their cash-rich Qatari owners, are currently three points clear at the top of the French table.","Brazilian defender Maxwell has completed his transfer to Paris St Germain .

"(CNN) -- They have dismissed him, attempted to silence him and threatened him with arrest. Mehdi Karrubi, pictured, ran against hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June 12 election. But Iran's Islamic hardliners so far have failed to stifle opposition leader Mehdi Karrubi's claims that post-election detainees have been abused -- some even raped -- behind bars. Actually, the 72-year-old cleric has grown increasingly defiant in recent weeks. His latest move: going public with a first-hand account from a detainee who says he was raped in a Tehran prison. ""I was in prison, blindfolded and tied down. They beat me almost to death and did the most despicable thing to me, which is rejected even by all infidels and idol worshipers and I only had the courage to make Mr. Karrubi aware of this,"" the unidentified male says in a statement posted Monday on Karrubi's party Web site. The male says he spoke to Karrubi after his release and ""I was convinced that if someone is raped -- while his hands and feet are tied and he has not powers to defend himself -- not only has he not committed a sin, but he has been victimized."" The statement alleges incidents of sexual abuse in Kahrizak prison, which has since been ordered closed by the supreme leader of Iran. The male says he was subjected to humiliating questions by judiciary officials as recently as Thursday. Karrubi said the man's account is the tip of the iceberg, and that he will continue posting accounts on the Web site if ""the current trend continues."" Iranian government officials could not be reached late Monday. However, the government this month firmly denied Karrubi's rape allegations, dismissing them as lies. Karrubi, along with opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, ran against hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June 12 election. Despite reformists crying foul, Iran's election authority declared Ahmadinejad the overwhelming winner, driving hundreds of thousands of Iranians to the streets in protest. Karrubi, a former parliamentary speaker, has since been scorned by government hardliners, whose credibility and legitimacy have been publicly questioned in the aftermath of the election. Allegations of the torture, abuse and rape of post-election detainees have forced the Islamic regime to respond to behavior inside prisons that has been compared to the abuse of political prisoners under the regime of the Shah of Iran, who was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Karrubi's claims have sparked outrage from human rights groups, including Amnesty International, which have called on Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to authorize an independent inquiry and allow international experts to participate in the investigation. Khamenei hasn't taken up their offer. However, Iran's powerful conservative parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani, said a special committee of Iran's parliament, or Majlis, conducted a ""precise and comprehensive inquiry"" into the treatment at Tehran's Evin and Kahrizak prisons, and found ""no cases of rape or sexual abuse,"" government-funded Press TV has reported. He accused Karrubi of spreading ""sheer lies."" Still, on Monday the special parliamentary committee agreed to review Karrubi's evidence and meet with four individuals who say they were tortured and raped while in prison, according to the Web site of Karrubi's Etemad-e Melli (National Trust) party. ""But if we determine that these were purely fabricated allegations in order to serve against the benefit of the system, we will also subject the perpetrators of such lies to prosecution,"" said Kazem Jalili, the head of the committee, according to the Web site. Such threats aren't new for Karrubi. Last week, the governor of Tehran province demanded legal action against Karrubi for making the rape allegations. ""If such a person has made such accusations that have infuriated the people and it is shown that he cannot prove them, then legal steps must be taken with regards to this person,"" said Gov. Morteza Tamaddon, according to the Iran Labor News Agency. Ayatollah Hossein Taeeb, commander of the Basij militia, which attacked protesters during the unrest that followed the election, has allegedly called for Karrubi to be flogged 80 times. CNN could not independently confirm Taeeb's remark, which was posted on the Web site of the reformist Etemad-e Melli newspaper. That newspaper, which is aligned with Karrubi, was shut down by Iranian authorities on August 16 for publishing ""unlawful and criminal material,"" state-run media reported, though details about the materials in question were not revealed.","Opposition leader Mehdi Karrubi claims post-election detainees have been abused .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A high-ranking Turkish government minister is calling for the speedy punishment of several police officers who were caught on a police station camera, repeatedly slapping a detained woman in the face and pulling her hair even after she had been hand-cuffed. The video showed an incident that took place nearly five months ago. But the case did not attract national outrage in Turkey until the silent police station camera footage was broadcast last weekend by Turkish television stations. The video showed a heated argument in an office between two plain-clothed police officers and Fevziye Cengiz, a woman who had been arrested and brought to a police station in the western Turkish port city of Izmir last July. Cengiz, who was dressed in shorts and a tank-top, yelled and backed away from the men. Suddenly, the officers started slapping Cengiz and yanking her hair. Later, the camera showed them wrestling Cengiz to the ground as a third man in police uniform occasionally stepped in to help restrain the woman and pick fallen items off the floor. After handcuffing Cengiz, the plain-clothed officers held her against a wall and took turns delivering open-handed blows to her face. ""The incident in Izmir is unacceptable and we definitely consider this incident as one for which the perpetrators should be punished,"" said Fatma Sahin, Turkey's family and social policies minister, in a statement released on her ministry's web-site on Sunday. ""There is political will and state authority to take the required action in a speedy way. Therefore, both legal and administrative investigations have been launched and those policemen are suspended."" Cengiz' lawyer told CNN police arrested her client during a raid at an Izmir night club on the night of July 16. ""The violence against my client, which started when she was taken with the excuse that she did not have her ID, continued at the police station,"" the lawyer, Hanife Yildirim, told CNN. ""When I met my client almost a week later, she still had a black eye and there were other marks on her."" Soon after her release on July 17, Cengiz filed a formal complaint against the police with the assistance of the Izmir Bar Association's human rights department. In the meantime, authorities pressed criminal charges against Cengiz for resisting arrest and ""reckless behavior."" ""She is facing up to six years imprisonment,"" said Yildirim. ""The charge against the policemen is 'cause of injury through excessive force' with up to 1.5 years' punishment."" Police in Izmir have not responded to requests from CNN to comment on the case. Cengiz' case sparked outrage throughout the media and among human rights groups in Turkey. Legal experts with the Turkish Human Rights Foundation (TIHV), which has been providing medical and legal support to Cengiz, told CNN that the number of complaints of torture and ill-treatment has grown in 2011 compared to the previous year. ""Although laws ban such behavior, there is a lack of punishment for the security forces that commit these abuses, which means that security forces are not deterred,"" said Coskun Usterci, an executive board member in the TIHV's Izmir branch. Usterci argued that Cengiz' case was a rarity, because the in-house police station video camera was not tampered with after the victim's complaint was formally lodged. ""During judicial or investigative processes of such situations, the camera recordings in the police stations (often) turn out to be either deleted or recorded over or the camera turns out to be broken,"" Usterci said in a phone interview with CNN. ""To give a rough percentage, in 80% of the situations, this happens. Therefore it is very important that in this case the prosecutor got hold of those videos and included them in the case file."" In its annual report on Turkey in 2011, Amnesty International concluded ""investigations of alleged human rights abuses by state officials remained flawed ... the losing of evidence by state officials and counter-charges being issued against those who alleged human rights abuses contributed to the perpetuation of impunity."" Human rights activists argued Cengiz' case also high-lighted the persistent problem of violence against women in Turkey. ""Turkey continues to be a country where discrimination and violence against women is high. In 2011, an average of three women a day were killed,"" announced the Turkish Human Rights Foundation and the Human Rights Association, in a joint press release this month. The two police officers shown beating Cengiz are expected to appear in court in February 2012. In her statement, Family and Social Policies Minister Sahin called Cengiz's case ""an individual mistake,"" and suggested it could not be attributed to all Turkish police officers. ""We will also be following up on this,"" she concluded. ""Violence in a police station, especially against a woman, is unacceptable.""","Minister calls for speedy punishment for officers .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea's new supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, appears to have carried out his first public inspection with the country's military since the death last month of his father, Kim Jong Il. The supreme commander of the nuclear-armed state's military spent New Year's Day with the Seoul Ryu Kyong Su 105 Guards Tank Division, signaling he will carry on his father's ""military first"" policy, state media KCNA said on Sunday. ""He (Kim Jong Un) underlined the need to be ready for fight and (to) keep arms and combat and technical equipment always ready for actions in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance,"" KCNA said. He was accompanied by his uncle Jang Song Taek, the senior official believed to be his patron, and the military chief of staff, Ri Yong Ho, KCNA reported. The visit came on the same day that North Korea urged its people to show allegiance to the death for Kim Jong Un. KCNA published North Korea's annual New Year's Day message, saying, ""The entire army should place absolute trust in and follow Kim Jong Un and become human rifles and bombs to defend him unto death."" The editorial is jointly published in the North's leading newspapers and is often scrutinized by South Korean and foreign officials for any signs of the North's intentions and policies for the year. The editorial called ""U.S. aggressor forces"" the main obstacle to peace in the Korean peninsula and called for their withdrawal. It criticized ""every move of reckless military provocation, arms buildup and war exercises against the North."" The United States currently has around 28,500 military personnel stationed in South Korea, which North Korea claims is the main impediment to reunification of the Korean people. The United States fought on the side of the South during the 1950-53 war and keeps troops in country as a deterrent against the North. The editorial also renewed the attack against the Lee Myung-bak government in the South, calling government officials ""traitors"" for not allowing more delegations to Pyongyang to pay respects to the late Kim Jong Il. Friday, KCNA quoted a National Defense Commission statement saying Pyongyang ""will have no dealings with the Lee Myung-bak group of traitors forever."" South Korea's Unification Ministry said it found the statement ""regretful. However the ministry's basic principle towards easing tensions in inter-Korean relations and resolving problems through dialogues remains still."" The editorial also claimed North Korea is ""at the epochal point of opening the gates of a thriving country."" For North Korea, 2012 is an important year was it marks 100 years since the birth of founder Kim Il Sung and the year the ""juche,"" or self-reliance policy, will bear fruit, according to the government. The article published the slogan, ""Glorify this year 2012 as a year of proud victory, a year when an era of prosperity is unfolding, true to the instructions of the great General Kim Jong Il."" However, North Korea is still asking the international community for food aid, as it does not have enough food for its people and its economy has been crippled by years of neglect and bad decisions by the leadership. North Korea did not mention its nuclear weapons program, a program that the United States and leaders in the region are pressing North Korea to cease in return for food aid.","The new North Korean leader carries out his first public inspection of the military .

"eMalahleni, South Africa (CNN) -- A South African coal-mining company is cleaning up its act by building cheap, eco-friendly housing using its industrial waste. For some years AngloAmerican -- one of the world's largest mining firms -- has been purifying the water contaminated during its coal mining activities in the South African city of eMalahleni. Now, AngloAmerican is mixing the waste by-product -- a mineral known as gypsum -- with cement to make energy-efficient bricks it uses to build houses there. ""We've built 62 houses so far,"" said Peter Gunther, AngloAmerican's head of sustainable development, and the driving force behind the initiative. ""Each home requires about eight tons of gypsum, but at present we're removing over 200 tons of it from the water every day."" Gypsum is a basic mineral compound of calcium and sulphur. The non-toxic mineral is soluble in water, but becomes harder and more adhesive the hotter and dryer it gets. Because gypsum is malleable when wet, its most common commercial application to date is as the main ingredient for household plaster. ""Actually, there are 50 different uses for it -- from dental surgery to fireproofing doors,"" said Gunther. ""But there is a serious housing shortfall here, and we have so much gypsum, that once we decided we needed to do something with it, making a strong building material was the obvious choice."" And Gunther believes that his new bricks have significant advantages over the heavy cement ones typically used in the area: ""The bricks are generally harder than traditional cement bricks, they're also better heat and sound insulators,"" he said. But, most crucially for one of the fastest growing urban areas in South Africa, the gypsum bricks have a lower environmental impact. ""Because it (gypsum) is such a strong binding agent, we need much less cement to make (the bricks),"" said Gunther. According to figures from the Cement Sustainability Initiative, about 5% of all the world's man-made CO2 emissions stem from the chemical and combustion processes involved in cement production. Most types of cement are made by heating limestone, a chemical process known as calcination which releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The industrial manufacture of cement also requires large quantities of fuel. Gunther claims that his low-cement bricks save, on average, three tonnes of carbon dioxide for every home built. Read related: 'Living' buildings could inhale city carbon emissions . In the city of eMalahleni -- a name that in Zulu literally means ""place of coal"" -- AngloAmerican aims to provide new homes for its entire local workforce, with 400 scheduled to be built in the next year. ""This is my first house ... this is my dream house, and I'm happy. It's not small. I feel free with my family,"" enthused Maria Mhlongo, whose husband works at one of AngloAmerican's coal mines in eMalahleni. The Mhlongo family was among the first to move into a gypsum-brick house after the company started building accommodation for its workers in 2010. But can gypsum -- a product that AngloAmerican had been discarding as waste before last year -- really be such a wonder material? Andrew Bloodworth is head of minerals at the British Geological Survey. He says that gypsum, ""a relatively common mineral geologically,"" is indeed a great heat insulator and can be very strong -- but only as long as it stays dry. ""I've never heard of it being used to make bricks because it's water soluble -- that's why it's so good as a plaster agent,"" said Bloodworth. ""I'd be interested to know how they've managed to get around that."" Gunther says that because the bricks are still partially composed of cement, they are fully water resistant. ""The brick mixture has been subjected to the most rigorous trials by the South African Bureau of Standards, and passed without any problems,"" he added. Global carbon emissions from coal are second only to oil, according to the UN Environment Program, while other environmental factors such as air-pollution from coal dust and damage caused by mining also remain a serious problem. Gunther acknowledges these issues, but says that coexistence between energy sources is necessary ""for as long as the world is so much set up around running on coal. ""While we're still using it, the question is: What can we do to make it cleaner and even more useful? I think our approach goes some way to achieving that goal.""","Mining firm claims to produce sustainable building materials from waste .

"(CNN) -- A goal from Japan defender Yuto Nagatomo handed Inter Milan a 1-0 win at Genoa that lifted them to seventh in the Italian Serie A table. Claudio Ranieri's side made it two wins in three days after Saturday's triumph over Fiorentina but despite going above Genoa Inter still lie ten points behind leaders Juventus. The away side dominated the match, having 17 attempts on goal compared to Genoa's four, but wasted chances to take the lead before the hour mark through Marco Faraoni, Andrea Poli and Diego Milito. Is Mancini the right man for Manchester City? But Nagatomo struck the decisive blow for the 2010 European Champions League winners on 67 minutes as he headed home a cross from Riccardo Alvarez. Alvarez came close to wrapping up the match soon after as he rattled the post with a shot from the edge of the penalty area. Genoa had a late chance to claim a point but Miguel Veloso spurned the opportunity to ensure Inter made it four wins out of five in the league. Meanwhile, Real Madrid cruised past third division opponents Ponferradina 2-0 in the first leg of their Spanish Cup last 32 tie.

"Redwood City, California (CNN) -- Video gamers who want to train for the next ""Legend of Zelda"" may want to enroll in fencing classes. The realistic swordplay in ""The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword"" for the Wii console will become central to the series, according to Nintendo executives who produce the games. ""In some games, the people or developers are looking into more photorealistic games,"" Shigeru Miyamoto, the famed game designer who created the ""Zelda"" series, told CNN in a recent interview. ""We make it so that you can feel as if you have actually shot the arrow with your bow."" ""Skyward Sword"" is not the first ""Zelda"" game for the Wii. In its predecessor, ""The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,"" players could swing their sword by shaking the Wii controller, but the sword would not respond directly to the way it was being held. Adding realistic sword movement to ""Skyward Sword"" appears to be a winning formula. The game, which came out on November 20, sold the most of any previous ""Zelda"" game on its first day and reached 600,000 U.S. sales in its first week, according to the NPD Group. Earlier ""Zelda"" games used some unusual hardware functions for controlling the characters, including rubbing a stylus on touchscreens, blowing into a microphone and using five screens in one room to navigate. Some of those ideas haven't stuck around, but the precise movement translated from swinging the Wii Motion+ remote to the character's sword onscreen will return, the Nintendo execs said. Many gamers see the ""Zelda"" series as one based around quirky adventures and puzzles. However, since the beginning, the games were supposed to have an emphasis on battling. Nintendo wasn't able to begin realizing this vision until 1998 when the available technology allowed for more realistic environments in ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"" for the Nintendo 64 system. ""When we started this project many, many years ago with the original NES, it was from the beginning about the sword fighting,"" Miyamoto said in an interview from Nintendo's office in Silicon Valley. ""Starting actually from the 'Ocarina of Time,' the developers were more eager to make more sophisticated movements of the sword competition."" Eiji Aonuma, who directed his first ""Zelda"" a decade ago and produced the most recent game, has said he expects future games in the series to use the type of precise sword controls from ""Skyward Sword."" ""I honestly think we cannot go back to button controls now,"" Aonuma told Game Informer magazine. In CNN's interview, Miyamoto discussed the difficulty of balancing realism with keeping the experience fun. ""When we look at today's fighting games and many other games, sometimes we have to feel it's rather difficult for us to realize the perfect balance between what you are actually doing with your hand against what you can see and realize or reproduce on your TV set,"" Miyamoto said. ""In other words, I really want people to feel, 'OK, I'm doing better and better by practicing, for example, my sword fighting.'

"Singapore (CNN) -- How do you sell a missile? Giving it a name that conjures up images of destruction or protection is a good start; weapons called ""Iron Dome defense system"" or ""Predator"" are unequivocal. However, a fearsome title alone won't clinch a multi-million dollar sale, so military trade events like air shows give weapons manufacturers a chance to show off their products -- even if the hard sell has been done over months and years of networking and negotiations. ""There's no new business here, but new sales prospects,"" says Mikael Olsson of Saab Technologies. The Swedish arms maker's stall at the Singapore Airshow has a full size simulator of their anti-aircraft defense system, the prosaically named RBS70 NG. Like similar demo models in the voluminous hall, it attracted the attention of passing visitors, and some potential new customers, commonly referred to as ""pop-ups."" Doing military's dangerous, dull and dirty work . Demonstrated by Olsson's colleague Hakan Bystrom, it seems more like playing a video game with a cool piece of kit than a weapon capable of blasting an enemy jet out of the sky. ""Systems are getting more technical, so making them easy to operate is a strong selling point,"" says Bystrom. Over the years the RBS70 has been sold in 18 countries, though Bystrom says he doesn't think it's ever been used in a combat situation. While plenty of technical detail and test footage can be used in support of any demo, being able to say a weapon has been used in combat situations gives it far more kudos. ""Most of our products are combat proven,"" says Amit Zimmer of Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, standing next to full-size models of missiles. ""We live in a test range, unfortunately it's one of our advantages. There is a big difference between a PowerPoint presentation and combat-proven systems."" Some manufacturers are less keen to talk to people outside the industry about what their weapons do, but Zimmer is happy to describe the capability of some of Rafael's munitions, including a new short-range ""Spike"" -- ""the baby of the group"" -- that he claims can be directed from kilometers away through any window of your choice. ""You have to know how to fit yourself to the customers needs... sometimes you have to make tailor-made things,"" he says. ""People come to us and say, 'Look we have a problem with our border, what solutions can you give us?'"" Most of the military products on display are marketed as defensive rather than offensive, with ""protecting assets"" and ""commanding combat zones"" being common terms. Missiles are increasingly promoted for their accuracy and ability to minimize collateral damage -- confirming a trend that so much modern warfare takes place in urban or civilian areas. Some are surrounded in obfuscating terms and industry jargon, like blast patterns, CP -- that refers to a weapon's accuracy -- or J-effect, when a bomb bounces and doesn't explode. Others are more upfront about what their munitions actually do. MBDA Missile Systems, Europe's largest missile manufacturer and owned by the continents big aerospace companies, has a promotional video playing on its stand showing weapons destroying moving cars and other real targets in combat in Afghanistan and Libya. ""I would say that our customers have been over satisfied with how our systems have worked,"" says MBDA's Daniel Petit, in reference to their use by the British and French air force in the recent conflict in Libya. But regardless of how a weapon is marketed it's getting harder to sell, as more countries are trying to become manufacturers and not just purchasers. ""The whole industry is currently changing. It's harder to sell (in the Asia region), mainly because of stricter rules and anti-corruption measures,"" says Olsson. ""Now it's a lot more about transfer of technology (between countries) and partnerships. ""In the end to sell your products you simply need to be the best at the cheapest price.""","Trade events like air shows give weapons manufacturers a chance to show off their products .

"(CNN) -- Spanish international striker David Villa suffered a broken leg as European Champions Barcelona brushed aside Qatari side Al Sadd 4-0 Thursday to reach the final of the FIFA Club World Cup. Villa fractured his left tibia while trying to latch on to an Andres Iniesta through ball after 34 minutes of the semifinal clash in Japan's Toyota City and was carried off on a stretcher. Spanish champions Barca will come up against Santos in Sunday's final after the Brazilian team beat Japan's Kashiwa Reysol 3-1 Wednesday. Barca sealed their comprehensive victory with a brace from full-back Adriano and strikes from Mali's Seydou Keita and Brazilian Maxwell. Santos cruise into Club World Cup final . Villa was restored to the starting line-up by coach Pep Guardiola having recently lost his place in the team to Alexis Sanchez, with the Chilean preferred for last weekend's ""El Clasico"" victory over archrivals Real Madrid. Sanchez arrived from Udinese in July, but saw the start of his Barca career hampered by a hamstring injury. The 22-year-old's recovery and return to the first team has prompted speculation over Villa's future with the Catalan giants. The 30-year-old has found the net just five times in 15 Spanish La Liga appearances this season and now faces a lengthy period on the sidelines. A later statement on the Barcelona official website confirmed the bad news: . ""Villa will return to Barcelona, via Frankfurt, to be operated on. He will be accompanied by doctor Ricard Pruna and Manel Estiarte. The approximate time he will be sidelined is between four and five months."" Barca coach Guardiola added: : ""He will be greatly missed as a colleague and as a player. I hope everything goes well. ""He will be out for a long time. It's a big blow to the team. We just hope that he can play again as soon as possible."" In that time frame, Villa could also face a race against time to be fit to take his place for Spain as they defend their title at Euro 2012 in Ukraine and Poland in June. Barca never looked like losing to Asian Champions League winners Al Sadd and took the lead when Adriano pounced on an error by goalkeeper Mohamed Saqr to bundle the ball home after 25 minutes. CNN Blog: Is Roberto Mancini the right man for Man City? Adriano doubled his and Barca's tally two minutes before half time, latching onto Thiago's pass to hammer his shot beyond a helpless Saqr. The second half continued in the same vein as the first, with Barca dominant. The third goal arrived with 26 minutes to go, Argentina star Lionel Messi slipping a perfect pass through for Keita to finish. Spain midfielder Thiago was once again involved in the fourth and final goal, the 20-year-old playing in Maxwell who fired a shot into the bottom corner. Barca will be looking to claim the title for the second time in three years, having beaten Argentina's Estudiantes to the crown in 2009.","Barcelona and Spain striker David Villa breaks his leg .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama unveiled his administration's plan Thursday for a leaner, cheaper military, a reflection of Washington's fiscal belt-tightening and slower national economic growth. The president insisted the new strategy -- which eliminates the military's ability to actively fight two major wars at once -- will allow U.S. armed forces to effectively combat terrorism while confronting any new threats from countries like China and Iran. ""Over the next 10 years, the growth in the defense budget will slow, but the fact of the matter is this: It will still grow, because we have global responsibilities that demand our leadership,"" Obama announced during a rare presidential visit to the Pentagon. ""I firmly believe, and I think the American people understand, that we can keep our military strong -- and our nation secure -- with a defense budget that continues to be larger than roughly the next 10 countries combined."" Security Clearance: Does a smaller military make sense? Alluding to the end of the U.S. military role in Iraq and plans to eventually withdraw from Afghanistan, Obama declared that ""the tide of war is receding."" ""The question that this strategy answers is what kind of military will we need after the long wars of the last decade are over,"" the president told reporters. ""Yes, our military will be leaner, but the world must know: The United States is going to maintain our military superiority with armed forces that are agile, flexible and ready for the full range of contingencies and threats."" The president was flanked by an array of top Pentagon brass during his remarks, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey. Republicans immediately blasted the plan, characterizing it as a retreat from the reality of America's global responsibilities. The blueprint is ""a lead-from-behind strategy for a left-behind America,"" said Rep. Buck McKeon of California, GOP chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. ""The president has packaged our retreat from the world in the guise of a new strategy to mask his divestment of our military and national defense. This strategy ensures American decline in exchange for more failed domestic programs."" McKeon said that ""in order to justify massive cuts to our military, (Obama) has revoked the guarantee that America will support our allies, defend our interests and defy our opponents. The president must understand that the world has always had, and will always have, a leader. As America steps back, someone else will step forward."" Among other things, Obama's strategy singles out China and Iran, pledging to keep strategically critical sea lanes open and successfully combat missile, electronic, cyber and other threats. ""States such as China and Iran will continue to pursue asymmetric means to counter our power projections capabilities, while the proliferation of sophisticated weapons and technology will extend to non-state actors as well,"" an administration document outlining the changes said. Thursday's announcement follows multiple missile tests by Iran in recent days and comments by Iranian leaders that they could choke off the Strait of Homuz, a major transit point for world oil supplies. The new strategy is the result of months of study at the Pentagon. It reflects a high-stakes, high-wire balancing act by the president as he faces a more austere budget climate combined with continued high U.S. responsibilities at home and overseas. ""The balance between available resources and our security needs has never been more delicate,"" the administration document said. In a signed introduction to the document, Obama called this a time of transition, noting the successful raid on Osama bin Laden's compound and the death of the al Qaeda leader, as well as the end to the war in Iraq and progress in Afghanistan. ""The fiscal choices we face are difficult ones, but there should be no doubt, here in the United States or around the world -- we will keep our Armed Forces the best-trained, best-led, best equipped fighting force in history,"" Obama wrote. Titled ""Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense,"" the document provides the bare bones of a defense strategy that will become more detailed as the White House and Congress prepare the 2013 budget. In a signal of how carefully the administration had orchestrated this announcement, amid fiscal austerity and during a presidential campaign year, the nation's highest-ranking military man also threw his weight behind the reforms. ""It is a sound strategy,"" Dempsey said in prepared remarks. ""It ensures we remain the pre-eminent military in the world. It preserves the talent of the all-volunteer force. It takes into account the lessons of the last 10 years of war."" Dempsey referred to the political uproar over the change from a two-war policy. CNN.com users debate the strategy shift . ""Our strategy has always been about our ability to respond to global contingencies wherever and whenever they happen. This does not change,"" Dempsey said. ""We can and will always be able to do more than one thing at a time. More importantly, wherever we are confronted and in whatever sequence, we will win."" Dempsey also said that ""the two-war paradigm has been a bit of an anchor, frankly, in trying to help us figure out the future."" ""It's not about whether we will fight adversaries as they confront us. It's how,"" he said. He stressed that he was pleased with the outcome of the strategy review. ""It's not perfect,"" Dempsey said, but added, ""It gives us what we need, in this world and within this budget."" Panetta also weighed in, noting in prepared remarks ""the continuing threat of violent extremism, proliferation of lethal weapons and materials, the destabilizing behavior of Iran and North Korea, the rise of new powers across Asia and the dramatic changes in the Middle East."" ""The U.S. joint force will be smaller and leaner, but its great strength will be that it is more agile, flexible, ready to deploy, innovative and technologically advanced,"" Panetta said. The secretary said that while the United States will maintain its obligations in Europe, the U.S. military force posture there will continue ""to adapt and evolve."" Security Clearance: Parts of defense budget would actually rise . Panetta joined Dempsey in taking on conservative critics who have blasted the administration's apparent step back from an active two-war strategy. ""Make no mistake -- we will have the capability to confront and defeat more than one adversary at a time,"" he said. Deputy Defense Secretary Ash Carter later told reporters that one way the new strategy could accommodate looming manpower cuts would be through an avoidance of long and large stability operations, an apparent reference to what happened after the initial invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. Carter refused to offer specifics about the defense cuts, promising new details after Obama's State of the Union address this month and the release of additional budget documents. Asked about the future of one of the country's most expensive weapons systems -- the F-35 Joint Fighter -- Carter said, ""It is our fifth generation fighter. We need it and we want it to succeed."" The document released Thursday noted the high cost of a decade of wars, with more than 46,000 men and women wounded and more than 6,200 members of the armed forces killed. In another recognition of hard economic times, the strategy includes a promise to help veterans find work in the civilian economy. As the Defense Department ""reduces the size of the force, we will do so in a way that respects these sacrifices,"" the administration document noted. ""This means, among other things, taking concrete steps to facilitate the transition to those who will leave the service. These include supporting programs to help veterans translate their military skills for the civilian workforce and aid their search for jobs."" Defense contractors and civilian workers also will feel the impact of Thursday's announcement and how it ripples through the system of defense contracts in coming years. Boeing has announced it will close a plant that produces B-52s and 767 tankers and employs more than 2,160 workers in Wichita, Kansas. ""The decision to close our Wichita facility was difficult but ultimately was based on a thorough study of the current and future market environment and our ability to remain competitive while meeting our customers' needs with the best and most affordable solutions,"" Mark Bass, Boeing vice president, said in a news release. Panetta, meanwhile, met with British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond in the latter's first official visit to Washington. ""They spent a good part of their meeting discussing innovative approaches to defense in an era of fiscal austerity, and agreed that NATO must continue to invest in military capabilities despite the imperative to achieve fiscal discipline,"" Pentagon press secretary George Little said. The two also discussed Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. Finally, they signed a statement that will provide the basis for the United States assisting the Royal Navy in the development of its next generation of aircraft carriers, Little said. CNN's Chris Lawrence and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: Panetta meets with British defense secretary .
