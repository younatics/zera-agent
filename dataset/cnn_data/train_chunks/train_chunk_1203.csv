"Stag party: Aidan Burley and his fiancée Helen Boyle . A Tory MP who attended a stag party where guests chanted Nazi slogans has issued a second apology in a desperate bid to save his career. Aidan Burley was with 12 Oxford-educated friends, some of whom chanted ‘Hitler, Hitler, Hitler’, at a restaurant in a French ski resort. The ‘stag’, who was seated next to the MP, wore an SS uniform and later posed giving the Nazi salute – illegal in France. Labour last night called for David Cameron to sack Mr Burley, a senior aide to Transport Secretary Justine Greening, for bringing ‘shame on the country’. Mr Burley, the MP for Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, was filmed by journalists from the Mail on Sunday raising his glass before a fellow guest made a speech saying: ‘Let’s raise a toast to Tom for organising the stag do, and if we’re perfectly honest, to the ideology and thought process of the Third Reich.’ The MP did not raise his glass during the speech. He did appear to pay the bill for the meal, although he later said he had paid only his share. Yesterday Mr Burley said on Twitter: ‘Deeply regret inappropriate behaviour by some guests at stag party I attended and I am extremely sorry for any offence caused.’ It followed a similar statement he had made on Saturday. But . his apologies were denounced as ‘too little, too late’ by Twitter users . who called for him to be sacked. Downing Street made no comment but . Tory sources said they were ‘investigating’ the allegations. Scroll down for video . SS uniform: Accountant Mark Fournier gives a Nazi salute, which is illegal in France . Members of the stag party may face prosecution in France, where it is a crime to wear Nazi uniform in public except in a film or play. Mr Burley, 32, has known the Prime Minister for at least five years and the pair ‘high five’ when they meet, according to Mr Burley’s friends on the stag night, who joked the MP was ‘the candidate for Berlin East’. The Nazi incident happened on December 3 in Restaurant La Fondue, an upmarket venue in the centre of the ski resort of Val Thorens. The MP, elected in 2010, sipped wine as one of the group taunted a waiter for being French. The man in the Nazi uniform was accountant Mark Fournier, 34, who was frequently addressed by the others as ‘Himmler!’ It was his businessman brother John Fournier, 37, who gave the toast celebrating the Nazis. At various points through the evening, members of the group were chanting, typically two or three of them. At no stage did the journalists – who were in the resort researching a different story – witness all 12 chanting the names of Nazi leaders or other slogans at the same time. As they left the restaurant, Mark and John Fournier agreed to be photographed and, without prompting, performed Nazi salutes. Asked why he was dressed as he was, Mark Fournier said: ‘We wanted to see how a Nazi outfit in the middle of France would go down. The answer is not that well at all.’ Another said: ‘We are trying to intimidate as many people as possible. A lot have been quite offended, especially one guy who was both Jewish and gay.’ The group moved on to the British-themed Frog and Roast beef pub, where some put on German accents and started chanting: ‘Mein Fuhrer! Mein Fuhrer! Mein Fuhrer!’, ‘Himmler! Himmler! Himmler!’ and ‘Eichmann! Eichmann! Eichmann!’  Himmler and Eichmann were senior SS officers directly responsible for the Holocaust. The MP did not join in with this chanting. In his initial apology on Saturday Mr Burley, who is engaged to TV fashion presenter Helen Boyle, said: ‘There was clearly inappropriate behaviour by some of the other guests and I deeply regret that this happened. I am extremely sorry for any offence that will undoubtedly have been caused.’ Mark Fournier has not responded to requests for comment, but his brother John told the Mail on Sunday: ‘[Mark] was dressed up in an outfit as a tongue-in-cheek laugh and there was nothing more to it than that. It was just a bunch of lads having a good evening.’ He denied raising a toast to the ideology of the Third Reich.","Calls for David Cameron to sack Aidan Burley after incident .

"Parents have complained that t-shirts featuring a character from the blockbuster movie Frozen are a bad influence on their children because she appears to be making an offensive gesture. They say that the £9.99 tops, which are for sale through H&M, show Elsa apparently making a V-sign, and are calling for the chain to pull the t-shirts because they say their children are copying the pose. The Disney character features on millions of items of merchandise, including clothes and stationery, and is supposed to be making snowflakes with her special powers. V-sign? Parents have complained that the Elsa character is making an offensive gesture on the H&M t-shirt . The t-shirts are for sale in a pack of two in H&M stores and online - the fashion store would not comment today . The £9.99 long-sleeved t-shirts are currently on sale in high street clothes store H&M and on their website. Mother of two Jacqui Williams, 40, from Warwick, said: 'I waited ages to get my hands on an Elsa top for my daughter Daisy but when she put it on I was shocked. 'From almost every angle you look at the t-shirt, Elsa is doing a V-sign. I'm sure it wasn't intentional but it is unfortunate. 'I didn't mind at first but then I saw Daisy copying the pose with her friends. I had to tell them to stop doing it because if they do it at school they might get into trouble. 'I've written to H&M raising my concerns but I haven't heard anything back yet.' Parents have also expressed their worries about the T-shirt online. On Mumsnet user Kathan16 said: 'I took my four-yr-old daughter to her friend's birthday party at the wkend and was shocked when all the kids were given Frozen T-shirts from H&M which made it look like Elsa was doing a rude v-sign. 'I wouldn't have minded but some of the kids started copying the pose and soon the room was full of kids flicking the Vs to their parents.' Elsa is the heroine in Frozen, the highest-grossing animated film of all time, which also won two Oscars . Twitter user JoJo4 in Los Angeles added: 'Elsa seriously got bad, swearing at fans. That's cold. Let it go girl.' Disney would not comment today, but a spokesman for H&M said there were no plans to remove the top from shelves. They said: 'This is the first we have heard about this T-shirt upsetting anyone. It is a shame if it has caused offence. 'Clearly the character is holding her hand in that way in order to create a sparkly snowflake.' Frozen, based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen, overtook Toy Story 3 in March to become the highest grossing animated film of all time, raking in £644.5million at the box office. It was in the UK box office top 10 for more than three months and now ranks as the 10th highest grossing film in cinema history. The film won two Oscars, and its songs, penned by Broadway duo Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, topped the US Billboard 200 chart for 13 consecutive weeks.","T-shirt, for sale for £9.99 through H&M, shows Queen Elsa from hit movie .

"An advert featuring a man speaking in a heavy Birmingham accent has provoked a furious response from the city's residents. It shows a brightly-dressed couple trying to plan a romantic holiday, with the Hawaiian-shirted man repeatedly responding to the woman's requests with the phrase: 'Anything for you, cupcake'. But the light-hearted commercial for travel site Hotels4u has riled Brummies, who claim it is 'offensive' and more annoying than the Go Compare advert, which sees a mustachioed opera singer bellowing out the company's name. Scroll down for video . 'Offensive' advert: The Hotels4u TV campaign features a couple planning a holiday, with the man repeatedly replying 'Anything for you cupcake' in a heavy Brummie accent. However, viewers have responded by saying it is unrealistic . They have taken to social media sites to attack the TV campaign, describing it as 'appalling' and criticising the actor's Brummie accent as unrealistic. 'I’m from Birmingham and have never heard any fellow Brummies speak like that!' Angela Dubberley said on Facebook. 'Go Compare sales went down thanks to that annoying Welsh bloke, I’ve a feeling Hotels4u is going to suffer the same fate!' Helen Wolfe wrote: 'Most annoying advert in the world, even worse than Go Compare! And Gavin from Autoglass!' Annoyingly familiar?: The company behind the Go Compare advert (pictured) are also responsible for the Hotels4u campaign. They used a Welsh opera singer for the comparison website's commercial and have decided to opt for a regional accent again . 'Warm and friendly': Mike Hoban, marketing director for Hotels4u, said they wanted to create 'a popular duo that people would warm to'. Unfortunately for the campaign a number of people have responded to the TV campaign by saying they would never use the website . It is no coincidence that the adverts are being compared to each other as they were both created by the company headed by marketing couple Chris and Sian Wilkins. They opted to repeat the use of the strong regional accent in the Go Compare ad, which features a Welsh opera singer. Vianney Lawlor stated: 'Not a Brummie accent. That’s a Black Country accent.' And Cactusrogeruk blasted: 'Bloody appalling! I can’t believe this is actually a serious attempt to speak like people anywhere!' However, last night the holiday firm revealed actor Craig Painting who stars in the advert was born and bred in Northfield, Birmingham. Mike Hoban, marketing director for Hotels4u, said: 'We wanted to create a popular duo that people would warm to. That’s why we cast a Birmingham born and bred actor as our lead character. Having a laugh: The actors in the Hotels4u advert seem in good spirits but viewers are not so amused. Helen Wolfe wrote: 'Most annoying advert in the world, even worse than Go Compare!' 'We wanted to use a friendly accent from one of the great UK regions to help create a distinctive character so that people remember how easy it is to save money on hotel bookings.' Hotels4u, part of Thomas Cook, said it wanted to come up with a 'truly memorable tagline' and characters who would become household names for the new TV campaign. Born and bred Brummie: Critics of the advert have attacked the heavy accent, saying it sounds more like someone from the Black Country. But actor Craig Painting who stars in the advert was born and bred in Northfield, Birmingham . 'Anything for you cupcake': The Brummie actor says the phrase repeatedly in response to his partner's holiday demands . Judging by the response on the social media sites, the advert could become memorable for all the wrong reasons. 'Your advertising campaign is a huge fail, I can imagine the majority of Brummies are offended and the rest of the country are confused,' said Rich Elwell. 'I’d never use your company in a million years.'","Hotels4u advert features Hawaiian-shirted man with heavy Brummie accent .

"Police say they need to share DNA databases with forces across Europe because so much crime in Britain is committed by foreign nationals. Senior officers want the Home Secretary to join an EU-wide scheme giving open access to forensic files. They believe it would speed up the  laborious process of sending samples found at crime scenes to individual countries, so they can look for matches on their databases. DNA match: Burglar Giani Radu poses on Facebook. Detectives had found blood at the scenes of several break-ins - but it was their Romanian counterparts who found the sample matched Radu . In one recent case, police found the blood of a prolific burglar in homes across the South East, but it was only when they got evidence from Romania that they were able to catch him. But Theresa May has resisted the UK sharing DNA records automatically across Europe because of the fear that low-quality evidence from overseas forces could see innocent Britons locked up. Last night a senior public official told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Politically the Government is afraid of the issue and therefore don’t provide the clarity. 'The police are saying, “if we want to be on top of these people that are moving across countries – some of them quite dangerous – then you need to let us manage the communications and the exchange of DNA information.” ’ National DNA Database spokesman, Chief Constable Chris Sims, said: ‘We fully understand the degree to which accessing other DNA databases would support investigations in this country and we are working very hard with the Home Office to find the best way to achieve this end.’ Nearly a third of all suspects arrested in London – as many as 80,000 people a year – are foreign nationals. International operation: Police in Britain say they need to share DNA databases with forces across Europe because so much crime in Britain is committed by foreign nationals . The number of foreigners in British jails has doubled over the past two decades, with 10,469 inmates in March. They account for 13 per cent of UK prisoners. But if foreign criminals have not been in trouble in the UK, their details will not be on Britain’s databases. Britain has opted out of an EU-wide agreement among 15 countries to allow open access to DNA samples on civil liberties grounds. Trial run: Home Secretary Theresa May told the Commons last week the Government would run a 'small-scale pilot' of the EU data-sharing measures . The Met’s forensics director Gary Pugh warned at a meeting of the National DNA Database Ethics Group that the Government’s opt-out ‘represents a challenge’ to police  trying to tackle the ‘scale of foreign national offenders in London’. But Mrs May has deferred any decision until after the General Election. Romanian burglar Giani Radu,  23, was jailed last week for a string of offences in England – thanks to information from his homeland. Detectives had found blood at the scene of several break-ins – but could not match it on their database. They approached counterparts in Romania and found the sample matched Radu, who was jailed for burglary before moving to the UK and posed with cash on Facebook. He admitted 23 counts of burglary and was jailed for  six years at Harrow Crown Court. Home Secretary Mrs May told the Commons last week the Government would run a ‘small-scale pilot’ of the EU data-sharing measures then  publish a report on them for debate in Parliament by the end of 2015. She said: ‘I would be negligent in my duty to protect the British public if I did not consider the issue carefully.’","Senior British officers want the Home Secretary to join EU-wide scheme .

"A Swiss coffee company has been forced to withdraw novelty milk lids featuring the image of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler after they were spotted by German businessmen in a city centre cafe. Lids showing the faces of Hitler and Mussolini were spotted by a group Germans while having a coffee break in a cafe in the city of Coire, in the eastern Swiss region of Graubunden. The plastic take-away packaging showing the fascist dictators' portraits inside a gold frame were distributed by Switzerland's largest supermarket chain Migros. Coffee cream lids featuring Hitler and Mussolini caused outrage after being handed out  in a cafe in Switzerland . Christian Shuster, 47, from Germany, who was on a business trip in Switzerland said: 'Our Swiss colleagues took us down to the coffee shop and when the waitress brought them over we saw the face of Hitler staring up at us from one of the cream containers. 'I couldn't believe it and at first thought it was some sort of sick joke being played by my colleagues. 'But then we saw the other containers also had the face of Hitler on and some had Mussolini. 'This is just absolutely evil and outrageous.' The cream lids were also found at a takeaway food kiosk in Switzerland's northern Aargau region. Shocked customers complained in droves after being handed them with their takeaway coffees. Kiosk owner Albert Erni, 33, said: 'To be honest, I hadn't even looked at them so when people started complaining I wasn't sure what they were talking about. 'But then I looked and, yes, was pretty shocked too. 'It seems like a very bizarre and distasteful piece of marketing.' In Switzerland, labels from the mini-cream containers are collectibles, and producers often seek new and inventive ways to enhance their appeal. Tristan Cerf, a spokesman for Migros, said the mishap had occurred when an outside company asked ELSA, a dairy manufacturer and Migros subsidiary, to supply a series of 55 coffee cream containers based on vintage cigar labels, two of which featured the dictators. He said that the outside company had provided the controversial designs, and that ELSA typically produced plastic creamers with charming and innocuous images on them - not fascists. He said: 'I can't tell you how these labels got past our controls. Usually the labels have pleasant images like trains, landscapes and dogs - nothing polemic that can pose a problem.' Switzerland has in the past been forced to grapple with its relationship with the Nazis during World War II, including accusations that Swiss banks abetted the National Socialist regime. But Cerf emphasised that the accidental circulation of the plastic Hitler creamers had nothing to do with the country's social mores, but rather reflected an isolated mistake. Speaking about his company's cream pots, Cerf said: 'Whoever made this mistake was not thinking properly as these aren't meant to be images for a book about World War II, but rather something meant to be enjoyed with coffee and a chocolate cake. Confirming that the sale and distribution of the product has been stopped, he added: 'You cannot put Pol Pot or a terrorist on a milk creamer. It is unacceptable.'","Lids showing the faces of dictators were spotted in Graubunden and Aargau .

"A party celebrating Martin Luther King, Jr day called 'Freedom 2 Twerk' has been cancelled after a poster promoting the event caused outrage. A Michigan party promotor called Mid-Michigan Teen Parties photoshopped Dr Martin Luther King Jr's head onto the body of a man wearing a heavy gold medallion and throwing a gang sign. The freedom to twerk was decidedly not one of King's civil rights dreams and the use of his image offended many in the community, especially his descendants. Wrong message: The organizers of the Freedom to Twerk party used Dr Martin Luther King, Jr's head superimposed on another man's body . Bernice King, daughter of the late civil rights icon, called the poster 'appalling' and 'almost embarrassing' in an interview with Fox 5. 'I lost a father who sacrificed everything for them to live a much more dignified and respectful life,' she said. 'And for it to come to this just makes me sad.' It's not the first promotional poster to appropriate Dr King's image for profit. A flyer for a Miami strip club featuring Dr King with a wad of cash standing next to a scantily clad woman earned its creator flack in 2012. And last year's 'MLK Chocolate Affair,' All Black Party' and 'No Worries Bash,' the latter of which featured Dr King in a pair of headphones and flanked by Lil Wayne and yet another scantily clad woman, all came in for criticism. Misrepresentation: Party posters like this that use Dr Martin Luther King, Jr's image are 'almost embarrassing,' says King's daughter . 'Appalling': Bernice King says her father sacrificed everything so that people could live with dignity and respect and hopes this is a 'teachable moment' The owner of the venue where the Freedom to Twerk party Vic McEwan was to be held has said he was not consulted about the advertising materials.'We have since cancelled said event, refunded the promotor's deposit and informed the group that  they will no longer be welcome at our establishment,' he said in a statement to Fox 5.'As an African-American man who owns a business, I have a lot of responsibility,' McEwen said, according to the New York Daily News. 'This is about his legacy. Dr. King has done way too much for this country, or me, or anyone, to allow this to go on.' Missing the point: Another Martin Luther King, Jr Day party, another unauthorized image of the icon . Leader: Dr Martin Luther King, Jr won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 and was assassinated four years later . McEwan has now planned his own Martin Luther King Day party that will truly honor Nobel Peace Prize winner. The MLK Awareness Event' aims to 'bring about social awareness and youth participation as it pertains to Dr Martin Luther King Jr's legacy.' New plan: The Social Network Banquet and Event Center has organized its own Martin Luther King, Jr Day event . On the Social Network's Facebook page, Terri Williams ,who brought the poster to the business's attention, said she was glad they cancelled the party. 'Please know that I stand proudly and supportive behind your decision and hope that profit never supersedes respect for these party promoters,' she said. 'They can twerk if they choose to, but leave the deceased civil rights Nobel Peace Prize legacy to rest respectfully in peace.' Dr Bernice King says she doesn't believe the poster was malicious, just ignorant, and hopes the incident will prove to be a 'teachable moment.' 'We can begin the process of educating them and helping them to see how this is insulting and how this is not truly representative of Dr King.' The civil rights leader would have turned 85 last week.","A poster advertising a party called Freedom to Twerk and featuring an image of Dr Martin Luther King, Jr has caused offense .

"If you're an avid tweeter who values their relationship, we have one important piece of advice... step away from the phone now! New research from University of Missouri, USA, found that Twitter causes relationship conflict, which in turn is linked to emotional and physical infidelity, breakups and divorce. The study's author, Russell Clayton, surveyed 581 Twitter users of all ages and asked how much conflict arose as a result of the social networking site. Is Twitter ruining your relationship: New research found Twitter use was linked to infidelity, breakups and divorce . He found that the more active people were on Twitter, the more likely it was to cause arguments between them and spiral into serious relationship issues - including divorce. So why is it that Twitter can wreak havoc with your love life? 'Even if you are sat in silence with your partner, reaching for your phone breaks any connection, makes the other feel that they are boring you,' says sex and relationship therapist Sarah Berry. And then there's all that flirting: 'Online flirting with others may seem innocent but it can still hurt. It can lead to your partner not trusting you. 'Even if your flirting is only online and you have not been unfaithful in the flesh, it can still feel like a public slap in the face for your partner.' In previous research, Clayton found Facebook had a similar effect. But whereas Facebook-related conflict was greater among couples in newer relationships (of 36 months or less), in this latest Twitter research, Clayton found the same worrying outcomes occurred regardless of how long people had been together. 'I found it interesting that active Twitter users experienced Twitter-related conflict and negative relationship outcomes regardless of length of romantic relationship,' Clayton said. Tweeting is the source of many relationship woes . 'Couples who reported being in relatively new relationships experienced the same amount of conflict as those in longer relationships.' His advice for Twitter lovers? To limit use of social networking sites to more healthy, reasonable levels. 'Although a number of variables can contribute to relationship infidelity and separation, social networking site usage, such as Twitter and Facebook use, can be damaging to relationships,' Clayton said. 'Therefore, users should cut back to moderate, healthy levels of Twitter use if they are experiencing Twitter or Facebook-related conflict.' 'Some couples share joint social networking site accounts to reduce relationship conflict, and there are some social networking site apps, such as the 2Life app, that facilitates interpersonal communication between partners.' The 2Life app is a private, secure network that lets you chat, . share, collaborate and coordinate with your partner. It features a 'date night' feature powered by Yelp's local listings so that couples can browse reviews before deciding where they want to have dinner. They can also chat in the built-in messaging space and there's a private shared journal. In his previous study, . Clayton, surveyed Facebook users . aged between 18 and 82, asking them how much they used the social . network and how often they had bust-ups with their partners - past or . present - that had been ignited by the site. #LetsTalk! Couples are often involved in their social media world instead of interacting with each other . Dr . Clayton said: ‘Previous research has shown that the more a person in a . romantic relationship uses Facebook, the more likely they are to monitor . their partner's Facebook activity more stringently, which can lead to . feelings of jealousy. The research found Twitter is linked to extreme ralationship issues -- breakups, infidelity and divorce . ‘Facebook-induced jealousy may lead to arguments concerning past partners. ‘Also, . our study found that excessive Facebook users are more likely to . connect or reconnect with other Facebook users, including previous . partners, which may lead to emotional and physical cheating.’ According . to the study, ,published in the Journal of Cyberpsychology, Behavior and . Social Networking,couples who are just starting out should consider . staying away from the site. Dr Clayton explained: ‘The findings held only for couples who had been in relationships of three years or less.‘This suggests that Facebook may be a threat to relationships that are not fully matured. ‘On . the other hand, participants who have been in relationships for longer . than three years may not use Facebook as often, or may have more matured . relationships, and therefore Facebook use may not be a threat or . concern. ‘Although . Facebook is a great way to learn about someone, excessive Facebook use . may be damaging to newer romantic relationships.","Excessive Twitter use increases risk of cheating, breakup and divorce .

"Obama has expanded a list of potential targets in Syria as he struggles to gather international support for military action.

Meanwhile, there were signs that Mr Obama may struggle to secure support in Congress for his proposal of 'limited and proportionate' military action against Assad. A poll commissioned by the BBC and ABC News suggested more than one-third of Congress members were undecided whether or not to back military action, while a majority of those who had made a decision said they would vote against the President. The survey found that 226 members of the House of Representatives said they would oppose or were likely to oppose military action, against 45 who were certain or likely to support it and 189 who were undecided or did not respond. Some 17 members of the Senate were certain or likely to oppose Mr Obama's plans, against 23 certain or likely to back him and 60 whose position was undecided or unknown.

"Fifa is investigating after photographs circulated of fans wearing black face makeup at Germany’s match against Ghana. Photographs taken at the match showed two men, apparently Germany fans, with blackened faces in the Fortaleza stadium on Saturday. Fifa said yesterday that its disciplinary committee is considering opening a case. It will also consider a report by the Fifa match commissioner, Eggert Magnusson of Iceland. 'We do not respect any discriminatory messages,' Fifa spokesperson Delia Fischer said. Caught out: Two fans who appeared to be blacked up pose ahead of Germany's game with Ghana . Under investigation: FIFA are looking into reports that Germany fans wore black face makeup . Watching on: the two supporters were spotted during Germany's 2-2 draw with Ghana on Saturday . ‘We always take any evidence or submissions to our disciplinary committee. It is the disciplinary committee that will meet,’ a spokesman told The Guardian. ‘If they see any grounds they will open proceedings. Then it is up to the disciplinary commission to take the decision.’ FIFA holds national football federations responsible for their fans’ behaviour inside stadiums. In a second incident, a man ran onto the pitch in the second half of the 2-2 draw. The shirtless fan, who is reportedly from Poland had an email address and telephone number written on his back. Ghana's former Portsmouth and Sunderland midfielder Sully Muntari, who currently plays for AC Milan, embraced the pitch invader before being detained by stewards and removed from the field. Brazil’s organising committee spokesman Saint-Clair Milesi said the man was detained by local authorities. Germany has a tradition of blacking up, often for theatrical purposes, that despite its burgeoning ethnic minority population and the fact that it is now unthinkable in the UK and the U.S., still continues to this day. In January last year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel courted controversy after she posed for pictures with carol singers who had applied black face paint to pose as the Three Kings. It was part of the Sternsinger, or star singer, tradition of Dreikönigstag, the Three Kings' Day, when children go from house to house in groups of four and sing carols for charity. It is tradition that one of the kings is black. Err, is this okay in Germany? Angela Merkel peers at a carol singer blacked up to pose as one of the Three Kings at a post-Christmas event at the chancellery in Berlin in 2013 . Prior to . that, the Olivier award-winning playwright Bruce Norris in 2012 banned a . Berlin theatre from staging one of his plays after learning that it . intended to 'black up' a white actress for a lead role. In . an open letter he called on fellow playwrights to boycott any German . theatre which still practices what he described as an 'asinine . tradition'. 'Whatever . rationale the German theatre establishment might offer for their . brazenly discriminatory practice is of no interest to me,' he wrote. 'For, . as little power as we playwrights have, we always retain one small . power and that is the power to say no. To say, no thank you, I’d rather . not have my work performed in Germany, today, under those conditions.' Disruption: A fan stops play by running onto the pitch during Germany's 2-2 draw with Ghana on Saturday . Meanwhile, FIFA have also been contacted by the Fare network relating to discriminatory chanting at the World Cup. Allegations . of the use of improper language by supporters at games between Brazil . and Mexico and Cameroon and Mexico have been passed on to FIFA by Fare - . the organisation in place to tackle discrimination in football. The . allegations centre around the use of the word 'puto' which translates . into 'whore' and has been heard in games in Fortaleza and Natal. Controversy: FIFA have been contacted about discriminatory chanting allegedly heard during Brazil v Mexico . Concern: The allegations centre around the use of the word 'puto' which translates into 'whore' FIFA said that while Fare had passed on concerns about both of the matches - played last Friday and on Monday - it was already engaged in disciplinary proceedings against Mexico. It . said in a statement: 'We can confirm that we have been contacted by . Fare. Prior to this, disciplinary proceedings were opened against Mexico . for improper conduct of spectators during the match Mexico - Cameroon. FIFA also reiterated its position on discrimination of any kind. FIFA recognises its responsibility to . lead the way in abolishing all forms of discrimination in football. Article 3 of the FIFA Statutes states: 'Discrimination of any kind . against a Country, private person or group of people on account of race, . skin colour, ethnic, national or social origin, gender, language, . religion, political opinion or any other opinion, wealth, birth or any . other status, sexual orientation or any other reason is strictly . prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion.'

"Boys roll in mud and climb trees, while girls prefer sitting quietly and playing with dolls. Or at least that’s what adverts for Clarks shoes would have you believe – triggering an online backlash from parents who complain the firm is being ‘sexist and offensive’. The shoe shop has been accused of gender stereotyping on its posters which suggest boys need hard-wearing shoes for running around, while girls are more concerned with looking pretty. Gender stereotyping: This slogan for Clarks shoes in Stratford, London, prompted 3,000 complaints online . One of the adverts, which are displayed in store, proclaims in blue: ‘Because boys test their shoes to destruction, so do we.’ Another poster, in pink, says: ‘Because girls love comfort and style, we design both into our shoes.’ Last night the firm said it was ‘never our intention to cause offence’ as it faced a barrage of complaints on Twitter. Emma Dixon, a lawyer from Islington, north London, and mother of two boys and a girl, launched an online petition calling for the removal of the adverts, which last night had been signed by more than 3,000 people. She said: ‘I was horrified to find gender stereotyped notices above the boys’ and girls’ shoes. ‘These offensive posters suggest boys are active while girls are passively pretty. Pretty in pink: A Clarks spokesman insisted the font colour was not intended to cause any offence . ‘Gender stereotyping has an important . effect on children’s development. To suggest that boys engage in active . outdoor play of the type that destroys shoes, while girls are interested . in fashion and looking pretty, is to reinforce damaging social . stereotypes. ‘I grew up in . the carefree 1970s when kids were kids and my brother and I wore . matching outfits on a regular basis. 'I’m a mum to a girl and two boys, . so I know how important it is for kids to grow up with the space to be . who they are, not who someone else thinks they ought to be.’ Clarks is famous as a high street institution renowned for helping children find their first shoes and ‘back to school’ footwear. Founded in 1825, Clarks is still based in Street, Somerset, and sells more than 50million pairs of shoes a year, recently posting a record turnover of £1.4billion. A spokesman for Clarks said: ‘The wording in these in-store marketing displays was chosen to reference qualities that our customers value in children’s shoes. It is never our intention to cause offence. Lawyer Emma Dixon, from Islington in north London, set up a petition which has had more than 3,000 signatures . ‘All of our marketing materials are designed to showcase qualities including design, quality, comfort and style, and all our shoes are tested to destruction. 'These are attributes we are very proud to be associated with after 185 years in the shoe business. 'As part of the regular seasonal changeover of in-store signage, we are in the process of updating all current in-store marketing for Autumn/Winter 2014.’ It is not the first retailer to fall foul of sexist language. Last year, Boots admitted it was wrong to use separate signs labelling girls’ and boys’ toys - putting Science Museum-brand toys in the latter category - after outraged shoppers took to Twitter and Facebook. Tesco also came under fire for labelling a children’s chemistry set a boys’ toy. And Harrods had to apologise for stocking books entitled ‘How To Be Gorgeous’, which encouraged girls to ‘look stylish’, and ‘How To Be Clever’, helping boys to ‘remember things’.","Ad in Stratford, London, said 'boys test their shoes to destruction'

"Questioned: Stephen McLaughlin, 34, was quizzed for at least four days over the death of an Afghan Sikh found crammed inside a container that had come from Belgium to Tilbury Docks . The trucker being questioned by police over the death of an Afghan stowaway was held as he drove home to his family. Detectives stopped Stephen McLaughlin’s blue Volvo lorry on Tuesday near the bungalow in Northern Ireland he shares with partner Ann-Marie Harkin, 32, and their four young children, it was revealed last night. Yesterday Mr McLaughlin, 34, was still being questioned on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking after a man suffocated to death in a container at Tilbury Docks in Essex on Saturday. Meet Singh Kapoor, 40, was one of 35 Afghan Sikhs – including 13 children – found crammed inside the container, which had just arrived from Belgium. Mr McLaughlin, from Limavady, near Londonderry was flown to Essex for questioning on Wednesday night. A second man, aged 33 and from Londonderry, was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and people smuggling after he went to a police station in Essex on Wednesday afternoon. Last night both men remained in custody. Detectives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland have searched Mr McLaughlin’s home. Miss Harkin, 32, who gave birth to their youngest child, a boy, only six weeks ago, declined to comment on her partner’s arrest. Neighbours in Limavady described Mr McLaughlin as a ‘friendly family man’. Essex Police have released more details of the conditions in the container in which Mr Kapoor suffocated in front of his family as the group of migrants aged one to 72 tried desperately to enter Britain. With too little room to stand, the families had to perch on top of large containers of chemicals surrounded by what little luggage they could carry. The stowaways were locked inside without light and proper ventilation for a harrowing 18 hours, struggling to breathe the air let in by one tiny hole in the container. They had barely enough room to move and nowhere to relieve themselves. They were rescued at about 6.30am on Saturday when staff heard screaming and banging coming from the 40ft container, labelled Hudig & Kersten, which had arrived on a P&O freight ferry from Zeebrugge. Belgian police believe the immigrants were already inside when it was delivered to the Belgian port. Father-of-two Mr Kapoor was declared dead at the scene. The others were treated at the scene and at local hospitals for severe dehydration and hypothermia. After being freed, the survivors said that they feared they were 20 minutes from death and were drifting in and out of consciousness. Partner: He lives in a bungalow in Northern Ireland with Ann-Marie Harkin, mother of their four young children . Crammed: Meet Singh Kapoor, 40, was one of 35 Afghan Sikhs, including 13 children, found inside the container . The group were from the tiny Sikh minority left in Afghanistan. They are believed to have fled the country six months ago to escape further persecution. Kamaljit Singh Matharu, who has been acting as a translator for the group, said: ‘The immigrants have been through a lot, they are traumatised. They are still very frightened and confused.’ One of the immigrants, a man in his 30s, told the Daily Mail that the survivors were struggling to piece together their harrowing journey.

"A mother of three severely disabled young children is suspected of smothering them to death. Tania Clarence, 42, was last night described as a devoted mother who ‘doted on her children’. She was arrested after police discovered the lifeless bodies of three-year-olds Ben and Max and four-year-old Olivia at the family’s £2million home in south-west London. Scroll down for videos . Mr Clarence with his three-year-old twin sons, Ben and Max . Probe: Police have launched a murder investigation and have arrested a 42-year-old woman, believed to be mother Tania Clarence, who is in custody . Scene: Police guard a grand property in New Malden, south-west London, where the bodies of three children were found . Bedroom: A Scotland Yard forensics officer inside a room at the £2million Victorian property . Friends said all three children . suffered the degenerative condition spinal muscular atrophy – sometimes . described as ‘floppy baby syndrome’ – and received specialist care . around the clock. Their . father, investment banker Gary Clarence, 43, had travelled to the . couple’s native South Africa with their eldest daughter Taya – who was . not disabled – to celebrate her eighth birthday. Last . night Mr Clarence was flying back from Johannesburg but Mr Clarence’s . brother Kevin said the family were too upset to discuss the deaths. Mr . Clarence, a trained lawyer, studied at Stellenbosch University and in . Holland before joining Investec in 1999, two years after the couple . married in South Africa. Poignant: Plants, candles and teddies were left outside the house in New Malden yesterday as the community reacted to the deaths . Support: A woman brings flowers to the scene in . New Malden while a card printed with Psalm 23 is stuck to a fence . outside the house . Moved: A policeman lays flowers on behalf of grieving neighbour at the property in Thetford Road, New Malden . Moving: This message was one of many left at the house as the community paid tribute to the children who died . He began working in its financial department, before moving to the US for 18 months and eventually becoming a director, responsible for international healthcare clients. Spinal . muscular atrophy (SMA) is a disease sometimes called ‘floppy baby . syndrome’ that affects between 5,500 and 6,000 people in the UK. It . causes muscle weakness and progressive loss of movement as the nerve . cells connecting the brain and spinal cord to the body’s muscles break . down over time. Muscles . used for activities such as crawling, walking, sitting up and moving . the head become gradually weaker, but mental abilities remain . unaffected. In the . most severe forms of SMA, types I and II, fatal respiratory problems . often develop early on and it is the leading cause of genetic death in . infants and toddlers. Depending . on its severity, children may need surgery, exercises and  equipment to . improve mobility and breathing. There is no cure. SMA is caused by a faulty copy of a gene, which is activated when both parents carry it. Around . one in every 40 to 60 people carry the gene. It can be tested for . during pregnancy, although the test can increase the risk of a . miscarriage. Joanna . Mitchell, from the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Trust, said: ‘There can be . terrible pain and it can be challenging for parents to look after . children with the condition.’ The couple had Taya in 2006. But while pregnant with the twins Mrs Clarence discovered that their second daughter Olivia had a degenerative genetic illness. The twins, who were born prematurely in Lisbon in 2010, were soon discovered to have inherited the same illness. All . three children were left with severely limited development and doctors . warned that Olivia was unlikely to survive to her teens. The . couple threw everything into providing for their children. Mrs . Clarence, a talented graphic designer, gave up her career to look after . them and the family renovated a seven-bedroom home in the commuter belt . in New Malden. They moved in . last year after builders gutted the home and installed special . features, including a lift and ramps, during a nine-month project. The couple also employed a nanny and carers were regularly seen  visiting the children at all hours of day and night. New . Malden councillor Ken Smith said Mrs Clarence had contacted him . recently with concerns about an uneven pavement that was hindering her . children’s wheelchairs. He . added: ‘She absolutely doted on the children. When I spoke to the lady . she was very, very concerned about the children and that they were . looked after properly. This is a tragedy.’ All . three disabled children attended Bedelsford School, a highly respected . school for the disabled in Kingston, where staff said they were ‘deeply . saddened’ by the deaths. Police discovered the bodies after they were . called to the couple’s three-storey Victorian mansion on Tuesday . evening. A forensics teams has spent several hours in the house and post mortem examinations will be carried out . A forensics officer enters the property as the murder investigation continued yesterday . Location: The children were found dead in a house in New Malden, south-west London . Family friends had dialled 999 after becoming concerned when they couldn’t contact the family for more than 24 hours. Gary and Tania Clarence spent almost a year renovating their £2million home to make it suitable for their disabled children before moving in. The couple bought the house in 2011 for £1,060,000 but it was derelict and needed extensive renovation. They shelled out hundreds of thousands of pounds on the seven-bedroom property in New Malden, Surrey, stripping it back and rebuilding it almost from bare foundations. When it was finished it included a state-of-the-art lift for their second daughter, Olivia. The couple spent another £50,000 on a new driveway, removing a tree and fitting a sloping entrance to the front door that could be used by wheelchairs. The property also boasted a 140ft south-facing garden for the children to play in and the fridge in the kitchen included a holder for wine glasses. Neighbour June Dodd said they spent ‘months and months’ doing it up before moving in from their previous home in nearby Wimbledon, South London. Ethel Winstanley, who lives opposite the couple, said she congratulated them on the house’s ‘transformation’ last summer. The . three children were found dead in their upstairs bedrooms. Police . suspect they may have been suffocated. Mrs Clarence was taken to St . George’s Hospital, Tooting, south London, and arrested on suspicion of . murder after treatment to minor wounds. She remained in police custody last night. Neighbours . said two tearful women were standing in the street as police and . ambulances arrived. Both were so upset they could barely speak. Michele . Bacchus, 38, who helped them, said: ‘They were sobbing and very upset. I . don’t know if it was them that found the family. It was awful.’ Last night a family friend said: ‘She had to cope with so much, she was a very loving mother.’ Shocked neighbours said it was a tragedy and called the family ‘really, really lovely people’. Retired . nurse Joy Devis, 86, said the deaths came as a ‘huge surprise and . shock’ and other neighbours said they had last seen the children playing . in the front garden on  Sunday ‘larking about’. They . and other well-wishers created a poignant makeshift memorial to the . children outside the house yesterday, leaving teddy bears, bouquets of . flowers, pot plants and a child’s skipping rope in the driveway – which . was guarded by police officers. A . Metropolitan Police spokesman said post-mortem examinations, undertaken . by a specialist paediatric pathologist, are likely to take place today.

"Infected: Dr Kent Brantly, from Texas, with his wife Amber . An outbreak of Ebola could spread worldwide after an infected plane passenger introduced the deadly virus to Nigeria, health experts warned last night. Previous outbreaks were confined to forests and rural areas, but this one has already spread across four countries in West Africa, killing 672 – the disease’s biggest death toll. The news came as it emerged that an American doctor working for a charity in Liberia had become infected. Dr Kent Brantly, 33, from Texas, had moved to the country for the Samaritan’s Purse organisation with his children and wife, Amber, to help contain the disease. More than 1,000 others have been infected by the virus, which can go unnoticed for three weeks and kills 90 per cent of victims. The outbreak started in Guinea in February and spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone in weeks. After an air traveller brought it to Nigeria, health experts now fear infected air passengers who do not realise they have the virus could spread it around the world. With 170million people, Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation and airlines fly from there to Britain, other European countries and North America. Civil servant Patrick Sawyer collapsed at Lagos airport in Nigeria on July 20 after flying in from Liberia, where he had attended the funeral of his sister, who had also succumbed to the disease. His plane also landed in Togo on its way to Nigeria, prompting fears that the virus may have also reached a fifth country. Professor Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, said: ‘If the disease gets going in Nigeria it would be cause for concern. Protective gear: Dr Brantly, right, became infected by the disease while trying to stop it . ‘Nigeria has close links with the UK and many other countries.’ Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are now screening air passengers – but doctors say this may not be effective because Ebola has an incubation period of two to 21 days and cannot be diagnosed on the spot. Symptoms include high fever, bleeding and damage to the nervous system. There is no vaccine or cure. It is spread by contact with infected blood or other bodily fluids. All outbreaks since 1976 when Ebola was first identified have been in Africa, with the previous highest death toll being 280.","Health experts fear other passengers could now be carrying the virus .

"Rising from a dry dock, this is America's latest and possibly costliest piece of military machinery ever constructed. The world's only superpower has released details of its new generation of aircraft carriers - the first of which costs a staggering $13billion - which it hopes will enable it to dominate any battlefield for decades to come. But that sort of money buys an incredible amount of firepower, with the ship stuffed with cutting-edge and top secret technology. Scroll down for video . The $13billion USS Gerald R. Ford will be one of the most fearsome weapons in the Pentagon's arsenal . When finished, the giant 1,106-foot USS Gerald R. Ford . will be able to launch 220 airstrikes per day from its two runways, hold 4,000 sailors . and marines, and be virtually invisible to enemy radar. The Navy also plans to buy another three such carriers, at a cost of $43 billion, to complete its fleet. But the project to build the most advanced aircraft carrier every made has come at a high price, with costs overrunning to the tune of nearly $3billion and major delays. Beci . Brenton, spokesman for Huntington Ingalls Industries, the maker of the . ship, told FoxNews.com: 'The structure has been rearranged to . accommodate new technology and meet all of the Navy’s operational . requirements. Superpower: The new generation of aircraft carriers incorporates a host of top secret technology which is designed to secure dominance of any battlefield . Deadly: USS Gerald R. Ford will hold 4,000 sailors and marines and is designed to be virtually invisible to enemy radar . The . ship’s structure and exterior are now 100 per cent complete, Brenton . said. But internal connections and features inside the ship are still . being added. The ship began construction in Newport News, Virginia, in 2007, but is unlikely to enter sea trials until 2016. The carrier would be fully capable by February 2019, according to a critical watchdog report. Delays . ranging from between two and a half and four and a half years in . testing three of the ship’s most important new advances: its dual band . radar, arresting gear and the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System . that will catapult jets off the carrier have become serious issues. Power: The USS Gerald R. Ford is the new generation of aircraft carriers capable of launching 220 airstrikes a day . Rising costs: The USS Gerald R. Ford is expected to cost taxpayers more than £13billion when it is finally completed . New generation: The giant 1,106-foot ship is currently under construction at a dry dock in Newport News, Virginia, but will not be commissioned until 2016 . And . the spiralling costs come at a time when the Navy is seaching for ways . to plug a $14 billion cut in the upcoming fiscal year as a result of the . automatic federal budget cuts known as sequestration. The state-of-the-art carrier has provoked strong criticism from some quarters, including the government's own watchdogs. In . a report earlier this month the Government Accountability Office wrote: . 'Key ship systems face reliability shortfalls that the Navy does not . expect to resolve until many years after [Ford] commissioning, which . will limit the ship’s mission effectiveness during initial deployments . and likely increase costs to the government.' It added: 'The Navy faces technical, design, and construction challenges to . completing Gerald R. Ford that have led to significant cost increases.' National . security experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, . the Brookings Institution, have also called into question the value of the aircraft in future conflicts. 'I’m not persuaded they’re worth twice what the old carriers cost,' Michael O’Hanlon, of Brookings, told FoxNews.com.

"A Spanish councillor has quit her job after a home-made porn movie she made was leaked online. Olvido Hormigos Carpio resigned today after the intimate clip went viral on social networks across the country. The graphic footage showed her naked and pleasuring herself alone on a bed. Home-made movie: This footage of Spanish councillor Olvido Hormigos Carpio naked went viral on web . The clip quickly spread around the town of 6,500 people before it was posted on YouTube. Carpio branded the leak 'an attack on her privacy,' it was reported by Spanish newspaper El Mundo. The footage was taken off YouTube this morning after Hormigos complained to the California-based site. Attack of privacy: Carpio branded the leak 'an attack on her privacy' and has claimed she is handing in her notice . She claimed she was handing in her notice 'out of respect for her family and to her party, the PSOE'. The mother-of-two is one of six Socialist politicians in the Toledo town of Los Yébenes, 80 miles south of capital Madrid. Tomorrow the town council is expected to accept the primary school teacher's resignation. She has also reported the 'distribution' of the film to Spain's Civil Guard police. Town Mayor Pedro Acevedo, of the opposing Popular Party, confirmed to El Mundo that Hormigos has resigned due to a 'thorny issue'. It is unclear who spread the video around the town or who posted it on YouTube. Leaked sex tapes have ended many political careers around the world. Indian politician Abhishek Manu Singhvi, 53, a senior Congress party spokesman, quit his post and his chairmanship of a parliamentary committee on law and justice in April this year after a tape was leaked allegedly showing him having sex with a female colleague in his legal chambers.

"French fishermen are among a dozen people accused of smuggling more than 200 illegal immigrants across the Channel to the south coast of England.

An Albanian mother begs with her child near Baker Street, London: Albania is a 'potential' European Union candidate, but at present its nationals are not allowed free movement to live and work in Britain . 'It is thought they were dropped off at smaller ports and beaches along the English coast between Weymouth and Plymouth. 'We . are in contact with our counterparts in Britain and inquiries into . other gangs possibly involved in people trafficking between Britain and . France are ongoing.' A . police source added: 'The method was chosen because it avoids the many . checks that lorries go through when they board ferries to the UK.' The . traffickers carried the immigrants from ports in Normandy and Brittany, . often travelling in hired pleasure boats. Prosecutor Brigitte . Ernoult-Cabot, who coordinated the French operation said: 'There were 14 . trips over a period of 18 months.' Albania . is not a member of the EU although it wants to join, so its people, who . are among the poorest in Europe, require a visa to visit the UK or work . here.  If discovered by British officials, Albanians without residency . rights face deportation, but many find work in the black economy. The . joint Franco-British operation was prompted by the arrest of two boat . captains in January 2013. The skippers, both Bretons in their 20s, had . hired a luxury yacht, the Koo 2 Bool, on the pretext of sailing to the . Caribbean. But they were . stopped by French customs officers off the coast of Normandy, four miles . from Cherbourg, trying to smuggle 15 Albanians to England. The sailors are understood to have carried out five or six similar trips across the Channel. The skippers told police they had been recruited by a Kosovan criminal boss. A . French police source said: 'The Kosovan mastermind does not live in . France. Police had to wait until he returned until they could launch . their operation. He had only been in St Malo for a few days when . officers struck.'","Suspects alleged to have used boats to ferry migrants across the Channel .

"Teacher Priscilla Davo Ortego has been suspended amid allegations she sellotaped children's mouths closed . The teacher accused of Sellotaping over the mouths of a class of ten-year-olds to keep them quiet says was a ‘game’ that the youngsters suggested and enjoyed. Priscilla Davo is said to be ‘devastated’ by the furore following the incident. She has been suspended from teaching Spanish and art while Danesfield Church of England middle school in Williton, Somerset, investigates parents’ complaints that their children had struggled to breathe and hurt their lips when removing the tape. The 27-year-old Spanish-born teacher has not spoken publicly about the incident, but boyfriend Ivan Martin Linan said the claim that she taped the children’s mouths shut against their wishes ‘couldn’t be further from the truth’. ‘She told me she was trying to relax the children with music before asking them to draw themselves and to do so he told them they couldn’t speak,’ he said. ‘She said the idea of the Sellotape was one the children came up with as a way of reminding them they couldn’t speak, that they were laughing and enjoying themselves.’ She is said to have left the lesson in good spirits thinking the class had gone well, and been surprised and appalled when parents contacted the school to complain. Parents claimed that some of the children ripped the tape off because they were struggling to breathe, while other were left with bleeding lips when the tape was removed, and several said they were scared about returning to school. The Year 6 pupils said Miss Ortega imposed the punishment on Monday because they were making too much noise while playing a game of blind man’s bluff. The incident is now the subject of a ‘thorough’ investigation by the school, and Miss Davo, who now lives in Somerset, has not spoken publicly about her side of the story. But speaking from his home in Spain, Miss Davo’s boyfriend Ivan Martin Linan, told the Mail: ‘She’s absolutely devastated at what’s happened. A teacher has been accused of taping up the mouths of 10-year-olds at Danesfield Church of England School, Williton, Somerset . ‘She breaks down in tears whenever she speaks about it. She can’t believe what’s happened. ‘The accusation that she taped the children’s mouths shut against their wishes and hurt them couldn’t be further from the truth. ‘It was just a game during an art class.’ He continued: ‘She told me she was trying to relax the children with music before asking them to draw themselves and to do so she told them they couldn’t speak and had to express themselves with signs to each other. ‘She said the idea of the Sellotape was one the children came up with as a way of reminding them they couldn’t speak, that they were laughing and enjoying themselves and when the tape fell off they’d ask her to put more on. ‘She and the kids ended the class as happy as normal and that was it as far as she was concerned.’He went on: ‘The first she knew of any problem was the following day when a teacher told her she was going to substitute her in her following class and she was informed the school had complaints from parents. ‘She’s shocked because she’s seen photos of children complaining about what happened and says they’re the ones who were enjoying themselves the most.’ Speaking from the village of Huetor-Santillan near Granada, in Southern Spain, Mr Linan said: ‘Staff have been very supportive of her and told her not to worry and it’s best she’s away from school for the time being. ‘You’d understand it if she had done something wrong and made a mistake. The teacher has now been suspended and the school has launched an investigation . ‘But the case is that she hasn’t. It’s total madness. ‘It was just a game. She’s taking advice from a teachers’ association about her future at the moment. ‘She doesn’t want to return to Spain just now in case that’s misinterpreted. ‘But at the same time she’s fretting about how she can face some of the children after everything that’s been said about her.’ He said of Miss Davo, who has been battling cancer and recently received chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment: ‘She loves her job and she loves being around children. ‘Priscila’s the last person you’d have expected something like this to happen to. ‘Her conscience is clean.’The teacher’s uncle Enrique Ortega added: ‘Priscila’s been totally maligned. ‘I’m proud to be her uncle. She’s one of the nicest young women you could ever hope to meet. ‘She’s told her mum in a phone call it was just a game and the children were laughing and joking.‘We just hope the truth comes out as soon as possible and she’s allowed to get back to working with children as soon as possible which is what she loves. Avon and Somerset Police confirmed they had spoken to one family but added that they would not be taking any further action . ‘The last few months have been very difficult for her. Being falsely accused like this is the last thing she needed.’ Miss Ortega, who is said to speak excellent English, worked as a nanny in London from November 2010 to June 2011 before returning to her native country to complete a Master’s in secondary education. Having completed a month-long placement at Danesfield primary in 2012, she began working at the school full-time in January. She wrote in May last year her joy at getting a job at the school. ‘Now for sure, next school year, I will be an art and Spanish teacher in Danesfield School in pretty Sommerset (sic)! A bit nervous but happy,’ she said on Facebook. Headteacher Ian Bradbury said on Tuesday after the initial complaints emerged: ‘We take all allegations seriously. The well-being of our children is of vital importance to us. ‘An incident happened in a lesson on Monday. Following that incident, I have suspended the teacher involved until a full and thorough investigation has taken place.’","Spanish and art teacher Priscilla Davo Ortega taped children's mouths shut .

"The British nurse infected with ebola is responding well to treatment and has recovered his appetite, his parents told yesterday. William Pooley, 29, is enjoying bacon butties and is now strong enough to start gentle exercise. But he is still being kept inside an isolation tent and may have to stay there for weeks to ensure the infection does not spread. Feeling better: William Pooley, 29, is feeling much better eight days after arriving back from Sierra Leone . Mr Pooley was hailed a hero for his work treating ebola patients in a remote clinic in Sierra Leone after he was struck down with the disease. He was airlifted out of West Africa by the RAF and taken to the specialist isolation ward at the Royal Free Hospital in north London. Last night his parents Robin, 67, and Jackie, 66, beamed with relief as they revealed their son is responding well to treatment, including the experimental drug ZMapp. The couple, who have spent most of the last ten days at the hospital, praised the ‘world class’ care he had received. Mr Pooley said: ‘He is able to get out of bed. He has a little step in there that the physio gave him so that he can rebuild his strength. ‘That in itself is a good enough sign, I think. But he seems to be pretty well actually.’ Unable to have any direct contact with his parents, Will is able to talk to them via a telephone link into the isolation tent. Mr Pooley added: ‘We can stand and see him indistinctly through the glass and the polythene.’ Mrs Pooley said: ‘He is talking a lot more than he was at the beginning. He is interested in more things. And a clear sign of his improving health is his appetite. Mr Pooley said: ‘His appetite has come back. It came back with a bacon butty that one morning for breakfast’. Mrs Pooley added: ‘And then we took him a vegetable rogan josh [curry].’ The couple have revealed that they were at a family wedding when Will broke the news that he had been infected with ebola. Mrs Pooley said: ‘We were at our niece’s wedding and he phoned, we’re out in the grounds and the photos were being taken. We assumed he’d phoned to wish his cousin every happiness.’ The phone was passed around family members, but his father thought Will was sounding ‘flat’ and that there was something wrong. Fears: The volunteer nurse contracted Ebola while  treating patients in Africa where the disease has sprea . ‘Fairly soon I rang him back and he told me,’ he said. ‘At which point the first thing in mind is, “We can’t spoil the day”.’ The couple left the wedding early. Mrs Pooley said it was a ‘very stressful’ and anxious time when ‘all the worst case scenarios’ were running through her mind. She said: ‘First of all we worried that he would not get out of the country. There a lot of check points that had to be cleared. He had 160 miles to travel across to get to the airport in Freetown. ‘It wasn’t until the plane had taken off that we breathed a very, very small sigh of relief, we knew he was on his way home.’ The couple say their son is very grateful for the expert case he has received. Mrs Pooley said: ‘I think he has feels very glad to be having such good care. He is very aware of what he has left behind.’ Her husband added: ‘The fact that the British Government decided that they were going to be his insurance company was absolutely fantastic.’ The couple said they were very proud of Will for the live-saving work he did in Sierra Leone. They hope he will make a full recovery. More than 1,500 people have died since the ebola outbreak started in Guinea. The World Health Organisation has warned as many as 20,000 people could be infected before the outbreak is controlled.","William Pooley, 29, contracted the virus in Sierra Leone working as a nurse .

"Thailand's army has declared martial law, intensifying the turbulent nation's deepening political crisis but denying a coup d'etat was under way. The shock pre-dawn announcement, which effectively places the army in charge of public security nationwide, came after six months of anti-government demonstrations aimed at ousting the government and a day after the south-east Asian country's caretaker prime minister refused to step down. The army said in a statement that the military had taken the action to 'keep peace and order' and soldiers entered several private television stations in the capital Bangkok to broadcast their message. Scroll down for video . Thai soldiers take up position on a street outside the Centre for the Administration of Peace and Order after soldiers were sent in to seize the centre on Tuesday in Bangkok . Pedestrians stroll past armed Thai soldiers in Bangkok on Tuesday after Thailand's army declared martial law . The army said in a statement that the military had taken the action to 'keep peace and order' and soldiers entered several private television stations in the capital. The military statement was signed by army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan-Ocha. It cited a 1914 law that gives it authority to intervene during times of crisis, and said it had taken the action because on-going mass rallies between political rivals 'could impact the country's security and safety of the lives and properties of the public.' The move came after a six-month political stalemate, which has involved widespread anti-government demonstrations. Analysts have warned Thailand is on the brink of civil war and 28 people have been killed in clashes across the country. Thailand has been without a sitting parliament since December last year, when then-premier Yingluck Shinawatra refused to bow to pressure to step down but called an election for February in an attempt to ease unrest. Thai soldiers occupy the foyer of the National Broadcasting Services of Thailand television station in Bangkok .

The February elections were sabotaged by the anti-government People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), led by Suthep Thaugsuban. Election officials were unable to schedule a new poll before Yingluck was removed on May 7, after a court found her and nine of her ministers guilty of abuse of power. Thailand's acting prime minister Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan insisted on Monday that his government will not resign, resisting pressure from a group of senators who are seeking ways to settle the country's political crisis, and from anti-government protesters who are demanding an appointed prime minister.

Thailand's army declared martial law to restore order after six months of anti-government protests which have left the country without a functioning government . A group of about 70 senators, most of whom are seen as siding with the anti-government protesters, proposed a framework on Friday that calls for a government with full power to conduct political reforms. Acting Prime Minister Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan and Justice Minister Chaikasem Nitisiri met with two representatives of the Senate in an undisclosed location Monday to avoid disruption from the protesters. In a statement following the meeting, . Niwattumrong said the Cabinet cannot resign because 'it will be . negligence of duty and against the constitution,' and insisted he 'can . carry out duties and has full authority' as prime minister.

The Cabinet has operated in a caretaker capacity with limited power since Yingluck dissolved the lower house in December in a failed bid to ease the political crisis. A new government cannot normally be named until there are elections, which anti-government demonstrators have vowed to block unless political reforms occur first. The Senate, the only functioning legislative body in the country, was seen as the last resort of the anti-government protesters, who are calling for an interim, unelected prime minister to be chosen. A Royal Thai Army soldier stands guard on an overpass outside a major shopping center in downtown Bangkok . Earlier this month, the Constitutional Court removed Yingluck for nepotism along with nine Cabinet members in a case that many viewed as politically motivated. Protesters said her removal is not enough because she was replaced by an acting prime minister from the ruling party, Niwattumrong. Anti-government protesters say they are making their final push to oust the government and install an unelected prime minister and government. They have promised to call off their rallies if they are not successful by May 26, following six months of street demonstrations in which 28 people have died and hundreds of others have been injured. Thai anti-government protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban is greeted by his supporters during a march in Bangkok, Thailand, on Monday . The protesters on Monday began searching for members of the Cabinet at their residences to pressure them to resign, but did not find any. Labor unions representing about 20 state-owned enterprises vowed to go on strike Thursday to support the anti-government protesters, although several companies, including Thai Airways and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, said Monday that they would operate normally. Thailand's political crisis began in 2006, when Yingluck's brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was toppled by a military coup after being accused of corruption, abuse of power and disrespect for King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Thaksin, a former telecommunications billionaire, remains highly popular among the poor in the north and northeast, and parties controlled by him have won every national election since 2001. The anti-government protesters, who are aligned with the opposition Democrat Party and backed by the country's traditional elites, say they want to remove all traces of his political machine from politics. Thaksin's supporters, known as the Red Shirts, have staged a rally in Bangkok's western outskirts since May 10, raising concerns about possible clashes between them and the anti-government protesters.

"Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has slammed the US President Barack Obama over his speech made on the controversial issue of climate change at last week's G20 Summit. Leaders at the summit turned up the heat on Australia's climate change in Brisbane over the weekend, which resulted in some of the world's largest economies declaring their support for strong action. But Ms Bishop, speaking to ABC’s 7.30 program from New York, said there was an 'issue' regarding the president’s statement about the Great Barrier Reef. Scroll down for video . Julie Bishop has slammed the US President Barack Obama over his speech on the Great Barrier Reef . ‘I can understand the Queensland Government’s concern because the Queensland government and Australia have committed significant resources, funding and effort to preserving and conserving the Great Barrier Reef,’ she told host Leigh Sales. ‘Indeed, I believe that we are demonstrating world’s best practise in working with the World Heritage Committee to ensure that the Great Barrier Reef is preserved for generations to come. ‘And I think that president Obama might have overlooked that aspect of our commitment to conserving the Great Barrier Reef.’ President Obama said no country was immune to the effects of climate change and that everyone must play a role in fighting the global phenomena . On Saturday President  Obama told an audience at the University of Queensland that no country was immune to the effects of climate change and that everyone must play a role in fighting the global phenomena. 'Here in the Asia Pacific, nobody has more at stake when it comes to thinking about and then acting on climate change,' he said during his speech. 'Here a climate that increases in temperature will mean more extreme and frequent storms, more flooding, rising seas that submerge Pacific islands. 'Here in Australia, it means longer droughts, more wildfires – The incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef is threatened. ‘I have not had time to go to the Great Barrier Reef and I want to come back and I want my daughters to be able to come back and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit and I want that there 50 years from now.

"A sex offender who had taken vodka shots through his eyeballs before raping a teenage girl as she lay drunk in bed at a house party has been given a 10 year sentence. Mitchel Ward, 21, was told by a judge at Leeds Crown Court that he poses 'a serious danger' to women. Ward pleaded guilty to raping the teenage victim at a house party in Leeds, West Yorkshire, in November last year. Mitchel Ward, 21, was given a ten-year sentence after a judge told him he poses 'a serious danger' to women . Leeds Crown Court heard Ward had gone to a party at the property with his girlfriend and drank heavily. Denise Breen-Lawton said the 21-year-old had been doing 'eyeball shots' - in which he poured vodka directly into his eye in order to get drunk more quickly. During the evening people at the party played spin the bottle and the victim had ended up in just her underwear. The court heard the teenager then decided to go to bed because she felt sleepy. Ward went into the bedroom later in the evening and laid beside her in bed, before asking the girl if he could have sex with her  - but she refused. At around 7.30am the next morning she awoke to find Ward having sex with her. He was arrested after the girl told her parents about what had happened. Ward, from Leeds, initially denied any wrong-doing. Leeds Crown Court (pictured) heard Ward pleaded guilty after forensic evidence linked him to the offence . He described the victim as a 'strange one' and told officers that he did not like her. Ward pleaded guilty to rape after forensic evidence linked him to the offence.

Simon Alexander, defending, said Ward was 'sorry' for what he had done and had pleaded guilty to the offence at an early stage in the case. He said Ward accepted that he would be facing a lengthy prison sentence. Mr Alexander said Ward was 'keen' to receive help while in custody to address his offending behaviour. Judge Neil Clark told Ward he must serve five years in custody followed by a period on licence for a further five years. He said: 'It is clear that you have ruined her life in many ways. I only hope that the passage of time will help with her recovery.' The judge added: 'You present a high risk of harm to females.

"France was yesterday accused of providing a ‘refuelling stop’ for illegal immigrants trying to get to Britain with plans for a new Sangatte-style refugee camp. MPs said proposals for housing 400 people near Calais would act as a magnet, encouraging more desperate people to attempt the perilous journey to the UK. They were also furious at plans to set up ‘welcome centres’ providing help and advice to people seeking to reach Britain’s shores. These may be used to help migrants make applications for asylum in Britain. Scroll down for video . The Mayor of Calais today called for the building of a permanent centre for thousands of illegal migrants making their way to Britain . The row began after Calais mayor . Natacha Bouchart announced plans for a state-funded camp, providing . shelter, food and washing facilities, for thousands of migrants who pass . through the port. In words which have already raised the . spectre of a new Sangatte, she said that allowing them all . to sleep rough in her town was 'unsustainable.' Mayor Bouchart said: ‘Calais is today under an unbearable strain from the highest number of migrants we have ever known. ‘In . the face of this new situation we cannot stay with our arms folded. I . am going to propose a solution to the government – the creation of a . [migrant] centre away from local residents. ‘It . is the only way to rid the town of this huge migrant presence, which is . as unbearable for local people as it is for the migrants.’ Madame Bouchart will submit her proposal to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve at a meeting on September 2. In words which have already raised the spectre of a new Sangatte, . (pictured in 2001)  Natacha Bouchart said that allowing them all to . sleep rough in her town was 'unsustainable' Four . potential sites for the centre have been identified outside Calais but . their locations have been kept secret for fear of a public outcry. It is said the centre will be 'far from the town, because if it is close to local . residents it becomes too tense'. Natacha . Bouchart estimated it would 'remove 80 per cent' of those sleeping . rough, and reassure Calais residents  they were entitled to 'a bit of . peace' The . mayor claims she does not want ‘a new Sangatte’ – the name of the . notorious Red Cross centre closed in 2002 that was used by 60,000 people . as a springboard for illegal entry to Britain. But, faced with an influx of more migrants, Ms . Bouchart told the Voix du Nord newspaper: 'I would accept the . construction of this centre if the state agrees to manage it.' She estimated it would 'remove 80 per . cent' of those sleeping rough, and reassure Calais residents that they . were entitled to 'a bit of peace'. But last night critics said her plan to open a dedicated camp would encourage huge numbers to flock to the Channel port. Conservative . MP for Kettering Philip Hollobone said: ‘It’s completely unacceptable . at every level for the French authorities to provide a refuelling stop . for illegal immigrants trying to get to Britain. This needs to be raised . urgently at the highest level with the French government. ‘We . need to take urgent steps to tighten our border controls at Dover and . elsewhere to ensure that this new wave of uncontrolled immigration does . not come to Britain. ‘It’s . quite clear that these people are not claiming asylum in France. They . are passing through France and only claiming asylum once they arrive in . the UK. ‘It’s completely unacceptable for migrants to pass through many other safe countries before claiming asylum in the UK.’ The . situation has deteriorated in Calais this year because of a new wave of . immigrants from Eritrea and Ethiopia. Tens of thousands have crossed . the Mediterranean after the collapse of Libya. Up to 1,500 migrants are camping out or living in squats run by anarchists in Calais. Hundreds more are living in makeshift shelters and tents in woods and sand dunes along France’s north coast. Calais’ deputy mayor Philippe Mignonet has warned that the migrant population . there will rise to up to 5,000 by the end of the year if the situation . does not change. Around 1200 migrants - mainly Eritreans, Sudanese and Afghans - are currently squatting in disused buildings, or living in temporary camps - ones which the French regularly raze (file photo) Around 1200 migrants - mainly Eritreans, . Sudanese and Afghans - are currently squatting in disused buildings, or . living in temporary camps - ones which the French regularly raze. Violent . clashes between rival ethnic groups armed with knives and metal bars . broke out two weeks ago as they fought for the best sites from which to . clamber on Britain-bound lorries. Outnumbered riot police have been . unable to control the situation. There have also been disturbances involving people smugglers who . charge the equivalent of around £1000 for a passage across the Channel . in a lorry or car. Last night Immigration Minister James Brokenshire declined to comment directly on plans for a ‘new Sangatte’ in Calais. In . a statement he said: ‘Security at the UK border is our priority and we . will continue to strengthen it to stop those who have no right to enter . the UK. ‘We are taking action at a national and international level to tackle illegal immigration.’ Humanitarian . workers in Calais welcomed the idea of the camp. One, Philippe . Wannesson, said: 'It's a change of position, because until now she was . blocking the suggestion of a shelter and denouncing the squats. 'It's . positive to reopen the debate, but a centre for 400 people is not . enough.

"Dash-cam footage emerged today showing the moment that George Zimmerman was pulled over by a police officer in Texas for speeding and told them he was carrying a gun. Just over two weeks since his dramatic acquittal for the murder of Trayvon Martin, 17, Zimmerman was issued the warning on Sunday in Forney, Texas, just 25 miles from Dallas. The latest traffic incident comes a week-and-a-half after Zimmerman rescued a family-of-four from their upturned SUV over a thousand miles away in Florida, near  where he shot Martin dead. Armed: George Zimmerman was pulled over on the road in Forney, Texas and it was revealed that he had a gun in a glovebox . With Zimmerman facing death threats following his acquittal, his brother Robert said that his family have to deal with rumors about his whereabouts every day. He added that they go to great lengths to ensure their safety in accordance with the law. CBS Dallas Fort Worth have claimed that the officer did not recognize Zimmerman, who has been at the center of a nationwide controversy since he was found not guilty of the second-degree murder and manslaughter of Trayvon Martin earlier this month. Indeed, Zimmerman is even reported to have asked the officer if he knew his face from television and the officer again told the one-time Florida neighborhood watch captain that he did not. While being questioned by the officer, Zimmerman, who was driving a 2008 Honda pick-up with Florida plates, told the officer that he was armed and was instructed to keep the gun in the car's glove-compartment. The officer issued Zimmerman a warning for speeding and then sent him on his way - but not before asking him where he was going, to which he replied 'nowhere in particular'. 'Nowhere in particular, why is that?' responded the officer according to In Forney.com . 'You didn’t see my name?' said Zimmerman. The officer then responded, 'wow, what a coincidence.' Traffic Violation: George Zimmerman was pulled over by police in Forney, Texas, at around midday and was issued a warning for speeding . The officer then inquired if Zimmerman was free of any warrants for arrest, to which Zimmerman replied, 'absolutely'. 'Alright, I’m gonna go back and just check you, routinely,' said the officer as he checked Zimmerman's proof of insurance and a driver’s license. 'The reason you were stopped was for your speed, why don’t you slow down a little bit for me and, as long as you don’t have any warrants, I’ll cut you loose with a warning,' said the officer to Zimmerman according to In Forney.com. 'Just take it easy, go ahead and shut your glove compartment and don’t play with your firearm, ok?' The traffic stop according to . InForney.Com lasted approximately five minutes and after being given a . warning, Zimmerman was sent on his way - being wished 'a safe trip' by . the officer. In the aftermath of his acquittal Zimmerman's lawyers said that he would almost certainly rearm himself and would be handed back the 9mm Kel-Tec pistol he used to kill Martin. Federal investigators have not yet returned the weapon. And . even though the fact that Zimmerman is back carrying a weapon will . certainly be viewed as controversial, Zimmerman is legally permitted to . under Texas state law. Cleared: George Zimmerman has been involved in two separate traffic incidents in two different states in the two and a half weeks since he was cleared of the murder and manslaughter of Trayvon Martin . Saved by Zimmerman: The Gerstle family of Dana (left) and Mark (right) stand with their children in a October 2011 photo snapped at a Disney World Halloween party . The gun in the glove box is legal in Texas, and police routinely ask motorists if they have weapons in the car, Brooks said. He said the entire stop lasted less than five minutes. 'It wasn't for super-excessive speeds, they just got him on regular speeding,' said Brian Brooks, city manager of Forney, Texas, about 25 miles southeast of Dallas, where Zimmerman was stopped. 'It's a pretty routine stop except for the fact that it was George Zimmerman.' Zimmerman, 29, who is white and Hispanic, was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter on July 13 in Florida after a racially charged trial in the shooting of Martin in February 2012. Thousands of people demonstrated across the United States after the verdict. Zimmerman, who was a volunteer neighborhood watchman in the central Florida town of Sanford, Florida at the time of the shooting, said he acted in self-defense. Scene: The crash occurred at the intersection of I-4 and route Route 46, pictured, less than a mile from where Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin . This is the second highway-related incident involving Zimmerman that has come to the media's attention since his highly controversial acquittal. Last week it emerged that Zimmerman pulled a couple from their upturned SUV after a crash on a stretch of Florida highway just yards from where he shot and illed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. The crash on the 17th July left occurred when Dana and Mark Gerstle lost control of their vehicle on a ramp that left them and their two children, aged eight and four trapped. Zimmerman did not witness the accident which took place at 5.47pm  but was on the scene shortly afterwards. Though he spoke with his lawyers last Friday he did not make any mention of the rescue.Speaking to MailOnline Shawn Vincent, a spokesman for Zimmerman’s attorney Mark O’Mara said: ‘We spoke with George on Friday and he made no mention of this at all. That’s very typical of George. ‘He has a history of getting involved….it’s just the way he is. ‘There has already been the backlash of people saying this is some sort of PR stunt but it isn’t. We’ve had it confirmed by the Sheriff.’ The heroic rescue took place just four days later, less than a mile from where Zimmerman shot the teen in a gated Sanford community in Seminole County. Sanford Police Department Capt Jim McAuliffe said that Zimmerman was identified by one of the crash victims as the man who pulled him and his family from the mangled blue Ford Explorer. Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman, Jr., said in a Wednesday statement: 'Our family receives innumerable death threats on a daily basis. We all continue to take our security and privacy very seriously and go to great lengths to ensure our safety in accordance with the law. ' He went on to accuse the media of speculating and publishing misinformation about the whereabouts of family members that was putting George in particular at risk and called this 'irresponsible and counterproductive.'","George Zimmerman pulled over driving cross-country in Forney, Texas for speeding on Sunday .

"Madcap footballer Mario Balotelli has been linked with the purchase of an extravagant £4.75m 'Teletubbies' mansion after he moved back to the Premier League. The £16m striker, who signed for Liverpool last month, is rumoured to be interested in the Cheshire property, complete with its own swimming pool, football pitch and helipad. Current owner, the entrepreneur Steve O’Connor and his wife Clare have insisted that the property remains on the market with Chester estate agents Savills. Scroll down for video . Fit for a footballer? Mario Balotelli, 24, is believed to be considering this Cheshire home, complete with football pitch, as he prepares to move from Milan to the north west . Helipad: The helipad, overlooking 10 miles of countryside, allows the owner get to London in an hour, which will be welcome news to notorious party-goer Balotelli . Retreat: The mansion is a long drive from Anfield Stadium but it could act as a haven for the Premier League star who attracts plenty of attention in the UK . Balotelli, 24, is known to be house hunting in the area after returning to the country from AC Milan in Italy. He played for Manchester City between 2010 and 2013 .

Light: The previous owners made sure to put windows wherever possible so that the . underground property is filled with light and does not have damp . Before: This is the two-storey cottage perched on a sloping hill that current owner Steve O'Connor transformed into a modern estate that delves underground .

And thanks to the addition of a . helipad, the couple and their two sons Stevie, nine, and Ryan, four, can . get to London in an hour. Mr O'Connor, who owns Widnes Viking Rugby League team, said: 'It is essentially a . modern day country house in size, but if you took out our indulgence, . the swimming pool, it would have the same energy costs as a three bed . semi.' Temperature in the . home is controlled using a unique air tower which releases hot air in . the top and lets in cold air at the bottom.

"Media blackout on American publication's reports on Wen Jiabao's family wealth . New York Times website and web searches of the names of the Prime Minister's family have been blocked . Mr Wen's son, daughter, younger brother and brother-in-law appear to have accumulated most of the wealth . The family of Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao have accumulated some $27 billion - but reports of that vast fortune have been blocked in the Communist state . Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's family have accumulated vast wealth during his time in power, but reports of their $2.7 billion fortune have been blocked in his country. A New York Times article describing how the Prime Minister's mother, siblings and children amassed their affluence prompted the powers-that-be in the Communist state to block the newspaper's website both in English and Chinese. Searches for the publication's site as well as the names of Mr Wen's family members were also barred on the country's main microblog service with the Chines government describing the feature as a 'smear'. The article stated that the family of Mr Wen, 70, known for his humble background - his mother was a teacher and his father tended pigs, have accumulated most of their assets since Wen was named vice premier in 1998 before his promotion to Prime Minister nine years ago. The estimate of his family's wealth was made according to a review of corporate and regulatory records from 1992 to 2012. According to the review, his widowed mother Yang Zhiyun, 90, has had just one investment to her name - in a financial services company with assets worth $120 million in 2007. Aside from his mother, Mr Wen's son, daughter, younger brother and brother-in-law appear to have made most of the money with their 'knack for aggressive deal making,' as the Times describes it. No holdings were found in Mr Wen's own name. The family has assets in telecommunications companies, jewellers, tourist resorts, and banks among other projects and the records show that family business ventures received support from state owned corporations such as the nation's largest mobile phone operator China Mobile. Wen Jiabao, second right, and his family, son Wen Yunsong (left), wife Zhang Beili (second left) and daughter Wen Ruchun (right) One of those holdings includes a stake in a company that helped build stadia ahead of Beijing's 2008 Olympics, including the iconic Birds Nest national stadium. The article said: 'In many cases, the names of the relatives have been hidden behind layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, work colleagues and business partners.' The family also profited from opportunities arising from state decisions according to the report - though it is not known what role Mr Wen plays in those decisions. Wen Jiabao and his family reportedly have assets in a number of companies including a construction firm which helped to build stadia for the Beijing Olympics in 2008, including the national 'Birds Nest' stadium, pictured . Mr Wen's younger brother Wen Jiahong was awarded $30 million in government contracts as part of a crackdown on medical wasted disposal following the outbreak of SARS in 2003 and to handle wastewater management in several of China's biggest cities. The newspaper cited one holding as being with insurance company Ping An which benefited from reforms brought about under Mr Wen's jurisdiction. His wife Zhang Beili is a leading authority on jewellery and a state diamond company that she ran were privatised. Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, pictured during the second round of Chinese-German intergovernmental consultations in Beijing in August, is said to have been unhappy with his family's business dealings . His son Wen Yungsong sold a technology company for $10 million and used another investment vehicle to set up one of the country's biggest equity firms. But state documents leaked by Wikileaks two years ago suggested that Mr Wen, known as a populist premier, was aware of his relatives' business dealings and said to be unhappy with them. The Chinese government's blocking of the reports are by no means the first time that news has been censored in the country. Last year coverage of a high speed rail crash which killed 40 people close to Wenzhou in the Zhejiang Province was blocked. Similarly, nothing was reported of an uprising in Wukon late last year. In June, the Bloomberg website was blocked after an investigative report into the finances of the family of president in waiting Xi Jinping. Mr Wen will step down as part of a transition of power on November 8.

"Pope Benedict XVI used his Christmas Day address to call for an end to bloody conflicts in Syria and Palestine and for there to be peace in the middle East. Appearing from the balcony of the Vatican, he spoke to thousands of pilgrims, tourists and locals who gathered in St Peter's square. In his traditional 'Urbi et Orbi' speech, the Pope condemned the killing of 'defenceless' civilians in Syria and urged Palestine and Israel to find the courage to negotiate. Pope Benedict XVI used his Christmas Day address to urge for peace and an end to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East . Benedict also encouraged Arab spring nations, especially Egypt, to build just and respectful societies. He said Egypt was the land 'blessed by the childhood of Jesus' also prayed that China's new leaders respect religion, a reference to persecution Chinese Roman Catholics have at times endured under communism. Last night Benedict led a two-hour Christmas Eve ceremony in the basilica in which he questioned if there is still time for God in our technology-driven lives. A horse-sounding Benedict called for Israel and Palestine to have the courage to negotiate over peace . Pressing question: Pope Benedict XVI enters St Peter's Basilica for his Christmas Eve Mass, where he used his message to ask whether people still have time for God in our technology-driven lives . In his 'Urbi et Orbi' speech, which . traditionally reviews world events and global challenges, Benedict . prayed that 'peace spring up for the people of Syria, deeply wounded and . divided by a conflict that does not spare even the defenceless and . reaps innocent victims'. He called for easier access to help refugees and for 'dialogue in the pursuit of a political solution to the conflict'. Benedict prayed that God 'grant . Israelis and Palestinians courage to end long years of conflict and . division, and to embark resolutely on the path to negotiation'. Senior Palestinian official Saeb . Erekat said that in a meeting with the Pope last week, Palestinian . president Mahmoud Abbas 'emphasised our total readiness to resume . negotiations'. The Vatican has been worried for . decades about the well-being of its flock in China, who are loyal to the . Pope in defiance of the communist government's support of an . officially-sponsored church, and relations between Beijing and the Holy . See are often tense. Speaking about China's . newly-installed leaders, Benedict expressed hope that 'they will esteem . the contribution of the religions, in respect for each other, in such a . way that they can help to build a fraternal society for the benefit of . that noble people and of the whole world'. Acknowledging Latin America's . predominant Christian population, he urged government leaders to carry . out commitments to development and to fighting organised crime. Calling for unity: Pope Benedict XVI also prayed that Israelis and Palestinians live in peace and freedom, and asked the faithful to pray for strife-torn Syria as well as Lebanon and Iraq . Christmas Eve Mass at the Vatican traditionally began at midnight, but the start time was moved up years ago so as to give the 85-year-old pontiff more time to rest before his Christmas Day speech. A smiling Benedict, dressed in gold-coloured vestments, waved to photo-snapping pilgrims and applauding church-goers as he glided up the centre aisle toward the ornate main altar of the cavernous basilica on a wheeled platform guided by white-gloved aides. The platform saves him energy. In his homily last night, Benedict cited the Gospel account of Mary and Joseph finding no room at an inn and ending up in a stable which sheltered the baby Jesus. He urged people to reflect upon what they find time for in their busy, technology-driven lives. Celebrating the birth of Christ: A general view of the St Peter's Basilica during the Christmas Eve mass held by Pope Benedict XVI . Stunning surroundings: As midnight neared, church bells tolled throughout Rome, while inside the basilica, the sweet voices of the Vatican's boys' choir resounded joyously . 'The great moral question of our attitude toward the homeless, toward refugees and migrants takes on a deeper dimension: Do we really have room for God when he seeks to enter under our roof? Do we have time and space for him?' the pope said. 'The faster we can move, the more efficient our time-saving appliances become, the less time we have. And God? The question of God never seems urgent,' Benedict lamented. The pope worried that 'we are so 'full' of ourselves that there is no room left for God'. He added 'that means there is no room for others either - for children, for the poor, for the stranger'. With his voice a bit hoarse, and looking somewhat tired as the two-hour ceremony neared its end, Benedict decried that history has suffered through 'misuse of religion', when belief in one God became a pretext for intolerance and violence.

'Let us pray that Israelis and Palestinians be able to live their lives in the peace of the one God and in freedom,' the pope said. Benedict also mentioned his hope for progress in Syria, which is mired in civil war, as well as Lebanon and Iraq. Reflecting the Vatican's concern about the exodus of many fearful Christians from the Muslim-dominated Middle East, Benedict expressed hope that 'Christians in those lands where our faith was born maybe be able to continue living there' and that Christians and Muslims 'build up their countries side by side in God's peace'. Hours before the basilica Mass, Benedict lit a Christmas peace candle on the windowsill of his studio window overlooking St Peter's Square.","Pontiff condemned killing of 'defenceless' civilians in Syria .

"He was accused by a fellow MEP this week of having a ‘weakness for women’. Now Nigel Farage has been criticised by another for using public money to employ both his wife and his ‘former mistress’. The Ukip leader was alleged to have had an affair with his spin doctor Annabelle Fuller, 32, who recently tried to explain the distinction between a ‘slag’ and a ‘slut’ following a row at the party conference. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage dismissed claims he was employing his former mistress on Brussels allowances as 'absolute nonsense' Former Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire (left) accused Mr Farage of employing his 'former mistress' Annabelle Fuller . Mr Farage, 49, has two children with his second wife, German national Kirsten Mehr, who he married in 1999 and who works as his secretary. But independent MEP Nikki Sinclaire asked in the European Parliament: ‘With unemployment still a problem across Europe and indeed across the UK, does Mr Farage think it is a fair use of taxpayers’ money, namely his secretarial allowance, not only to employ his wife Kirsten but his former mistress Annabelle Fuller?’ Mr Farage replied: ‘I don’t want to answer that at all, thank you.’ Mr Farage's wife Kirsten wants a chat with her husband over the allegations . The extraordinary allegation comes just days after Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom said: ‘We all have our foibles and our weaknesses – mine is real ale, I’ve never been partial to crumpet. 'Nigel’s is women. It’s not something he ever denied.’ The Ukip leader and Miss Fuller fiercely denied the claims of an affair, but Mrs Farage seemed less certain when asked at the large semi-detached family home near Westerham, Kent. She said: ‘Nigel’s just on his way back from Strasbourg and we will be discussing it tonight, I’m sure. I don’t want to comment today.’ Rumours about Miss Fuller’s close friendship with Mr Farage have swirled since she was appointed by the party in 2006, soon after graduating from the University of London. She broke down in tears in 2008 after revealing she had received ‘threatening’ telephone calls accusing of her of being a ‘whore’, in what she claimed was part of a vicious two-year smear campaign aimed at undermining Mr Farage. Mr Farage said he had faced questions about his relationship with Miss Fuller since 2006 but insisted 'it is not true' The former public schoolgirl left Ukip because of the claims but remained a well-known socialite around Westminster. Three years ago, she accused Tory MP Andrew Bridgen of groping her on the balcony of his flat close to the Commons. He was arrested but the case was later dropped and Mr Bridgen has always strongly denied all the allegations. Miss Fuller later waived her right to anonymity and said her life had been ‘destroyed’ by the incident and that she had been branded a ‘fantasist.’ After leaving Ukip, she started a public relations firm, Athena PR, which boasts a recommendation from Mr Farage on its website praising her ability to ‘resolve issues which may arise.’ She repaid the compliment by lavishing praise on Mr Farage on the company’s Facebook page for his ability to use social media to engage with new audiences. Miss Fuller resumed working for Mr Farage last year and soon afterwards they were spotted going for a curry together close to her flat in Muswell Hill, North London. She was thrown into the spotlight when Mr Bloom was surrounded by journalists after calling a room of women at the party’s conference ‘sluts’. Miss Fuller tried to defend the comment to reporters, saying: ‘I think people don’t understand the difference between “slut” and “slag”. Do you know what the word “slut” means?’ The daughter of a property developer from Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey, Miss Fuller studied at the £13,000-a-year Sir William Perkins’s school in Chertsey before graduating with a BA in political economics and a Masters in international relations from the University of London. On her YouTube profile, she has also posted footage of pole dancing, saying it’s something she has ‘always wanted to learn.’ She added: ‘It’s a sport that is admittedly erotic, but really celebrates talent and dedication and the art of the female body, and a skill.’ Her company website also offers advice on ‘what to do if a journalist calls’. When the Mail contacted her for comment by phone yesterday, she hung up. She later issued a statement through the Ukip press office strongly criticising Miss Sinclaire, who was born a man before undergoing sex-change surgery in her 20s. Miss Fuller said: ‘It’s a shame that as a woman I am considered fair game for accusations of alleged affairs. It’s hard enough being a woman in politics without having to justify why I am employed. ‘It is safe to say that this would not have happened if I was a man. Surely this is something that Nikki Sinclaire should have considered.’ Miss Fuller’s mother, Marylyn, refused to come to the door of  her semi-detached home in  Sunbury-on-Thames yesterday. But her uncle Anthony Fuller, who also lives in the commuter town, branded the allegations ‘ridiculous’. He added: ‘What difference would it make if they had had an affair?’ Mr Farage told the Mail: ‘Every single national newspaper has asked me that question since 2006 and the answer remains the same. ‘It’s not true. It is absolute nonsense. It’s just a malicious attempt to do damage.’ Miss Sinclaire was a member of Ukip but left after a row with Mr Farage.","Ukip leader challenged in the European Parliament by MEP Nikki Sinclaire .

"He is one of Britain’s wealthiest hedge fund tycoons, with a fortune of hundreds of millions of pounds. But Sir Christopher Hohn’s lifestyle is far more ‘Swatch’ watch than ‘jet-set’, according to a High Court judge. He was speaking at the outset of what could be Britain’s first billion-pound divorce case. Split: Jamie Cooper Hohn (left) believes her former husband Sir Christopher Hohn (right) is richer than he claims and is not being generous with his settlement . Sir Christopher sat just feet away . from his estranged American-born wife, Jamie Cooper-Hohn, as the couple . began their legal fight over the size of her financial settlement. Mrs . Cooper-Hohn, 49, claims their joint assets were about £849million and . her husband is worth at least a further £872million from personal assets . in his hedge fund – The Children’s Investment Fund group of companies – . making a combined wealth of £1.72billion. Acrimonious: Mrs Cooper-Hohn believes she is entitled to half of her husband's wealth . But . Sir Christopher, knighted last month in the Queen’s Birthday Honours, . claims he is worth a mere £67million and that much of his wealth was . built up after they separated. The 47-year-old ‘non-dom’ says therefore . his wife is entitled to only a quarter of his wealth. Mrs Cooper-Hohn . wants half. Last month she . failed in a Court of Appeal bid to have expert evidence of Sir . Christopher’s assets submitted in the settlement case. The couple . separated in December 2012 and divorced in April 2013 but the decree . nisi has never been made absolute. Yesterday the High Court heard that . despite the tycoon’s incredible ability to make money on the financial . markets the couple lived ‘modest lives’. Martin Pointer, QC, for Mrs Cooper-Hohn, said: ‘Both are from modest backgrounds, neither brought any assets into the marriage.’ He added: They have led relatively modest lives. They have not led a jet-set lifestyle.’ Referring to Sir Christopher’s image of frugality Mrs Justice Roberts added: ‘It was more of a Swatch [watch] lifestyle.’ Despite . this reputation Sir Christopher has ‘spent his whole life making money’ earning up to £24.2million a year, Martin Pointer QC told the court. ‘He has generated wealth of £3.45billion.’ Difference: Sir Chris puts a value of only £67million on the company’s net assets. But his wife claims his shares are worth more than £872million, and their combined fortune is £1.72billion . The . son of a Jamaican immigrant to Britain, Sir Christopher grew up in . Surrey and is known for his simple lifestyle. He reportedly lives in a . rented house, drives a Toyota Prius and wears a black Swatch watch he . has had for years. The couple met as students at Harvard University and . married in 1985. They have four children – triplets aged 12 and an older . child aged 15. They have homes in London, the US and the West Indies. But yesterday the court heard Mrs Cooper-Hohn and the children live in rented accommodation. Sir . Christopher has also become one of the UK’s leading philanthropists . after giving more than £1billion to charity through the Children’s . Investment Fund Foundation, which is linked to his hedge fund. And it is as chairman of the CIFF that Mrs Cooper-Hohn claims she contributed to the couple’s combined wealth.

"It was a project almost 12 months in the making - a 72-foot wooden sculpture of two people lovingly looking into each other, built across studios in Vancouver and Portland. Called Embrace, the plywood installation was supposed to be a place to reflect and contemplate life and love. And, like countless other pieces of art to feature at Burning Man, it was reduced to nothing but dust and ash on Thursday night. The remote week-long rave in the Nevada desert - often described as 'where Mad Max meets Woodstock' - culminates each year with many of the statement artworks going up in flames, in a symbol of catharsis, reflection and new beginnings. 'In short, Embrace is about asking people to consider why death is so challenging and why it’s also so beautiful,' lead artist Matt Schultz said. Tragically death was an all-too-real element of this year's festival. Scroll down for video .

Art gallery manager Alicia Louise Cipicchio, 29, was killed after being hit by a party bus near Center Camp early on Thursday. The bus was transporting passengers around the festival when the accident happened a little after midnight. It is not known whether the Wyoming . woman was walking at the time or whether she fell off and then underneath . the bus, which had people dancing on the top deck at the time of the accident. Later in the day, thousands of the almost 70,000-strong crowd gathered at Embrace to watch as the first of this year's sculptures was burned, taking a moment to remember Cipicchio. Schultz said the design of the piece was supposed to be hopeful. 'It’s not all about sorrow. It’s also about appreciating the relationships in your life,' he said. 'I want people to think about people they miss. But I don’t want people to miss out on those moments you share with the ones who are still here. Say “I love you.” 'Enjoy that moment now.' This year's festival has already been dogged by moments of controversy. Black Rock Desert was doused in rain in the lead up to the gate's opening on August 25, forcing organizers to turn people away until the grounds had dried and the proper festival infrastructure could be put back together. Next, hardcore 'Burners' complained the essence of what the festival represented - a society without currency built on sharing and freedom - had been ruined by an influx of tech billionaires that brought with them a five star experience, complete with luxury RV's, top shelf liquor and even bodyguards.

It's now a nonprofit organization committed to leaving no trace of its participants in between each year's event. Because the event is far from cities of any size — the nearest town 16 miles away is Gerlach, Nev., population 200, but about 90 minutes away because of the roads — medical care beyond what volunteer doctors and health-care workers provide can be tough to get quickly.

The website bbcwatch.org highlighted the error and wrote: 'Up to now, it may have been possible to put down Jon Donnison’s frequently problematic reporting to a lack of knowledge and understanding of the region. 'However, his decision to promote deliberate misinformation – either knowingly or as a result of a complete failure to check facts – indicates that he is not merely naive. 'Donnison has rendered himself no longer fit for the purpose of accurate and impartial reporting from the Middle East in accordance with the BBC’s legal obligations.' Retraction: Donnison apologised for the mistake by tweeting this message . Donnison apologised for the gaffe, . tweeting: 'A photo I retweeted from another journo showing children . injured was not in Gaza as I said but apparently from Syria. Apologies.' A BBC News spokesperson . said: 'Jon Donnison retweeted the photograph in good faith. He issued a . correction and apologised as soon as he learned that the picture was not . from Gaza.' This is the latest in a string of embarrassing incidents for the BBC, in which the most high-profile has been the Lord McAlpine Newsnight scandal. But Chris Doyle, director of the Council for . Arab-British understanding, replied to the apology by saying that it . was also good to highlight the distress caused in Syria by the . conflict. Devastation: Palestinian children stand in the rubble left after an Israeli strike on a house in Gaza City on Tuesday . Violence continued in the region with six men accused of being 'Israeli spies' dragged through the streets of Gaza City and executed before a chanting mob. Witnesses said the six were taken to an intersection in the north of the city where they were summarily shot for providing intelligence that helped Israel pinpoint key figures in Hamas and the Islamic Jihad targeted by their warplanes. The names of the men are said to have been scrawled on the road after they had been questioned by Hamas security officials about who provided the 'human intelligence' necessary to pinpoint targets for 'precision' attacks that have 118 Palestinians - half civilians, including women and children, dead - in seven days of military operations.

"A child sex killer has been released back on to the streets despite remaining a serious danger to children. Robert Oliver, 59, was a key member of a notorious gang of paedophiles known as the 'dirty dozen' that has been linked to the deaths of nine boys. But he has been happily mingling with families and children near his bail hostel in Guildford after serving less than 12 months of a three-year sentence for grooming young boys. Robert Oliver walks near young families in Guildford, Surrey. We have concealed their identities . Oliver was jailed last July for breaching supposedly strict conditions designed  to keep vulnerable youngsters out of  his clutches. They had been imposed after he served time for his part in the killing of 14-year-old Jason Swift. Families had unwittingly befriended the paedophile and let their children visit his bungalow in Maidstone, Kent. He gave one boy a birthday card and allowed another to use his toilet. But one of their fathers became suspicious and called in police after discovering Oliver's history on the internet. Oliver admitted breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order and was jailed for three years. Now, after less than a year, he has already been granted his freedom and his appearance on the streets of the Surrey town has sparked uproar among worried families. His bail hostel is just 500 yards from a primary school. Roaming the streets: Robert Oliver, 58, has been moved to a bail hostel in Guildford, Surrey, which is just 500 yards from a primary school . Last night Sara Payne, mother of murdered . Sarah who has campaigned for access to information about the location . of paedophiles, said: 'Whose family will this man hurt next? 'Something is wrong with a British 'justice' system that cannot protect children from sex killers. What more do evil people have to do to prove that they are a danger to the public? 'Using our children as tethered lambs for these monsters to exercise their vile inhuman rights is just wrong.' Oliver was originally jailed for 15 years for his part in the 1985 killing of paperboy Jason. The teenager was subjected to a horrific 15-minute gang sex attack, instigated by Sidney Cooke, before being  tortured and killed. His body was discovered in a shallow grave by a dog walker. Cooke, 87, remains in prison, where he is serving two life sentences. Oliver was released in 1997, after serving just ten years for manslaughter. He spent several years keeping a low profile, often wearing disguises, as well as changing his name, in a bid to avoid being identified. But residents drove him out of homes in London, Swindon, Manchester and Milton Keynes after learning who he was. One householder near the Guildford hostel said: 'What are the chances of him attacking a child in this town? 'I've got a young daughter and my wife is scared stiff that he might harm her.' A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice declined to comment on his case. But she said sex offenders on licence are subject to strict conditions and can be recalled  to prison if they fail to comply with them. Last night Whitehall sources said it appeared Oliver was freed after just 11 months because that was the normal release point of half his three-year sentence minus time spent on remand. Oliver was caught reoffending last year by the father of a child he invited into his home. Convicted: Oliver, pictured leaving prison in 1997, was jailed in 1985 for the death of 14-year-old Jason Swift . Families . living on the same street in Maidstone, Kent, had unwittingly . befriended the paedophile and let their children visit the bungalow he . shared with his male partner. But one father became suspicious and after searching online he discovered Oliver's history. Kent Police were called and he was arrested on June 7, 2013, for breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order imposed three years ago. He pleaded guilty to two breaches of the order and was jailed for three years. On one occasion Oliver gave a birthday card to a child, while another time he allowed a boy whose mother was visiting him to use the toilet in his bungalow.","Paedophile Robert Oliver, 58, moved to bail hostel in Guildford, Surrey .

"An Australian woman has miraculously given birth to conjoined twins with one body and two heads despite doctors initially telling them to terminate the pregnancy. Renee Young and her partner Simon Howie, of Tregear in Sydney's west, welcomed their daughters on Thursday six weeks before they were due. The couple, who found out via an ultrasound that the twins they were expecting was in fact one child with two symmetrical faces and two brains connected by the one brain stem, said doctors were shocked by the girls' exceptional progress. Scroll down for video . Two girls in one body: Renee Young with her daughters Faith and Hope who were born in a Sydney hospital on May 8 . Faith and Hope were born with a rare condition called diprosopus, which means they share the same body and organs but have separate brains and two faces . Proud mother: Faith and Hope are now in a stable condition and breathing without support, after initial doubts . 'They are breathing perfectly on their own and feeding,' Mr Howie told Woman's Day. Ms Young gave birth to the girls, named Faith and Hope, via an emergency caesarean at Blacktown Hospital last Thursday. The girls were born with a rare condition called diprosopus, which means they share the same body and vital organs but have their own faces and brains which are connected by only one brain stem. 'Even though there is only one body, we call them our twins. To us, they are our girls and we love them,' Mr Howie said. They were transferred to the Children's Hospital at Westmead shortly after they were born. 'We have no idea how long they will be in hospital. We just want to bring them home, happy and healthy to make our family a little bit bigger and a bit more chaotic,' Mr Howie said. Hope and Faith's have their own brains which are connected by only one brain stem . 'I think they're beautiful and Simon thinks they're beautiful so really that's all that matters,' their mother said. As the parents of seven other children, Renee and her husband Simon Howie never considered terminating while the girls grew healthy . The condition is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none have survived. Due to the incredibly complex nature of their condition, doctors are so unsure about what to expect from the twin’s condition that they are being forced to make their prognoses day by day. Mr Howie confirmed that specialists are being called in to decipher a range of problems and assess the twins in great depth, from the functioning of their lungs and blood vessels to decisions about how best to proceed with feeding. But despite all the forewarned medial problems likely to come their way, Ms Young and Mr Howie are just happy their girls are alive and well. 'I think they're beautiful and Simon thinks they're beautiful so really that's all that matters,' Ms Young told A Current Affair. Mr Howie said: 'I sort of don't believe in terminating the baby if it's healthy and growing fine and everything is going to plan' Their mother Renee gave birth to the girls via an emergency caesarean . Their condition is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none have survived . From as early as 28 weeks into Ms Young’s pregnancy, specialists were concerned about grave developmental issues. One of the biggest predicted survival risks from their doctor Greg Kesby, was that the babies would be unable to breathe on their own. The couple, who are parents to seven other children, were also told early on in the pregnancy not to keep the child ‘because it would be looked upon by the public as a freak’. They defied the doctors because Ms Young had never terminated a pregnancy and because they had a family 'that gives us a lot of support'. At first, things certainly looked to be taking a turn for the worst as Ms Young unexpectedly went into labour at only 32 weeks last Thursday, and was forced to have an emergency caesarean. The couple refused to terminate their unborn twins despite being warned by doctors of the medical and social problems the girls were likely to suffer . Channel 9 were given the honour of choosing the middle names of the newborns, picking Daisy for Faith and Alice for Hope . The twin girls were not breathing in the first few moments after their birth, leaving their parents in a state of great anxiety . But despite problems from the first moments of their birth, in which Faith and Hope were not heard to be breathing despite having a clear singular heartbeat, the girls have now defied all odds and are currently in a stable state and breathing without any assistance. Although the couple were aware from the early stages of pregnancy that their children would have great developmental problems, they explained that while the girls continued to grow healthily, they couldn’t come to terms with letting their unborn twins go. 'We sort of looked at it as; it'd be the same as being a child with autism or Down syndrome. I sort of don't believe in terminating the baby if it's healthy and growing fine and everything is going to plan,' Mr Howie said. The proud parents of the small survivors have braced themselves for a difficult path ahead and refuse to say goodbye prematurely. 'I would say, if I only get two days with the baby, I only get two days with the baby - at least I have some time with it,' Ms Young said.

"Convicted fraudster  Neelam Desai admitted a travel agency racket which police believe has claimed 'hundreds' of victims . She is a convicted fraudster suspected of fleecing hundreds out of their life savings in an elaborate series of holiday and dating scams. So when victims of Neelam Desai contacted journalist Gareth Davies to say she was at it again, he started his own investigation – in the hope that police would follow suit. Instead, it was he who got a visit from three uniformed officers – who then served him with a harassment notice for the apparent crime of approaching the swindler for a comment. Yesterday Scotland Yard was accused of trampling on press freedom after local newspaper chief reporter Mr Davies was warned he faced arrest even for writing stories about Desai. In an unprecedented step, the chilling ‘prevention of harassment’ notice warns that any attempt to talk to, or approach the conwoman could constitute harassment. Mr Davies even risks prosecution if he attends Croydon Crown Court to report on her sentencing for fraud later this month. Senior Tory MP Rob Wilson last night called it an ‘outrageous and heavy-handed’ attempt to hound journalists for doing their job to expose criminals. ‘This is a chilling reminder of what can go wrong if the environment for journalists swings too far in the wrong direction,’ he said. ‘The police have got this badly wrong and need to think very carefully about their actions. The public will take a very dim view of them protecting the right of a fraudster ahead of protecting the public.’ Earlier this month Desai, 33, admitted a travel agency racket which police believe has claimed ‘hundreds’ of victims. While bankrupt, she ran a travel business in the name of Nisha Patel peddling fake holidays – and wrote out bogus cheques of £220,000 from a cloned bank account when customers demanded money back. Earlier this month she pleaded guilty at Croydon Crown Court to a string of offences including fraud, running a business while bankrupt, handling stolen goods and selling bogus iPhones. But after the case, the Croydon Advertiser was contacted by a number of victims who said they had been swindled while she was on bail. When victims of Desai contacted journalist Gareth Davies to say she was at it again, he started his own investigation - in the hope that police would follow suit.  Instead, it was he who got a visit from three uniformed officers - who then served him with a harassment notice . Desai allegedly set up a fake profile . on an Asian marriage website using the photograph of an attractive . marketing manager she stole from Facebook to lure men. One . 35-year-old from Leicester claims he lost his business and turned . suicidal after being conned out of £35,500 after Desai demanded he pay . for them to go on lavish holidays through her travel agency. Another victim contacted the newspaper saying he too had been scammed by a woman into paying £4,000 for bogus iPhones and iPads to raise money for homeless children. But when the Croydon Advertiser approached Desai at her home in Selhurst, South London to put the allegations to her, she called the police. Days later, she claimed Mr Davies had grabbed her, before hastily retracting the allegations. Mr Davies also tried emailing Desai twice – and was then shocked when he got a call at work summoning him to a local police station. Three officers then visited the paper’s office in Redhill to hand Mr Davies a ‘Prevention of Harassment Letter’ which said Desai felt ‘intimidated and persecuted’ by his ‘unsolicited contacts’. Mr Davies said he was told that being a journalist ‘doesn’t give you special privileges’ and that just ‘doing a job’ is what killed off the News of the World. He added: ‘The ridiculous thing is that a number of her victims haven’t been able to speak to a police officer for love nor money. But I send her a couple of emails and I have three policeman at the door.’ Kirsty Hughes, of Index on Censorship said: ‘The police need to show that they fully respect the role and responsibilities of a free media.’ A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the letter was issued by a ‘local safer neighbourhood team’, adding: ‘The officers did this to ensure that the reporter was fully aware that allegations of harassment were being made against him.’ Yesterday Desai immediately called the police when the Daily Mail politely asked her for a comment.","Journalist Gareth Davies tried to contact convicted fraudster Neelam Desai .

"Anti-GM campaigners reacted with fury last night after the Government backed an EU vote that could lead to weedkiller-resistant maize being sowed in England next year. Other European countries can ban the so-called Frankenstein food after EU ministers said members could opt out of GM planting. Critics said England’s first commercial GM crops would spell disaster for wildlife and contaminate conventional and organic crops, with ‘catastrophic’ consequences for farmers. The Government position is also at odds with those of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, which have opted for a ban. Controversial: The government has backed an EU vote which could see weedkiller-resistant maize being sowed in England next year. Critics say it could spell disaster for wildlife and other crops . The EU vote allowing the planting of two types of maize resistant to the weedkiller Roundup was passed by agriculture ministers in Luxembourg, although the European Parliament must approve it. Dr Helen Wallace, of the campaign group GeneWatch UK, said: ‘The Government has colluded with commercial lobbyists to fast track Roundup Ready GM maize into England, despite the expected harm to British wildlife such as birds and butterflies caused by blanket spraying of these crops. ‘If some farmers in England press ahead with GM cultivation, conventional and organic farmers across the country will face the unnecessary risk of loss of markets due to contamination with GM.’ The Government’s pro-GM stance also flies in the face of public opinion, with most consumers saying they are concerned about the impact of the crops on the countryside, wildlife and their health. The approval of commercial GM planting has been stalled for ten years because the EU needed all member states to vote for it. Owen Paterson has been pressing for regulations that allow individual member states to plant GM crops once Brussels has approved them . Environment Secretary Owen Paterson – the Government’s cheerleader for genetically-modified crops – has been pressing for regulations that allow individual member states to plant them once they have been declared safe by Brussels. He said the EU decision will fast-track them into farms and supermarkets, adding: ‘This is a real step forward in unblocking the dysfunctional EU process for approving GM crops, which is letting down farmers and stopping scientific development. ‘Farmers will have more power in deciding whether to grow GM crops that have passed a robust, independent safety assessment.’ But Peter Melchett, of organic industry body the Soil Association, said: ‘In future, a committed, pro-GM Secretary of State like Owen Paterson could take the decision to make England a “GM country”, and once that is taken it will be difficult for a future Government to adopt a different position. This will lead to farmers losing export markets to the rest of Europe and most of the rest of the world, which would be catastrophic.’ The EU vote is a victory for multi-national biotech firms, which have spent millions lobbying British ministers and officials to speed up the approval of GM crops. The Government claims there is no risk to humans or the environment. But European and US research suggests there are health concerns and a threat to wildlife, and warns of the damage from ‘superweeds’ that develop a natural resistance to the pesticides used on GM crops. Liz O’Neill, director of GM Freeze, said: ‘Even if a country or region does establish a ban, they will find it very difficult to protect their fields and food from contamination if neighbours start growing GM.’ However, the Government said safeguards would be put in place to protect conventional crops from  GM contamination. The vote by EU ministers is the culmination of a campaign by the biotech industry and the Government to fast-track the approval of GM crops. The collaboration began with a Westminster summit in summer 2012, attended by agriculture ministers and science minister David Willetts. Organised by the Agricultural Biotechnology Council, which is funded and run by GM firms, it agreed that the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs would lobby the EU to allow the planting of biotech crops in Britain, even if they were banned in other member states. Agriculture Secretary Owen Paterson and fellow ministers spent months persuading their EU counterparts to agree. Yesterday they succeeded. They were aided by an ‘independent’ review of GM by British scientists, suggesting the crops could prevent Third World starvation and create plants resistant to disease and pests.. But the Mail found that its five authors were GM supporters, and one was a consultant for biotech firm Syngenta.","EU vote could see weedkiller-resistent maize sown in England next year .

"Riot squads were sent into Calais last night after UK-bound migrants turned the French port into a ‘war zone’. Anarchy broke out when 250 men burst into the town’s docks and tried to board vessels sailing for Dover. One gang of marauders broke through gates and climbed over fences in a  desperate bid to reach a ferry. Scroll down for video . Detained: Witnesses said the crowds attempted to overpower officials and machine-gun wielding police by climbing over fences and running up the main ramp into the ferry's vehicle hold . Brushing off pursuing police officers, . the migrants stopped only when the ship’s crew turned a fire hose on . them and pulled up the car ramps. The . mayor of Calais last night begged David Cameron to come to Calais to . tell the waiting hordes that Britain was ‘no El Dorado’. Natacha . Bouchart said the UK was too soft on migrants. In a day of drama: . Dramatic . film of Wednesday’s storming of the port was posted on YouTube by a . British lorry driver who watched from his cab as up to 100 mainly . Eritrean men ran toward him at full tilt. ‘Looks like loads of immigrants have managed somehow to get into the port,’ says Mark Salt on his video footage. Sirens can be heard blaring and a van appears as Mr Salt says: ‘Police have just turned up to try to rein them all in – but there’s loads of them.’ Shocking: Security staff were forced to turn a fire hose on the crowds as they attempted to overpower officials and run up the main ramp into the ferry's vehicle hold . Run for it: There were two attempts to storm the ferry yesterday - the first by 90 immigrants, who forced their way through a gate and then over a fence before the ferry's crew were able to raise the ramp in time . Brazen: Witnesses said the immigrants were not intimidated by police with machine guns guarding the entrance to the ferry, casually running past them as they attempted to force their way on board . Footage has also emerged which is believed to show migrants trying to board a lorry headed for Calais . The mob jump over a wall to escape pursuing police and stream past more officers to head for the Berlioz, a MyFerryLink vessel, where they are finally stopped. Another lorry driver Lee Croson told ITV: ‘It’s more like a war zone than it used to be. If you get into Calais or park anywhere in Calais you can be 99 per cent sure you will get the immigrants in your trailer.’ He said many drivers are threatened at knifepoint. Anywhere within three hours drive of the port is considered a risk, he added, saying he had not known a worse situation in 20 years. If a trucker is caught with migrants in his vehicle it is the driver, not the company, who is liable for a £2,000 fine. The chaotic scenes recall the early 2000s when migrants repeatedly tried to storm the entrance to the Channel Tunnel. Jean-Marc Puissesseau, of the Calais Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which runs the port, said: ‘The situation is unacceptable, the port is under siege. ‘I demand that the forces of law and order have a permanent presence at the port as quickly as possible. Mass: The incident took place yesterday afternoon, with P&O Ferries confirming that a 'huge intrusion' Sprint: A second attempt involving 150 individuals took place a short time later, with police able to block their path and detain them - again before they made it up the ferry's ramp (pictured in background) ‘It is out of order what is going on. If it is not sorted out we must close the port.’ The crisis comes in the week that thousands of Britons are returning from holidays on the Continent, causing congestion on roads around Calais. The slow traffic will help migrants determined to board UK-bound lorries which are forced to slow. Despite the extra police drafted in, hundreds of migrants at the sprawling camp close to the port vowed to continue their bid to reach Britain. An estimated three million freight lorries, two million cars and 12million passengers pass through Calais to Dover every year. Witness: Ferry passenger John Bailey said: 'The migrants were escorted back down the ramp by the police and led out of the port, shouting at some people in the vehicle queue' Lorry drivers and car passengers look on as the immigrants attempt to force their way on to the ferry . A MyFerryLink spokesman said: ‘Several . migrants entered the port and attempted to board Berlioz. The crew took . immediate action to ensure the ship’s security and the attempt was . unsuccessful.’ The captain of a P&O ferry, Spirit of Britain, coming into Calais saw what was happening and held back from docking. Fed up: Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart said she would block the port if it was legal to do so . A P&O spokesman said last night: ‘We approached the port and witnessed all the migrants. ‘Our crew remained just in the inner harbour and didn’t tie up until we were able to do so.’ Police said all the migrants were rounded up, before being returned to the other side of security fences. Passengers had earlier told of seeing a large crowd of migrants on the main access to the port road being guarded by French police, some armed with sub-machine guns, before they burst in around 4.15pm. ‘This was clearly no deterrent as they obviously ran past them into the port, which must have been a distance of about a mile,’ said one witness. A Border Force spokesman in the UK said: ‘The incident was quickly brought under control and the French police apprehended all those involved. ‘All freight vehicles inside the port at the time have been rescreened by Border Force.’ In April the Daily Mail reported how four migrants were killed in one week trying to get aboard UK-bound trucks. P&O spokesman Chris Lamming told the Daily Mail: ‘The migrants are clearly desperate and will try anything to get on board a ferry.’ More French police have been drafted in by the authorities. Sudanese refugees relax in Calais.

"A plan to open a new ‘Sangatte-style’ camp in Calais for UK-bound migrants was rejected by the French government last night, but ‘welcome centres’ offering advice on claiming asylum in Britain may soon go ahead. Interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve ignored the pleas of Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart for a hostel for those determined to get to the UK as a solution to the immigration crisis blighting the port. Mme Bouchart blames Britain’s generous welfare and asylum systems for attracting a stream of migrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East which have brought havoc to the streets of Calais. M Cazeneuve dismissed the call for a base for the migrants – likened to the notorious Red Cross camp at Sangatte used by thousands as a launch pad to Britain before it was closed in 2002 . Authorities are struggling to maintain order with up to 2,000 UK-bound migrants living in makeshift camps and squats around the town. Armed gangs fight for control of the best vantage point from which to break into trucks boarding ferries to Dover – on Saturday alone police found 300 stowaways hidden in lorries. But M Cazeneuve dismissed the call for a base for the migrants – likened to the notorious Red Cross camp at Sangatte used by thousands as a launch pad to Britain before it was closed in 2002 – even before a meeting with Mme Bouchart in Paris began.

"GM foods are banned from restaurants in the Houses of Parliament despite government claims it is ‘probably safer’ than other meals. Government ministers are demanding that ordinary families should abandon their reluctance to eat genetically modified food, however they are banned from MPs’ plates. This week the food and farming secretary, Owen Paterson, launched an extraordinary propaganda campaign to encourage the nation to accept GM crops and farming. Menu: Genetically modified food is banned in the Houses of Parliament, despite ministers insisting it is safe . He bolstered his campaign with claims that some seven million children in the Far East could have been saved from blindness or  death in the last 15 years if only people had opened the door to a new form of GM ‘Golden Rice’. However, his efforts were unravelling today amid evidence that GM food is banned from the dinner tables of MPs, while his claims for the GM rice proved to be bogus. The House of Commons Catering service today confirmed that the ban on GM ingredients which dates back to 1998 remains in place as a matter of ‘customer choice’. It said: ‘In line with its procurement policy, the House of Commons Catering Service avoids, wherever identifiable, the procurement of foods that contain genetically modified organisms. Speech: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson this week urged Brits to eat GM . ‘To this end, as part of the tendering process, food suppliers are required to work to a strict GM organisms policy and give assurances that goods supplied be free from genetically modified materials.’ It added: ‘The decision to avoid GMs is seen as largely a matter of customer choice.’ Mr Paterson has set himself up as the chief cheerleader for so-called Frankenstein Foods, however it appears that he has been unable to convince fellow MPs to accept them in their restaurants. As a result, the minister and fellow MPs leave themselves open to accusations of hypocrisy and complaints that they are telling people to ‘do as I say, not as I do’. Speaking earlier this week, Mr Paterson said: ‘The use of more precise technology and greater regulatory scrutiny probably makes GM organisms even safer than conventional plants and food. ‘There is no substantiated case of any adverse impact on human health…An enormous amount of material has been eaten, not a single case has been brought to my attention.’ Mr Paterson’s most powerful argument for accepting GM was the development of Golden Rice, which has been genetically modified to boost levels of beta carotene and Vitamin A, which can protect eyesight. In an extraordinary statement, he said: ‘Over the last 15 years, despite offering the seeds for free to those who would need them, every attempt to deploy this golden rice has been thwarted. ‘In that time seven million children have gone blind or died.’ Restaurant: MPs, staff, officials and journalists can dine in several restaurants including in Portcullis House, across the road from the main Parliament building . It emerged today that these seeds have not been offered free to communities in the Far East who might need them because they have not yet been through a safety checking and approval system. Neither have any tests been carried out to establish whether they contain sufficient nutrients to make any difference to the eyesight of children, let alone save millions of lives. Golden Rice has not been available to farmers and consumers for the past 15 years and is only now going through crop growing trials in the Philippines. If these prove successful, the rice will be sold for profit just like any other agricultural commodity and will not be given away free. The International Rice Research Institute has issued a statement which makes clear that Mr Paterson’s claims that Golden Rice could have prevented millions of youngsters from going blind or dying over the past 15 years are also bogus. This states that: ‘It has not yet been determined whether daily consumption of Golden Rice does improve the vitamin A status of people who are vitamin A deficient and could therefore reduce related conditions such as night blindness.’ Al fresco: Food is also served in the pavilion buffet, a tented restaurant for MPs on the terrace at the House of Commons . It said tests will be needed to establish whether the rice would be useful, but this process could take another two years. The Channel 4 News FactCheck blog concluded: ‘Mr Paterson has been misleading on a number of counts. ‘There haven’t been attempts to give golden rice out for free. The leading exponent of it says it will cost ‘about the same’ as ordinary rice. ‘To then claim that seven million children have gone blind or died as a result of such attempts being thwarted doesn’t follow either. The numbers are a large and inaccurate extrapolation.’ A spokesman for Mr Paterson’s department, DEFRA, said: ‘We have only just started the discussion on the potential benefits of using GM products here in the UK. 'Other governments wouldn’t licence these technologies if they didn’t recognise the economic, environmental and public benefits.’","Genetically modified food banned from Houses of Parliament .

"A woman in Perth has employed a unique tactic to sell her used car, claiming that it would be suited to a feminist' and that it comes with a recommendation for a 'Ryan Gosling-style mechanic'. Perth-based lecturer in gender studies Chantal Bourgault posted an advertisement on community classifieds website for her 2005 Holden Viva, and after receiving no interest, decided to amp up her marketing strategy. 'I just put a regular boring ad on Gumtree, and didn't get any responses and so I thought that I may as well try something different,' Ms Bourgault told Daily Mail Australia. Perth-based lecturer Chantal Bourgault posted an advertisement on community classifieds website for her 2005 Holden Viva . Ms Bourgault recommends a mechanic called Kevin, who is 'gorgeous' and Ryan Gosling-esque in philosophy . Ms Bourgault decided to amp up her marketing strategy after initially advertising the car with no interest . She said it was just 'how she thought, so it came easy', and enjoyed writing the ad as she was unwell earlier in the week. 'I have lots of like-minded friends, and I posted it on Facebook and many of them shared it. It's now outgrown me,' Ms Bourgault said. Advising that the car 'would suit [a] feminist', Ms Bourgault highlights several features of the car which would empower men or women interested in gender equality. Ms Bourgault says in the ad that she bought the car, which shows 'demonstrable continuity, so no need to worry excessively about generations, waves, or postfeminism'. She explains that the car has done 150,000 kilometers and has a new timing belt which means that 'there is sufficient mileage here to support a realistic appraisal of the status of women, but still plenty in reserve to 'keep going', as Thelma once said to Louise.'

Ms Bourgault says in the ad that she bought the car, which shows 'demonstrable continuity, so no need to worry excessively about generations, waves, or postfeminism' Her recommended mechanic Kevin won't patronize women who employ his services, or 'mansplain', a term meaning men who offer opinions on topics they know little about. 'Manual controls and power steering are also beneficial for the modern feminist driver, as the features would allow the prospective buyer to 'empower [themselves] by retaining full control over [their] decisions on the road to equality', and would ensure they could 'rise above essentialist arguments about women's physical limitations.' It would come as a given that Ms Bourgault would have a special interest in feminism, given that she is a lecturer in gender studies and English. 'I guess I know that world well, and so was able to write to it. It's a really hard market at the moment, and I do really want to sell it,' she said.

Her recommended mechanic Kevin, who she says is 'gorgeous' and brimming with Ryan Gosling philosophies, won't patronize women who employ his services, or 'mansplain'. 'It’s a popular culture feminist word used to describe the experience of having a man explain something  to you that you already know, or even know more about than him,' Ms Bourgault explained. 'It can also mean that a man offers an opinion on something he doesn’t know much about,' she said. 'A lot of the time they are just responding to societal expectations, but it can be problematic in workplaces, as cultural habits can often silence women and perpetuate bad patterns.' Her mechanic is also close to the University of Western Australia, so prospective buyers of the car 'can read Judith Butler in the library while he works'. Ms Bourgault said that Jamie was always very sensible and straight-talking, spoke to her like an equal, and was just a very good mechanic. She said that one of the reasons she wrote the ad using feminist rhetoric was because she was aware that feminists were often depicted as humourless. 'I always try to retain my sense of humour when I engage in feminist theory,' she said. 'One of the nice things about the ad was that I was setting the agenda for the conversation. It wasn't 'oh, is feminism dead?' In explaining why she was selling her car, Ms Bourgault ends her ad with a nod to feminism in pop culture, poking fun at her satirically whimsical and well-worded classified. 'In the context of Time magazine's campaign to make feminism defunct, I have decided to upgrade to the newer and more powerful HeForShe model as endorsed by Hermione,' she quips. Ms Bourgault said that 'mansplaining' is 'built on social and cultural expectations of men that they are the authority and show expertise. I'm sure for many men it probably comes as a burden' 'In the context of Time magazine's campaign to make feminism defunct, I have decided to upgrade to the newer and more powerful HeForShe model as endorsed by Hermione,' Ms Bourgault quipped .","Perth based gender studies lecturer advertised her car on Gumtree as ideally suited to a feminist .

"Cecilia Munoz, Director of the White House's Domestic Policy Council, oversaw the drafting of the Senate's immigration bill. Her former employer, the National Council of La Raza, stands to reap a windfall as a result . A former senior policy analyst at the National Council of La Raza supervised the drafting of a U.S. Senate bill, passed on June 27, that would give an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants a path to citizenship if the House of Representatives goes along. And La Raza figures to enlarge its budget significantly, thanks to slush funds buried deep in the legislation. A bombshell report published Thursday by Investor's Business Daily shows that the immigration reform bill would set aside hundreds of millions of dollars for La Raza and other liberal immigrants' rights groups, which the federal government would contract to assist future U.S. citizens with applications and offer them legal advice. In a separate little-noticed section of the legislation, senators propose to rewrite the laws against counterfeiting passports and the materials used to obtain them. Those new laws would set a legal threshold of 10 phony passports before a fraudster could be prosecuted for buying, selling or using counterfeit materials used to produce such fake documents. Another section would exclude serial drunk-drivers from gaining a path to citizenship, but only after they rack up a third DUI offense. The report came from the American Media Institute (AMI), an investigative journalism service. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Munoz (top left) was present on May 21 when President Obama met in the Oval Office with a group of students who have already received Deferred Action and can't be deported, under an executive order Obama issued in 2012 . La Raza and MALDEF had a hand in organizing pro-immigration-reform rallies like this one at the U.S. Capitol, and now might reap a financial benefit if legislation reaches President Obama's desk . 'An alien convicted of 3 or more offenses for driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated on separate dates is inadmissible' to the United States on a legal basis, the bill's text reads. But '[t]wo prior convictions for this offense,' the AMI reported, 'would not disqualify an immigrant for legalization.' And of the language that applies to 'selling or forging materials used in making passports,' the organization adds, 'the bill says 10 such instances are verboten, [but] that nine won't be a problem.' The slush fund language, however, 'may be the real point of the legislation,' AMI contends. 'This seems likely since the bill was steered through the Senate by the Obama White House. Overseeing a team of executive branch bill-drafters ensconced in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, guiding the legislative process, was Obama director of domestic policy Cecilia Munoz, the leading presidential staffer on immigration issues. Before joining the Obama administration, Munoz was La Raza's top policy analyst. La Raza did not return a phone call on Thursday seeking comment. Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain said on Thursday that his immigration bill doesn't permit any passport counterfeiting, although the legislation's text says otherwise . Obama (L) has had his hands full trying to persuade House Republicans to endorse the Senate bill, while White House spokesman Jay Carney (R) fends off reporters' questions about its chances for survival . AMI calculated that several different pots of taxpayer dollars set aside for immigrants' rights groups, all on the political left, 'would total almost $300 million over three years and grow over time.' Those include a $50 million set-aside for grants to organizations that will advertise benefits available to illegal immigrants, and to help them fill out paperwork. Another $100 million, over the first five years, would be distributed to groups that can set up 'New Immigrant Councils' to help formerly illegal immigrants 'integrate' into communities in which they may already have lived for years. After five years, that amount is at the discretion of the Office of Citizenship and New Americans, a division of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. $120 million more would be spent over three years to mount a campaign educating newly legalized immigrants about 'employer and employee rights, responsibilities and [legal] remedies' available under the new law. Again, the federal government would 'contract with public and private organizations' to execute the campaign. Those groups likely will include La Raza and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), says AMI. La Raza will be 'arguably be at the head of the line to receive new funding,' it says. MALDEF told the organization that it would likely qualify for subsidies if the immigration bill becomes law. Cutting corners to get one of these? Don't counterfeit too many if the Senate immigration bill becomes law: Two will do, but the third could make you a jailbird . Illegal-immigrant minors exempted from deportation by the Obama administration, and their parents, took a mock citizenship oath during a July 10 rally on Capitol Hill aimed at pressuring House Republicans . In addition to language allowing counterfeiters to escape prosecution if their phony materials impacted fewer than ten illegal passports, other language in the Senate bill addresses those who actually produce the finished forgeries. A 20 year jail sentence is a possibility, but only for a criminal who 'produces, issues, or transfers ... forges, counterfeits, alters, or falsely makes ... [or] secures, possesses, uses, receives, buys, sells, or distributes 3 or more [fake] passports.' Current federal law prescribes up to 25 . years in federal prison for unauthorized persons who produce or issue . 'any passport' - meaning a single one. But under the Senate proposal, 'three such instances are forbidden, meaning two would be permitted,' the Investor's Business Daily story concluded. Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who supported the bill, told the conservative Cybercast News Service a different story on Thursday. 'I don't think that we stand for any forgeries,' McCain said. La Raza highlighted this stroller-brigade immigration protest on Facebook. In future years, taxpayers could be subsidizing the group to help these immigrants learn how to apply for citizenship benefits . Note: The reporter participates in the AMI's media advisory board.","The National Council of La Raza is likely to benefit from grant money set aside in an immigration bill drafted by its former policy director .
Legislation passed in the Senate would exclude three-time DUI offenders from a path to citizenship, but two-time drunk drivers would be acceptable .
Passport forgers would no longer be prosecuted for making a single fake travel document, with the bar being set at three .

"A baby girl who was born with her heart beating outside of her body has gone home today, after she was given a pink protective shell to protect her vital organ. Audrina Cardenas was born in October with a rare congenital disease called ectopia cordis, where her heart formed outside the chest. The disease affects only one in eight million and nine out of 10 sufferers are stillborn or die within three days. But on Wednesday, the three-and-a-half-month-old defied the odds when she was discharged from Texas Children's Hospital in Houston and taken home by her mother Ashley. Scroll down for videos (WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT) All smiles: Audrina Cardenas was allowed to leave Texas Children's Hospital on Wednesday after being fitted for a plastic casing to protect her heart . Matching: Mum Ashley seems intent on making Audrina a girly girl with her big pink bow and frilly socks to match the color of the casing . So happy: Ashley Cardenas, Audrina's mom, hugs one of the physical therapists as they leave the hospital . The happy youngster left the hospital with a pink external heart shield that she will wear moving forward to protect her heart as she grows. In a few years she will have surgery to place a more permanent protective shield inside her chest wall. It is a relief for Audrina's mother who has had sleepless nights every since she found out about her daughter’s life-threatening condition at a routine check-up when she was 16 weeks pregnant. Ms . Cardenas was given three difficult options – abort the baby, carry her to term knowing she would die, or have doctors to construct a hole in her baby’s chest shortly after birth in an attempt to make room for the heart. She said: 'After my doctors explained just how sick my baby was and what options I had, it didn't matter how scared I was, I knew I had to do anything possible to save my daughter's life.' She was evaluated by Texas Children's Fetal Center a few weeks before she was scheduled for delivery. They gave her an ultrasound, foetal heart scan and foetal MRI and found that a third of the baby's heart was outside her body. On the mend: Ms Cardenas talks to Dr Charles D. Fraser, Jr. about her daughter's protective shield . Miracle: Audrina Cardenas, who suffers from a rare congenital heart condition that caused her to be born with her heart outside of her body is recovering after surgery . Overjoyed: New mother Ashley Cardenas, center, looks at her daughter Audrina after the successful surgery . On October 15, Ms Cardenas gave birth via caesarian section the next day her daughter was whisked away for heart surgery. Dr Larry Hollier, chief of plastic surgery at the hospital, said: 'Once . the cardiac surgeons were finished operating on Audrina, the plastic . surgery team played a pivotal role in completing this surgery as we were . responsible for covering her heart beneath her skin and muscle.' Five weeks later doctors declared the little girl was out of the woods and yesterday she was finally allowed home after they said she was 'doing very well.' But . the infant isn’t in the clear yet – surgeons said that she’ll need more . surgeries in coming years to repair defects in her heart. However, they must wait for Audrina to heal and gain strength before attempting any additional procedures.

"Al-Shabaab has released a graphic video calling for 'Westgate-style' attacks on shopping districts such as Oxford Street in London as well as major shopping centres in the United States and Canada. The threat is being taken seriously by security officials across the Atlantic after the group called on Jihadis living in the west to target major shopping centres in their home cities. During the 76-minute video, which was published on YouTube by Al-Shabaab's media wing, the terrorist, who has a strong English accent, recites a list of potential targets which included London's Oxford Street as well as the Westfield malls in Stratford and White City. Scroll down for video . The terrorist , who has a strong English accent, gave GPS co-ordinates for two London shopping centres . The unnamed terrorist specifically names Oxford Street in London as one of the potential targets . He also threatened the Mall of America in Minnesota, which is the largest shopping centre in the U.S. Donning a camouflage jacket with a headscarf covering his face, the fighter threatens action and refers to the  group's 2013 siege on Kenya's Westgate Mall, in which 62 people died. The terrorist even supplied the GPS co-ordinates for the Westfield shopping centres in Stratford, East London and White City in West London. The video, which lasts 76 minutes, is fronted by a terrorist with an English accent. He said: ‘We call upon our Muslim brothers, particularly those in the West, to answer the call of Allah and target disbelievers wherever they are. ‘If just a handful of mujahedeen fighters can bring Kenya to a complete standstill for nearly a week, imagine what a dedicate mujahed in the West could do to American or Jewish owned shopping centres across the world? ‘What if such an attack on the Mall of America in Minnesota or the West Edmonton mall in Canada or in London’s Oxford Street. Or any of the hundred or so of the Jewish owned Westfield shopping centres. ‘Take the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford or White City for example, what would be the implications of such an attack, one can only imagine. ‘All it takes is a man with firm determination, of which our Muslim ummah (community) has plenty of.’ Finishing his slowly delivered and lengthy speech, he said: ‘So hurry up and hasten to Heaven and do not hesitate. The terrorist, who has an English accent, threatened the Westfield mall in Stratford, pictured and White City . Women clutch young children to their chests as they run to safety during the siege of Westgate mall, Kenya . The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, is specifically targeted. Chillingly, an image of the centre is shown in the corner of the frame, while its GPS co-ordinates are displayed in a white font. Speaking directly to the camera, the unnamed militant says: 'If just a handful of mujahideen fighters could bring Kenya to a complete stand-still for nearly a week, just imagine what the dedicated mujahideen could do in the West to American or Jewish shopping centers across the world.' He adds: 'What if such an attack were to occur in the Mall of America in Minnesota? Or the West Edmonton Mall in Canada? Or in London's Oxford Street?'. Now, the Mall of America is taking 'extra security precautions' in light of the threat. Officials are reportedly working closely with the FBI and America's Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Some of the new security measures will be visible to shoppers, while others will not, a security official told CBS News, adding that employees 'will remain diligent as they would do in any similar situation.' Speaking to Fox News, Jim Kallstrom, the former assistant director of the FBI’s New York office, said the bureau has a 'huge job' in front of them in the wake of the threatening online video. The terrorist specifically mentioned the 2013 attack on Kenya's Westgate Mall, killing more than 60 people . US homeland security chief Jeh Johnson (pictured) warned that 'lone wolf' terrorists were a major threat . 'You look at the Mall of America, you look at all the malls, then you start to backtrack and say it would be nice if we knew what comes and goes into the country,' he said. 'We don’t have a clue.' On Sunday, US homeland security chief Jeh Johnson urged shoppers to be on their guard while visiting the Mall of America - the country's largest shopping center, with 40million visitors a year. 'I would say that if anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they've got to be particularly careful,' Mr Johnson said during an appearance on CNN's 'State of the Union.' 'This latest statement from al-Shebaab reflects the new phase we've evolved to in the global terrorist threat in that you have groups such as al-Shebaab, ISIL [ie. the Islamic State, or ISIS], publicly calling for independent actors in their home lands to carry out attacks. 'We're beyond the phase now where these groups would send foreign operatives into countries after being trained someplace.' More than 60 people died and 200 were injured following the 2013 terror attack claimed by Al-Shabaab . He added that he was 'very concerned' about the potential threat 'lone wolf terrorists' pose to shopping centres across the West. 'Any time they call for an attack against a specific place, we've got to take that seriously,' he said. Another DHS official later clarified that Mr Johnson's did not mean shoppers should avoid  the Mall of America - only that they should be 'extra vigilant' and should be aware that security is increased. Shortly after the Westgate Mall incident in September 2013, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack and estimated 67 deaths. Around 200 people were also injured in the days-long assault. In the newly-released video, al-Shabaab runs a documentary-style account of the deadly attack, complete with images of terrified men, women and children running for their lives through the mall. Terrifying: Shoppers are pictured crawling across the floor as they try to escape the mall in September 2013 . Running to safety: In the newly-released video, Al-Shabaab describes the attack, complete with images of terrified men, women and children running through the mall for their lives. Above, people escape the mall . The masked militant then appears on-screen and suggests similar attacks could be carried out on the Mall of America, the West Edmonton Mall in Canada, or London's popular Oxford Street. The footage, apparently posted online by the Islamic group, also includes six minutes of graphic images of terrorist activity and discusses Kenyan forces' intervention in Somalia, it is reported. Minnesota, where the Mall of America is based, is home to a sizeable Somali population. U.S. law officials have been concerned about the potential for radicalization among some of the community. Last week, a Minnesota man was charged with conspiring to support ISIS - which has taken over swathes of Iraq and Syria - and lying to federal agents investigating recruitment by militant groups. Prosecutors said dozens of people from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area - many, Somali-Americans - have traveled or attempted to travel overseas to support ISIS or al-Shabaab since 2007. Scotland Yard said: ‘The Met Counter Terrorism Command is aware of the video and is assessing the content. ‘We remind the public that downloading extremist material may constitute an offence.’ The masked militant also calls for assaults on West Edmonton Mall (pictured) in Alberta, Canada .","Al-Shabaab has released video calling for attacks on Oxford Street .

Sir Jeremy Heywood (pictured left) has David Cameron 'by the balls', claims a former aide of Michael Gove . ‘Jeremy Heywood is more important than anyone in the Cabinet apart from Cameron or Osborne – and is arguably more important than Osborne. ‘He sits right next to the Prime Minister, has him completely by the balls and Cameron doesn’t do anything without Heywood’s permission.’ Sir Jeremy, Britain’s most senior civil servant, was Tony Blair’s principal private secretary from 1999 to 2003. He was nicknamed Sir Cover-up after preventing the Iraq War inquiry from seeing letters and records of phone calls between Mr Blair and George W Bush in the run-up to the war. Dominic Cummings pictured behind Michael Gove was a key aide when he was Education Secretary . His influence is such that Mr Cameron is said to have once joked: ‘Remind me, Jeremy, do you work for me or do I work for you?’ Mr Cummings was also highly critical of Mr Cameron’s closest aides, calling them ‘totally and utterly useless’. Speaking at an event organised by the Institute for Public Policy Research think-tank, he said: ‘I don’t think in lots of ways it matters what happens in the election. Whether it is Cameron or Miliband who gets in, neither of them know how to prioritise, neither can build a serious team, they’re both surrounded by these dysfunctional teams. ‘They don’t know how to get anything done, neither has had experience in any organisation watching someone who knows how to get things done in a real alpha organisation that’s well managed.’ Mr Cummings, who describes himself as now ‘very happily unemployed’, was Mr Gove’s special adviser but left in January after resigning. He said Mr Cameron’s advisers at Number 10 ‘operate in a bubble in which it is at most ten days planning or more usually 48 hours or 72 hours’. He added: ‘There is no long-term priority. There is no long-term plan. The central people operate in that kind of culture, they don’t think anything can change. They just think that is politics. ‘His most important advisers are [chief of staff] Ed Llewellyn and [director of communications] Craig Oliver – both of them are totally and utterly useless. It is not their fault. They are just in the wrong job. The fault lies in Cameron putting them there. ‘If you have a prime minister who has no sense of priorities and cannot manage his way out of a paper bag, and his two chief advisers who don’t know what they are doing… of course it’s going to be a farce.’","Dominic Cummings says Sir Jeremy Heywood has great influence over PM .

"A UKIP politician who said she wanted to send immigrants back home is set to selected to stand as an MP in a key target seat. Victoria Ayling sparked a racism row last year after she was recorded discussing the number of foreigners entering the UK and remarking: ‘I just want to send the lot back, but I can’t say that.’ Now she has been chosen by activists to contest the seat of Great Grimsby for UKIP, which she came within 700 votes of winning as a Tory candidate in 2010. UKIP star: Victoria Ayling, who last year faced racism storm after being caught on camera saying all immigrants in Britain should be sent back home, will stand for the party in Great Grimsby . Mrs Ayling dramatically quit the Conservatives last year, after ambushing David Cameron to say she was joining Nigel Farage’s UKIP. She claimed she was leaving because the Tories are ‘no longer the party of aspiration’. At the last election she stood for the Conservatives in Great Grimsby against veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell, and eroded his majority to just 714 votes. Mrs Ayling, who a councillor on East Lindsey District Council and Lincolnshire County Council, claims UKIP will ‘throw the kitchen sink’ at winning the marginal seat. In 2010, Labour won with 32.7 per cent of the vote, just ahead of the Tories on 30.5 per cent, with UKIP in fourth on 6.2 per cent. But an opinion poll carried out by Lord Ashcroft last month put UKIP on course to beat the Tories. It suggest Labour had the backing of 38 per cent of voters, UKIP 27 per cent and the Conservatives 20 per cent. Mr Farage claims his party is now taking votes from both Labour and the Tories, and Great Grimsby is a key target for UKIP. Mrs Ayling will hope to benefit from local recognition after standing in the seat in 2010. But after defecting to UKIP an astonishing video emerged in which Mrs Ayling expressed her views on immigration. The video was filmed by Mrs Ayling's ex-husband Rob in 2008 but she has said she stands by her comments . Mrs Ayling was recorded saying: 'I just want to send the lot back, but I can't say that . The video was shot in 2008 by her then-husband Rob, and saw her recording a series of political messages. In one take, she said: ‘We must basically repatriate those that shouldn’t be here. That’s not quite policy yet. Maybe I should soften it a bit.’ She then added: ‘OK. Send them back.’ Rob is then heard to mutter: ‘National Front.’ Veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell is standing down in Great Grimsby, leaving the seat open to challenge . In the very next take, Mrs Ayling – a Lincolnshire County councillor and deputy leader of the local UKIP party – says : ‘Multiculturalism is dead, I’m allowed to say that, but maybe Britishness is waving the National Front flag a bit. ‘We must control immigration. We cannot sustain the numbers coming in; the strains on our infrastructure are enormous. Control should be done fairly and the points system like they have in Australia and all those coming here should be encouraged to speak English so they can integrate.’ She adds: ‘I just want to send the lot back but I can’t say that.’ Confronted over the video in December last year, Mrs Ayling told the Mail on Sunday her comments were taken ‘out of context’ and she was only referring to illegal immigrants. he said: ‘It is nothing different from what the Home Secretary is advocating now any way. And the blackmail music is from a Monty Python sketch. I don’t think there is anything there that can be seen as offensive or politically incorrect.’ ‘I stand by what I said: illegal immigrants should be sent back home and multiculturalism won’t work. It was a throwaway comment that has been taken out of context.’ Speaking after her selection this week, she repeated her warnings about immigration. ‘Immigration is not a racist issue, it's about sheer numbers,’ she told the Grimsby Telegraph. ‘This country cannot cope. It doesn't matter about country or origin, it is about uncontrolled immigration, which is putting a huge strain on our infrastructure and pushing our schools and hospitals to breaking point.’ Despite being backed by the local party, a UKIP spokesman said: 'All candidates must be approved by the NEC and she has not yet been approved.'","Victoria Ayling, who defected from the Tories, to stand in  Lincolnshire .

"Per Mertesacker believes Arsenal's trip to Manchester City this weekend will be a 'big test' of their top-four credentials. Mounting injury problems have weakened the Gunners ahead of Sunday's trip to the Etihad Stadium.

'We had a good last game and January is a good time to come down and have a bit of a relax, but to switch on at the weekend.

"Hospitals across the Midwest are being inundated with children infected by a bizarre virus, which first comes on as a common cold before developing into severe respiratory distress. In Kansas City, Missouri, about 450 children were recently treated at one facility - Children's Mercy Hospital - with at least 60 of them admitted to intensive care. According to CNN Health, possible outbreaks have also been reported in Colorado, Illinois and Ohio. Children's Mercy Hospital's division director for Infectious Diseases, Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, said the problem was 'big' and 'unprecedented'. Scroll down for video . Close call: The parents of Will Cornejo, 13, feared their son would not make it after he struggled to breath this week and was rushed to Rocky Mountain Hospital in Denver. He is one of hundreds of children being admitted to hospital for respiratory distress . Feared the worst: Jennifer Corneyjo said she didn't know to what to expect after her son Will went white and his lips turned blue as he struggled to breath . 'I've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics, and I've never seen anything quite like this,' Dr. Jackson told CNN. 'We've had to mobilize other providers, doctors, nurses. It's big. I would call it unprecedented. 'It's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care.' Dr. Jackson said the problem started around when school went back on August 17 and peaked between August 21 and 30. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that some 19 of the cases in Kansas City tested positive for Enterovirus D68 or EV-D68,  D68 or EV-D68, typically causes only mild asthma-like symptoms but can be more severe in some cases. However there is no specific treatment for an EV-D68 infection, which is almost exclusively associated with respiratory disease. Ventilation appears to be the best away to assist patients with the infection. There is also no available vaccine. There is currently no data for any deaths related to an EV-D68 infection in the United States. 'It's the worst I've seen in my time': Dr. Raju Meyeppan from Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children in Denver said he is worried about what will happen in winter . Intense: Will required a breathing for 24 hours to help get enough oxygen into his lungs . 'The full scope is yet to be known, but it would appear it's in the Midwest,' Dr. Jackson said. 'In our community (in Kansas City), meticulous hand-washing is not happening. 'It's just the nature of kids. Worst I've seen.' Symptoms include fever, body and muscles aches, sneezing, coughing and rash, CNN reported. Rocky Mountain Hospital in Denver reported five children in their intensive care unit and 20 more in the pediatric unit. Will Cornejo, 13, was among the children in intensive care after he came down with a cold last weekend. His mother, Jennifer Corneyjo, said when her son took a turn for the worse on Tuesday, struggling to breath, she feared the worst. 'It was like nothing we've ever seen,' Jennifer Cornejo told CNN affiliate KUSA. 'He was unresponsive. He couldn't speak to me. He was turning white and his lips turned blue.' Will needed a breathing aparatus for 24 hours. Nationwide Children's Hopsital in East Columbus, Ohio, reported a 20 percent increase in patients with respiratory illness last weekend. They are testing to see whether the cases are EV-D68. Hannibal Regional Hospital in Hannibal, Missouri, said on Facebook they were dealth with 'recent outbreaks of enterovirus infections in Missouri and Illinois'.

"Archaeologists have unearthed what they believe to be a vampire burial site in Bulgaria. The so-called 'vampire graves' contain skeletons which all have an iron rod impaled through their bodies where their heart would have been. The discovery, made at the ancient temple of Perperion, south-east of the Bulgarian capital Sofia, is further evidence that people really did believe that vampires could rise from the dead if they were not buried properly. Vampire graves: Archaeologists have unearthed what they believe to be a vampire burial site in Bulgaria . Dracula? The so-called 'vampire graves' contain skeletons which all have an iron rod impaled through their bodies where their heart would have been . Out for the Count: Scores of people were killed because they were thought to be vampires, similar to witch-hunts elsewhere in Europe and North America . In the 13th and 14th centuries, many Eastern Europeans held the belief that vampires were real, causing mass hysteria when people suspected someone of being one of the blood-sucking creatures. Scores of people were killed because they were thought to be vampires, similar to witch-hunts elsewhere in Europe and North America. However it may be possible that some towns had a ritual of hammering a stake into dead people's hearts to make sure they did not join the undead, even if there was no suspicion of them being a vampire. The skeletons were found by 'Bulgaria's Indiana Jones', Professor Nikolai Ovcharov. Last year his team found a 35-40-year-old male with a metal pole impaled through where his heart would have been at a nearby site. Before that Professor Ovcharov had found 700-year-old corpses ‘nailed to the ground with iron staples driven into the limbs’. Burial ritual: The technique of impaling a stake through the heart was believed to be the best method for killing a vampire . Hard at work: The skeletons were found by 'Bulgaria's Indiana Jones', Prof Nikolai Ovcharov, and his team . The site: This week's discoveries are the sixth and seventh vampires dug up in just two years in Bulgaria . John Van Eyssen, in the film Horror of Dracula, prepares to drive a wooden stake through the heart of vampire . The year before that, a group headed by the professor unearthed another 700-year-old skeleton of a man pinned down in his earth in a church in the Black Sea town of Sozopol. This week's discoveries are the sixth and seventh vampires dug up in just two years in Bulgaria. However, the phenomenon is not just Bulgarian. Last year Polish archaeologists unearthed four 'vampire graves' where the bodies had their heads removed and placed between their legs. The discoveries near the southern town of Gliwice showed that different towns believed in different methods for killing vampires. The belief in vampires was widespread throughout Bulgaria and other parts of central Europe throughout the Middle Ages. The word vampire is derived from the original Slavic term 'opyrb' or 'opir' which later appears as 'vipir', 'vepir', or 'vapir'. Drunkards, thieves and murderers were all believed to be likely candidates to become vampires. Appearing completely normal, they would arrive at a town and live amongst the people often even marrying and fathering children. But at night they would wander the countryside in search of blood. These types of vampires could be destroyed with a stake through the heart. One account maintains that a vampire was the soul of an outlaw who died in the mountains or forest or along a country road, and whose corpse is eaten by crows, wolves, or some other such scavengers. Because such a soul is not permitted to enter heaven or hell it remains on earth haunting the place where he was killed strangling and drinking the blood of anyone who comes by. Another account states a person who died a violent, unnatural death or whose corpse was jumped over by a cat before burial, can become a vampire. In such cases during the first 40 days after burial, the bones turn to gelatin and the vampire performs mischief at night - releasing animals from their pens, scattering house hold items, and suffocating people. During the first forty days it can be destroyed by a 'Vampiridzhija' - a professional vampire hunter capable of seeing them - or alternatively devoured by a wolf. However if not destroyed in this time period the Vampire would develop a skeleton and become even more fierce.","Archaeologists have unearthed a vampire burial site in Bulgaria .

"Dinner lady: Alison Waldock, 51, has been sacked after forgetting the dietary requirements of a seven-year-old Muslim pupil and serving her gammon . A school dinner lady with 11 years service has been sacked after she accidentally served pork to a Muslim pupil. Alison Waldock, 51, gave gammon to a seven-year-old girl after she pointed to the dish on the canteen menu. The school’s headteacher spotted the mistake and stepped in before the youngster ate any of the meat, which is banned by her religion. But her parents were told about the error and complained to the catering firm that supplies meals to the school. Miss Waldock was suspended from her duties and has now been sacked for gross misconduct. A British Muslim group has already branded the decision ‘heavy-handed’ and an ‘overreaction’. Miss Waldock yesterday said she had made an honest mistake and was dismissed despite begging bosses to let her keep her job. ‘I feel the school and catering company made me a scapegoat so they can’t be seen as politically incorrect,’ added the mother-of-two. ‘I was really upset when I found out what I’d done. I’d never have done something like this on purpose. It was a simple mistake – I was so gutted with the school’s reaction. ‘I really enjoyed the job and I’d never had any problems before.’ The error happened at Queen Edith Primary School in Cambridge, where the proportion of pupils from ethnic minority backgrounds is ‘well above average’ according to the school’s latest  report from Ofsted. The school’s website also says that the families of pupils speak 28 languages. Miss Waldock said the pupil had actually asked for the meat. ‘I asked, “Do you want the gammon?” and she said yes, so I served it to her,’ she said. ‘When the headteacher found out, she was not happy. But there are 200-odd children to feed and I don’t know who is a Muslim or who is a vegetarian. Miss Waldock, who lives in Cambridge, said there were about 40 pupils with various dietary requirements, but claimed it was impossible to keep track of them. Dismissed: Ms Waldock claims there were around 40 pupils at Queen Edith Primary School in Cambridge with various dietary requirements and it was impossible to keep track of them with the lists she was given . She said: ‘There is a list, but the . pupils don’t wear name badges or stickers and we can’t know them all. I . respect all of the children’s beliefs, religions and meal choices. This . was just one mistake. I think firing me was really harsh.’ The girl’s parents, Zahid and Rumana Darr, claimed the school told them Miss Waldock was not concerned about the mistake. Mrs Darr, 33, said: ‘The person there said the dinner lady didn’t care or wasn’t that bothered.’ But Miss Waldock said: ‘That’s just not true. If I saw the parents today, I would say sorry.’ The Darrs also contacted Lunchtime UK, . the catering firm that operates the canteen. The company’s operations . manager Peter McAleese said: ‘Anyone losing their job is regretful. 'But . there was a full and transparent procedure that Alison went through, as . well as an appeals procedure, which she lost.’ A Muslim campaign group said that 'dismissing a dinner lady for inadvertently serving pig meat is an overreaction' Community group Muslims4UK said the majority of Muslim parents would be ‘understanding’ of the mistake. Founder and chairman Inayat Bunglawala said: ‘Dismissing a dinner lady for inadvertently serving pig meat is an overreaction. ‘The most sensible way to rectify such . mistakes is to improve awareness of the pupils’ dietary requirements . while apologising to the pupils and their parents.’ The Muslim Council of Cambridgeshire . called the sacking ‘heavy-handed’. ‘We are all human beings and all make . mistakes,’ said a spokesman. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has vowed to take up Miss Waldock’s cause. He said: ‘I feel desperately sorry for her. If she’d served gammon to a vegetarian would she have been fired? I think not.’","Alison Waldock, 51, apologised for mistake as soon as error was spotted .

"Speaking out: Christiana Figueres sparked fury yesterday by claiming that the devastating winter storms that have battered Britain had a 'silver lining' The devastating winter storms that have battered Britain had a ‘silver lining’ in raising the issue of climate change, the UN claimed yesterday. Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate change chief, sparked fury by making a political point out of storms which flooded 7,000 homes, killed 11 people and caused untold devastation. And Miss Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, added there was also an upside to the blast of Arctic air that blanketed America and Canada in snow, and the Australian bushfires, because they have forced climate change back on to the political agenda. ‘There’s no doubt that these events, that I call experiential evidence of climate change, does raise the issue to the highest political levels,’ she told the Guardian. ‘It’s unfortunate that we have to have these weather events, but there is a silver lining if you wish, that they remind us [that] solving climate change, addressing climate change in a timely way, is not a partisan issue.’ The floods have cost small businesses more than £830million, it emerged yesterday, and £170million of damage has been done to railway lines. The clear-up will cost billions. Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, whose Bridgwater constituency in Somerset has borne the brunt of the flooding, said last night: ‘It is a complete insult to have this unelected, overpaid UN bureaucrat making glib comments at the expense of my constituents. 'She hasn’t visited us here in Somerset, she knows nothing about what has happened here. She is taking advantage of this situation for political capital. Devastation: The storms flooded 7,000 homes, killed 11 people and caused untold devastation. They also cost small businesses more than £830million, it emerged yesterday. Above, Moorland on the Somerset Levels . Making do: The floods also caused £170million worth of damage to railway lines - with the clear-up costing billions. Above, volunteers use a pontoon to move a car that has been cut off by flood waters in Burrowbridge . ‘Apart from anything else, what she says is absolute rubbish. There is no evidence this  is anything to do with climate change.’ The Met Office has repeatedly pointed out that the winter storms cannot be attributed to global warming, although extreme rainfall ‘could be consistent’ with a warming world in the future. In a document addressing the issue, it said: ‘As yet, there is no definitive answer on the possible contribution of climate change to the recent storms, rainfall amounts and the consequent flooding. ‘This is in part due to the highly variable nature of UK weather and climate.’ Miss Figueres, who hails from Costa Rica, is leading the charge for a legally binding international agreement to reduce carbon emissions. After two decades of failure to reach a consensus, the UN is determined to finalise a deal at a conference in Paris next year. She said: ‘Paris has to reach a meaningful agreement because, frankly, we are running out of time.’ Miss Figueres was speaking before an event in London, where she was due to meet major businesses including Unilever, Lafarge and Royal Dutch Shell.","Christiana Figueres sparked fury by claiming floods had a 'silver lining'

"Labour ministers ‘suppressed’ warnings about hospitals blamed for causing thousands of needless deaths, a senior Government adviser said yesterday. In a devastating intervention, Professor Sir Brian Jarman said previous health ministers had presided over a ‘denial machine’ designed to prevent criticism of the NHS. A report by the NHS’s medical director, Sir Bruce Keogh, tomorrow will detail a shocking catalogue of failure at 14 hospital trusts held responsible for up to 13,000 ‘excess deaths’ since 2005. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is expected to place at least 10 of the hospitals in ‘special measures’ immediately, with NHS troubleshooters parachuted in to take over what are described as ‘failing regimes’. Investigation: Lincoln County Hospital is part one of 14 hospital trusts where 'excessive deaths' are being examined . Casualty, maternity, geriatric and other units could be shut down as ministers order drastic action to prevent further unnecessary deaths. The report will also highlight a culture in which warnings of dangerous practice were routinely ignored or buried. Ministers received 386 separate warnings about conditions at Morecambe Bay NHS Trust alone between 2005 and 2010. Sir Brian, an expert on hospital death rates who was an adviser on the report, said: ‘The Department of Health seems to have been, until recently, a denial machine. There has been a denial of the death rate data.’ He said Labour ministers had been in denial about the issue for most of the last decade – with the result that health regulators were actively discouraged from highlighting problems. He told Sky News: ‘The Government that was responsible for providing the service was, uniquely, also monitoring its quality. So you had a conflict in which where there was a problem with quality they couldn’t really say what it was. ‘Things were suppressed, (there was) spin, everything ... effectively they had to produce a good news story for ministers. ‘The impression in those days was, the problem was ministerial pressure, even from Number 10.’ Sir Brian also criticised the controversial NHS chief Sir David Nicholson, claiming that he had misleadingly suggested that the scandal at Mid Staffordshire trust hospitals was a one-off. His comments drew a furious response from shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, who served as health secretary in the last year of Gordon Brown’s government. ‘To be honest, I’m fed up of these general accusations being hurled in my direction,’ he said. ‘I will account for all of the things that I did as secretary of state.’ Mr Burnham insisted he had acted on warnings, including ordering a report into the Mid Staffs scandal and handing warnings to five other hospitals with high death rates. He said he had never received a ‘specific warning’ about Morecambe Bay. And he claimed the situation at some of the hospitals had got worse since the election. But one Downing Street insider said the Government planned to give Labour ‘both barrels’ when Sir Bruce Keogh’s report is published tomorrow. A Tory source said: ‘We now know Labour set up a hopeless regulator whose views shouldn’t have been trusted. ‘Andy Burnham allowed people with no medical training to inspect hospitals. It was a disaster waiting to happen. 'Despicable': A coroner heard four separate inquests in one day over 'incompetence' at Tameside Hospital . ‘But what is shocking is how Labour Ministers – including Andy Burnham and even Gordon Brown himself – appear to have been leaning heavily on officials to keep problems covered up.’ David Cameron commissioned the Keogh . report in February after Robert Francis QC’s inquiry into the Mid Staffs . scandal exposed appalling lapses in both care of patients and the . regulation of hospitals. Sir Bruce has been examining 14 hospital trusts that have been outliers on mortality indexes over the last two years. He . also examined infection levels, the number of patients suffering from . preventable and potentially fatal neglect and numbers of so-called . ‘never events’, such as operations on the wrong part of the body or . surgical instruments left inside a patient. Between them, the 14 hospitals have paid £234 million in negligence settlements in the past three years, although many of the cases will date back far longer as the legal battles often take several years. Infection: Tom Davies, 84, died after contracting MRSA while in Tameside Hospital with a fractured hip . Former RAF pilot Tom Davies, 84, died from MRSA after being admitted to Tameside General Hospital with a  fractured hip. The treatment he received there was ‘despicable’, the coroner said. According to his family, the twice-widowed grandfather was often unable to reach his meals because his table was too far from his bed. His son Ivor, 58, said: ‘On one occasion I found my dad lying in his own excrement which had dried on the bed sheets. It was after Mr Davies pointed out filth smeared over an abscess on his  father’s leg that nurses cleaning him up discovered the infection, which turned out to be MRSA. Mr Davies, who flew in Burma with the RAF during the Second World War, died on April 5, 2006. ‘I have no doubt he would still be alive today if he’d had  better care,’ his son said. Details of Mr Davies’ death formed one of four separate inquests heard in one afternoon by coroner John Pollard in which relatives in all cases complained of incompetence at Tameside General. Mr Pollard said staff had failed to carry out the most simple tasks. He added: ‘I would have concerns about any  hospital which was referred to in four different inquests in one day where people raise doubts about the basic care given to their relatives.’ The 14 hospital trusts are:  Basildon and Thurrock in Essex; United Lincolnshire; Blackpool; The Dudley Group, West Midlands; George Eliot, Warwickshire;  Northern Lincolnshire and Goole; Tameside, Greater Manchester; Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire; Colchester, Essex; Medway, Kent; Burton, Staffordshire; North Cumbria; East Lancashire; and Buckinghamshire Healthcare. Mr Hunt will announce tomorrow that most of the hospitals are still failing and will be placed in so-called special measures. Troubleshooting teams will be sent in with a free hand to order changes. Mr Hunt last night said: ‘Poor care in the NHS is completely  unacceptable which is why we  commissioned this review. For too long problems in the NHS have been allowed to go on unchecked. We will act in the best interests of patients and ensure that where problems are found we take action immediately.’ Senior Tories believe the row could help to neutralise Labour’s poll lead on the NHS. Some on the Left also believe it poses the party a challenge. Labour’s former general secretary Peter Watt said: ‘The Left is going to have to find a much better response to the series of NHS scandals than “I love the NHS”.’","Prof Sir Brian Jarman said health ministers tried to stop NHS criticism .

Now, New York hedge fund manager Louis Bacon, 61, has filed a whopping $50million defamation suit against Canadian clothing tycoon and fellow billionaire, Peter Nygard, 71. In the suit, Bacon claims Nygard - who lives next to him on an exclusive beach strip in the Clifton Bay area of the Bahamas - has waged an 'obsessive and malicious' smear campaign for years. The campaign has seen him wrongly accused of covering up a series of murders and carrying out a high-level conspiracy  to 'unseat the ruling political party in the Bahamas', Bacon writes. Billionaires' brawl: New York hedge-fund manager Louis Bacon (left), 61, has filed a whopping $50million defamation suit against 71-year-old Canadian clothing tycoon and fellow billionaire, Peter Nygard (right) Home: In the suit, Bacon claims Nygard - who lives next to him on an exclusive beach strip (pictured) in the Clifton Bay area of the Bahamas - has waged an 'obsessive and malicious' smear campaign for years . It has also seen rumors spread about him being a white supremacist and a member of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), possessing terrorist weaponry and committing arson at Nygard's home, he says. In a statement, Bacon’s attorney, Orin Snyder, said the suit - which alleges that Nygard carried out the campaign both online and in local newspapers - had been unsealed in New York on Thursday. 'Louis Bacon filed this lawsuit to hold Peter Nygard and his companies responsible for their unlawful and reprehensible smear campaign,' he said, adding: 'We look forward to our day in court.' In the suit, Bacon himself claims that Nygard 'harbors spite, ill will, and animus' toward him and that his 'sinister' allegations have destroyed Bacon's professional, philanthropic and personal reputations'. In his defamation suit, Louis Bacon alleges that Peter Nygard spread the 'lies' that he: . Nygard's representatives have strongly denied the suit's claims. 'The allegations in Louis Bacon's latest lawsuit are completely without merit and will be proven so if they ever get to trial,' the representatives told the Business Insider. 'The assertion that Mr. Bacon has been defamed is not supportable.' In relation to the corruption claims, they added: 'Mr. Bacon has falsely and maliciously accused Mr. Nygard and [Bahamas] Prime Minister Perry Christie of government corruption. 'In fact, Mr. Bacon has falsified evidence of corruption.' The lawsuit is part of a decade-long battle between the two billionaires that started as a property-line dispute. The pair live on adjoining estates in the exclusive Lyford Cay community. Nygard, a self-styled playboy and eccentric owner of Nygard International, has an estimated fortune just shy of $1billion, and has resided on the island since 1987. His famous 150,000-square-foot beachfront mansion, dubbed 'Nygard Cay', has previously featured on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' and 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'. Meanwhile, visitors have included former U.S. President George Bush and actor Robert De Niro. Burned: The campaign has  seen rumors spread about Bacon being a white supremacist and a KKK member, possessing terrorist weaponry and setting fire to Nygard's Mayan-themed home (pictured), the suit states . Couple: In a statement, Bacon’s attorney, Orin Snyder, said the suit against Nygard had been unsealed in New York on Thursday. Above, Bacon, worth around $1.6bn, is seen with his wife Gabrielle at a formal event . Bacon, meanwhile, is the founder of Moore Capital Management LLC, has an estimated wealth of $1.6billion. He has lived next door to Nygard since 1996. The feud began around 2004 when a group of conservationists, including Bacon, established the Coalition to Protect Clifton Bay to preserve the Western part of the island, where Nygard lives. The group accused Nygard of illegally dredging the sea bed, extending the island's natural shore line, and of expanding the borders of his compound without proper permission. They attempted to block any further attempts by the billionaire to expand his home buy buying up a large stretch of coast line and establishing a nature reserve. Nygard hit back with a series of videos in which he claimed to be a friend of the Bahamas and passionate about conservation. Since then, Bacon and Nygard have been waged in war. In his lawsuit, Bacon accuses Nygard of doctoring a television report about the arrest of Wall Street mogul Rajat Gupta for inside trading. The report aired on CBS News in October 2011. In it, Nygard deliberately superimposed Bacon's face over Gupta's, wrongly alleging that the billionaire was at the center of a 'billion-dollar scam', the suit claims, according to the New York Post. During the alleged smear campaign, Nygard also claimed Bacon was trying to hide the fact that his great-grandfather, Col. Roger B. Moore, was a member of the KKK, it says. Eccentric: Mr Nygard (pictured, center, with women at Beverly Hills Hotel), who has seven children by four women, built his impressive 150,000-square-foot beachfront mansion, dubbed 'Nygard Cay', in 1987 . Mogul: In the suit, Bacon himself claims that Nygard (pictured left) 'harbors spite, ill will, and animus' toward him and that his allegations have destroyed Bacon's professional, philanthropic and personal reputations' Bacon claims this amounts to character assassination, and says Nygard is behind rallies and protest marches on the island which have seen him denounced as a racist. And elsewhere in the suit, Bacon claims his neighbor spread rumors that he had covered up the murder of his house manager, Dan Tuckfield, who died in his pool in May 2010. The bitter argument came to a dramatic head in 2009 when a fire gutted Nygard's mansion. Fire crews listed the official cause as 'unknown', but Nygard claimed it was an act of arson organised by Bacon - an allegation he strongly denies. Visitors: Mr Nygard's home was previously featured on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' and 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous', with visitors including ex-President George Bush (left) and actor Robert De Niro (right) Nygard also alleged that Bacon installed four 'large, military-grade' speakers at the boundary between their two properties, before aiming them at his bedroom. Bacon then blared 'ear piercing noises' toward Nygard, with one of Bacon's assistants shouting 'There, that's a message from Mr. Bacon. Don't f*** with Louis,' according to court papers. Since the fire destroyed large parts of his home, Nygard has applied for planning permission to rebuild the lavish estate in even grander style, prompting outrage from the exclusive community. Last year, more than 100 people, including actor Sean Connery, filed a legal complaint against the government over efforts by Mr Nygard to redevelop his compound.","Tycoons Louis Bacon and Peter Nygard engaged in a decade-long feud .

"Suppliers to one of America's biggest poultry chains have been accused of animal cruelty after its workers were apparently filmed kicking, throwing and burning chickens alive. Animal rights group Mercy for Animals has released undercover footage which it claims was recorded at a Tennessee slaughterhouse run by Chick-fil-A supplier Koch Foods. The video, introduced by The Simpsons co-creator and animal rights campaigner Sam Simon, also claims to show footage from a worker at a poultry farm contracted with Koch Foods. In the clips, staff are seen throwing chickens violently by their legs and necks into cages, often, the video alleges, breaking their bones in the process. Scroll down for video . 'Cruel': Undercover footage allegedly shows workers at a poultry farm contracted with a supplier to restaurant chain Chick-fil-A violently throwing chickens into cages, often breaking their legs and wings in the process . Allegations: Some of the birds also have their heads crushed in the cage doors as they are transported to the slaughterhouse, according to the video taken by animal rights group Mercy for Animals . The animal rights group claims the birds are bred to grow so quickly they suffer 'crippling deformities' Some of the birds also have their heads crushed in the cage doors as they are transported to the slaughterhouse. The video then shows the chickens being slung upside down on metal shackles on a conveyor belt which drags them through an 'electrified vat of water' to stun them. This, it claims, often only partially paralyses them, leaving them still conscious when they are pulled across a blade to cut their throats. Some of the birds, however, are still breathing when they are dragged through scolding water to remove their feathers, burning them alive, the video claims.

Mr Simon signs off the video with the claim: 'Disgusting cruelty is standard practice at Chick-fil-A suppliers nationwide. But it doesn't have to be this way. 'Tell Chick-fil-A to end it's disgusting treatment of chickens by adopting stronger animal welfare standard to prevent the cruelty you have just witnessed.' Koch Foods branded the video 'inaccurate and out of context' in a statement yesterday, it was reported by The Tennessean. Koch Foods CEO Joe Grendys said: 'The chicken processing business is a highly regulated industry with well-established industry processing procedures, and our company works hard every day to ensure our employees and contractors follow strict regulations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.' Chick-fil-A also responded by asserting its commitment to humane practices. Chick-fil-A has responded to the video by asserting its commitment to humane practices . It said: 'As a values-based organization, we strictly partner with suppliers who share in our goal of responsible environmental stewardship, and maintain our values throughout all animal welfare and management practices.' Koch Foods and Chick-fil-A said they stopped working together last year. But Mercy for Animals director of investigations, Matt Rice, claims to have recorded phone calls that show the companies were still working together earlier this year when the video was taken. Rice said the acts recorded in the factory and farm did not violate any federal or Tennessee laws, but the group hopes their investigation will encourage firms to adopt more humane practices.","Animal rights group claims footage taken in Koch Foods slaughterhouse .

"A family claims they are allergic to their £900 Argos sofa after erupting in burning itchy rashes as soon as they sit on it. Lynnette Stuckey, 52, bought a three-piece suite from Argos two months ago but within a couple of weeks she was hit with a rash, which spread across her stomach and back. Now every member of the family, from Cardiff, has reported the same reaction after sitting on the black and grey 'Bailey' sofa. Lynette Stuckey at home in Cardiff  with the sofas she bought from Argos. She says the furniture has brought her and her whole family out in a painful red rash . Ms Stuckey said: 'It was a big red mark and it felt like a bee sting,' she said. 'I couldn't make out where it was coming from.' Her daughter Laura said: 'Every person who sits on it gets like a burning sensation on the skin, and it's itchy straight away. 'It comes up into a rash or a lump, and then it becomes a hole and it weeps.' Laura, 26, said she saw her GP for treatment for the rash but the various prescribed creams didn't make the rash go away. Her sister and her sister's boyfriend have also since been affected. Now every member of the family, from Cardiff, has reported the same reaction after sitting on the black and grey 'Bailey' sofa . Ms Stuckey said: 'It was a big red mark and it felt like a bee sting,' she said. 'I couldn't make out where it was coming from' The family contacted Argos on November 5 about the issue and claimed that the company first told the family to phone pest control. Ms Stuckey said: 'Pest control said there was no point coming out to see the sofa because from what I'd told him over the phone it's a chemical reaction from the sofa. 'He said if it was an infestation my mum would see things jumping on the sofa. He said coming out would be a waste of our money.' Argos then told her they would send an upholstery crew to test the sofa, but the family say they haven't heard from them since. Lynnette Stuckey (pictured) said she noticed a rash spreading to her back and stomach just weeks after buying the Argos couch set. Argos is now investigating . An Argos spokesman said: 'As a responsible retailer we were extremely concerned to learn of the issues Ms Stuckey and her family have experienced with their chair and sofas. Our priority is conducting an urgent investigation into this matter. 'We have attempted to get in touch with Ms Stuckey to discuss this further, however we are unable to get hold of the customer at this time. In 2010, Argos and several other high street retailers agreed to pay out up to £20m in compensation to around 2,000 customers who reported that they had received chemical burns from their leather sofas. It was found that the sofas were packed with sachets of the anti-mould chemical dimethyl fumarate which were used by some manufacturers to protect leather goods from going mouldy while stored in humid conditions.","Stuckey family break out in itchy rashes as soon as they sit on sofa .

"A Liberian orphan has been separated from his younger sisters after his adoption by an American family was put on hold due to the deadly Ebola outbreak. Tessa and Joel Sanborn from Maple Valley in Washington, were due to take five-year-old Devine back to their home just outside of Seattle in December after adopting his twin sisters Faith and Favor. The couple were previously allowed to take the two-year-old twins from the Acres of Hope children's home in Liberia as Faith had a stroke at birth and needed medical attention and Favor was allowed to travel with her. Scroll down for video . The Sanborns were allowed to take home Devine's sisters Favor, left, and Faith, right (pictured in December 2013). Now Devine is stranded in Liberia because Ebola has meant adoptions have been put on indefinite hold . Seattle couple Joel and Tessa Sanborn sit with their adopted twins and some of their other children as they look at pictures of Faith and Favor's older brother Devine, who is stranded in Liberia . Faith is currently receiving therapy to strengthen the use of her right hand and foot. But Devine had to be left behind in Liberia, and because a state of emergency continues in the country as they try to contain the Ebola threat his adoption is on hold indefinitely. Fighting back the tears, Mrs Sanborn, who also has six other children, said: 'We love Liberia, and we want what's best for the country as a whole. 'It's never a place a parent wants to be.' Patricia Anglin, the director and founder of the Acres of Hope orphange where Devine is currently living is constantly updating his new parents of his progress. Director of the orphanage where Devine is living says he asks everyday when he can join his American family . She said: 'He's, I guess, doing as well as can be expected, but every day, asks, ""When do I get to go? When do I get to go to America and be with my family?""' 'Those children that have extended families, some of those extended families are afraid to reach out to them. 'Often times, the traditional thinking is that those children will always be contagious.' The deadly virus has caused the number of children in west African orphanages to increase and aid workers say many are struggling to cope with the influx as well as a shortage of food and supplies. It is estimated 7,000 children in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have lost one or more parent to the disease. Ms Anglin says that many of the staff at her organisation have now stopped taking a salary as funds are so low and they desperately need to raise money. She added: 'Long after Ebola is even eradicated, we will have the devastation and challenges left behind of these orphans who need to be cared for. 'We can't do it alone.' Liberia used to be a major partner with U.S. adoption agencies, but the situation has changed recently due to complications unrelated to Ebola. Separated from family: Favor points at a computer picture of her big brother Devine taken before they were separated while Faith looks on . The twins were allowed to be taken back to the United States by Mr and Mrs Sanborn, pictured, as Faith needed medical treatment after suffering a stroke at birth . According to State Department figures, there were only 12 adoptions from Liberia by Americans in 2013, down from a high of 353 in 2006. However, experts on international adoptions caution that disasters and emergencies, such as the Ebola crisis, should not be occasions to hastily encourage adoptions. Najwa Mekki of UNICEF explained: 'The first priority is to reunite children with their close relatives or other community members willing to look after them . Two-year-old Faith plays with her adoptive father Joel. It is estimated 7,000 children in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have lost one or more parent to Ebola .

Guinea, along with Liberia and Sierra Leone, have been hardest hit by Ebola, which has claimed nearly 5,200 lives this year, according to the latest WHO figures . 'Children are never more vulnerable than in the contexts of large-scale emergencies. Making permanent decisions about children's long-term care should be kept to an absolute minimum during this period.' The Joint Council on International Children's Services, a Virginia-based child-advocacy organisation whose partners include many U.S. adoption agencies, has also taken a similar stance, as has the State Department. Spokesman Niles Cole added: 'We want to avoid the situation where adoptive parents go through the process and then are disappointed.'","Five-year-old Devine was due to be adopted from a Liberian orphanage .

"People should stop expecting food prices to go down when the price of everything else is going up, celebrity chefs Heston Blumenthal and Peter Gilmore say. Speaking at the launch of Perth's food and wine festival, the Margaret River Gourmet Escape, Gilmore said weekend penalty rates for workers were pushing up the price of dining in Australian restaurants.

'I do say in the same sentence the quality you get is exceptional and you should be prepared to pay for quality,' he said.

"A letter from Lord Nelson to his mistress Emma Hamilton after the birth of their love-child Horatia in 1801 is set to go under the hammer . A letter sent from Lord Nelson to his mistress Lady Emma Hamilton a fortnight after the birth of their secret love child has gone under the hammer. In the note, dated February 12, 1801, Nelson talks in code, pretending the child actually belongs to a fictitious Admiral named Thomson and that he and Miss Hamilton are the child's godparents. Speaking about himself and Miss Hamilton in the third person, Nelson says: 'Assure her of his unalterable and affectionate regard' adding that 'all the world cannot either change or make him wish to change for a moment and that he is unalterably hers.' Nelson also speaks about his fear that the affair will be discovered, worrying that his letters will be intercepted, and revealing that he has a Midshipman post them for fear of discovery. The couple's love-child Horatia, named after Nelson, was born on January 29, 1801, while he was still married to Frances 'Fanny' Nisbet. Despite Nelson's attempts at hiding the affair, word did eventually reach Fanny that Miss Hamilton had given birth to the child she had so longed for with her husband. Following a set of bitter arguments, Fanny stood her ground and demanded that Nelson chose between his two loves, leading to their scandalous separation before Nelson was killed in 1805. The letter is one of three being sold by a private collector at Christie’s in London and is expected to fetch between £10,000 and £15,000. A Christie’s spokesman said: 'The letter betrays some of the insecurities that beset the couple, including the constant fear that one of their letters - full of thinly-veiled affection with neither party well disguised by their use of the ""Thomson"" alias - would fall into strange hands. 'From his proclamations of affection it also seems that Emma, or ""Mrs Thomson"" as she appears here, had questioned Nelson’s devotion. In the letter (pictured) Nelson pretends the child belongs to a fictional Admiral called Thompson, while suggesting that he and Miss Hamilton are in fact the girl's godparents . A second letter going under the hammer is from Nelson to Spencer Smith, praising Spencer's brother William who helped him mastermind the defence of Acre . 'Accusations of emotional infidelity and neglect recur throughout their correspondence and saw him whipped into agonies of jealousy and despair. 'Based in England during the final negotiations of the Peace of Amiens, Nelson could frequently visit Emma and play some part in the life of his illegitimate daughter, Horatia.' The second letter up for auction from Lord Nelson was written in the wake of the successful British defence of Acre, masterminded by William Sidney Smith. The letter is to his brother the minister-plenipotentiary in Constantinople, Spencer Smith expressing his pride of his brother's actions. It is expected to sell for between £5,000 and £8,000. The final letter is addressed to the Prime Minister Henry Addington and is valued at between £4,000 and £6,000. A third letter, thought to be worth between £4,000 and £6,000, sees Nelson arguing with his superiors over pay - suggesting he is being given less than other Admirals after a victory . In it Lord Nelson complains of his unequal financial treatment relative to his fellow victorious admirals Earl St Vincent and Viscount Duncan. Lady Emma Hamilton, who was the daughter of a blacksmith, married the much older Sir William Hamilton in 1791, the British Envoy to Naples. Lord Nelson won three of the most decisive naval victories in British history at the Nile in 1798, Copenhagen in 1801 and Trafalgar in 1805. He was seriously wounded four times, losing his right arm, and was famously killed by a French sniper aboard HMS Victory during the Battle of Trafalgar. Emma Hamilton began life as a blacksmith's daughter, worked in a sex shop in London, became a well-known mistress to high society, and died in poverty in Calais in 1814 . Emma Hamilton may have been made famous as history's 'other woman', tempting Lord Nelson away from loving wife Fanny Nisbet, but she began life as the daughter of a blacksmith. Born as Amy Hart in The Wirral, Cheshire, in 1765, her father died when she was two months ols so she was raised by her mother Mary Kidd in the Cotswolds. Without any formal education she moved to London around 1980, changed her name to Emma Lyon, and began working for infamous 'sexologist' Dr James Graham at his Temple of Health. Scantily dressed as Vestina, the Goddess of Health, she would be the first sight that guests coming to the pleasure house would see walking through the door. The temple was a den of debauchery, and featured a bed through which an electric current could be passed as couples copulated on top of it, and supposedly cured infertility. Here, aged just 15, Emma learned the arts of the oldest profession, and began mixing with well-to-do socialites including Sir Harry Featherstonhaugh, who took her for a mistress. Following the birth of a love-child, she passed into the hands of Charles Francis Greville, who was so obsessed with her looks that he sent her to be painted by his friend George Romney. So charmed was Romney by the young, beautiful Miss Lyon, he made her his muse, and over the years painted her dozens of times - both clothed and nude. Greville, the nephew of the British Ambassador to Naples, eventually took Miss Lyon abroad where she fell into the arms of his uncle, Sir William Hamilton, who married her. Now firmly installed in the ranks of the social elite, and with her beauty well known throughout Britain, Emma was first introduced to Lord Nelson in 1793 when he visited Napes to gather reinforcements to fight the French. Nelson had been happily married for nearly a decade up to this point, and once wrote of his wife Frances, that: ‘Until I married her I never knew happiness and I am certain she will continue to make me happy for the rest of my life.’ However he immediately fell under Emma's spell, and the two began an affair with the knowledge and blessing of Emma's husband, who invited Nelson to stay with them in London two years later. Emma gave birth to their daughter, Horatia, shortly afterwards - prompting Fanny to write to Nelson, saying she was willing to forgive him if he would only come back to her. In return he offered Fanny £2,000 a year while he and the Hamiltons lived in Surrey. Frances was furious, stood her ground, and demanded that Nelson chose either her, or Emma. Nelson refused to see her, and returned one of her letters with the note: 'Opened by mistake by Lord Nelson but not read.’ The couple separated, scandalising the nation, shortly before Nelson died at Trafalgar in 1805. Cast out from Nelson's side, many expected the figures of Frances Nisbet to shrink into obscurity, but she remained a firm fixture at court until her death in 1831. Emma, meanwhile, took to drink, plunged into debt, fled to France where she died in poverty in at Calais 1814.","Nelson married Frances 'Fanny' Nisbet in 1787 after meeting overseas .

"Danny Murphy has revealed the shocking moment former Fulham striker Clint Dempsey punched his hand through a glass window after being dropped by Roy Hodgson for the Europa League semi-final in 2010.

He doesn't hold back and he decided to punch a window which had thickened glass in the corner of the Cottage. 'Basically half his finger was off and you could see his tendon.

Speaking about his role of captain at the time, the former Liverpool and England midfielder admitted he was in total shock after seeing Dempsey's reaction. Murphy said: 'It was tough initially, there was a lot of shock. Even Roy was in shock. Clint calmed down quite quickly when he realised the severity of the injur. 'I was just trying to keep him calm and in the end he did calm down. What was great for me was that Roy didn't punish him and leave him out altogether because it was a real lack of discipline.

"Scotland is poised to reject independence – but only based on the votes of half a million English living north of the border. Scottish-born voters are evenly split, 48 per cent to 48 per cent, with just six days to go before next week’s historic referendum, according to a poll published last night. But after the 477,000 voters born in England are taken into account - as well as tens of thousands of Welsh, Northern Irish and foreigners entitled to take part on Thursday - the ‘No’ to independence campaign enjoys a four point lead. Scroll down for video . Scottish-born voters are evenly split on whether to leave the United Kingdom - but those born elsewhere are strongly pro-Union . Unionists however will point to the 750,000 Scots living in England, many of whom are strongly anti-independence, that cannot vote next week. Overall, some 63 per cent of English, Welsh and Northern Irish voters living in Scotland are planning to reject independence, according to last night’s YouGov survey. Just 27 per cent of non-Scottish Brits plan to vote for independence and only a third of those born outside the UK. More than half of foreign immigrants living in Scotland plan to against separation. Last night’s YouGov poll for the Times and Sun newspapers suggested that many were turned off independence by Alex Salmond. Mr Salmond is overwhelmingly mistrusted by those born outside Scotland. According to the YouGov research, three quarters of Brits living in north of the border but born outside Scotland do not trust the Scottish First Minister. Two thirds of those not born in the UK do not trust Mr Salmond. This is compared to 55 per cent of Scotish-born voters who distrust the SNP leader. Even David Cameron – considered by many to be toxic in Scotland - is more trusted by non-Scots than Mr Salmond. The Prime Minister is trusted by a third of ‘foreigners’ living in Scotland – 10 per cent more than Mr Salmond. Some 65 per cent of those born in the UK but outside Scotland also said they would be financially worse off after independence. Six in 10 foreign-born immigrants shared the same pessimism. Scots themselves are much more evenly split on the issue of whether they would be hit economically by separation. Four in 10 say they would be better off – just five per cent less than the proportion who claim they would be hit in the pocket. A surge in support for independence saw support for a 'Yes' vote briefly taking the lead last week, before falling back yesterday . Labour's central belt heartlands hold the key to preserving the union, but have turned towards independence . Mr Salmond’s failure to attract those born outside of Scotland could cost him the referendum, because of the relatively large proportion of people living in the country born elsewhere. The Scottish population is around 5.3million – but 17 per cent were born elsewhere. Nine per cent of the Scottish population were born in England – some 477,000. A further 0.7 per cent came from Northern Ireland and 0.3 per cent in Wales. Of the seven per cent - 369,000 - people in Scotland who were not born in the UK, 15 per cent - 55,000 - were born in Poland, and six per cent - 23,000 - were born in each of India and the Republic of Ireland. Rutherglen and Hamilton West Labour MP Tom Greatrex, who was born and grew up in Kent, urged the SNP to accept the result of the referendum – even if it was English votes which blocked independence. First Minister Alex Salmond is not trusted by voters  who were not born in Scotland, according to last night's YouGov poll . Labour MP Tom Greatrex (left), who represents the Scottish seat of Rutherglen and Hamilton West Labour despite being born English, said everyone who lived in Scotland had a right to vote. Gordon Brown (right) has become the de-facto leader of the Better Together campaign against independence . Mr Greatrex said: ‘All of these polls suggest it’s going to be quite close, so there are various possible scenarios once the numbers are broken down. ‘Just because someone happens to have been born in a different part of the UK, like me, they are just entitled to have their say as people who happened to have been born in Scotland. ‘I don’t think it will take anything away from a no vote – it will be the view of the people living in Scotland.’ But Mr Greatrix said he had experienced a rise in anti-English sentiment over the past few months. He said: ‘I’ve lived here for 11 years and it’s just been a handful of occasions when people have had a go at me – but most of those have been in the last couple of months.’ He added: ‘The atmosphere is quite fevered.’","Scottish-born voters are evenly split, 48% to 48%, on the referendum .

"A mother of 34 children has given a rare insight into the day-to-day running of her one-of-a-kind household. During the past 30 years, Jeane Briggs and her husband Paul, have adopted 29 children from around the world and, alongside their five biological children, have happily opened up their home in Falling Waters, West Virginia, to the youngsters, many of whom suffer from serious illnesses or disabilities. 'I just enjoy it. This is my career. I say to my kids, you’re the very air I breathe so I need you, I need that oxygen,' Mrs Briggs, 58, told Today.com. Full house: Jeane Briggs (center) and her husband Paul (not pictured) have 34 children, five of them biological and 29 adopted . In fact, the Briggs family have no plans to stop welcoming children into their home, and are especially devoted to those who are older or hard to place because of disabilities or illnesses. They've cared for children with cancer, polio, scoliosis, leg deformities, kidney problems, learning disabilities and autism, among other medical conditions. Their son Joseph, now 24, recalls being abused as a child in Ukraine because he was born with a cleft lip and palate, before the Briggs adopted him at age 14. New addition: The couple are in the process of adopting this baby boy with no hands or legs from Ghana . Around the world: The Briggs, who live in Falling Waters, West Virginia, have adopted children from Mexico, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Ghana . 'It was hard to believe that someone wanted me with my problem. I can't repay them for what they did for me… I love my parents to the moon and back,' he said. The first international child they adopted was Abraham, a blind two-year-old whom they rescued from a Mexican orphanage in 1985. He had brain damage due to having been beaten. While it's quite expensive to feed such a large brood - the family spends $52,000 a year on groceries alone - Mr Briggs, 59, is fortunate to have a very lucrative job at a credit card processing company. His employer also pays the family $10,000 for every child they adopt. No limit: The Briggs have no plans to stop welcoming children into their home, and have a special devotion to those who are older or hard to place because of disabilities or illnesses . True calling: 'This is my career. I say to my kids, you’re the very air I breathe so I need you, I need that oxygen,' Mrs Briggs said . They were also able to expand their nine-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot house, where 26 people currently live, with money from a recent inheritance. In 2003, Mrs Briggs, then a mother of 12, told the Herald-Mail that anyone hesitant to take in an older child should visit her family. 'Children are special gifts, blessings. No child should learn or feel that nobody wants them,' she said. 'It's such a joy. Honestly, I've never had a bad day.'","Jeane Briggs and her husband Paul, of Falling Waters, West Virginia, have adopted 29 children from around the world, in addition to their five biological offspring .

"Thirty-eight members of the same family have  paid off mortgages and watched their bank accounts rise after rorting $2 million in welfare payments from the government. One person from the western Sydney family claimed benefits while depositing $750,000 over three years and another paid off a $300,000 mortgage in just two years while claiming income support.

Thirty-eight members of the same family have paid off mortgages and watched their bank accounts rise after rorting $2 million in welfare payments from the government (file picture) Multiple people also falsely claimed the disability support pension while other family members claimed a carer's allowance for looking after them. The NSW Department of Human Services launched an investigation after a tip-off suggested a man had failed to declare his income. As a result, 19 family members have had their welfare payments cancelled and another 19 have had their payments reduced. Five people have been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions and nine people have to repay more than $50,000 each. Human Services Minister, Senator Marise Payne, said it was the most extreme example of rorting she's seen . Human Services Minister, Senator Marise Payne, said she was surprised by the extent of the rorting. 'This is the most extreme example that I've seen in the time I've had this role,' she told Macquarie Radio. 'People abusing it in this way simply damage the opportunities for the appropriate delivery of payments for others.' The consequences of such fraud can include prison time, according to Ms Payne. 'This rort was a blatant abuse of the welfare system and an offence to hard-working Australians who expect their taxes to be spent helping those in need,' she said. One person from the western Sydney family claimed benefits while depositing $750,000 over three years and another paid off a $300,000 mortgage in just two years while claiming income support . Ms Payne admitted there was one family member who had failed to report almost $1 million over 11 years, and her department is working closely with the Australian Tax Office and Australian Federal Police. 'The debts we currently have in relation to social welfare fraud investigations are $39 million,' she said. The department's investigation will involve all levels of the alleged fraud including the doctors who may have given documentation to support a disability support pension. She warned people who are rorting the system that 'we will find you'.","38 members of a western Sydney family have rorted $2 million in welfare .

"The U.S. Department of Defense tried to pay ransom to win the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from the terrorist Haqqani network in Pakistan, but was duped by a con man who ran off with the money, according to a member of Congress. The Pentagon said June 9 that 'there was no money exchanged for Bergdahl’s release,' and the White House's National Security Council insisted a day later that 'the United States did not provide money in exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl’s release.' Those carefully worded statements don't appear to rule out the possibility that money was sent but never reached its target. Joe Kasper, the press secretary to California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter, told MailOnline on Thursday that the Pakistanis holding Bergdahl 'wanted to deal. They were desperate to deal.' Official denials from the Obama administration, Kasper said, are par for the course but likely deceptive. Rep. Duncan Hunter (center) is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who is pressing the Pentagon for details about a failed plot to ransom Bowe Bergdahl through a middleman who disappeared with the money . A triumphant President Barack Obama announced Bergdahl's release in May, offering no suggestion that his administration had tried to ransom him before opting for a 5-to-1 prisoner swap instead . AWOL? Bergdahl's former platoon-mates said he walked away from his post in Afghanistan and should have been court-martialed instead of reintegrated into the military . 'We know better than to believe that,' he explained. 'That's what they're going to say, and that's fine. We should expect that. But where there's smoke there's fire.' 'They can deny it all they want,' added Kasper, speaking of the administration's official spokespersons. 'But there are people within the Defense Department itself who are saying otherwise. Their own people. ... We know who discussed this issue within the Pentagon. We know who briefed the secretary.' He said the government is in the habit of entertaining ransom plans, but always through third-parties that will give the United States deniability. 'We don't pay a ransom in the sense that the U.S. government officially makes payments to a foreign entity,' Kasper said, emphasizing the word 'officially.' 'The way we've been doing this for a long time is through a workaround.' Rep. Hunter, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served two combat tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan after the 9/11 terror attacks, is among Capitol Hill's most persistent military bloodhounds. Pentagon officials flatly told the congressman this year that there was no consideration of a cash swap for Bergdahl, Kasper said. 'They told him categorically that, no, it never happened. That's when we decided to press down on the accelerator. And the information we got back was resounding.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday that the Obama administration flatly opposes the idea of paying for the release of Americans held captive overseas. 'It's not in the best interests of American citizens to pay ransoms to any organization, let alone a terrorist organization, that is holding an American hostage,' he said. 'And the reason for that is simple: We don't want to put other American citizens at even greater risk when they’re around the globe, and that knowing that terrorist organizations can extract a ransom from the United States if they take a hostage only puts American citizens at greater risk.' Hunter dropped a bombshell in a Nov. 5 letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, claiming that America's Joint Special Operations Command 'did pursue at least two lines of effort for Bergdahl: a kinetic rescue operation, if necessary, and; a payment to the Haqqani Network to gain Bergdahl's release.' 'It has been brought to my attention,' Hunter wrote, 'that a payment was made to an Afghan intermediary who ""disappeared"" with the money and failed to facilitate Bergdahl's release in return. The payment was made in January-February 2014.' Hunter also seemed to understand the careful parsing of denials that often follows inquiries – from both congressmen and journalists – into sensitive national security matters. 'I recognize the reluctance to describe a payment as a ransom,' he wrote, but claimed the botched payment was made – 'regardless of how the transaction is described.' In a separate letter to the directors of the FBI, the CIA and U.S. Special Forces Command, he expressed his understanding that 'a transfer occurred that possibly included payment to Haqqani from the Taliban for the receipt of Bergdahl.' Accusation: Hunter's press secretary told MailOnline that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was briefed on the failed ransom plan, which had to involve third parties in order to give the White House deniability . TALIBAN FIVE: The Afghans released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Bergdahl were among the most senior members of the Taliban held at the prison camp, including one who had direct ties to Osama bin Laden . According to The Washington Times, unnamed officials said the U.S. Army’s elite Delta Force anti-terrorism squad handled the Bergdahl ransom mission. 'The FBI also was involved in the ransom payment attempt and was waiting inside Afghanistan’s border with North Waziristan when the release failed,' the Times reported, 'confirming that it had been a scam.' The USA Patriot Act makes it a crime to give payment or assistance to terror groups that could boost their support, and hostages' family members have said publicly that the federal government warned them against raising money for their loved ones' safe return. But retired Lt. Col. Oliver North told WMAL radio in Washington in June that he had direct knowledge of the negotiating process and was sure the Haqqani network had asked for a cash payment. Bergdahl, he said, 'was never regarded as a – quote – ""prisoner of war."" They all thought of him as a hostage and that’s the way they presented it. All they wanted was money.' Earnest's statement on Wednesday came in response to questions about a government-wide review of U.S. hostage policies, requested this summer by President Barack Obama. Bergdahl is back on active duty now, after five years of captivity . The Pentagon completed a review of his case in October but has yet to release it, citing the need for an internal review. Angry Republicans including some on the House Armed Services Committee claimed in the days before the midterm election just weeks ago that Democrats were holding it back for political advantage. The self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, a militant terror group that now controls large sections of Syria and Iraq, has executed three American hostages this year in gruesome beheading videos distributed via online social media. That group has reaped at least $20 million this year in hostage ransoms, according to Treasury Undersecretary David S. Cohen, but often decides that the propaganda value of videotaped killings outweighs the value of money. Bergdahl was released in May after the Obama administration made a different kind of trade – not for money, but for five high-value Taliban terrorists who had been held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba military detention facility. The enlisted soldier came under fire for allegedly deserting his U.S. Army unit in Afghanistan before he was captured by Taliban fighters. That group reportedly sold him to the Haqqani network, a notorious crime syndicate with centuries of history trading hostages for gold, opium and other commodities. The Haqqanis held Bergdahl for five years. He is now back on active duty and serves at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. Duncan Hunter Letters on Bergdahl Ransom uploaded by MailOnline .","Rep.

"Yolanda Ostoloza, 39, faces up to 15 years in jail after being convicted of sexually exploiting the girl . A Florida mother who brought her 15-year-old daughter more than 1,300 miles to New York to pimp her out to Super Bowl fans has been found guilty of sexually exploiting the teenager. Yolanda Ostoloza, 39, faces up to 15 years in prison after she was convicted of promoting prostitution and endangering the welfare of a child in Manhattan Supreme Court. She was arrested in January after undercover Bronx detectives set up a date with her daughter at the New York Hilton in Midtown and struck up a deal to pay $200 for an undisclosed sex act. The girl told detectives that she was just 15 and her mother was waiting for her at another hotel, the New York Daily News reported. 'Think about what a barely 15-year-old girl is supposed to be doing. Planning for her Sweet 16, preparing to get her driver's permit,' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Rachel Ehrhardt said in summations at the trail. 'Doing her homework during her sophomore year of high school. Maybe even thinking about a high school sweetheart.' 'But for [Ostoloza's daughter], her mother had another plan for her... sexually exploit her child for money.' Officers found Ostoloza waiting for her daughter at the Double Tree Metropolitan, where she was arrested and later charged. Her arrest was part of a NYPD crackdown on prostitution across the city during Superbowl week.

"Aleksey Vayner, the very determined Yale student with the infamous video resume, died this weekend, according to reports . The Yale student who catapulted to Internet infamy with a disastrous video resume he sent to a prospective employer has reportedly died at his home in Queens, New York after a friend sent him desperate messages on Facebook asking him to 'pick up the phone' and think of his mother. Aleksey Vayner passed away at the age of 29, according to the New York City Medical Examiner -  and reports from relatives suggest that he may have experienced a drug overdose. On Jan. 18, the night before his death, a friend wrote on Vayner's Facebook wall, 'Do not, anyone, sell this idiot ANY pills!.' This rest of the post is written in Russian and says, 'Damned egoist, pick up the phone, who's going to take care of mom? [you could] sell your source code and f**k off to costa rica. [even] paypal would pay you 2-3 hundred thousand. pick up the phone, bastard.' In response, just before midnight, Vayner angrily wrote back to his Facebook friend by responding 'Volodia, go to hell' in Cyrillic. A spokesman for the medical examiner told Ivygate that a man matching Vayner's description under the name of Alex Stone died at 8 a.m. on January 19th at Jamaica Hospital, Queens. She said the cause of death was still to be determined and the autopsy will take several weeks. 'It looks like he took some drugs or medicine, had a heart attack, a friend of his drove him to the hospital, and they couldn't resuscitate him,' said Boris Vayner, who identified himself as Aleksey's step-cousin to Gawker.com . 'Not exactly sure though, I'm too far away.' Public records seen by the MailOnline confirm that Vayner had changed his name in April 2012. It is believed that he decided to go under the name of Alex Stone after the video resume he sent to UBS for an investment banking job in 2006 went viral online and was mocked by millions. In the video, titled 'Impossible is Nothing,' a gravely serious Vayner attempts to prove his mental and physical fitness by talking about the meaning of success while lifting 495-pound weights, smacking tennis balls faster than 140 miles per hour, ball-dancing with a scantily-clad woman and breaking seven bricks with his hand. 'Ignore the losers, bring your A-game, your determination and your drive to the field, and the success will follow you,' he says in the video. The video was forwarded around Wall Street and quickly went viral. The Facebook posting to Aleksey's page the evening before his death that begins with a warning in English and carries on in Russian to ask him 'who's going to take care of your mom?' Vayner said his physical fitness was a testament to his mental stamina . The New York Times called it 'The Resume Mocked 'Round the World,' and Vayner told the newspaper that he thought he might never get a job in the financial industry as a result of the video's popularity. While the video became the laughing stock of Wall Street, Vayner said he was not amused. 'He said he feels like a victim,' the Times reported in October 2006, three months after the video was recorded. 'The job materials that were leaked and posted for public view included detailed information about him that allowed strangers to scrutinize and harass him, he said.' Even before he arrived as a freshman at Yale, Vayner had become known for exaggerating his own feats. At a 2002 event in New Haven for high-school seniors who have been admitted to Yale, Vayner told current students all about his abilities and specialised skills. He told Jordan Bassm a freshman student at the Ivy League college that he had taught tennis to Jerry Seinfeld and Harrison Ford and that the Dalai Lama had apparently written his college recommendation. Vayner included clips of himself skiing and chopping bricks in half with his palm . Vayner shows off his tennis skills in the video that he sent to UBS for an investment banking job . 'He talked for, like, six hours straight the first night,' said Bass to the New Yorker magazine after they investigated Vayner in 2006 following his notorious video job application. 'He had a lot of affiliations with élite institutions. He was an action star, an espionage expert, and a professional athlete. He would be on the C.I.A. firing range one day and, the next, at a martial-arts competition that took place in this secret system of tunnels underneath Woodstock, New York. 'Then he was at a skiing competition in Switzerland. He told us the Russian Mafia had him forging passports.' Struck by the outlandish claims of the prospective student, student journalist Bass investigated and eventually wrote a title for the Yale campus tabloid entitled 'CRAAZY PREFROSH LIES, IS JUST WEIRD'. Attending Yale despite the attention of the article, Vayner arrived with a CV that now boasted he had begun modelling for the price of $200 an hour, written a book about the Holocaust and founded a charity for troubled children. He also claimed to have won two tennis matches against Pete Sampras, retired from professional martial arts and mastered the art of 'bone setting'. Aleksey Vayner with an unidentified woman who is believed to be his wife . As an undergraduate at Yale - Aleksey made outlandish claims about his social and academic prowess that he included in his now notorious Impossible is Nothing video résumé . These amazing claims informed part of Vayner's video résumé which he sent to UBS and included the further claims that he was a an international rumba dancing specialist and could split a stack of bricks with his bare hands. Today, Vayner is listed online as the manager of a company called Ultimate Success Systems, LLC, and a nonprofit called Empower a Child.' It has also been reported that Vayner may have been married at some point. He has maintained a YouTube channel where he posts videos of himself performing athletic feats, such as punching through a block of wood and cracking bricks with his palm. In an interview from 2010 with motherboard.vice.com, Vayner described how the spread of his video had . made him feel 'like that Star Wars Kid' - referring to Ghyslain Raza, . the Canadian boy who had to seek therapy after a secret video of him playing . with a mock light sabre turned him into a laughing stock. 'I hit rock bottom.' The videoed interview took place at ROFLCon . during which he outlined his continuing passion for weight lifting, . martial arts, tennis and Buddhism. Aleksey Vayner at ROFLCon during which he outlined his continuing passion for weight lifting, martial arts, tennis and Buddhism . The news of Vayner's passing was first announced in an email to a group of his friends from Yale - which has been seen by the MailOnline. According to the email, his sister, Tamara and mother, also called Tamara are devastated by the news and are planning a memorial service for January 26th in New York. The author of the email recounted how when he last saw Vayner in December, he was applying to law school, coaching tennis, in good spirits and looking forward to the future. In his cover letter to UBS, Vayner said 'as a world-level athlete in several sports, I have developed an insatiable appetite for peak performance and continuous learning.' On his resume, Vayner cited  experience as an investment adviser at a firm called Vayner Capital Management.

"Was there ever a government quango quite so useless as the Met Office? From its infamous ‘barbecue summer’ washout of 2009 to the snowbound winter it failed to predict in 2010 and the recent forecast-defying floods, our £200 million-a-year official weather forecaster has become a national joke. But of all its recent embarrassments, none come close to matching the Met Office’s latest one. Without fanfare — apparently in the desperate hope no one would notice — it has finally conceded what other scientists have known for ages: there is no evidence that ‘global warming’ is happening. A chunk of ice is shown drifting after it separated from the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf off the north coast of Ellesmere Island in Canada. The Met Office has conceded there is no evidence that 'global warming' is happening . The Met Office quietly readjusted its temperature projections on its website on Christmas Eve. Until then, it had been confidently predicting temperature rises of at least 0.2 degrees per decade, with a succession of years exceeding even the record-breaking high of 1998. Its latest chart, however, confirmed in a press release earlier this week, tells a very different story: no more global warming is expected till at least 2017. According to Dr David Whitehouse of the independent think-tank the Global Warming Policy Foundation, the climbdown couldn’t be more dramatic or more devastating for the Met Office’s credibility. ‘They’re panicking. All the predictions they’ve been making about man-made global warming these past 20 years have started to come crashing about their ears.’ For two decades the Met Office has acted as Britain’s foremost cheerleader for climate change alarmism. In 2007, its Hadley Centre for climate change research produced a briefing document for the Government claiming its state-of-the-art computer models left no doubt: man-made global warming was a very real threat which needed to be addressed urgently by policy-makers. ‘The Met Office Hadley Centre has the highest concentration of outstanding people who do outstanding work, spanning the breadth of modelling, attribution, and date analysis, of anywhere in the world,’ claimed an expert from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) in the document. Many in the Government were impressed for, a year later, the 2008 Climate Change Act was passed by an overwhelming majority. The act has been described by veteran journalist Christopher Booker as the most expensive legislation in history, committing the government to as much as £734 billion (£18.3 billion a year for the next 40 years) in extra spending to ‘decarbonise’ the economy. It is also one of the reasons why our countryside is being ruined by ugly, noisy wind turbines. But what if carbon dioxide isn’t the culprit for global temperature changes? What if all the expensive, economy-ravaging, job-killing, environmentally destructive measures we’ve taken have been a spectacular waste of money? If so, the Met Office will be attacked for being not just risibly incompetent — but an active menace both to the integrity of science and to the nation’s wellbeing. Hence its defiant attempts to argue that nothing has changed and it’s business as usual. ‘The fact the new model predicts less warming, globally, for the coming five years does not necessarily tell us anything about long-term predictions of climate change for the coming century,’ it claimed yesterday. In other words: ‘Never mind that global warming stopped in 1997. It will come back with a vengeance one day. We’re just not quite so sure when.’ According to the Met, Britain is apparently experiencing more rain by volume and intensity . But according to the Met Office's own data - the England and Wales precipitation records dating back to 1766-  there has been nothing particularly abnormal about the recent rain . The Met Office confirmed in a press release earlier this week that no more global warming is expected till at least 2017 . This latest embarrassment comes just days after the Met Office was lambasted for yet another misleading claim, about the recent flooding. It said this is part of a growing national trend towards ‘extreme’ weather — as also heavily promoted by the BBC’s Environmental Analyst Roger Harrabin, and by scaremongering documentaries such as Channel 4’s Is Our Weather Getting Worse? According to the Met, Britain is apparently experiencing more rain by volume and intensity. ‘We have always seen a great deal of variability in UK extreme rainfall because our weather patterns are constantly changing, but this analysis suggests we are seeing a shift in our rainfall behaviour,’ said the Met Office’s top scientist, Professor Julia Slingo. ‘There’s evidence to say we are getting slightly more rain in total, but more importantly it may be falling in more intense bursts — which can increase the risk of flooding.’ But these claims appeared to be at best a dangerous fudge, at worst a complete nonsense. As is clear from the Met Office’s own data — the England and Wales precipitation records dating back to 1766 — there has been nothing particularly abnormal about the recent rain. Not only were there two years, 1872 and 1768, wetter than the supposed record-breaking year of 2012; but also, the Met Office appeared to have overlooked two very dry years (2003 and 2011) to prove its narrative that the past ten years. The Global Warming Policy Foundation’s Dr David Whitehouse believes the very notion of ‘extreme’ weather is an unscientific nonsense. ‘If you were to pick any period in history, you would soon find an example of an unusual weather event — maybe a heatwave in Russia or fires in Australia. Global Warming Policy Foundation's Dr David Whitehouse believes the very notion of 'extreme' weather is a nonsense. He said you could find examples in any period of history event, such as the fires in Australia . ‘Somewhere in the world, a weather record is being broken almost every day. This is normal. What’s not normal is when people try to impose on it some kind of invented trend.’ This is what happened just yesterday, when the scorching Australian heatwave that has caused bushfires was linked in both The Guardian and The Independent to global warming. The Met Office has subscribed to this sort of stance since at least 1990, when it became politicised under its then director John Houghton — the fanatical believer in the great global warming religion, who was also responsible for setting up the IPCC. Under Houghton’s stewardship, it became an article of faith that not only was man-made global warming real and dangerous, but that it was the primary job of the Met Office to spread the alarmist gospel. Dr Whitehouse notes that this is a sad betrayal of the Met Office’s traditional role: ‘When it comes to four or five-day weather forecasting, the Met Office is the best in the world,’ he says. ‘The tragedy is that, for the most part, the Met Office thinks weather forecasting is beneath it. Climate change is more glamorous — and brings in more money.’ And the Met Office’s obsession with climate change has wreaked havoc with its medium to long-term forecasting. That infamous ‘barbecue summer’ and its inability to foresee last November’s floods were the result of the same major flaw in its system: its computer models are all programmed on the assumption that as global CO2 levels increase, so will global warming. This means they’re continually predicting warmer weather, in contradiction of all the real world evidence. For two decades, the Met Office has abused its position of trust, authority and taxpayer-funded privilege to promote green ideology at the expense of scientific integrity. Never mind the mere £200 million we pay a year to fund the Met Office’s dodgy, Mystic Meg prognostications: the real bill for its incompetence runs into the billions. On March, 7 2013 Greg Clarke, Met Office Chairman wrote: . 'James Delingpole’s views misrepresent the Met Office’s reputation for world-class weather and climate forecasting and research (Mail). The UK can be rightly proud the Met Office is among the world’s top two national weather forecasting services. We’re proud that, in independent surveys, more than 90 per cent of the public regard our warnings as useful, and more than 80 per cent of the UK public trust our forecasts and warnings. This respect for our professionalism and impartiality hasbeen built over 150 years of forecasting for the nation. We aim to use our world-leading scientific expertise to protect life and property and increase prosperity and wellbeing right across the UK.

Whatever a journalist’s views are about climate change — and they have a right to air them — let’s not degrade the institutions on which the public rely.'","The £200 million-a-year official weather forecaster often gets it wrong .

"Daredevil tourists have a thrilling new ride to add to their bucket lists - the longest   rollercoaster zip line ride in the world. The nearly one-mile long attraction, which opened last Sunday, whizzes, dips and dives through the Ourimbah State Forest at TreeTop Adventure Park in Central Coast, Australia. The rollercoaster, called Crazy Rider Xtreme, starts 60ft above ground then zigzags through 40 obstacles, around 360-degree loops and in and out of 40 slaloms. Scroll down for video . Longest rollercoaster zip line: Crazy Rider Xtreme opened last Sunday and is nearly a mile long . Hold on tight: The five-minute ride starts 60ft above ground and then zigzags through 40 obstacles . It's also the country's first tree-based rollercoaster zip line. The marathon ride takes five minutes to complete and is three times as long as any other curved zip wire, surpassing Forever Florida in the US which previously held the title. The TreeTop Adventure Park website says: 'Combining the thrill and suspense of a rollercoaster with the flying sensations of zip lines, the Crazy Rider is an exhilarating experience open to a large range of age and abilities.' No getting off: The attraction is three times as long as any other curved  rollercoaster zip wire . 'It is not really about the speed but more about gravity, especially in the turns. The acceleration and deceleration is what makes the ride thrilling,' Sandrine Gaymard, the owner of the park, told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'Zip lines usually travel in a straight line but we thought it would be incredible to build some to go around the trees, up and down, and even with 360-degree loops to really ramp up the fun factor,' she said. The TreeTop Adventure Park has a shorter tree-based zip line that is 330m long . If you want to try something a little less heart racing, you can strap into the Pioneer zip line at the same site, which is nearly 1,100ft long. Sophisticated high-wire technology developed by the park owners and tree-ride maker Ecoline means the attractions allow trees to grow around them unrestricted. An independent arborist is also employed to monitor the health of the trees. Stomach churning: Sophisticated high-wire technology allow trees to grow around the ride unrestricted .

Twists, turns, heart in your mouth moments all interspersed with cruisey sections and squeals of joy.' While it's the longest rollercoaster zip line, Crazy Rider certainly isn't the longest zip line in the world. That honour goes to Italy's 1.3-mile-long Volo dell'Angelo (the Angel Flight) which travels in a straight line at speeds of up to 74 miles per hour and is said to be the world's highest continuous zip wire as well. Eye of the Jaguar, in Peru's Sacred Valley, is almost as long and reaches speeds of up to 68 miles per hour.

"A Lebanese pop star caused outrage in the Arab world by wearing a revealing dress during a talent show performance condemned by many as 'scandalous'. Haifa Wehbe, 38, was appearing on a live episode of Arab Star Academy, a pan-Arab TV music talent contest, donning a figure-hugging long black dress with revealing sheer panels. More than two million people watched the seductive performance and many women took to social media to criticise Wehbe for her racy choice of outfit. Scroll down for video . Haifa Wehbe, 38, was appearing on a live episode of Arab Star Academy, a pan-Arab TV music talent contest, donning a figure-hugging long black dress with revealing sheer panels . Commenting on footage of the performance on social media, many wrote 'scandalous' with one YouTube user writing: 'Art has limits and you, Haifa, have crossed the line'. Wehbe regularly causes a stir with her revealing outfits - especially among the Arab  world - where many women uphold strict conservative traditions of dress. Most of the negative reactions on social media came from  women in Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, women are required to cover up from head to toe, often with only their eyes exposed. One Egyptian woman tweeted: 'It is true that we got used to her wearing scandalous clothes but not to this extent…it was a shock for the viewers.' More than two million people watched the seductive performance and many women took to social media to criticise Wehbe for her racy choice of outfit . Some sick posts even suggested that Wehbe should be introduced to hard line ISIS militants with one man writing on Facebook: 'These type of Arab female celebrities need to meet the Islamic State.' Another shared an image of a man with a long beard holding a mobile phone with the caption 'hello…ISIS!!' - suggesting he was reporting the pop star to the terrorist group. In response to the online criticism, many fans weighed into the debate to defend the Lebanese pop star . The debate about the dress shows just how divided the Arab world has become on such matters. Dana Khairallah, a Lebanese lifestyle blogger, told the BBC: 'They think if women dress this way it would misrepresent our culture. 'I find that hypocritical. I see Arab girls dressing more provocatively in clubs but no one cares because there are no cameras. 'There's also an element of social media meanness in what is happening that drives this bullying of celebrities.' In response to the criticism from conservative viewers in the Arab world, thousands of the singer's fans posted messages of support on social media - with one highlighting the stark difference between her outfit and Kim Kardashian's recent photo shoot. Sawsun Abu Omar wrote: 'After Kim Kardahsian's attempt to break the internet, I find Haifa Wehbe's see-through dress on star academy to be quite modest.' Wehbe, pictured here in 2003, blamed the stage lighting in a tweet, saying the original dress appeared more modest but that she 'was surprised that it looked very different with the strong lighting on the stage' The Egyptian channel CBC, which airs the Star Academy TV show, issued an apology on its channel for the star's appearance on the show. Wehbe herself blamed the stage lighting in a tweet, saying the original dress appeared more modest but that she 'was surprised that it looked very different with the strong lighting on the stage.'

"Three teenage boys have been jailed for the fatal bashing of a 16-year-old boy who was lured to a bush reserve during a staged drug deal. Quinn De Campe died the day after being bashed, kneed and kicked by the three teens in Balga bushland in Perth's north in December  last year. But the sentence handed to the trio of teenagers is 'irrelevant' because it won't bring back their only son, his parents say. Quinn De Campe died the day after being fatally based by the three teenage boys on December 22 . Judge Denis Reynolds sentenced the three attackers on Thursday to six and a half years in jail for manslaughter, to be served concurrently with a four year sentence for aggravated armed robbery. The fourth boy was sentenced to three-and-a-half years behind bars. 'The sentence is irrelevant - nothing is going to change what's happened,' Quinn's father Vaughan De Campe told reporters outside court. But he and wife Shelley said it was important to discourage and hopefully diminish such senseless crimes, seen all too often on the streets. Family and friends comfort mother Shelley De Campe (centre) outside Perth's District Court on Thursday . The 16-year-old (centre) was lured to a bush reserve under the guise of a drug deal but attacked . 'Quinn grew up to believe that people's differences were to be celebrated and not judged. Ultimately, it led to him losing his life,' they said. 'Regardless of the sentence handed down today, it will never change the fact that our son has lost his life in a cowardly and brutal attack that was perpetrated by juveniles. 'It is us and our family that will live with this life sentence. Nothing will ever take away the pain of losing Quinn, our only child.' Judge Reynolds said the offending was an extremely serious example of its kind because Quinn had been lured to an isolated location and left there severely injured after being outnumbered three to one. 'The three of you were persistent,' he said. 'The three of you were unrelenting. 'Your whole focus was to get the money.' When they lured Quinn to the bush reserve and - brandishing a broken bottle - The teens assaulted him after he refused to give up his belongings, which included $175 to buy the cannabis. Quinn was punched, kneed and kicked so hard it left a shoe imprint on his head and caused his attacker to limp. Quinn was declared brain dead and died from traumatic brain injury the following day .

He was chased down when he tried to run away and was found bleeding, bruised and unconscious. He was declared brain dead and died from traumatic brain injury the following day in hospital. His attackers, who were around the same age, were initially charged with grievous bodily harm but that was later upgraded to murder. They last month pleaded guilty to manslaughter - a plea bargain accepted by the prosecution. Along with the fourth boy, they also pleaded guilty to aggravated armed robbery. Judge Reynolds said all the offenders had been initially remorseless, with one lying 'big time' to police. They had all developed remorse during the 11 months they have already served at Banksia Hill Juvenile Detention Centre, but in each case, that was overlaid with regret for the impact on themselves, he said. All will be eligible for parole after serving half of their terms.

"This series of brain scans shows the path a tiny parasitic tapeworm takes as it burrows its way through a man's brain . In the first case of its kind in Britain, the one centimetre long worm is seen travelling 5cm from the right side of the brain to the left over the space of four years. Known as Spirometra erinaceieuropaei, the worm which originates in the Far East, is extremely rare, with just 300 cases recorded worldwide since 1953. It causes inflammation of the body's tissues known as sparganosis, triggering seizures, memory loss and severe headaches. Very little is known about the worm, though it is thought people may be infected by accidentally consuming tiny infected crustaceans from lakes, eating raw meat from reptiles and amphibians, or by using a raw frog poultice as a Chinese remedy to calm sore eyes. This series of brain scans shows a tiny parasitic worm burrowing its way through a man's brain . The case is the first of its kind in the UK. The images show the one centimetre long worm travelling 5cm from the right side of the brain to the left . Surgeons managed to successfully remove the worm, which they found was a benign version. Had it been a more aggressive type, it could have laid eggs, which then feed off the brain as they grow. To identify the exact species of worm, surgeons at Addenbrooke's NHS Trust in Cambridge, sequenced one particular gene. The so-called 'barcode of life' revealed the parasite was the more benign of the two sparganosis-causing creature. But their research found the worm was resistant to current anti-tapeworm drugs and as more people travel to exotic destinations, the risk of becoming infected increases. In response British scientists examined its DNA to spot weaknesses that can be targeted with other existing drugs. Dr Effrossyni Gkrania-Klotsas from Addenbrooke's, said: 'We did not expect to see an infection of this kind in the UK, but global travel means that unfamiliar parasites do sometimes appear. 'We can now diagnose sparganosis using MRI scans, but this does not give us the information we need to identify the exact tapeworm species and its vulnerabilities. 'Our work shows that, even with only tiny amounts of DNA from clinical samples, we can find out all we need to identify and characterise the parasite. 'This emphasises just how important a global database of worm genomes is to allow us to identify the parasite and determine the best course of treatment. 'Additionally, this information can be paired with our work in global travellers' infection to give additional insights in what infections other patients can get in specific destinations.' The study looked at discovering targets in the genome for existing licensed drugs which could prove to be the best way to treat this rare disease. This data could contribute to the growing global database for identifying parasites and identifying new treatments, according to the report, published Genome Biology. Known as Spirometra erinaceieuropaei, the worm which originates in the Far East, is extremely rare, with just 300 cases recorded worldwide since 1953 . Surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge successfully removed the worm . They identified it as the less aggressive of the species of worm. Had it been the more aggressive type it could have laid eggs, which feed of the brain . Dr Hayley Bennett, of Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said: 'The clinical histology slide offered us a great opportunity to generate the first genome sequence of this elusive class of tapeworms. 'However, we only had a minute amount of DNA available to work with - just 40 billionths of a gram. 'So we had to make difficult decisions as to what we wanted to find out from the DNA we had.' The researchers used the draft sequence to look for similarities and differences from other, previously sequenced, tapeworm species in the GeneDB pathogen database. This has revealed more about Spirometra erinaceieuropaei's biology than ever before, for example, the worm has a large selection of molecular motors for moving proteins around the cell, which could underpin the large changes in body shape and environmental adaptions that the worm undergoes during its complicated life cycle. Dr Matt Berriman of Faculty of the Sanger Institute said: 'For this uncharted group of tapeworms, this is the first genome to be sequenced and has allowed us to make some predictions about the likely activity of known drugs. 'The genome sequence suggests that the parasite is naturally resistant to albendazole - an existing anti-tapeworm drug. 'However, many new drug targets that are being explored for other tapeworms are present in this parasite and could offer future clinical possibilities.'","Surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge removed the worm .

'Hertfordshire Constabulary have . suddenly got this unexpected budget strain dumped on them at literally a . month's notice. It's not on.' Hertfordshire Police has not revealed details of the bill, but they are in talks with the Home . Office about a grant for 'unexpected or exceptional costs'. This is only approved if expenditure . threatens a force's budget, which would need to be more than one per . cent of its overall spend - or about £1.8million, according to the Daily . Telegraph. Hertfordshire Police said the . Bilderberg Group has agreed to contribute some of the cost of security, . but taxpayers will have to cover the rest. A spokesman added: 'We will also be seeking funding from other sources to help cover the costs of policing and are in discussion with the Home Office about other funding sources.'

Ring of steel: Three police officers man a gate on the outskirts of the hotel . 'Outrageous': The huge police operation drafted in to monitor the four-day event, which has previously attracted mass demonstrations, could cost the British taxpayer as much as £2million or more, it has been claimed . Amid tight security, members of the . press and a handful of protesters gathered in a fenced-off area just . inside the grounds of the hotel today, but around half a mile from the . redbrick hotel. As delegates arrived for the four-day meeting from around 10.30am, protesters heckled their cars, shouting 'scum', 'pay your taxes' and 'shame on you' as they disappeared down the driveway. The demonstrators, who gathered in the sunshine to wave anti-capitalist placards, play guitars and listen to speeches, were searched for alcohol and drugs as they entered the site. Michael Meacher, the Labour MP, called the delegates the 'real top brass of Western finance capitalism'. He . said he believed Osborne would be attending for the sixth time this . year, and named the meeting's 'steering committee' as Henri de Castries, . the chairman of Axa, Peter Thiel, 'a billionaire venture capitalist', . Thomas Enders from EADS, the defence manufacturing company, and Peter . Sutherland, the chairman of Goldman Sachs.

Campaigners: Amid tight security, members of the press and a handful of protesters gathered in a fenced-off area just inside the grounds of the hotel, but around half a mile from the redbrick hotel . Speaking in the pen near the hotel . gates, he said: 'They are the leaders of the biggest banks, the biggest . multinational companies, people from the UN institutions like the World . Bank, World Trade Organisation, several EU commissioners and several . politicians from the US, Canada, the UK and the EU. 'These are people who are all in the most dominant positions in the governance of Western capitalism. 'They . only meet in order to concert their plans about the future of . capitalism over the immediate future period - the next year or two. 'My objection is that it's being done in utter secrecy with the police keeping everyone else out.' 'Real top brass': It is thought billionaire executives from multinational companies, high-ranking political figures and even members of royal families are among the 130 or so attendees . Keeping watch: The traditionally secretive conference, which has taken place since 1954, is expected to be attended by politicians, bank bosses, businessman and European royalty . Tight security: Police officers stand guard on the roads surrounding The Grove hotel near Watford, which is hosting the annual Bilderberg conference of top politicians and businesspeople from around the world . The politician said although he has . no problem with powerful people meeting in private, the numbers at the . Bilderberg meeting means they should be held accountable. 'When . 130 of the leaders from all across the West get together, and many of . these are billionaires, they are people who are immensely wealthy and . immensely powerful,' he said. 'And . when they all get together, it's not just to have a chat about the . latest problem, it is to concert plans for the future of capitalism in . the West. On the guest list: Among those attending the conference will be Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls (left) and Conservative MP Kenneth Clarke (right) Delegates: Christine Lagarde (left), managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and former Labour MP Peter Mandelson (right), who is now chairman of Global Counsel, will also be taking part in the event . Also attending is Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt . 'That is on a very different scale.' Chancellor . George Osborne and his Labour counterpart Ed Balls will be there along . with Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt of Google. They are among the 140 people, . including only 14 women - who will this week discuss topics such as . ‘cyber warfare’ and ‘jobs, entitlement and debt’. Delegates never reveal exactly what is discussed, but it will involve the key issues these leaders believe the world faces. Alex Jones, the U.S. television personality and Bilderberg researcher, said: 'It is very, very sinister. 'Not everybody who goes to Bilderberg, from my research, is a scoundrel or a villain. 'But there are definitely villains who are there who are basically trying to organise government and business.' Judd Charlton, a ventriloquist from Camden in north London, said: 'We are basically here to bring down the parasites who are drug dealers and bank collapses who seem to want to destroy this world.'","Attendees thought to include politicians, top business executives and royalty .

"Jesamine Hearsum, 32, from Stroud, beat, strangled and sexually assaulted her friend after holding her hostage when she refused to have sex with her . A lesbian woman beat, strangled and sexually assaulted her friend during a hour-long hostage ordeal after she refused to have sex with her. Jesamine Hearsum, 32, stripped naked and repeatedly attacked the woman after trapping her in her home in Stroud, Gloucestershire. Gloucester Crown Court heard today that Hearsum even threatened the victim with a knife when she repeatedly refused her advances. She later bombarded the victim with a series of texts and Facebook messages, even though she had already been arrested over the other offences. But Hearsum was spared jail, despite pleading guilty to false imprisonment, sexual assault, assault by beating and harassment. Judge Jamie Tabor QC sentenced Hearsum to two years prison, suspended for two years. He also imposed a three-year restraining order banning Hearsum from contacting the woman. The defendant was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for 10 years. At an earlier hearing, prosecutor Julian Kesner told the court  that Hearsum had rung her friend - who had a boyfriend - in July this year because she wanted to talk about problems in her relationship. The victim then went to Hearsum's home, before they went together to a nearby pub. Hearsum had already drunk three cans of lager and drank another pint of beer at the pub, the court was told. The pair returned to Hearsum's home at about 9pm and went inside. But when the victim went to use the bathroom, she noticed the front door had been locked from the inside and the key was missing. The woman told Hearsum she had to go home, but Hearsum replied that she was 'not going anywhere'. Mr Kesner said: 'The lady was worried and she said to the defendant that she had to go. But the defendant replied that she was not going anywhere. 'She repeatedly asked the victim to stay the night and go to bed with her. Her repeated invitations were declined. 'The defendant was acting in a bizarre way. She took all her clothes off and asked the lady for a kiss. This was again declined.' The court heard how thing 'degenerated' after that, with Hearsum attempting to strangle the victim and punching her around the head. He added: 'She started to strangle the victim who appears to have started to slump and lose consciousness. At that point the defendant stopped. Hearsum was spared jail after admitting sexual assault, false imprisonment, harassment and assault when she appeared at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) 'The victim was in tears. The defendant put her clothes back on then attacked the victim again, grabbing her by the clothes and grabbing her breasts and undoing her jeans. 'It was during that attack that the defendant pushed her hand inside the victim's trousers and knickers.' The court heard how the victim managed to use her phone to contact her boyfriend on Facebook, who called the police. But Hearsum still managed to attack her victim and threaten her with a knife before officers arrived at her home. Mr Kesner said: 'The victim succeeded in using her phone to contact her boyfriend on Facebook and asked him to call the police. 'The defendant saw her using the phone and when she knew she had called the police she started to punch her, once on the cheek and the rest on the top of the head. She stopped after a few minutes. 'She then went into the kitchen and returned with a knife with a serrated edge. She threatened the victim with it.' When police arrived, Hearsum admitted the offences and was bailed. But she soon started sending the victim texts which - although not threatening - were harassing, the court was told. Paul Grumbar, defending, said Hearsum was a woman who was 'emotionally immature, easily involved and easily hurt'. But a psychiatric nurse who had assessed Hearsum told the court she did not need any mental health treatment. Stephen Mooney, defending at the earlier hearing, said the victim had made a statement saying she did not want to see Hearsum jailed. She had been 'objective, rational and humane' towards Hearsum, he said. Talking about the defendant, Mr Mooney said: 'She is an unsophisticated woman who lacks confidence, loves animals and clearly can offer a lot to the world. She places great store in having a loving, caring, nurturing relationship. ' He also said that the alcohol and her anti-depressant medication had combined to create a 'dreadful cocktail of events' that night.","Jesamine Hearsum, 32, beat, strangled and sexually assaulted her victim .

"It's one of Melbourne's most iconic pieces of property. Brighton beaches' latest bathing box is up for auction next month, the first of Bayside council's newly built weatherboard-clad structures for sale. Box 57a, covered in a variety of beach blues, is the ultimate luxury for south east Melbourne residents who want a bit of protection from the elements, the first new one sold for the summer season. A definite money spinner for council, the cost of building them is believed to only come to around the $15,000 to $20,000 mark but if you want to buy them you could be in for more than $200,000. Scroll down to video . Bathing box 57a (pictured) is expected to sell at auction next month for more than $200,000 . Bathing box 57a (pictured far left) is the first of Bayside council's newly built weatherboard structures for sale . 'The prices have ranged,' said Hockingstuart real estate agent John Clarkson,'we have achieved in the excess of $200,000 but lately it's dropped back a little to between $160,000 to $200,000.' But this new release, he expects will hit the $200,000 plus mark when it goes to auction, with the plus being there is no neighbour, with a gap before the next box. 'It's a summer sensation, a great christmas present,' he said. While bathing boxes date back many years, Mr Clarkson was the first to sell one by private auction in 1999. 'Used to just have a number of people on a name and list,' he said, 'at the first auction it sold for $58,000.' The last box he sold was in February for $175,000 and had been in the same family for 40 years. Bathing boxes are an icon at Brighton beach in Melbourne south east . Bayside residents are the only one that can purchase the iconic bathing boxes, which shelters them from all the elements on Brighton beach . 'They're iconic, there's only 86 of them, you have to be a Bayside ratepayer to make a purchase.' He says the colourful wonders have been 'world famous' and some families keep the traditional going for decades. '(residents)Really protective of them, and so few opportunities to buy,' he said. 'They're very well known to people all over the world, there's so many pictures and paintings across the world.' Mr Clarkson expects buyer interest will vary on the day of the auction, depending on the weather. How about that view? Situated right on the beach bathing boxes are very popular but also very expensive to buy . Bathing boxes come with a great view and nearby harbour . 'It's weather pacific as to whether we get a good crowd.' 'Last one I had it was bucketing down and we crammed 40 people in the box, another one was in total sunshine and we had about 200 on the beach.'

"A woman who drowned her newborn baby in a toilet did it because she was afraid of losing her job if she had a child, a court has heard. Nitrogen plant worker Marzena Kowalski, 30, thought she had committed the perfect crime when in August last year she gave birth on her parents' toilet and then immediately drowned the baby. But after telling her distraught parents she had suffered a miscarriage, an autopsy revealed the baby died from drowning. She then admitted to the killing when quizzed by police. Marzena Kowalski, 30, pictured during her court appearance where she admitted to killing the newborn . Judges in the trial (pictured) of Kowalski heard she was now three months pregnant again and bitterly regretted killing her previous child . Appearing in court this week, Kowalski - from the small village of Sniadowko in south-eastern Poland - told the judge that she had kept the pregnancy secret because she had been worried that her boss would sack her if he found out. And she admitted killing the newborn out of fear that he would fire her if she became a mother. She told the court: 'I was afraid that my employer would not extend my contract and that I would not be able to find work if I had a small child.' She then told the court that she was again three months pregnant and that she bitterly regretted what she had done. Her stunned co-worker Michal Kowalczyk, 27, said: 'We often saw her walking around, chatting and laughing as normal. 'She didn't look pregnant and didn't let on that she was. 'When we found out what she had done we were completely shocked. It just seems so out of character.'","Mother in Poland drowned her baby instantly after giving birth on a toilet .

"Chinese officials are planning to lift spirits  this winter - by putting up thousands of metres of plastic sheeting printed with green shrubs. The waterproof sheeting has been put up to mask hedges that have lost their leaves in the city of Changchun, the capital of north-eastern China's Jilin Province.

'We want to try and cheer people up a bit by putting some greenery around to make them feel better.' He added: 'If the plastic hedges are greeted favourably by locals, then we might consider similar initiatives around the city. 'We would not rule out plastic flowers as well.' The images were greeted both by people who rubbished the idea and those who welcomed the initiative as a way of brightening the area up in winter .

"A Fort Carson soldier charged with murder in the slaying of his soldier-girlfriend on Valentine's Day 2013 did not intended to kill her and should not be found guilty of murder, his attorney told a military jury Wednesday. Sgt. Montrell Lamar Anderson Mayo should be convicted of a lesser charge because he was in a 'crazy state of madness' when he and Sgt. Kimberly Walker quarreled, military defense lawyer Capt. Michael Gold said. Walker, 28, was found dead on a bed sprinkled with rose petals at a motel in Colorado Springs near Fort Carson. She had been beaten and asphyxiated, investigators said. Fort Carson soldier Sgt. Montrell Lamar Anderson Mayo was charged with murder in the slaying of his soldier-girlfriend Sgt. Kimberly Walker on Valentine's Day 2013 did not intended to kill her and should not be found guilty of murder, his attorney told a military jury . Prosecutors said Walker was trying to break up with Mayo, who was charged with premeditated murder and assault. Both sides made closing arguments in Mayo's court-martial at Fort Carson on Wednesday. The jury of five Army officers began deliberating Wednesday. Walker, of Cincinnati, was stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas. She was visiting Mayo, who was stationed at Fort Carson and is from Greenville, South Carolina. The lead prosecutor, Capt. Amy Foley, argued Mayo should be convicted of premeditated murder, saying he hit Walker three times in the back of the head with a glass and then smothered her with a pillow when he realized she was still alive. Gold acknowledged his client struck Walker but said he didn't mean to kill her. When she collapsed to the floor, Mayo thought she was dead and placed her on the bed amid the flower petals to make a kind of altar, the defense attorney said. Sgt. Kimberly Walker's family won the right to re-install 6ft, 7,000lb SpongeBob SquarePants headstones a year after their soldier daughter was murdered . 'He had just killed the woman he loved,' Gold said. The attorney said prosecutors did not prove Mayo tried to smother Walker and suggested the angle of her head had cut off her air supply as she lay unconscious. Prosecutors dismissed Foley's account as unlikely. Premeditated murder carries a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Sentences were not immediately available for the lesser crimes the jury could consider: unpremeditated murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter. Gold asked the jury to convict Mayo of one of the manslaughter counts. Walker, a corporal at the time of her death, was given a posthumous promotion to sergeant. Separately, Fort Carson officials postponed a hearing Wednesday to determine whether another soldier should be court-martialed in the shooting death of a 19-year-old comrade. The lead defense attorney said he had not had time to review all the evidence. Spc. Jeffery T. Page, 23, of Perrysburg, Ohio, is charged with murder in the death of Spc. Adrian M. Perkins of Pine Valley, California, in May while both were deployed in Jordan. The Army has not publicly discussed a motive or the circumstances surrounding the shooting.","Sgt.

"Prince Charles will break with the Queen’s habit of discretion when he becomes King and continue to speak out on issues close to his heart, it was claimed today. According to an unnamed source quoted in The Guardian, the heir to the throne is ‘ready to reshape the monarch’s role’ when he accedes to the throne. The newspaper claimed Charles wants to make ‘heartfelt interventions’ in national life, in stark contrast to his mother who rarely utters a word on matters of public debate – including September’s Scottish referendum. Prince Charles (pixtured) will break with the Queen’s habit of discretion when he becomes King and will continue to speak out on issues close to his heart, it was claimed today . The Prince frequently speaks his mind, often controversially, on issues that he feels passionately about such as the environment, farming, health, education and architecture. While some see his interventions as well-meaning, others – including some former ministers – have accused him of meddling. Next week the Supreme Court will rule on a legal battle by The Guardian to publish 27 of Charles’s so-called ‘black spider memos’, correspondence sent by the Prince to ministers on a variety of issues affecting public life. Clarence House, backed by former attorney general Dominic Grieve, has argued that the Prince has a right to express his opinions and for those views to be kept secret in order to protect the monarchy’s political neutrality. The Queen (pictured) rarely utters a word on matters of public debate – including September’s Scottish referendum . But critics of the Prince say his ‘meddling’ and ‘lobbying’ over national affairs have put him in an invidious position. Now what the paper describes as a ‘well-placed source’ says of his future role: ‘He will be true to his beliefs and contributions. 'Rather than a complete reinvention to become a monarch in the mould of his mother, the strategy will be to try and continue with his heartfelt interventions, albeit checking each for tone and content to ensure it does not damage the monarchy. ‘Speeches will have to pass the following test: would it seem odd because the Queen wouldn’t have said it or would it seem dangerous?’ The paper also quotes Patrick Holden, an adviser to the Prince on sustainability, as saying: ‘The Prince understands the need to be careful about how he expresses concerns…but I do think he will keep doing exactly that.’ Clarence House described the claims as ‘speculative’, but a spokesman added: ‘The Prince of Wales cares deeply about this country and has devoted most of his working life to helping individuals and organisations to make a difference for the better.’","Prince will make 'heartfelt interventions' in national life when he accedes .

"An American town who were bidding to become the first in the country to ban tobacco sales have dropped the plan after widespread public outcry. Officials in Westminster, Massachusetts had proposed to ban the products from the town's stores to stop young people from taking up smoking . A vote on the plan had been due to take place last week, but a rowdy opposition made up of local people and businesses meant the public meeting had to be ended early. Opponents of the plan by officials in Westminster, Massachusetts to ban local businesses from selling tobacco products protest at a recent public meeting . Yesterday, the board reconvened and voted 2-1 to drop the proposal with chairwoman Andrea Crete the only one to say the plan should be kept under consideration. At the meeting board member Ed Simoncini explained how he was against the plans. In a motion to drop it he said: 'The Town is not in favour of the proposal, and therefore I am not in favour of the proposal.' After the vote was passed he then added: 'You made the difference. It didn't go as smoothly as we would have liked, but thank you.' Meanwhile Ms Crete said she was disappointed saying: 'We could have made Westminster tobacco-free in the sense children would have no exposure to tobacco at the stores. 'We didn't want to stop people from smoking in private but unfortunately that's the way it came off. The initial meeting when the vote was due to take place last week was ended after just 25 minutes when boos and shouts from some among the several hundred people who crowded a school gym began to drown out those registered to speak. Ms Crete and the other board members were escorted out by police, and the crowd dispersed. Westminster Health Board chairwoman Andrea Crete had backed the proposal and said it was unfortunate residents thought they wanted to ban people from smoking in their own homes . The proposal split the central Massachusetts town of 7,700 residents, with some fearing business would be lost if they were unable to sell tobacco products. Store owner Brian Vincent told the Boston Globe he helped gather recall signatures, as tobacco products make up more than 5 per cent of his sales and bring customers who buy other items. And fellow opponent Joyce McGuire said: 'I think people are really angry because they feel this is being shoved down their throats. Tobacco industry groups also called the plan bad policy. However, the American Lung Association said Westminster would be the first community in the U.S. to take such sweeping action. Town resident Vicki Tobin, a mother of three young boys, was among those who supported the ban, last week calling it 'a great step in a positive way to promote a healthy town.'","Officials in Westminster, Massachusetts proposed to ban tobacco sales .

"In April this year, Emily Whitehead's family had almost given up hope. The brave six-year-old had been fighting leukaemia for two years, only to relapse for a second time during intensive chemotherapy treatment in February. Doctors had exhausted all the traditional treatments as Emily could not remain in remission for long enough to attempt a bone marrow transplant. So her desperate parents, Kari and Tom, started looking at more radical options. Scroll down for videos... Fighting fit: Emily (seen left during treatment in April) has now been in remission from cancer for seven months . Big hugs: Emily was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in May 2010 . 'We made the . decision that we needed to go somewhere else,' said Mrs Whitehead. 'We needed to . try something new, different and cutting-edge.' So they turned to the Cancer Center at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, which is involved in testing a pioneering new therapy. Doctors suggested they sign Emily up to a clinical trial that would use a disabled form of HIV to carry cancer-fighting genes into her T-cells (disease fighting cells). The hope was that this would re-programme her immune system to recognise the cancer cells and start killing them. Several adults had already been enrolled in the study at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and had . responded well, but as it was so new the treatment wasn't without risks. But time was running out for Emily, who is also known as Emma. Mr Whitehead said: 'We were told that we were down to 48 hours of making a decision or she could start having organ failure.' They comforted themselves with the knowledge that even if the treatment didn't work, it would provide doctors with information that could help them save other sick children. So on April 17, the then six-year-old became the first child to have the therapy known as CTL019. Emily during her therapy - at first she suffered an adverse reaction, which was treated with an arthritis drug . Now in remission, Emily enjoys walking her dog who comforted her when she was ill . Emily with her proud parents: 'She has never complained' they revealed . The . family had been warned Emily could experience flu-like symptoms a few . days after her re-engineered T-cells were injected back into her. But her symptoms were far . more serious than doctors anticipated. She became critically ill and was . admitted to intensive care at the children's hospital. On April 24, . doctors told her parents she had a one in 1,000 chance of surviving the . night. Trial leader Dr Stephan Grupp and his team realised that the level of a certain protein had become very elevated as a . result of the T-cells growing in Emily's body. This same protein is . involved in rheumatoid arthritis, and there is a drug for that disease . that turns off production of that particular protein. The team . administered the drug to Emily, with dramatic results. Almost overnight, her . breathing improved, her fever dropped and her blood pressure was back to . normal. Mrs Whitehead said Emily inspired them with how she coped. 'She's extremely smart and creative. She's funny - she makes us laugh all the time. She never complains,' she said. Emily is very creative according to her parents, and loves playing with her dog . Kira and Tom faced the agonising decision of whether or not to put their daughter forward for a clinical trial . Emily during a consultation with Dr Grupp and her parents Tom and Kari . Dr Grupp led the clinical trial, which was life-saving for Emily . Her husband added: 'She told us from the beginning that she would continue to fight and do . what we asked as long as we were there with her. We've stuck . together as a team. She's definitely our hero.' Several weeks after her T-cell infusion, they were . able to conduct a bone marrow test to find out if the therapy had worked. 'Three weeks after receiving the . treatment, she was in remission,' said Dr Grupp. Emily was diagnosed with the most common childhood cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in May 2010. Unfortunately her case, like 15 per cent of sufferers, was resistant to traditional treatment. She was put forward for an experimental therapy known as CTL019. In certain cancers, including the . type of ALL that Emily was battling, a subset of cells in the immune . system become leukaemia. These are called B cells. Another set of cells . in the immune system, called T-cells, normally recognise and attack . invading disease. But in cancers like ALL, the abnormal leukemia cells . fly under the radar of the normal T-cells that are meant to kill them. In the experimental treatment, her T-cells were collected from her blood, then . re-engineered in a lab to recognise and attach to a protein called CD19 . that is found only on the surface of B cells. To do this they used a gutted HIV virus, called a lentivirus, to carry special receptors into the T-cells. There is no risk of HIV infection from a lentivirus. When the . re-engineered cells were put back they dispersed . throughout the body to find and kill cancerous B cells. Emily had an additional drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis to tackle a side-effect of the therapy and has been in remission for seven months. 'Emily completely . responded to her T-cell therapy. We checked her bone marrow for the . possibility of disease again at three months and six months out from her . treatment, and she still has no disease whatsoever. The cancer-fighting . T-cells are still there in her body.' He added that they need to see the remission go on for a couple of years before they can think about whether she is cured or not. But, after spending years . in treatment, Emily went home in June and now enjoys going to school, playing . football and walking her dog Lucy. 'T-cell therapy was really the only option left for Emily,' said Mr Whitehead. 'But we entered her into the trial really hopeful, and from the . very beginning we just really had a good feeling about it. So all along . we said, ""it just has to work, it has to work for Emily"" – and it did.' The scientists said although the . results were very promising, much more research needs to be done to see . whether the therapy is a viable, safe and long-term solution for . controlling certain cancers in children and adults. Ken Campbell, Clinical Information Officer at Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research, said the results of the study were encouraging for both children and adults diagnosed with leukaemia. 'Treatments which modify the body’s own immune system to fight leukaemia have shown much promise in recent years,' he said. 'What is significant about [the] therapy is that the severe side-effects associated with this form of treatment seem to be greatly reduced when combined with other drugs. 'This is a small study of just 12 patients. Larger clinical trials are needed to determine how effective this treatment could be and as a result it should be some time before it is available in the UK.' Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia presented their latest findings at the American Society of Hematology’s annual meeting in Atlanta. They found nine out of 12 patients in the trial, which included Emily and one other child, responded to the treatment. Their goal is to treat another 12 patients over the next year.

"A British ISIS fighter who has threatened to return home has urged Muslims in the UK to avenge the murder of a Saudi Arabian woman in Essex. A man using the nom de guerre Abu Rashash Britani has previously claimed that he and other British insurgents have been ordered to return to Britain once they have finished fighting in Iraq and Syria by the fanatical ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Following the murder of 31-year-old PHD student Nahid Almanea in Colchester, Essex on Tuesday, Abu Rashash Britani said: 'I call upon any brother to take up a knife and kill as they did #colchester'. Scroll down for video . Jihadist: Abu Rashash Britani (picture taken from his Twitter account) has previously claimed that he and other British insurgents have been ordered to return home once they have finished fighting in Iraq and Syria . Following the murder of 32-year-old PHD student Nahid Al Manea in Colchester yesterday, Abu Rashash Britani urged Muslims to carry out revenge attacks . Abu Rashash Britani took  to Twitter to express anger over the murder of PHD student Nahid Al Manea . A previous tweet by Abu Rashash suggests Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, head of ISIS, will target the UK with homegrown fighters . Anti-terror investigators in London are already examining claims in a tweet by Abu Rashash that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, head of ISIS, is targeting the UK with homegrown fighters. Baghdadi, who has a £6million bounty on his head, is considered the world's most dangerous terrorist leader. Now, following the murder of a Saudi woman of Ms Almanea in Colchester - which police believed may have been inspired by her conservative Muslim clothing - Abu Rashash Britani called for revenge attacks. 'These kuffar getting out of hand, dare they touch a #Muslimah. I call upon any brother to take up a knife and kill as they did #colchester,' he posted on Twitter. Drawing comparisons to the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby outside his barracks in Greenwich last year, the ISIS fighter added: '#colchester attack is cowardly act. At least when our noble brothers, killers of #leerigby did so they killed a soldier not a civilian.' Twitter has since suspended the account used by Abu Rashash Britani. Nahid Almanea was found bleeding to death at 10.40am on Tuesday on a footpath in Colchester. She was wearing a dark blue robe called an Abaya, as well as a multi-coloured hijab scarf, leading police to believe she may have been targeted for religious reasons. A 52-year-old man from Colchester was arrested in connection with the incident. Officers are thought to . have requested extra time to question him. Murder hunt: Police have revealed the woman found battered to death in Colchester yesterday morning was wearing a full-length robe and a hijab as they investigate whether the attack was racially motivated . Probe: Police are appealing for anyone with information. It is the second brutal murder in Colchester since March . Abu Rashash Britani has previously . declared: 'I my brother intend to go back to #UK under the order of our . Ameer Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi #foreignpolicy.' It was the first time it had been suggested that Baghdadi is preparing to . send his battle-hardened and highly trained ISIS fighters back to the . UK. The revelation came as . David Cameron warned that Britain cannot afford to ignore the chaos in . Iraq and Syria because of the risk that British jihadis will bring their . murderous tactics back to the UK. He . told MPs: 'I disagree with those people who think this is nothing to do . with us and if they want to have some sort of extreme Islamist regime . in the middle of Iraq, that won't affect us. It will. 'The . people in that regime – as well as trying to take territory – are also . planning to attack us here at home in the United Kingdom. So the right . answer is to be long-term, hard-headed, patient and intelligent with the . interventions that we make.' Mr Cameron, who described the . estimated 400 British fighters in the region as 'the most serious threat . to Britain's security that there is today', later chaired a meeting of . Britain's National Security Council. In . a statement, No 10 said British military intervention was 'not on the . table'.

He is called the 'new Osama Bin Laden' but even Al Qaeda have  distanced itself from his bloodstained methods and goals. The identity of Abu Rashash Britani is not known, but he is thought to be linked to a group of eight Britons from London and Portsmouth operating as part of a unit called the British Kataa'ib, meaning British Brigades. Britons in Syria are encouraging others in the UK to follow them by offering a rough travel guide for would-be jihadists. In a series of postings, they advise people to travel light and bring a smartphone for internet access, but to leave religious books at home to avoid suspicion when travelling through airports. They highlight the need for visas for those heading to Turkey, the main 'gateway' border to Syria, and even detail the type of plug adaptors new recruits will need to charge their electronic devices. One Briton, who goes by the alias Abu Abdullah al-Britani, told would-be militants on the Ask.fm website to delete 'jihad pics' from their phones in case they are searched.

"Pittsburgh Penguins forward Pascal Dupuis is expected to be out for at least six months after being diagnosed with a blood clot in his lung, the National Hockey League team announced on Wednesday. 'Pascal had a blood clot in his leg that traveled to his lung,' said Pittsburgh team doctor Dharmesh Vyas. 'In medical terms, that is a deep vein thrombosis resulting in a pulmonary embolism.' This is not the first time the 35-year-old Canadian has been diagnosed with blood clot problems. In January, Dupuis was treated for a blood clot following knee surgery.

Aller (Getty/AFP/File) Doctors put him on blood thinners at the time and will continue with that treatment for his latest problem. 'This is the second such incident that we know of for Pascal,' Vyas said. 'The treatment is at least six months of blood thinners, during which time he will not be able to play hockey. Other than that, his condition is stable.' The news comes less than a week after Dupuis delivered one of his best games of the season, scoring two goals on eight shots in the Penguins 2-1 win over Toronto. The Penguins said the clot was discovered Monday after Dupuis had complained of chest pain. Dupuis has six goals and five assists in 16 games this season. He missed the majority of the 2013-14 season after tearing his ACL.","Pittsburgh Penguins forward Pascal Dupuis, 35, is suffering his second blood clot - his first was in January .

"A lost painting by artist John Duncan Fergusson which was discovered in an attic has sold for a record £638,500. When it went under the hammer at Christie's Modern British and Irish Art Evening Sale in London yesterday evening, it had a guide price of £80,000. But it ended up selling for eight times the estimate to an anonymous bidder and a world record for the artist at auction. John Duncan Fergusson's 'Poise', which dates back to 1916, sold for a record £638,500 at Christie's auction house in London . Fergusson painted 'Poise', of a woman posing in a blue dress, in 1916. But it hasn't been seen publicly after it was shown in London at the artist's 1918 Connell Gallery exhibition. The oil painting had been hidden away before being discovered in a French attic. The painting previously belonged to a couple who were friends of Claude Monet before it was rediscovered in the attic in Giverny by their grandchildren. Prior to the sale, Andre Zlattinger, senior director, Head of Modern British Art, Christie's London, described 'Poise' as a 'a really exceptional work, of huge beauty and appeal'. The oil painting, pictured, was offered with a guide price of £80,000 but sold for nearly eight times that . Mr Zlattinger added that he expected the artwork to do 'very well at auction'. He said: 'The market for modern British and Irish art continues to be strong, appealing to collectors worldwide. 'We are very pleased with the result for John Duncan Fergusson's recently discovered masterpiece, 'Poise', which sparked fiercely competitive bidding, realising £638,500, a new world record for the artist at auction, far exceeding its pre-sale estimate.' At the London auction, 25 of the 34 lots were sold, totalling £8.8 million. A sculpture by Dame Barbara Hepworth was the top lot, selling to a private UK buyer for £1.1 million. Scottish colourist John Duncan Fergusson, pictured with wife Margaret Morris, in the 1940s . 'The Blue Lamp' (1912) by John Duncan Fergusson . Born in Leith, Edinburgh in 1874, Fergusson was one of the leading Scottish colourists. He briefly training as a naval surgeon, but soon abandoned his medical career and enrolled at the Trustees Academy, an Edinburgh-based art school. After growing frustrated with the rigid style of painting he was being taught, he began to teach himself and travelled all over the world. In Paris, he was attracted to the 'cafe society' - a description for the young and talent who gathered in the cafes and restaurants in the city. There, he rubbed shoulders with Picasso and Matisse. He was considered at the forefront of modern British painting, bur his career was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War. As a result, he didn't see his first solo exhibition until 1923. In 1928, he and his partner, Margaret Morris, moved to Paris but when war loomed over Europe once again, they decided to move once again. In 1939, the settled in Glasgow where they stayed for the remainder of their lives. A year later, he founded the New Art Club in Glasgow - and became the first president of the New Scottish group of painters. After his death in 1961, his widow gifted the University of Stirling with 14 of his paintings and in 1992, a permanent gallery - The Fergusson Gallery - was founded to house them.","Fergusson painted 'Poise' in 1916 but it hasn't been seen public since an exhibition in 1918 .

"A town is ‘under siege’ from travellers who have set up 79 illegal camps in a year. Caravans have been parked on verges, roundabouts, cycle tracks and school grounds in Harlow, Essex. Residents say they feel intimidated, and accuse the Irish travellers of leaving piles of rubbish behind as they move from place to place avoiding authorities. Scroll down for video . A line of caravans on a pavement in Harlow, Essex, where residents say the number of illegal camps is quickly growing and have demanded action . More than 2,000 people in the town have signed a petition calling on authorities to tackle the problem . One weekend last month, 18 vehicles descended on a special needs school, which was left unable to open on the Monday morning amid fears of what would happen as children arrived. With police on their way, the headteacher persuaded the group to move on. Evicting and cleaning up after the group, believed to be mostly from three or four families, cost taxpayers more than £41,000 up to August. That bill is now estimated to have passed £50,000. Yesterday, local Tory MP Robert Halfon said: ‘Residents have been living under siege, in fear and misery for the past year. It’s shocking that this is allowed.’ The camps have ranged in size from one caravan to more than 30, and may last a few days – or several weeks. Sometimes the group move of their own accord, and sometimes they are moved on, only to find another spot close by. Mr Halfon said they were ‘holding a gun to the council’s head’ in an attempt to get a legal permanent site. He wants a change in the law to make it a criminal offence to set up an illegal camp. Last night mother-of-eight Theresa Donovan, wife of the travellers’ leader Patrick Donovan, 47, said: ‘We’ve been served a notice to move on – we’ll leave this camp but we won’t leave Harlow. ‘Our kids are all booked into local schools so we won’t be leaving. We’ve got nowhere else to go.’ She added that the group hoped to win a legal camp. ‘There’s already two Marks and Spencer shops in the town and they’re building a third – if they had a choice why would they not give it to the traveller people?’ Locals say 70 sites have appeared in the town in the last year, but little has been done to tackle the issue . Locals have complained of litter and safety concerns, but travellers insist they are merely waiting for legal plots to be made available . Mrs Donovan said they came to Harlow in October 2013 after being evicted from land they purchased in nearby Epping. Section 61 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act allows police to force trespassers to leave if they have more than six vehicles, damage land or use threatening words or behaviour. Councils can get an injunction or a county court possession order to protect land. More than 2,000 Harlow residents have signed an e-petition calling for official action. A resident wrote online: ‘Travellers feel they have the right to intimidate people for using public footpaths that they have decided to set up camp by. Why should these people have more rights than those who abide by the law?’ The town is less than 30 miles from the Dale Farm camp, which was cleared out following legal action in 2011 . Harlow has two legal traveller sites with a total of 44 pitches, but there is not enough room for the newcomers. Council officials have started a day-by-day diary to keep up with the group as they move from one illegal camp to another. It shows all 79 encampments and how many caravans were at each. Yesterday’s entry states there are now three illegal camps in Harlow. The largest, 21 caravans, sits on a cycle track owned by Essex County Council. Two caravans are in a Harlow Council car park, and nine on private land near a social club. Essex Police visited the cycle track yesterday and gave the group a deadline of 9am today to leave. The travellers are said to split into smaller groups so councils have to take out more eviction notices. Harlow Council said it is taking action to protect its land and a possession hearing is due to take place next week. It has written to the Government calling for new laws to end the ‘expensive and disruptive cat-and-mouse game where travellers merely move from one site to another’. Council leader Jon Clempner said the ‘balance’ between travellers’ and residents’ rights needed to be reviewed, adding: ‘We are doing everything we legally can.’ Chief Superintendent Sean O’Callaghan, of Essex police, said the force would ‘not hesitate to serve Section 61 notices’ where possible. He said a number had been served, but added that police cannot stop camps forming: ‘We can only use this power if it is lawful, necessary and proportionate.’ Harlow is 29 miles from Dale Farm, Britain’s most notorious illegal camp until it was dismantled after violent confrontation with bailiffs and riot police. The eviction, after a ten-year stand-off at the site near Basildon, cost £7million.","Town near notorious gipsy site has seen increase in number of camps .

"Nick Bonnie, 30, sent a final text to his girlfriend Leah Wilkins telling her he loved her before dying of an Ecstasy overdose . A worker at Prince Charles's flagship charity sent a final text to his girlfriend telling her he loved her, just hours before dying of an Ecstasy overdose during a night out with friends. Prince's Trust employee Nick Bonnie, 30, who had been pictured with the Prince of Wales and visited Highgrove and Buckingham Palace through his work, collapsed after taking the drug while on a ‘lads’ weekend’ in Manchester in September last year. Hours before, Mr Bonnie texted his girlfriend Leah Wilkins - who had no idea her boyfriend used drugs - saying, 'goodnight, love you'. He also posed for a photo with his friends while at the rave. But Mr Bonnie - whose mother works in drug rehabilitation - had unknowingly taken almost 15 times the recreational dose of MDMA while at the rave. Soon after, he had been rushed to hospital where he died two hours later. Today, at an inquest into Mr Bonnie's death, the coroner blasted the 'morally bankrupt' dealers of party drugs as a 'heinous blot on our civilisation'. Speaking at the hearing in Stockport, John Pollard said: 'These drugs are manufactured and distributed by people who clearly have no care for the welfare of fellow human beings. 'They are morally bankrupt and form a heinous blot on our civilisation.' The inquest heard how Mr Bonnie and three of his friends had bought Ecstasy and cocaine before leaving their hometown in Stroud, Gloucestershire, for the night out at the Warehouse Project. The foursome took some MDMA and cocaine while travelling the 200 miles by car to Manchester. They also took more while getting ready for the night out at a rented apartment in Salford, before taking more as they queued to enter the club. After Mr Bonnie's death, the three friends and another member of the group were prosecuted for lying to police about where they bought the drug. Dean Neale, Paul Tabb, James Churchill and Simon Lloyd-Jones - who abstained from taking the drugs during the night - had agreed to lie to police about who had supplied the drugs. Mr Bonnie (left) who worked for the Prince's Trust, had taken drugs on previous occasions but neither his girlfriend (pictured right) nor his parents knew . Nick Bonnie (far right, in white T-shirt with red lanyard) had worked at the charity for eight years. He is pictured here with the Prince of Wales . The group concocted the story as they travelled in a taxi to Manchester Infirmary to visit Mr Bonnie, where he lay dying. They claimed they bought the drugs in the club in a 'drunken mistake', leading to police putting out urgent alerts about a possible fatal ‘bad batch’ of drugs circulating the club. Mr Bonnie's mother Pauline has previously hit out at how his friends’ lies had caused her family ‘additional anguish and unacceptable stress’ by prolonging their ordeal for more than a year. Today, Mr Neale - who alongside his friends was given a suspended sentence for their crimes - told the hearing they had concocted the story to 'protect the image of us as a group'. Mr Tabb said the group made up the lie so Mr Bonnie's death would be 'easier' for his parents' to 'get their head around'. Ms Wilkins (left) and his parents Pauline and Andy (right) were today at an inquest into Mr Bonnie's death in Stockport, where the coroner blasted drug dealers as a 'heinous blot on our civilisation' The court heard Mr Bonnie, a finance manager, had taken drugs on previous occasions, unbeknownst to his girlfriend, parents and colleagues. Mr Tabb said: 'I knew from previous conversations that they had no idea he had ever taken drugs. 'We thought it would be easier for them to get their head round it if they thought their son had made one drunken mistake. 'All of us were told we wouldn't get in any trouble for the drugs so we didn't do it to protect ourselves.' Mr Lloyd-Jones described it as 'the worst mistake I have ever made'. He added: 'We thought if they didn't say they took the drugs up with them then it would be a slap on the wrist and it wouldn't go any further. 'It only occurred after the lie that we should have told the truth.' The court heard today how the group took the drugs before heading out, but ended up splitting up from one another when the DJ finished his set. After combing the club and checking in the toilets, Mr Neale told the inquest that one of the group went back to the apartment see if Mr Bonnie had gone home. But Mr Bonnie was on his own in the venue and had been found by security manager Ivan Horsman, after crashing through a fire door. Mr Horsman told the inquest: 'He seemed to lose his footing as he came out and fell to the floor flat on his back right in front of me. 'He said his name was Nick and I could tell he was not simply drunk and he had taken something. I noticed he was clammy to the touch. 'I tried to talk to him but he was now less responsive. I remember him saying, ""I can cope, I can do it"". Me and a colleague took an arm each and helped him to his feet.' The worker then described how Mr Bonnie began spasming in their arms, before his speech began to deteriorate. Dean Neale, Paul Tabb and James Churchill, pictured outside Stockport Coroner's Court, today told the court about why they had lied to police about where they bought the drugs from which killed Mr Bonnie . He said: 'I could tell he was taking a turn for the worse. I kept saying ""stay with me"". I heard the medic say she was calling 999 and that was the last I heard until I received a phone call at 5.45am to say he was dead.' The court heard how the friends' lies unravelled when Miss Wilkins analysed her boyfriend's phone almost two months after Mr Bonnie's death. She discovered a string of texts and WhatsApp messages which revealed the group's intentions to buy drugs before the night out. In court, Churchill, 31, a a gym owner, admitted three charges of supplying controlled Class A drug MDMA, three counts of supplying cocaine and a charge of perverting the course of justice. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for 18 months and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work. Tabb, 31, and father-of-one Neale, 30, admitted possession of MDMA, possession of cocaine and perverting the course of justice by providing a false witness statement. They were sentenced to eight months, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work. Construction site engineer  Lloyd-Jones, 29, admitted perverting the course of justice and was sentenced to eight months, suspended for 18 months, as well as 250 hours of unpaid work. Mr Bonnie died after collapsing at the Warehouse Project in Manchester (pictured) where he attended a rave . The coroner gave Mr Bonnie's cause of death as MDMA and cocaine toxicity. Tests showed a concentration of 4.42mg of MDMA in his blood. Typical recreational use normally measuring just 0.3mg. He had also had amphetamine and alcohol in his system. Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Pollard said: 'There was nothing to suggest the presence of drugs in his body was due to anything other than a voluntary act. No-one forced him. 'It was apparently for the ""buzz"" that he would get from them. 'I suspect that he either took too many tablets or more likely he took the powder form of the drugs and didn't know how much he was taking. 'Looking at all the facts it is very clear that while Nick had used drugs previously and that he was planning to use them again, he managed to keep this from his parents and partner. 'If they had any knowledge about this I'm confident they would have brought considerable force to bear on him.' Mr Bonnie had worked for the Prince's Trust for eight years and had attended one of the Queen's garden parties at Buckingham Palace. He had helped many young people get into work and was raising thousands of pounds for good causes, the inquest heard.","Nick Bonnie, 30, went to a warehouse rave with four friends in Manchester .

"Channel 4 News chief correspondent Alex Thomson was barred from hosting the Rory Peck awards over fears he had had contact with Ebola patients . A news correspondent was barred from hosting an awards ceremony for aspiring journalists because of organisers' fears over his contact with Ebola patients while reporting in west Africa. Alex Thomson, chief correspondent for Channel 4 News, has recently returned from reporting in Sierra Leone. The reporter was due to host the Rory Peck awards at the BFI in London last night but was dropped from the role. Ebola has killed around 5,000 people so far, with most of the deaths confined to parts of west Africa. Sierra Leone is one of the worst hit areas for the disease. Thomson was due to present the Rory Peck awards alongside Sky News special correspondent Alex Crawford. But there were concerns that because the disease has a 21 day incubation period Thomson could put people at risk because he would be shaking hands. He denied claims that he had stepped down from hosting the awards on Wednesday. He wrote on Twitter: 'I did not pull out of presenting the Rory Peck Awards - they dropped me.' The correspondent was instead replaced by colleague Lindsey Hilsum who has also been out in Sierra Leone previously in 2006. The Rory Peck awards were launched to recognise journalists who take risks to report difficult stories from around the world. They were set up in 1995 in memory of Rory Peck, a freelance cameraman who died in Moscow while working. A spokeswoman for the Rory Peck Trust said: 'The Trust is committed to ensuring that it does not reinforce any confusion over how Ebola is spread - we understand the medical issues and at no stage did we think that there was an infection or safety risk in Alex presenting the awards. However, Alex and Channel 4 News are running a no-touch policy which we respect, but which would have made his job as presenter impractical and, possibly, distracting for the audience. So after discussion with Channel 4 News, we thought it would be easier for Lindsey Hilsum to present instead.' Last night's award for news went to 23-year-old Pacome Pabandji  for his reports on the conflict in the Central African Republic. And six North Korean cameramen, who chose to remain anonymous and appeared under the name Team Mindeulle, received the award for features for their work exposing life in Korea. They were praised by judges of the awards for 'risking their lives to tell this story.' Ben de Pear, editor of Channel 4 News, last night tweeted a picture of Thomson and Alex Crawford at the awards. He wrote: 'Alex's @alextomo& @AlexCrawfordSky both Ebola heroes and TV news stars #rorypeckawards' Ben de Pear tweeted this image of Thomson (left) and Sky News reporter Alex Crawford last night . A spokeswoman for the awards said they were 'happy' to see the presenter at the event. Alex Crawford, who was due to be Thomson's co-host has previously spoken out about the dangers of creating panic in reports of Ebola. In a recent interview with the Guardian she said: 'I think the fear in America, Britain and everywere else is out of proportion because they will get cases of Ebola, absolutely. But will it spread like it has done in Liberia? Really unlikely. You need to be alert, but do you think it’s going to take over and kill half of Reading? No.' Mr Thomson has reported from locations across the world, including appearing here in the Middle East .","Alex Thomson, chief correspondent, was due to present Rory Peck awards .

"A supermarket Christmas pudding has beaten the best that Harrods and Fortnum & Mason have to offer in blind taste tests. The £3.99 ‘M Signature Jewelled Fruit Christmas Pudding’ from Morrisons was the cheapest of 11 premium puddings tested by experts for the consumer group Which? However, it was scored 85 per cent by a panel of judges including the 2013 winner of the Great British Bake Off, Francis Quinn, and food critic Charles Campion. Scroll down for video . The £3.99 ‘M Signature Jewelled Fruit Christmas Pudding’ from Morrisons was the cheapest of 11 premium puddings tested by experts for the consumer group Which? but it also scored the most highly . The panel eulogised about its having a ‘great depth of flavour’ and being ‘simply majestic’. By contrast, the experts described the £10 St James Christmas Pudding from Fortnum & Mason as having an 'artificial flavour' and compared the taste to a citrus bathroom cleaner. The Extra Special Mulled Port and Orange pudding from Asda, costing £5, scored lowest – at 48 per cent - and was criticised for its unpleasant, chemical flavour. Each pudding was given a mark out of 10 for appearance, aroma, taste and texture . Which? asked supermarkets and upmarket retailers to nominate a premium pudding for the taste test by experts, who also included the award winning artisan baker, Patrick Moore, and Oliver Whitford-Knight, owner of The Pudding Bar. Each pudding was given a mark out of 10 for appearance, aroma, taste and texture, which was converted to a percentage and then given a ranking. Which? also tested both champagne and sparkling wine and found quality does not necessarily come at a high cost. Sainsbury’s Blanc de Blanc Brut Champagne at £22.50 a bottle came joint top of the champagnes, scoring 80 per cent, sharing the accolade with Piper Heidsieck Brut Champagne at £33. The best Prosecco on offer came from a Co-op own label at £9.99 with the judges praising its balance of bitterness and fruitiness. Which? editor, Richard Headland, said: ‘Christmas can be an expensive time of the year so it’s satisfying to see our festive taste tests revealed some of the cheapest were also some of the best.

"This amazing footage literally captures a birds-eye view of London after an eagle flew over the city - with a video camera on its back. The white-tailed eagle, which has been critically endangered for over 50 years, was released from the top of the Golden Gallery of St Paul’s Cathedral. In the clip, which lasts 20 seconds, the impressive raptor can be seen landing in front of an impressed audience, at the base of the city’s famous Tower Bridge. An endangered eagle captured footage from a literal bird's eye view of the city of London in amazing video . The bird flew from St Paul's Cathedral to Tower Bridge with a camera fastened to its back . The eagle then flew along the Thames before gently alighting on the arm of his handler . During the flight, the bird of prey was able to capture breathtaking footage of the capital with the high-spec camera mounted on its back. The eagle flew over the Thames before gently alighting onto the arm of his handler Jacques Olivier Travers. As part of the incredible stunt, Sony have provided a number of cameras to FREEDOM, a charity attempting to reintroduce the rare white-tailed eagle back into the wild. Additional videos filmed by the impressive bird of prey will be released on the bird’s Youtube channel over the coming days. The majestic bird also completed a flight from ArcelorMittal in Mayfair . The entire project was to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the IUCN's Red List and raise awareness for critically endangered species . Perched atop City Hall, the eagle was filmed by Sony-provided cameras, donated to animal charity FREEDOM . Jacques-Olivier Travers said: 'I like to bring the birds where they are not expected. For many years, I have taught the birds to fly in nature using a paraglider.' He has had a passion for the birds since the age of 12. 'I was given small chicks from a nest and recommended feeding with milk. But they died a few days later,' he added. Now his dream is to reintroduce the white-tailed eagle into the wild. Part of a larger campaign for IUCN, there will also be an art installation at London's Old Sorting House . The eagle's handler, Jacques-Olivier Travers, said: 'I like to bring the birds where they are not expected' Jacques-Olivier admits that one of his dreams is to reintroduce the White-Tailed Eagle back into the wild . He explained: 'For reintroduction and conservation to be successful we need the public to support it.' The project is part of a greater campaign to raise awareness for The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List 50th Anniversary. An international contemporary art exhibition called Here Today… will also be held in London's Old Sorting Office from November 25 in support of the cause. The exhibition will showcase specially commissioned interactive installations and art focused around endangered species from several renowned artists. The project, its hoped, will help people who feel disconnected from nature to remember how important it is . It's hoped that the high-spec camera footage will allow researchers to accurately document the eagle's flight patterns to assist in their reintroduction into the wild . It is hoped the HDR-AZ1 Action Cam Mini mounted on the animal’s backs will allow researchers to accurately document their flight and prosperity as they are re-introduced into the wild. The project also hopes to help people, who feel disconnected from nature whilst living in urban environments, and forget the impact their lives can have on the world outside. FREEDOM will use the footage to study the behaviour of the eagles to understand what needs to be done to prepare the birds ahead the full re-introduction program.","Amazing footage came from camera fastened to the bird's back .

"Passed: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured here leaving Downing Street today, has seen his gay marriage bill go through with the help of Labour and Lib Dems . David Cameron suffered a humiliating reverse last night when more than half his MPs rejected his 11th-hour appeals for support for same-sex marriage. On an extraordinary day in the Commons, 134 Tory MPs took advantage of a free vote to oppose the plans. Only 126 backed the legislation, with 35 abstaining. But with the help of the majority of Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs Mr Cameron saw the measure passed easily, by a margin of 400 to 175. The first gay marriages are likely to be conducted within 12 months. The standard bearer of the Tory Right, Iain Duncan Smith, voted in favour of same-sex unions, but the Government’s top lawyer, Dominic Grieve, astonished colleagues by abstaining. A source close to Mr Grieve said: ‘He is a practising member of the Church of England and it has caused a lot of hurt and upset for the church.’ Cabinet ministers who voted against the measure included Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who said privately some years ago in a discussion about gay marriage that ‘biddies don’t like botties’, and Welsh Secretary David Jones. They were joined by Simon Burns, Esther McVey and John Hayes. Mr Cameron has been accused of needlessly splitting his party and prioritising an issue important to only a handful of voters. One poll suggests 70 per cent of voters now see the Tories as divided. Despite the vote being deemed one of conscience, Tory MPs had been left in no doubt that the party leadership wanted as many as possible to vote in favour. Senior ministers including George Osborne, William Hague and Theresa May were wheeled out on the eve of the debate to make the case. Senior Tories had suggested before the vote it was crucial for Mr Cameron to win over more than half of his party – a benchmark he failed to meet. However, several Tories who rejected the measure said they objected to being described as ‘rebels’, since it was a free vote. Labour also suffered a split, with 22 of its MPs voting against. Scroll down for video . Passed: The Commons voted in favour of same-sex weddings by 400 votes to 175, a majority of 225 . Rebels: A total of 134 Tory MPs took advantage of a free vote to oppose the plans. Only 126 backed the legislation, with 35 abstaining . A handful of Liberal Democrats – including former children’s minister Sarah Teather – did likewise. The Prime Minister said: ‘I am a strong believer in marriage. It helps people commit to each other and I think it is right that gay people should be able to get married too. ‘This is, yes, about equality. But it is also about making our society stronger. I know there are strong views on both side of the argument – I accept that. But this is an important step forward for our country.’ But Graham Brady, the chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, expressed doubts over the Government’s assurances that faith groups will not be forced to conduct gay marriages. And Cheryl Gillan, the former Welsh secretary, said: ‘This legislation was not in our manifesto, it was not in the coalition agreement and it was not in the Queen’s speech.’ Sir Roger Gale, Tory MP for North Thanet, accused Mr Cameron of an ‘Orwellian’ attempt to redefine marriage. He prompted uproar as he suggested the Government might as well allow civil unions between all people ‘irrespective of their sexuality or their relationship ... that means brothers and brothers and sisters and sisters and brothers and sisters as well’. Margot James, a leading modernising MP, accused the Church of England and anti-gay marriage campaigners of a ‘deliberate’ attempt to distort the debate by falsely claiming faith groups would be forced to conduct same-sex ceremonies. She warned the Conservatives risked alienating mainstream voters in the same way as US Republicans if they failed to embrace social changes such as equal marriage. The MP for Stourbridge, who is gay, told the Commons: ‘My party should never flinch from the requirement that we must continue this progression, otherwise we may end up like the Republican party who lost an election last year that they could have won were it not for their socially conservative agenda.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘We will look back on today as a landmark for equality in Britain.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘This is a proud day and an important step forward in the fight for equality in Britain.’ Colin Hart, of the Coalition for Marriage, which has opposed the legislation, said: ‘This result is a disaster for David Cameron. Despite a personal plea from the PM his MPs have overwhelmingly rejected gay marriage. Mr Cameron must think again.’ Last night was not the first time Mr Cameron has gone into the Commons division lobbies with a minority of his MPs over gay rights. In 2007, on a free vote, he was among fewer than half of his party who supported gay adoption. The previous biggest Tory split on a free vote was under Mr Duncan Smith in 2003, when the party split over reform of the House of Lords. Tony Blair suffered a bigger loss of support over foxhunting in 2004. Looking back: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the day would be seen as a 'landmark for equality in Britain' Culture Secretary Maria Miller defended the plans for gay marriage in the Commons . MARIA MILLER, TORY CULTURE SECRETARY . This Bill is about one thing. It is about fairness, it is about giving those who want to get married the opportunity to do so while protecting the rights of those who don’t agree with same-sex marriage. TIM LOUGHTON, TORY FORMER CHILDREN'S MINISTER . Who are we, this Government, or this country, to redefine the term marriage that has meant one man and one woman across cultures, across ages, across geographical barriers since before state and religion themselves? YVETTE COOPER, LABOUR'S EQUALITIES SPOKESMAN . ‘Call us hopeless romantics, call it the triumph of hope over experience – most of us think when people love each other and want to make that long-term commitment, that is a wonderful thing. So why would we stop a loving couple getting married just because they are gay? JIM DOBBIN, LABOUR MP FOR HEYWOOD AND MIDDLETON . The Government cannot possibly guarantee protection for churches or individuals with a traditional view because it cannot predict or control what happens in the courts. SIR ROGER GALE, TORY MP FOR NORTH THANET . It is not possible to redefine marriage. Marriage is the union between a man and a woman, has been historically, remains so. It is Alice in Wonderland territory, Orwellian almost, for any Government of any political persuasion to seek to come along and try to re-write the lexicon. It will not do. EDWARD LEIGH, TORY MP FOR GAINSBOROUGH . We should be in the business of protecting cherished institutions and our cultural heritage otherwise what, I ask, is a Conservative Party for? Indeed we are alienating people who have voted for us for all their lives, leaving them with no one to vote for. NICK HERBERT, FORMER TORY POLICE MINISTERWhat are heterosexual couples going to say? ‘Darling our marriage is over, Sir Elton John has just gotten married to David Furnish”? Labour's equalities spokesman Yvette Cooper asked: 'Why would we stop a loving couple getting married just because they are gay?' STEPHEN TIMMS, LABOUR MP FOR EAST HAM Children are at the heart of marriage... but they are barely mentioned at the Bill. The Bill aims to open up the benefits of marriage to people excluded from it at the moment but it is doing at the price of taking away a significant part of its meaning.’ PETER BONE, TORY MP FOR BILLERICAY It is my saddest day as an MP when my party brings in a Bill which I’m fundamentally opposed to. I’m very sad my party has brought this in without any democratic mandate. SIR GERALD HOWARTH, FORMER TORY DEFENCE MINISTER This Bill is wrong, the consultation process was a complete sham, it is opposed by the established church, it has caused deep and needless divisions within the Conservative Party, there is no mandate for it, there are huge potential consequences, not least the prospect of endless legal challenge and the nation faces much more serious challenges which the Government needs to address. EMMA REYNOLDS, LABOUR MP FOR WOLVERHAMPTON NORTH EAST The love that two men or two women feel for each other is equal to that felt by a heterosexual couple. Their love is no less significant and no less important. JOHN GLEN, TORY MP FOR SALISBURYBy a factor of at least 30 to one my constituents have expressed their opposition to this. Huge numbers of Conservative supporters feel grave disappointment and alienation at the decision to pursue this legislation. ANDREW SELOUS, TORY MP FOR SOUTH WEST BEDFORDSHIRE What of further redefinitions? Will this be the last redefinition of marriage?

"Teachers have been accused of neglecting textbooks at the expense of producing worksheets or trawling the internet for information . Ministers will today urge schools to bring back traditional textbooks to end a growing reliance on worksheets and the internet. They will say that an ‘anti-textbook ethos’ has contributed to England’s slide in international rankings of pupils’ performance in key academic subjects. In a speech to the Publishers Association, School Reform Minister Nick Gibb will call on all schools – both primary and secondary – to reintroduce good quality textbooks in most subjects. He will complain that teachers too often neglect textbooks in favour of producing worksheets or ‘endlessly trawling the internet’ for suitable material for their lessons. Mr Gibb will also highlight new research from exams body Cambridge Assessment which shows that teachers in top-performing countries are significantly more likely to use textbooks than in England. The research ‘should rightly send shockwaves through the education system and the publishing industry,’ Mr Gibb will say. In Finland, 95 per cent of maths teachers use a textbook as a basis for lessons and in Singapore, the figure is 70 per cent. In contrast, only 10 per cent of maths teachers in England use a textbook for their core teaching – and only four per cent in science. ‘In the controversial search for the reasons why a range of key nations have improved their systems so dramatically and so quickly, the role of high quality textbooks has been seriously neglected,’ Mr Gibb will say. ‘Well-focused, forensic study of these nations highlights the extent to which good teaching and high academic standards are strongly associated with adequate provision and widespread use of high quality textbooks.’ And he will say: ‘Once again England has fallen behind.’ In other leading nations such as Singapore, 70 per cent of maths lessons are taught from a textbook, while in Findland the figure is 95 per cent - in the UK it is just ten per cent . Mr Gibb will suggest that teacher trainers and researchers, rather than teachers themselves, are responsible for the marginalisation of textbooks. He will also lay down a challenge to educational publishers to drive up the quality of textbooks in England. ‘All the evidence shows that high quality textbooks are good for teachers, students and parents,’ he will say. ‘For teachers, well-structured textbooks reduce workload and the perpetual ritual of producing worksheets; for students, knowledge-rich textbooks mean they can read beyond the confines of the exam syllabus and using textbooks helps to develop those all-important scholarship skills; and for parents, textbooks are a guide to what their children are being taught in school. ‘I would like to see all schools, both primary and secondary, using high quality textbooks in most academic subjects, bringing us closer to the norm in high performing countries.’","Teachers accused of relying too heavily on internet and worksheets .

"Kevin Nunes was beaten and shot in 2002. The investigation into his murder contained serious errors, a police watchdog probe later found . Fourteen police officers - including two chief constables - will not face charges over a botched murder investigation of a promising football star. Kevin Nunes, who had been on the books of Tottenham Hotspur, was found dead in a country lane in Pattingham, Staffordshire on September 19, 2002. The 20-year-old had been savagely beaten and shot five times. Five men were found guilty of the alleged 'execution-style' murder of Mr Nunes and jailed for a total of 135 years at Leicester Crown Court in 2008. But they launched a collective appeal and were cleared at the Court of Appeal in March 2012 after a damning report exposed a catalogue of blunders by Staffordshire Police. After the trial, it emerged concerns over the credibility of the key prosecution witness, Simeon Taylor, were not disclosed to the defence. Mr Taylor claimed to have seen the killing having driven the car which took Mr Nunes to his death. But it later emerged that complaints made by Mr Taylor concerning his treatment while in witness protection were 'put on ice'. A detective handling the key witness was also involved in an 'intimate' affair with a disclosure officer, it emerged. A senior detective believed there was an 'at any cost' culture within Staffordshire Police to ensure Mr Taylor gave evidence in the case. In September last year, a file of evidence was handed over to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) after an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The police watchdog probe centred on how the officers acted before the trial and dealings with protected witness Mr Taylor in 2008. But it emerged today that none of the 14 former and serving Staffordshire Police officers investigated over the murder will face prosecution. The officers include high-ranking Adrian Lee, the Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police, and Gloucestershire Police's Chief Constable Suzette Davenport. Staffordshire Police's temporary Chief Constable Jane Sawyers and West Midlands Police's Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale have also been told they face no further action. Gloucestershire Police's Chief Constable Suzette Davenport (left) and Adrian Lee (right), the Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police, were among the police who will face no further action . West Midlands Police's Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale (left) and Staffordshire Police's temporary Chief Constable Jane Sawyers (right) are also no longer being investigated . The CPS said it had considered two allegations in connection with the handling of the case. One was that Staffordshire Police had received a complaint from the main witness relating to a senior officer of the Sensitive Policing Unit in November 2006. The second matter was the force's failure to disclose the results of internal review of the sensitive policing unit and its handling of Mr Taylor. Five of the 14 officers were told they would not face criminal prosecution in January and the nine remaining officers were told the same decision had been reached this week. Commenting on the latest officers to be cleared, a  CPS spokesman said: 'We considered whether there is sufficient evidence to prove that any action or inaction was a deliberate attempt to pervert the course of justice or could amount to the criminal offence of misconduct in public office. 'The CPS has determined there is insufficient evidence to prosecute any of the nine police officers, four remain in service while five are now retired, investigated either for attempting or conspiring to pervert the course of public justice or for criminal misconduct in a public office.' Owen Crooks (left) and Levi Walker (right) were among the five men convicted then cleared of murder . Antonio Christie (left) and Adam Joof (right) were also in the group, cleared of the 'execution style' killing . The investigation into the case against group - who also included Michael Osbourne (pictured) - was flawed . The spokesman added: 'The CPS has taken the decision that whatever criticisms may be made about the conduct of the various officers, there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction against any of them for conspiring or attempting to pervert the course of public justice. 'Equally, that there is no realistic prospect of a conviction resulting from the prosecution of any officer for the misconducting themselves in public office. 'Rather than a conspiracy to conceal, the evidence suggested that there was an overall failure to disclose the report. 'None of the officers who could be shown to be aware of the content of the report had a clear and direct responsibility for disclosure in the murder case. 'This CPS decision applies only to possible criminal proceedings and not to any possible misconduct proceedings under police regulations.'","Ex-Tottenham youngster was found shot and beaten in 2002 .

"Pre-Christmas tension looks to be striking couriers earlier than usual this year in Australia as their shoddy delivery of packages is the latest ‘breaking’ news across the country. It was anyone's guess what else was broken when this TNT delivery driver was filmed dropping large packages from the back of his truck in the middle of Sydney on Wednesday afternoon. 9News reported that the delivery man was filmed carelessly dropping several boxes to the ground on Pitt Street. Some even bounced off others as they fell to the ground. The TNT driver carries out his delivery by leaning out of his van and dropping a package to the floor . The driver sends the package flying through the air and towards the ground . All the driver can do is watch as the package hits the ground heavily . It's not clear what was in the boxes or if they contained fragile goods – not that the large bald-headed driver seemed to care anyway. The company has been contacted for comment but has not replied. A video was posted to YouTube by Bob Vance with one comment saying: ‘What a s****y human being.’ The driver then decides to just shove packages out onto the ground from the van to save time . With four packages scattered on the ground the driver goes back into the truck to get more . The incident follows a similar one that took place on November 4 in Adelaide. Footage again shows couriers recklessly throwing packages. It had over half a million views in a day. The clip was posted on Facebook by a 'Pinky BuaChompoo', the alias used by an Adelaide kick boxer, who filmed the scene from inside a car at Adelaide Airport. It shows three men in high visibility shirts carelessly hurling the parcels against the back of a DHL truck. Another earlier video shows three men in high visibility shirts carelessly throwing packages against the back of a DHL truck . The clip was posted on Facebook by a 'Pinky BuaChompoo', and it received half a million views in a day . The man that uploaded the video, who chose to remain anonymous, told Herald Sun he was angered by what he witnessed. 'The reason why it bothers me is that I send stuff all the time internationally and domestically and the stuff ends up in damaged boxes. 'Now I know why, so this is my little protest.' A spokesperson for DHL confirmed the clip was legitimate. 'DHL is obviously shocked to see the handling of the shipments in such a way,' she said. 'It's contrary to all of our policies and has spurred us to really prompt action.' The man that uploaded the video, who chose to remain anonymous, said he was angered by what he witnessed .

"Earlier this week, a visibly pregnant Duchess of Cambridge wowed guests at a Kensington Palace charity event, with a stunning sheer polka dot top which she teamed with a neat belt and a shimmering knee-length skirt. But although she looked a million dollars, her outfit came with the considerably lower price tag of £89 - the cost of the glamorous semi-sheer top by Hobbs chosen for the event. And it isn't the first time that Kate has stepped out in High Street. Zara, where prices for dresses average out at £50, and Whistles, which offers T-shirts for £40 and dresses for £120, are among her favourites as are Topshop and Reiss. High street meets high-end: The Duchess of Cambridge teamed an £89 Hobbs top with a Jenny Packham skirt at last night's Place2be charity event - just the latest example of how she uses simple styling tricks to make her low-cost labels look a million dollars . But while low-cost looks might have been bought for bargain prices, on the Duchess, they look anything but high street, thanks in no small part to her judicious use of accessories and penchant for teaming budget buys with designer splurges. Her appearance at the Place2be charity event was no exception. Joining the £89 Hobbs bargain was a billowing silk skirt by top designer Jenny Packham, a patent leather belt and, of course, her stunning sapphire and diamond engagement ring. The Duchess' latest high street outing is the continuation of a trend that began the moment she joined the royal family in 2011 and chose a simple Zara dress for her going away outfit. She teamed the £49.99 pleated blue number with a pair of £129.99 wedge pumps by another of her favourite high street brands, L.K. Bennett, while the fitted black jacket that completed the ensemble had been tailored just for her. A month later, at Prince Philip's 90th birthday celebrations, the dress appeared again, this time with a designer Jane Troughton coat. Updating her look: The Duchess wore a £189 Reiss dress in one of her official engagement portraits, which she accessorised with dazzling jewels, including Princess Diana's ring, reportedly worth £300,000 (left) Recycling: The Duchess of Cambridge wore the Reiss dress again during her visit to the Canadian Museum of Civilisation in Gatineau, Quebec, in 2011. This team she jazzed it up with a hat by Sylvia Fletcher for Lock and Co, which can retail at nearly £1,000 (right) Diamonds are a girl's best friend: To open an art room in North London, she chose a £225 kingfisher blue dress by LK Bennett and added £1,200 amethyst and diamond drop earrings by her favourite jeweller Kiki McDonough (left) Blign bling: Kate looked radiant in another high street design from Whistles at the National Portrait Gallery, she paired the Sofia Rae dress with dazzling earrings once owned by Princess Diana (right) Since then, she has stepped out in a whole host of high street numbers, whether the Petit Bateau striped top she wore to watch Prince William play polo earlier this year, or the tailored Zara jacket sported during the royal visit to New Zealand. Again and again, the Duchess has mixed high fashion with high street style, although many of her purchases - among them the designer bargains she picks up at the Bicester Village outlet centre - are later tailored to ensure they fit perfectly. But could there be more to the Duchess' high-low wardrobe than her love of a bargain? Fashion writer Simon Glazin thinks a desire to please a public fed up with watching high-spending politicians splash out could also be a factor. 'There has been lots written about the Duchess and Prince William's spending,' he explains. 'It's likely to be the reason why she is thrifty with her wardrobe and often recycles dresses and coats. Even a Princess has to dress on a budget.' Deja-vu: Kate's cornflower blue Zara Dress that she wore the day after announcing her engagement to Prince William sold out and she proved to be the frugal Duchess when the dress appeared again just a month later at Prince Philip's 90th birthday celebrations. She updated it with a swanky Jane Troughton coat, right . Luxe it up: The Duchess of Cambridge visited the 1st Battalion Irish Guards at the St. Patricks Day Parade at Mons Barracks Aldershot in March wearing a  £279 Hobbs coat and £400 Emmy shoes and clutch, which was £290 by the same designer . And it certainly seems to be working, with the Duchess named the UK's third most popular royal after Prince Harry and the Queen in a recent YouGov poll. Her love of British brands has also won her acclaim from the UK's fashion industry with her relentless championing of labels like Alexander McQueen, Goat and Jenny Packham giving business a noticeable boost. But while she's no stranger to designer fashion, the high street, whether her Topshop maternity dresses or L.K Bennett 'Sledge' shoes, remains a favourite. 'We're lucky in the UK to have one of the best high streets in the world,' adds Glazin, 'and it's good to see a royal appreciate it too. Kate has obviously worked out that designer pieces plus high street buys adds up to super-stylish - and she looks better than ever for it.' Mixing it up: For a trip to the Warner Brothers' Studio when she was pregnant with Prince George, right, she teamed a £38 Topshop dress with a more high-end Ralph Lauren blazer . Style icons collide: Kate met Michelle Obama  at Buckingham Palace in 2011 wearing a £175 Beige Shola shift dress from Reiss, £160 LK Bennett shoes and a pricier Anya . Hindmarch clutch bag, which cost £259 . Clever styling: Kate looked a million dollars on the red carpet at the Princes Trust concert wearing a short figure-hugging black and tan dress costing just £69.99 from Zara, which she teamed with a Ralph Lauren blazer .","The Duchess of Cambridge often teams dresses by Reiss, Whistles and Zara with designer coats .

"The astonishing scale of Eastern European migration to Britain is revealed today in figures uncovered by the Daily Mail. They show that 1.3 per cent of Eastern Europeans living anywhere in Europe – including in their native countries – are now in the UK. It means one in 75 of those born in eight former communist nations that joined the EU in 2004 is resident here – and the true numbers are likely to be even greater as the figures are three years old. Scroll down for video . Queue: Thousands of Romanians wait to vote in elections in Portsmouth this week . For some individual countries, the proportions of their citizens living here are particularly high. One in 30 Lithuanians in Europe now lives in Britain, as do one in 30 Latvians, one in 60 Poles and one in 200 Hungarians. Since the statistics were recorded in 2011, Eastern European migrants have continued to flock to the UK. Yesterday new figures also showed Britain is giving citizenship to more migrants than any other EU country – with 193,000 foreign nationals given passports in 2012. Since 2000, more than 2.1million migrants have acquired British citizenship. Today’s figures expose the vast exodus from Eastern European nations to Britain since border controls were dropped ten years ago. The data was compiled by the independent Migration Observatory at Oxford University and is based on census data from across the continent in 2011. Figures released in August showed the number of migrants from the eight newly-joined Eastern European countries working in Britain rose by more than a quarter in a year. Romanian and Bulgarian migrant numbers have also continued to increase. The influx has placed huge pressure on public services including the NHS, schools and housing. Immigration is now among the top two biggest concerns cited by the public in opinion polls. The figures are calculated from census data showing how many people born in each country are resident in Britain, how many are still at home and how many have moved elsewhere in Europe. It shows there are around 654,000 Polish nationals in the UK out of 41.5million in Europe – meaning 1.6 per cent live here. The scale of the migration from Lithuania is even more stark. A total of 108,000 Lithuanians live in Britain, some 3.4 per cent of all those in Europe. Lithuania has a much smaller population at around three million. A total of 61,440 Latvians live in Britain – or 3.2 per cent of the 1.9million anywhere in Europe. For Slovakia the figure is 1.2 per cent, for the Czech Republic 0.4 per cent, Estonia 0.7 per cent and Hungary 0.5 per cent. Between 2004 and last year, the population of Eastern European migrants in Britain rose by 544 per cent, from around 167,000 to 1,077,000. Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva, the Observatory’s acting director, said: ‘Eastern European migration to the UK is not a completely new phenomenon – Polish people were the second largest foreign-born group in the UK, after Irish born people, in the 1951 census. But the scale of change that the UK has seen in the last decade is significantly greater.’ EU migration has blown a hole in the Government’s attempts to fulfil a pledge to cut net migration to below the tens of thousands, and helped fuel the rise of Ukip. David Cameron has promised to secure major reforms to free movement rules ahead of a proposed referendum in 2017. On Tuesday Labour sought to toughen its position on migration by suggesting it would seek to negotiate a two-year ban on some benefit claims for EU migrants. But last night Eurosceptic Tory MPs said the figures showed Britain needed to reclaim control of its borders by leaving the EU. Backbench Conservative MP for Shipley Philip Davies said: ‘These figures are staggering. This is the inevitable consequence of opening our borders when Britain is creating more jobs than the rest of the EU put together. David Cameron has promised to secure major reforms to free movement rules ahead of a proposed referendum in 2017 . ‘We can’t cope with that level of immigration culturally, our NHS can’t cope and we can’t build enough houses to house them all.’ The figures also show how the populations of Eastern European countries have been hollowed out by emigration over the last decade. The Daily Mail understands that senior Eastern European politicians have raised the issue of domestic ‘brain drain’ with Mr Cameron in high-level talks. It raises the prospect of them lending their support for his proposed reforms. Last week, Lithuanian Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevičius spoke publicly about the huge numbers of his population to have moved to Britain in recent years, after meeting Mr Cameron at a conference in Finland. Downing Street officials confirmed that other EU countries had raised concerns that they face the opposite problem to that seen in Britain. The PM has pledged to put reform of immigration rules at the centre of his renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with Europe.","Statistics show 1.3 per cent of Eastern Europeans living anywhere in Europe are now in the UK .

"It was once considered simple manners but now opening a door for a woman might see her call security, according to Sir Terry Wogan. And after decades in the public eye, this is not the only change the veteran broadcaster, 76, has seen befall modern Britain. Along with the death of chivalry, Sir Terry also laments the demise in quality television, celebrity culture and poor use of language. Sir Terry Wogan, pictured, uses his latest book to complain about 100 problems with modern society . But in his new book, The Little Book of Common Sense… or Pause for Thought with Wogan, the Radio Two presenter has laid out his advice on how to get civilisation back on track. The ex-Eurovision host blames the ‘suffocation’ of common sense on over regulation and reality television and said people are ‘confused by too much information from the media and the internet’. Sir Terry has never been afraid to speak his mind – he has claimed transvestite Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst turned the event into a ‘freak show’ and that presenters such as Tess Daly and Holly Willoughby will lose their jobs once their looks fade – and his book sees him be just as candid as he picks up on a series of pet hates. In what he describes as ‘a little book of random thoughts’, Sir Terry Wogan dispenses more than 100 snippets of his wit and wisdom, on topics ranging from foxes to truth and road rage to diets. Here is a selection: . On truth: Leave plain speaking to Yorkshire men. ‘Speaking as you find’ is what’s caused most of the trouble in the world. ‘I’m only rude to people I like’, is the proud boast of someone who doesn’t understand why he hasn’t a friend in the world. On sex: Invented in the latter part of the last century by Helen Gurley Brown and Cosmopolitan magazine. Before that, everyone was happy with romance. On online dating: Only for the desperate. Get out more, talk to people and smile. It’s worth a try. On Eurovision Song Contest: Nothing more clearly defines the irreconcilable difference between ourselves and our fellows in the European community. They think that it’s a feast of fine pop music. We think it’s a joke… . On celebrity: Like ‘Star’, ‘Genius’ and ‘Talent’, a word that has lost all meaning. On public transport: I haven’t been on a bus in thirty years, and if all those empty buses clogging London’s streets mean anything, neither has anyone else’. On in-laws: As with outlaws and byelaws, watch your step. On relationships: Nobody knows anything. Just go for it and pray. Like life, it needs more luck that judgement.’ Many of the entries allude to the idea that people have become over-sensitive and, on the subject of manners, the father-of-three wrote: ‘What used to be called “good manners” is now regarded as mere affectation. Open a door for a young woman, and she’s likely to call security’. And he saved particular ire for the modern trend to regulate, writing: ‘Along with health and safety, council regulations on waste disposal and bus lanes, brings on the hopeless shrug. However did we manage to struggle on without a proper concern for ethnic diversity, inclusivity, team spirit and the rest of the H.R. [Human Resources] brief? If ever asked what you would bring to the team, resist the urge to reply, “A new striker and the half-time oranges”’. Sir Terry has previously criticised red tape. In 2008, he used his radio show to blast EU regulation that would supposedly force the BBC Proms – which he has presented for 18 consecutive years – to lower their noise levels to avoid upsetting neighbours. Sloppy language also came in for a critique, particularly the propensity for people to reply to the question ‘How are you?’ with the phrase ‘I’m good’. Sir Terry points out: ‘For Heaven’s sake! You’re not being asked about your moral behaviour, it’s a civil question about you’re health’. But beyond simply pointing out the world’s problems, Sir Terry also used the book as an opportunity to dispense gems of advice on how to achieve an easier life. On the topic of lies, he said: ‘Keep them little, white and simple; otherwise you’re bound to get caught out. I know you think you’re inscrutable, but believe me, your face is an open book to the rest of us’. While he suggests avoiding exercise because, ‘in view of the indisputable fact that we all have a finite number of heartbeats, it seems foolhardy in the extreme to cause the old ticket to point away at double and treble its normal rate’. He claims that even the best and brightest could benefit from such doses of common sense and perhaps need it more than anyone. He commented: ‘Just as you should never confuse the law with common justice, intelligence should not be confused with common sense. Some of the brightest people in the world have no idea how to cross the road’. Sir Terry Wogan, pictured, claimed common sense was a rare commodity in contemporary society . This is not the first time he has published a tome of his wit and wisdom and the book follows 2009’s Where Was I?, which contained quips such as: ‘Age, they say, is only important if you’re cheese. or a wine. They also say, if you are stuck behind one on a golf course, that a tree is 90 per cent air. How come, then, that you invariably send your ball crashing into the remaining 10 per cent?’ Sir Terry, who waded into the BBC ageism row that erupted after the dismissal of Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly by saying it was ‘a little unfair but [television is] a visual medium’, has been just a scathing of how people approach age this time around. He said: ‘Doesn’t exist any more. ‘Senior Citizen’ and ‘Silver Surfer’ are the new euphemisms. Unless you’re a female presenter on TV, in which case you’re ready for the knacker’s yard at 35.’","Sir Terry Wogan offers his fans 100 snippets of wisdom in his new book .

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's White House buzz got a boost Wednesday with word that donors and Clinton partisans would meet Friday for a New York City planning confab. But hours later Jim Webb, a former one-term Virginia senator, sucked all the oxygen out of her news cycle with word that he had launched a presidential exploratory committee. Only months ago the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign season was seen as a formality, a drawn-out Clinton coronation. But now there's another voice in the conversation, and it may appeal to right-leaning Democrats: Webb was once Secretary of the Navy during Ronald Reagan's presidency. He also has solid national security bona fides that can match with Clinton's tenure as America's top diplomat, and a military service record that she can't equal. But Webb is seen as less stridently liberal than Clinton, which could give her a rhetorical foil when she argues her case to the Democratic Party's left wing. That was the party constituency that abandoned her in 2008, siding with a little-known Illinois senator named Barack Obama. Scroll down for video . Former Democratic Sen. Jim Webb is the first White House hopeful to test the waters with a presidential exploratory committee . HILLARY KILLER? Webb is a right-leaning Democrat with strong national security bona fides and a military service record to match . Not happening again: Bill Clinton campaigned with Webb for a Virginia Senate seat in 2006, but the former president will have other priorities in 2016 . Clinton isn't officially a candidate for 2016 but a super PAC bearing her name – 'Ready For Hillary' – is gathering hundreds of donors in New York to meet with the people who could become her political war council. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack will speak to the group in a panel discussions entitled, 'Why I'm ready for Hillary,' according to The Hill newspaper. Only donors who have kicked in at least $5,000 to the pro-Clinton committee have been invited. CLinton herself will not attend. Other speakers on the lineup include Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee executive director Guy Cecil and EMILY’s List president Stephanie Schriock, whose group grooms and backs candidates who favor abortion rights. Strategists James Carville, Paul Begala and Harold Ickes will attend – all old names from President Bill Clinton's orbit. 'If she's ready to start the engine, so are we,' one event organizer told The Hill. Webb announced his exploratory committee's formation in a message posted from his Twitter account late Wednesday, making him the first candidate of either of the two major political parties to take an official step toward running for the White House. 'A strong majority of Americans agree that we are at a serious crossroads,' Webb wrote in a message posted to a website for his committee along with a 14-minute video address. 'In my view, the solutions are not simply political, but those of leadership. I learned long ago on the battlefields of Vietnam that in a crisis, there is no substitute for clear-eyed leadership.' The former Virginia senator has hinted at a possible presidential campaign for months and made campaign appearances this fall with Democrats in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. But any Democratic presidential primary candidate not named Hillary Clinton is considered a long shot at this stage. Webb's surprise announcement, released shortly before midnight, sets off the possibility of a challenge, at least. The field could also include Vice President Joe Biden, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who is considering running in the Democratic primary. Other names floated to MailOnline by pollsters and fundraisers in background conversations include New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and California Gov. Jerry Brown. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had all the Democratic Party's presidential momentum a few months ago but now must share the spotlight with other White House hopefuls on the political left . Clinton transitioned from the State Department back into political life without a hiccup, stumping for Democrats in November with mixed results . Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist and veteran of presidential campaigns, told the Associated Press that Webb can offer bipartisan appeal to an electorate soured by gridlock in Washington. 'Whether he can overcome Hillary Clinton's enormous, overwhelming advantage is something that only time will tell,' he said. Webb's decision to form an exploratory committee increases the likelihood that Clinton could position herself ideologically between two other candidates in order to paint each of them as an extremist. 'With O'Malley on the left and Webb on her right, Secretary Clinton may have a perfect opportunity to triangulate,' McMahon said. The message from Webb included appeals to Democrats who have struggled during the economic recovery and criticized political leaders for being too close to Wall Street. The former senator also makes the case for a shift in foreign policy that cautions against overseas entanglements. Webb said the nation faces major obstacles in governing and pointed to domestic and foreign policy items that need to be atop the agenda. 'We need to put our American house in order, to provide educational and working opportunities that meet the needs of the future.' He noted the stock market has nearly tripled during 'this so-called ""recovery""' while income levels and loans to small business owners have decreased. He said the U.S. needs to 'redefine and strengthen our national security obligations, while at the same time reducing ill-considered foreign ventures.' Military man: Webb (right, with Gen. David Petraeus) is a Vietnam veteran and former Navy Secretary who held that job for four years in the Reagan administration . Webb acknowledged he would face considerable challenges in a presidential bid, saying 'early support will be crucial as I evaluate whether we might overcome what many commentators see as nearly impossible odds.' The committee will allow Webb to raise money and travel the nation to test the waters for a potential campaign. The 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran served as Navy secretary under President Ronald Reagan. He defeated Republican Sen. George Allen in his 2006 Senate campaign, serving one term. In the message, he said he entered the race against Allen only nine months before the election and trailed by 30 percentage points before prevailing. Webb cast himself as an outsider, saying, 'In politics, nobody owns me, and I don't owe anybody anything, except for the promise that I will work for the well-being of all Americans, especially those who otherwise would have no voice in the corridors of power.' 'All I ask is that you consider the record I am putting before you, and give me the opportunity to earn your trust,' he said.","Hundreds of high-dollar Clinton donors will hear from 'Ready for Hillary' leaders and Democratic Party luminaries Friday in New York .

"Pope Francis has warned that planet earth could face a doomsday scenario if the world does not stop abusing its resources for profit . The pontiff warned that nature would exact revenge, and urged the world's leaders to rein in their greed and help the hungry. He told the Second International Conference on Nutrition (CIN2) in Rome: 'God always forgives, but the earth does not. Pope Francis has warned that planet earth would not forgive the abuse of its resources for profit, and urged the world's leaders to rein in their greed and help the hungry . 'Take care of the earth so it does not respond with destruction.' The three-day meeting aimed at tackling malnutrition, and included representatives from 190 countries. It was organised by the UN food agency (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) in the Italian capital. The 77-year old said the world had 'paid too little heed to those who are hungry.' While the number of undernourished people dropped by over half in the past two decades, 805 million people were still affected in 2014. 'It is also painful to see the struggle against hunger and malnutrition hindered by 'market priorities', the 'primacy of profit', which reduce foodstuffs to a commodity like any other, subject to speculation and financial speculation in particular,' Francis said. He told the Second International Conference on Nutrition (CIN2) in Rome: 'God always forgives, but the earth does not' 'The hungry remain at the street corner... and ask for a healthy diet. We ask for dignity, not for charity,' he said. He urged the world's population to have 'mutual respect, instead of fighting between themselves, damaging and impoverishing the planet.' While he praised the work of the FAO and WHO in getting the delegates to adopt a 'Rome Declaration on Nutrition' and 'Framework for Action', he called on those drawing up 'rules and technical measures' not to lose sight of the hungry man 'fighting for survival'. 'Feed the hungry, save life on the planet,' Francis said at the end of his speech which was met with a standing ovation. The declaration focuses on improving access to healthy food but also the growing problem of inactive over-eaters. Two billion people suffer from deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamin A, iron and zinc - a condition known as 'hidden hunger' by experts - while 42 million children and 500 million adults are overweight or obese.","The pontiff warned that the world is risking a doomsday scenario .

"A shooting at a home in a secluded wooded area of southern New Jersey left two children dead and a woman believed to be their mother and the children's brother critically wounded, state police said Thursday. Officials said they were not prepared Thursday afternoon to say whether the shooting in Tabernacle is considered a murder-suicide, but they did say there is no active search for a shooter and there is not believed to be a dangerous person in the area. Police did not release the name of the victims, saying they need to reach next of kin first. Scroll down for video .

Distraught: A woman covers her hand as she speaks with investigators on Thursday . Two families lived at the Tabernacle residence, neighbors told WABC. The shooting could have been committed as a potential murder-suicide, sources told the affiliate station. State police said they received a call from another relative in the home at about 9:15 a.m. reporting that the mother and children - believe to be middle-school and high-school aged - had been shot. The woman had a single shot to her head; officials would not say where the children were shot. All were found in the same room, and a handgun believed to have been the only weapon used was found, police said. The two survivors were taken to Cooper University Hospital in Camden. The young boy that was hospitalized is ten years old, The South Jersey Times reported. Five other people live in the home, but authorities say none reported hearing any shooting. The reason for that was another issue that officials said they couldn't explain yet. 'It's going to be a long time before we know exactly what happened,' state police Detective Geoff Noble said. 'At this point, I can tell you we are far from determining if this is a murder-suicide,' he said, NBC Philadelphia reported. 'What I can certainly tell you is that we are handling this as a homicide investigation.' Authorities said all the other residents of the home had been accounted for. The Burlington County community is located in the sparsely populated New Jersey Pinelands, about 30 miles east of Philadelphia. Neighbors said they did not know the residents of the house and did not hear any commotion Thursday morning until troopers arrived and helicopters began hovering overhead.

"Cameron Diaz has found herself at the centre of a plagiarism row after an Italian author sued the producers of her  film The Other Woman claiming they  ripped off one of his novels. Writer Paolo Limiti claims 20th Century Fox stole the plot of his 1999 novel Bugiardo e incosciente (Liar and Fool) for their film which came out earlier this year. The film, like the book, is about a woman who discovers her boyfriend is married and cheating on both his wife and herself with a third much younger woman. Scroll down for video . Plagiarism row: Cameron Diaz in The Other Woman. An Italian author has sued claiming producers 20th Century Fox stole the plot from one of his novels . All three women then join forces to get revenge on the man and bring about his economic ruin . Lawyer Daria Pesce representing My Limiti said the only difference was that the book is set in Italy, while the film takes place in the United States. Limiti wrote a script based on his novel in English in 2007 and had shown it to a series of American, Mexican and Spanish producers, his lawyer said. Similarities: Author Paolo Limiti claims the film stole the plot from his 1999 novel Bugiardo e incosciente . It 'is highly likely that one of the people involved had shown the book or the script to an employee of 20th Century Fox', the writ lodged at the Court of Milan says, according to investigative magazine Panorama. There was no immediate comment from 20th Century Fox. The Other Woman which was made on an estimated budget of $40,000,000 was released in April this year and proved a minor hit at the box office taking in $24,763,752 on its opening weekend. It has since gone on to gross almost $83million in the USA alone. However it was panned by many critics with The Daily Mail's Brian Viner slamming it for a lack of laughs and awarding it just two out of five stars. Even the normally generous Empire Magazine awarded it just two out of five stars, describing it as 'shrill and flabby'.","The Other Woman was released in April this year and did well at box office .

"A college student who was sexually assaulted by three fraternity brothers told MailOnline today that she will always be angry at her so-called friends for taking advantage of her when they could have chosen to help. Sarah Butters, 21, from Hopewell, Virginia, was attacked by three men - Mike Lunney, Jay Dertzbaugh and Nick Scallion - during spring break 2013 before they shared the video with other students at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virgina. Despite the fact the school determined the Sigma Chi Fraternity brothers had assaulted the young woman, officials came up with the unique punishment of 'expulsion after graduation'. Two men graduated in May and the third will be returning to school for his senior year next term. Miss Butters said today: 'I definitely blame them and I'm very angry. I had been drinking but they could have taken care of me or helped me but instead they took advantage.' She added: 'I will always be angry at them. They are the ones who made the decision to commit that act.' Scroll down for video . Miss Butters, pictured right, has dropped out of university following the sexual assault after her grades slipped and she was unable to retain financial aid . Jay Dertzbaugh (pictured left) and Nick Scallion (pictured right) along with Mike Lunney were found responsible by James Madison University of the sexual assault of a fellow students Sarah Butters during spring break 2013. The three frat brothers, identified by TV station WHSV, were punished by being banned from JMU - after they receive their degrees . Miss Butters has since dropped out of university after her grades slipped and she lost financial aid. The attack on Miss Butters took place in March of her sophomore year when she took a trip to . Panama beach, Florida with a group of girlfriends from college. Dozens of other JMU students also poured into the resort to party. She told MailOnline on Thursday that the . last thing she remembered before the attack, which followed a day of . drinking on the beach, was being in a male friend's apartment. While . still on her trip, Miss Butters learned that a video had been made of . her, visibly drunk and topless, being groped by the three men in a . bathroom, Huffington Post reported. The tape reportedly shows the men, . laughing and trying to pull Miss Butters onto their laps and trying to . remove her bikini bottoms, according to Huffington Post. Lunney, Dertzbaugh and Scallion were first identified by WHSV. Miss Butters said she confronted the three men, whom she considered friends, who denied the attack. She said: 'I asked the boys what they knew about this video and they told me: ''I don't know what you're talking about.''' When . she returned to college in Virginia, Miss Butters found that the video . had been shared further and was being talked about online on school . gossip sites. She got access to the video in order to see if for . herself. Student Sarah Butters was sexually assaulted by three frat brothers at James Madison University in 2013. The men have been banned from the college - but are allowed to graduate first . She told MailOnline today: 'I felt like the girl [on the video] wasn't me. It was like looking at someone else. I was disgusted. I hated that this had been made public.' JMU Students discussed the video on JMU gossip site, School Dirt. 'No surprise here,' one person wrote. Another wrote: 'How the f*** are these kids still on campus?' Miss Butters consulted her father, a police officer, as she was totally 'overwhelmed' by what had happened. On advice from her father and several legal experts, she decided not to go to police in Florida because it would have been difficult and costly to take action against her attackers out of state. She said today that she was advised not to go the police in Virginia because the case would have been difficult to prosecute because it did happen out of state. In January this year, Miss Butters worked up the courage to hand the tape over to officials at JMU and filed a formal complaint. Director of judicial affairs Josh Bacon told Miss Butters he could not determine if the video was consensual, she said. At a first hearing, the school found Lunney, Dertzbaugh and Scallion responsible for sexual assault and sexual harassment. Their punishment was being expelled after receiving their degrees. Miss Butters said: 'I told the hearing that I was not okay with that. I had to see them on campus. This did not affect their lives and it affected my life for a year.' A school official told her it was rare for anyone to expelled and the student handbook listed suspension as the harshest punishment for sexual assault. Miss Butters appealed the punishment and a hearing board decided to expel the three fraternity brothers. Lunney, Dertzbaugh and Scallion then . subsequently appealed and a final hearing board in April decided to . stick with the 'expulsion post graduation' punishment. The three men were barred from contacting Miss Butters, are not allowed to walk at their commencement ceremony and cannot return to campus after graduation. However they will receive their degrees. Another of the school's punishments was to have the three men create a 30-minute presentation on sexual assault 'for possible presentation to student organizations', according to a document seen by MailOnline. Following the school's muted reaction, Miss Butters complained to federal officials in April which has brought JMU under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). In a statement to MailOnline today, JMU said: 'The University takes the issue of sexual assault/harassment very seriously, and will cooperate fully with the OCR investigation. 'It is an important and deeply troubling problem, and the public discourse should serve to bring focus to the topic. Due to legal/privacy requirements, there are limitations to what we can say publicly about a pending matter of this type.' The Virginia school is among 63 higher education facilities across the U.S. being federally investigated for their handling of sexual assaults. Miss Butters said that she believes her treatment by JMU will make other victims of sexual assault hesitate about coming forward to report what has happened to them. She said: 'I feel like it sends an awful message to female students if someone like me, who has video evidence of being sexually assaulted cannot see her attackers punished. It was a miserable, stressful process. 'I feel it is putting other students at risk having these men walk around campus. Instead JMU wanted to give these men diplomas.' James Madison University (pictured) punished three male students with a ban from campus after they graduate - despite seeing a video of the fraternity brothers sexually assault a fellow student while she was visibly intoxicated and topless . Miss Butters has left JMU after her grades dropped following the assault and she was unable to maintain financial aid. She said on Thursday: 'Since I was in the eighth grade and went on a class trip, I have been in love with James Madison. It was my home for three years. 'I had pride and trust in my school, I thought they would protect me. Having their diploma on my wall is not something I'd be proud of anymore.' Miss Butters said she would have found it difficult to return to college next semester with one of the men who assaulted her still at the school. The 21-year-old, who is working in a hotel for the summer, is working out her options to attend college in the fall. The communications undergrad now plans to pursue a career in guidance counseling. Lisa Maatz, American Association of University Women vice president of . government relations, said that it was already extremely difficult for victims of sexual assaults to come forward at university. She said: 'This type of outcome is certainly emblematic . of campus cultures that seem to place a high priority on not . inconveniencing perpetrators while undermining campus safety for all. 'In . this case, the university's own process found these students in . violation of school policy - and the university still couldn't see their . way clear to immediate expulsion? Where's the message in that? It's . certainly not a deterrent. 'For women on campus, I think it says: ''Don't bother to report what happened. You'll find no justice here.'''","James Madison University found Mike Lunney, Jay Dertzbaugh and Nick Scallion responsible for the sexual assault of Sarah Butters during spring break 2013 .

"Illinois Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, who won a second term in the U.S. House two weeks ago, has given birth to a daughter. Duckworth gave birth to Abigail O'kalani Bowlsbey on Tuesday and the lawmaker's office made the announcement yesterday. Abigail is Duckworth's first child. The birth came a few weeks before her due date of December 5. Good news: Iraq veteran and Illinois Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, pictured left, and right with her husband Bryan Bowlsbey, has given birth to her first child, a girl she has named Abigail O'kalani Bowlsbey . In a statement reported by the Chicago-Tribune Duckworth said: 'My husband Bryan and I are thrilled to announce that we are the proud parents of a baby girl. 'Abigail O'kalani Bowlsbey was born on Nov. 18. Bryan and I were deeply honored that Senator Akaka acted as Hawaiian elder and selected her middle name.' Daniel Akaka, a Democrat, served as a senator from Hawaii until 2013. Duckworth met her husband Bryan Bowlsbey at George Washington University and married him in 1993. He is a Major in the National Guard. The 46-year-old Iraq veteran, who lost both of her legs and suffered serious injuries to her right arm while serving in 2004, was born in Thailand and spent part of her youth in Hawaii where she graduated from McKinley High School. Service: Duckworth is pictured serving with the Illinois Army National Guard during her tour of duty in Iraq. In 2004, she lost both legs when the helicopter she was in was shot down on a mission near Baghdad . Fighter: She is pictured wearing her Purple Heart medal at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 2004 . Her mother is Thai and her late father was American. Duckworth announced her pregnancy on NBC's 'Today' show in September saying she and her husband, a major with the National Guard Bureau, had used assisted reproductive technology in order for her to conceive. The newborn's earlier-than-expected arrival caps off a successful month. She was a second term in congress on November 12. In October it was announced that Duckworth, a lieutenant colonel in the Illinois Army National Guard, was retiring from the military. Duckworth was flying a Black Hawk helicopter over Iraq on November 12, 2004 when she was shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade, losing both of her legs and shattering her right arm. After returning to the U.S. and learning how to walk with the help of prosthetics, she worked for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and as the Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs between 2006 and 2009. She was elected to Congress in 2012. Band of mothers: Duckworth, middle, on the Today show with fellow veteran amputees, Melissa Stockwell, left, who is also expecting a baby, and Dawn Halfaker, right, who gave birth four months ago . Duckworth is the first disabled female veteran and the first female Asian American from Illinois to serve in the House. She is also one of five female veterans who lost limbs in Iraq and, coincidentally, four of them are pregnant or recently gave birth. Melissa Stockwell, who lost most of her left leg from a roadside bomb in 2004 before going on to compete in the 2008 Paralympics, also appeared on the show. Her son is due in November. 'Tammy and I as being lower limb amputees I think very initially wondered if it would be possible to have children and learned pretty quickly you can still have children and provide, but I think you have to find yourself first,' Stockwell said. They appeared on the show beside Dawn Halfaker, who lost an arm in Iraq, and who is now mother to a four-month-old boy. Then finally, Danielle Green-Byrd, who lost an arm during combat in 2004 before helping vets with PTSD, gave birth to a son 10 days ago. 'These women were there for me as the band of sisters when I went through the greatest pain, the greatest trauma in my life,' Duckworth said. 'And now we get to be together for the time of greatest joy.'","Tammy Duckworth gave birth to Abigail O'kalani Bowlsbey .

"With its carefully collated facts and figures, it reads like a set of company accounts. But closer inspection of the 400-page document reveals it is a chilling breakdown of the murderous activities of the fanatics battling for control of Iraq. For this is the 'annual report' of the Al Qaeda-inspired Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), designed to demonstrate its power and attract funds from potential donors. Like any corporate document, it uses computer-generated graphics, details a management strategy, lists performance and targets. Scroll down for video . But the jihadists' statistics chart in numerical and geographical detail its lethal operations – bombings, assassinations, suicide missions and cities taken over. In the latest edition of 'al-Naba' – the News –  covering the 12 months up to last November, ISIS claims to have carried out nearly 10,000 operations in Iraq. That includes 1,000 assassinations, planting more than 4,000 roadside bombs and freeing  hundreds of prisoners. ISIS even records the number of people who renounced Islam then repented – and contains one sickening category headed 'apostates run over'. The report, written in Arabic with a photograph of an ISIS gunman on its cover, has been analysed by the US think-tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which has corroborated much of the information. John Lawrence, of the Washington-based institute said: 'These numbers are not just purely propaganda figures.' Taking no prisoners: A man is executed by fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as the Al Qaeda-inspired militants continue their march towards Baghdad . Details: The Isis report uses computer-generated graphics to detail the group's reign of terror in the Middle East.

ISIS's aim appears to be to . demonstrate its record to potential donors, and ISW says the annual . report, the second published in as many years, destroys the myth that . the insurgents are a rag-tag band of Islamist militants. The . ISW analysis portrays an organisation 'functioning as a military rather . than a terrorist network' with a clear political strategy aimed to . eventually set up a Sunni sectarian state run under harsh Sharia laws. Jessica Lewis, director of research at the institute, told the Financial . Times: 'The reports provide measures of performance in the way you roll . out details for donors. Numbers: Another set of graphics in the report shows the weaponry Isis now has in its possession . Isis claims in the 2013 report to have 15,000 fighters who have carried out 1,000 assassinations . 'They . affirm that the organisation operates like an army and that it has . state-building ambitions.' The ISW study concludes: 'This is a military . enemy that requires a considered strategy, military as well as involving . anti-ISIS Sunni populations, to defeat it, or it will become a . permanent fixture in the Middle East.' The . latest annual report does not include the ISIS fanatics' major gains in . recent weeks, where they have swept through northern Iraq, carrying out . summary executions. They are now battling government forces close to . Baghdad. This year has also . been successful in financial terms for the terror group.

The road to Baghdad: Fierce fighting is currently taking place at Baqubah, the last major city before the capital, as ISIS militants seize control of vast swathes of northern Iraq . According to the Council on . Foreign Relations, ISIS was already extorting taxes from Mosul . businesses before its takeover – to the tune of £4million a month. In . its 2013 document, ISIS says it took over eight cities, compared to one . the previous year. The ISW warns that the number of attacks reported by . ISIS may be exaggerated but month by month, area by area, the document . reveals soaring levels of violence. In . 2013, ISIS claims to have executed 1,083 people – almost double the 585 . in 2012. Mortar attacks jumped from 359 in 2012 to 607 last year and . the number of houses burned or bombed rose from 648 to 1,015.

"Food Network chef Giada de Laurentiis stays thin by secretly spitting out the food she cooks while filming into a 'dump bucket'. The TV host, 'Today' show contributor and cookbook author has always insisted she maintains her size 2 figure by eating everything in moderation. And recently said exactly how she stays thin, is the question she is most often asked by fans. Scroll down for video . Food Network chef Giada de Laurentiis stays thin by secretly spitting out the food she cooks while filming into a 'dump bucket', a source on the program has claimed . Ms de Laurentiis has previously said she maintains her size 2 figure by eating in moderation . She told health.com: 'I eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything. Everything in moderation. 'I know that's really hard for people to understand, but I grew up in an Italian family where we didn't overdo anything. We ate pasta, yes, but not a lot of it. Pasta doesn't make you fat. How much pasta you eat makes you fat.' But a source on her show told the New York Post's PageSix that while filming Ms de Laurentiis 'never eats'. The source said: 'When she is making drinks and food that she has to drink or eat, they have a dump bucket that is brought out the second they cut.' Ms de Laurentiis is then said to spit out the food, before filming resumes. A representative for Ms de Laurentiis said she 'absolutely' eats the food that she cooks but because of the number of times scenes that are shot, she doesn't always 'eat and shallow every time' The source explained that sometimes an assistant was used to 'take the bite' of food if something needed to look like she had tried it, saying 'she does not eat at all while filming' Stephen Huvane, who represents Ms de Laurentiis, called the claims 'absurd and completely false'. He said the chef 'absolutely' eats her own food while filming but because scenes were often shot multiple times 'she doesn't always eat and swallow every time'. Mr Huvane said if his client ate everything she cooked 'that would be like eating six to eight meals a day'.","Giada de Laurentiis is a Food Network chef and a cookbook author .

"A devoted mother and her three young children have been killed after a fire ripped through the family's mobile home in Maine, police have said. The bodies of Norma Skidgel, 28, her  three-year-old son, Trenton Delisle, and two-year-old twins, Mason and Madison Delisle, and were found  in a back bedroom of the trailer in Caribou this morning. Investigators are still searching for a cause of the fire, but they said a fire alarm was found in the home with its batteries removed. The four bodies will be transported to the state medical examiner for an autopsy that will likely take place today. Protecting her children: The body of Norma Skidgel, 28, and her three-year-old son, Trenton Delisle, (pictured together) were found together in a back bedroom of the family home in Caribou, Maine, this morning . Heart-breaking: Ms Skidgel's two-year-old twins, Mason and Madison Delisle (above), were also killed in the blaze . Destroyed: Investigators are still searching for a cause of the fire, but they said a fire alarm was found in the home with its batteries removed . Investigators say the family shared the home with Ms Skidgel's sister, Amy Bouchard and her two sons. Ms Bouchard was out walking with one of her sons when the blaze erupted, The Press Herald reported, and returned home to find the trailer on fire. She rushed into the burning trailer in a desperate bid to save her sister and nephews, but was unable to reach them, according to reports. She is being treated in hospital for smoke inhalation. In a poignant and tragic last post on Facebook five days before she died, stay-at-home mother Ms Skidgel shared an image of a lit candle with the words, 'Share this candle of Love if you miss someone in Heaven above. Gone, but never forgotten.' And today, tributes  to the 'caring' mother and her three 'precious babies' began pouring in on social media. James Ballantyne wrote on Facebook: 'Rip GIRL norma and her babies didnt deserve that!!!!!!!!!!!!! Alll she wanted was the best life for her children........ I hope you have a better life of no pain nor drama........ You are a good caring friend and caring mother ... You helped me through my rough time i had there in caribou...... I will miss ya girl.' Travis Drake added: 'Rest in peace Norma Trenton, Madison and my sweet sweet little man mason. I'll love and miss you guys like crazy. To you Mason you will be with me and my heart to you ... I loved you like my own buddy.' A week before the tragedy, she posted photographs of herself strapping her children into a car alongside the caption: 'Fun fun ride to bangor at least they're having a gd time on such a long ride.' 'Caring': Today, tributes began flooding in on social media to the 'caring' mother and her three 'precious babies' Firefighters rushed into a burning mobile home in far northern Maine early Thursday but they were too late. The blaze had torn through the home at about 7 a.m., state police said. The children were taken to a hospital where they were pronounced dead, while the woman died at the scene, police said. Officials said the fire occurred in a mobile home park on the city's outskirts, about four miles from Aroostook National Wildlife Refuge.  The small park consists of three rows of trailers in a sparsely populated, rural area. The blaze had torn through the home at about 7 a.m., state police said. The children were taken to a hospital where they were pronounced dead, while the woman died at the scene, police said . Happy family: Investigators say three other people also lived at the mobile home and one of them is being treated at a local hospital for smoke inhalation . Maine Public Safety Department spokesman Steven McCausland said 25 people have died in fires this year in the state, the most in 21 years. Fires killed 27 in 1993. This month has been especially deadly for Maine fires — a fire November 1 in Portland claimed six lives and another this week killed a man in St. Francis in far northern Maine. The 11 fire fatalities in November have accounted for more in one month than occurred in all of 2010, when the state recorded nine fatalities, all-time low for the state. The worst year for fire deaths was 1967, when 70 people died from fires, McCausland said. ""It illustrates how quickly the death total can rise with a single fire and multiple victims,"" McCausland said. State public health officials encouraged residents to make sure their homes have working smoke detectors and that families review fire escape route plans. The cause of the fire was still under investigation.","Norma Skidgel was found with Trenton, 3, and twins Mason and Madison, 2 .

"Often overlooked in favour of it's bigger sister Stockholm, Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is making its mark on the culinary scene with four Michelin star restaurants and a soaring food culture. Keen to sample a different aspect of Swedish life, well-known presenter and DJ Alex Zane visited the city to try some of its infamous seafood dishes. 'The city is still relatively untouched by tourists' he says, and the best restaurant he ate in was Sjömagasinet, which is 'the perfect place to enjoy fish in Gothenburg'. Read our Q&A with him to find out what he made of the Scandinavian city. Alex goes to Gothenburg: 'The place was packed full of hidden marine gems.... all delicious!' What hidden gems does Gothenburg offer? Described by many as the ‘Little London’, I knew I was in for something special when I boarded the plane to Sweden’s second city. With a buzzing design scene and a vibrant bar culture, it’s not surprising that Gothenburg is beginning to draw tourists in from across the world. My visit to the city on the other hand, revealed some of the lesser-known reasons why people are making the journey here. With the largest harbour in Scandinavia (and it’s pretty impressive in size) and the term ‘Scandi food’ starting to be used by more and more visitors, the city’s reputation for cuisine is starting to appeal to more than just food experts. For me, the place was packed full of hidden marine gems from the sea, all cooked and prepared in the ‘Gothenburg way’ and all delicious! Eat your heart out: Scandinavian city now has four Michelin star restaurants and a vibrant food scene . Catch of the day: Gothenburg is known for its fresh fish and indoor Feskekôrka market . Is it somewhere for a weekend or is there enough to do on a longer break? I could have eaten the food there for weeks, but there is more than enough to keep you entertained beyond the weekend if food alone doesn’t entice you. We went to the Liseberg amusement park on one of our days there, which first opened in 1923 and is fully powered by renewable energy. The wooden roller coaster has won all kinds of awards and I could see why that was the case as I stumbled out of the cart after my fifth go. Best restaurant? The best meal I ate while I was there this time was at the Sjömagasinet restaurant, which is ideally located by the waterfront and serves up Michelin starred dishes made from the freshest produce from the harbour that day. It’s in a stunning setting and, and the perfect place to enjoy fish in Gothenburg. Wander around the indoor Feskekôrka market to see delicious fresh fish pulled from the North sea . Fish selfie: Alex's favourite place to eat was Sjömagasinet restaurant and he stayed at Hotel Pigalle . The city has the biggest harbour in Scandinavia so it's rife with shellfish and other marine delicacies . Best place to stay? Hotel Pigalle. If you can’t stay, then make sure you just go in to see the eclectic decorations within – a feast for the eyes. Alex's favourite thing about Gothenburg and why? According to new research from American Express, Brits have sampled an average of seven different cuisines in the past year, so it seems dining around the world is becoming a bit of a trend. Scandinavia is gaining an unrivalled reputation for its seafood across the globe and Gothenburg has its biggest port, so it’s at the very heart of this. While the city is still relatively untouched by tourists, now is a great time to go over and sample the local delicacies.

"When Gordon Hailwood saw the first flickering video images of a wall of oozing, stinking grease, he knew that his day had taken a turn for the worse. This wasn’t just a normal sewer blockage. This was the mother of all blockages — a putrid, steaming mountain of congealed lard and worse, the size of a double-decker bus and weighing a staggering 15 tons. Disgusting isn’t the word. Dante claimed Hell had nine circles, while Jean-Paul Sartre insisted that Hell was other people. But clearly neither had ever been in close proximity to a ‘fatberg’. Scroll down for video . Screen grab from CCTV footage of a giant 'fatberg' discovered in a sewer under the streets of Kingston in south London. It was described as the size of a double decker bus . They look revolting, they smell . revolting, they harbour disease and they are almost impossible to shift. And if one forms in the sewer near your home, then heaven help you. Unless it is quickly removed, your drains and lavatories will soon be . overflowing with filth. What’s most shocking is that the . number of fatbergs is on the rise, and our careless attitude to what we . flush down the drains and sewers — and our love affairs with fattening . takeaway food and cooking oil — are responsible. ‘We get immune to most things, but . when you come across a lump of decomposing fat, the smell is horrid,’ says Gordon, who has cleared sewers for Thames Water for 18 years. ‘The fatbergs are usually lard-coloured, with flecks of brown and black, depending on what is in them. ‘If you touch it, or if it gets on . your skin, then the smell stays with you for five to seven days, no . matter how many times you wash or shower. ‘It’s like old rotten compost, or musty dog combined with the smell of sewers.’ Among the biggest problems are . wet-wipes and other products that are flushed away but don’t break down . in the sewer, says Gordon. If they snag, then the fat starts to congeal . on them and it builds up. ‘People flush fat down the sink and . think that because they pour a kettle of hot water after it that it’s . gone,’ he says. ‘But of course they just move the problem on. No amount . of detergent stops it congealing in the sewer.’ The accumulation of fat in our . crumbling, Victorian sewers is nothing new — although the amount of oil . we are consuming in our diets is. Sixteen years ago I wrote for the . Daily Mail about the sludge choking up the drains and sewers of Central . London — mostly from restaurants and takeaways that failed to fit . fat-traps to siphon off the waste. Back in 1997, Thames Water reckoned it . had to scrape away 37 cubic feet of congealed fat from sewers in the . heart of the capital, using hand-picks and pressure hoses. But that was . from a two-mile area. What is astonishing about this latest . fatberg is the sheer volume in one giant lump under a single street in . an outer London suburb. To put it into perspective, in the . late Nineties, Thames Water spent £2 million scraping fat from its . network. Last year it spent £12 million. Such costs are inevitably . passed on to customers via their bills. But nothing has ever rivalled the record-breaking fatberg discovered by Gordon’s team in Kingston  upon Thames. That plug of grease was so big it . nearly blocked the 2.4m-wide brick sewer and caused toilets to stop . flushing in a nearby block of flats. Left for a few days longer, the  sewer . would have clogged up completely, forcing raw sewage out of manholes . and up through toilets into bathrooms — spreading the kind of filth and . disease normally associated with the poorest shanty towns in the world. ‘I’ve never seen anything like it,’ says Gordon, whose team worked every night for three weeks to  clear it, . using shovels and a high-pressure hose. ‘We know exactly how much it weighed . because we scraped out the fat and took it away to be measured. Normally . you would pull out one or two tons. But this weighed 15 tons.’ Rivers of filth: If workers hadn't cleared the mass, raw sewage could have spurted out of manholes across the whole of Kingston . In suburban areas, households are as . much to blame as restaurants and takeaway outlets for pouring cooking . oil down sinks. When the oil hits the cold water in sewers, it . congeals. Fat and oil should be bottled and disposed of in bins, water . companies say. Yet Londoners alone pour away around 33-44 million litres of cooking oil each year. The careless disposal of fat is only . part of the story of how a fatberg forms. We are also becoming more . fastidious about our bodies — using wet-wipes as never before. Once they were used only on babies — . now they can be found in bathrooms nationwide. As with many things, . celebrities have helped fuel the trend. Sales of wet-wipes are rising by . around 15 per cent a year, with many sold on the promise they are . ‘flush-able’. That’s a word the water companies dispute. Those . ‘flushable wipes’ cause 75 per cent of all sewer blockages, according to . Thames Water. The company says it clears nearly . 40,000 blockages every year in its 59,000 miles of sewers and pipes. It . is a similar story for water firms in other parts of the UK. Simon Evans, a Thames Water spokesman, . says: ‘We are seeing an increasing trend across Britain of people using . wet-wipes instead of loo roll. Goodness knows why. ‘Our sewers are designed to take human . waste and loo roll, and nothing else. When a wipe goes down, it doesn’t . break down. Manufacturers say they do eventually, but that’s in a . landfill site. In contrast, loo roll breaks down in seconds. ‘No moistened wipe has yet to come on the market that is acceptable to sewers.’ When wipes are flushed away, they . catch on joints or corners of sewers, particularly in older Victorian . tunnels that run under our major towns and cities. Fat congeals on the wipes, which . attracts more wipes — and more fat. The bergs build up like foul . stalactites from the roofs of sewers. About the latest fatberg, Mr Evans . says: ‘We’ve removed greater volumes of fat from under the sewers in . Central London but we’ve never come across a congealed single lump of . lard of this size. ‘It was clinging to the roof and the floor, and was the whole breadth of the sewer.’ The solution, according to water . companies, is for people to look to the continent. If they want to use . wipes, they should do what the Greeks do. Much of the plumbing in Greece is . unable to cope with toilet paper, so visitors to the loo must place . paper in a bin. What works for toilet paper, works for wipes. The longer-term solution, though, is . surely to start investing in bidets. What could be cleaner, cheaper and . less harmful to the environment than a dose of old-fashioned water and . soap? Wipes, meanwhile, are best left for . changing nappies. Otherwise, Gordon Hailwood and his colleagues at water . companies across the country will ultimately find themselves facing . fatbergs the size of mountains.","Stinking mass of congealed rotting fat and other sickening waste found .

"Adrian Peterson has pledged never to use a switch to discipline his child again and revealed that he called his son last week, the first time he's spoken to him in five months. The Minnesota Vikings running back was charged with felony child abuse in Texas for using a wooden switch to discipline his four-year-old son. He pleaded no contest  to misdemeanor reckless assault earlier this month. But the NFL star, who's been on paid leave from the Vikings for more than two months, told a newspaper that he 'won't ever use a switch again', that he has been seeing a therapist and meeting a pastor certified in counseling near his Houston-area home, and has learned other ways to discipline his children. Scroll down for video . Adrian Peterson has pledged never to use a switch to discipline his child again . The Minnesota Vikings running back was charged with felony child abuse in Texas . He told USA Today: 'I won't ever use a switch again. There's different situations where a child needs to be disciplined as far as timeout, taking their toys away, making them take a nap. There's so many different ways to discipline your kids.' He added: 'No one knows how I felt when I turned my child around after spanking him and seeing what I had left on his leg. No one knows that Dad sat there and apologized to him, hugged him and told him that I didn't mean to do this to you and how sorry I was.' Peterson said that he phoned his son last week. During the emotional call, the first conversation between the pair since June, his son said 'I love you, Dad. Can I come over to your house?' He also revealed that he may move on from the Vikings, as it might be best for both him and the team. Peterson said he believes the coaches and players on the team are fully behind him but that feelings in the organization toward him are mixed. 'I know who loves me. The coaches and the players, it's not going to be a problem. I've felt so much support from those guys. The organization, I know there's people in the organization that support me and there's people that I know internally that has not been supporting me,' Peterson told the newspaper. He said he has given a lot of thought to the idea that 'maybe it's best for me to get a fresh start somewhere else.' Peterson speaks to the media after pleading no contest to an assault charge in Conroe, Texas . 'I would love to go back and play in Minnesota to get a feel and just see if my family still feels comfortable there. But if there's word out that, hey, they might release me, then so be it. I would feel good knowing that I've given everything I had in me.' On paid leave from the Vikings for more than two months, Peterson was informed this week by the NFL he will be suspended without pay for at least the rest of the season. The NFL Players Association has appealed the punishment on his behalf, and Peterson will continue to draw his salary on the exempt list until the appeal is resolved. Regardless of which team he plays for next year, assuming he's reinstated by the league, Peterson said his focus has been on family — restoring his relationship with the boy and becoming a better parent. Peterson has fathered six children by six different women. He was married July 19. Peterson said he declined to meet with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last week because of unanswered questions he and the union had about the process. 'I didn't want to go into a situation blind. I didn't know what to expect. Who's going to be there? Who will I be meeting with? What details are we going to get into?' he said. Peterson also said he was upset by Goodell's accusation in the letter about the suspension that he showed 'no meaningful remorse' about injuring the boy. 'Ultimately, I know I'll have my opportunity to sit down with Roger face to face, and I'll be able to say a lot of the same things that I've said to you,' Peterson told the newspaper. 'Don't say that I'm not remorseful, because in my statement, I showed that I was remorseful. I regretted everything that took place. I love my child, more than anyone could ever imagine.'","Adrian Peterson was charged with felony child abuse in Texas .

"A Georgia inmate who raped and murdered a 15-year-old girl in 1989 became the first person on death row to be executed since the botched lethal injection of Oklahoma killer Clayton Lockett in late April. Marcus Wellons, 59, received a lethal injection late Tuesday in Jackson, Georgia, after last-minute appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court were denied. A prison guard fainting shortly before he was pronounced dead at 11:56 p.m, more than an hour after the procedure began. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which witnessed the execution, said Mr Wellons apologized for the 1989 rape and murder of his 15-year-old neighbor India Roberts in suburban Atlanta. Scroll down for video . Condemned: Marcus Wellons, an inmate in Georgia, became the first person to be put to death since April. His final words were reportedly: 'I'm going home to be with Jesus' Condemned men: John Winfield (left) followed Wellons minutes later as they became the first two people put to death since April;  John Ruthell Henry's (right) execution is scheduled Wednesday night in Florida despite claims that he is mentally ill . Wellons reportedly apologized to the family of his victim and said: 'I ask and hope that you will find peace with my . death'. His final words were: 'I'm going home to be with Jesus.' The . Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday denied clemency to . Wellons, leaving his fate in the hands of the courts. Only . five minutes after Wellons was pronounced dead, Missouri authorities commenced . the lethal injection of John E. Winfield at 12.01am. He was . pronounced dead at 12.10am. Winfield, 46, was put to death for shooting three St. Louis County women in the . head in 1996, killing two. According to the Death Penalty Info Twitter feed, Winfield took four or five deep breaths as the drug was injected, puffed his cheeks twice, and then fell silent. The U.S. Supreme Court had also refused late Tuesday to halt his execution, and Missouri Governor Jay Nixon denied clemency. Wellons was served Shepherd's Pie, mashed potatoes and red beans as a final meal although it was unclear if he ate it, according to Death Penalty Info. The same feed also said that Winfield declined to have a final meal. The executions were the first since the botched April 29 in Oklahoma raised new concerns about lethal injection. Another convicted killer, John Ruthell Henry, is scheduled to die later Wednesday in Florida. All . the states planning executions — Florida, Georgia and Missouri — refuse . to say where they get their drugs, or if they are tested. Lawyers . for two of the condemned inmates have challenged the secretive process . used by some states to obtain lethal injection drugs from unidentified, . loosely regulated compounding pharmacies. Nine executions nationwide have been stayed or postponed since late April, when Oklahoma prison officials halted the execution of Clayton Lockett after noting that the lethal injection drugs weren't being administered into his vein properly. Lockett's punishment was halted and he died of a heart attack several minutes later. 'I think after Clayton Lockett's execution everyone is going to be watching very closely,' Fordham University School of Law professor Deborah Denno, a death penalty expert, said of this week's executions. 'The scrutiny is going to be even closer.' Watershed case: Oklahoma death row inmate Clayton Lockett died in April from a heart attack following a botched execution . Marcus Wellons' execution in Georgia was scheduled for 7pm, but was delayed pending the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court appeal. Just before 11pm Eastern Time, the decision came down from the justices refusing to grant Wellons, 59, a last-minute reprieve, clearing the way for his execution an hour later. Georgia and Missouri both use the single drug pentobarbital, a sedative. Florida uses a three-drug combination of midazolam hydrochloride, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride. Despite concerns about the drugs and how they are obtained, death penalty supporters say all three convicted killers are getting what they deserve. Wellons was convicted in the 1989 rape and murder of India Roberts, his 15-year-old neighbor in suburban Atlanta. Soon after the girl left for school, another neighbor heard muffled screams from the apartment where Wellons was living. Later that day, a man told police he saw a man carrying what appeared to be a body in a sheet. Police found the girl's body in a wooded area. She had been strangled and raped. In Missouri, Winfield had been dating Carmelita Donald on and off for several years and fathered two of her children. Donald began dating another man. One night in 1996, in a jealous rage, Winfield showed up outside Donald's apartment in St. Louis County and confronted her, along with two friends of hers. Winfield shot all three women in the head. Arthea Sanders and Shawnee Murphy died. Donald survived but was blinded. Lawyers for two of the men slated to be executed challenged the secretive process used by some states to obtain lethal injection drugs from shady pharmacies . Symone Winfield, the daughter of Donald and John Winfield, was among those who asking Gov. Jay Nixon for clemency, but the relatives of other victims want to see him die. A federal judge granted a stay of execution last week on a claim that a prison worker dropped plans to write a letter in support of clemency due to intimidation from staff. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the stay Tuesday, and attorneys for Winfield appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Florida, the state is moving ahead with the execution of John Ruthell Henry despite claims he is mentally ill and intellectually disabled. The state claims anyone with an IQ of at least 70 is not mentally disabled; testing has shown Henry's IQ at 78, though his lawyers say it should be re-evaluated. Henry stabbed his estranged wife, Suzanne Henry, to death a few days before Christmas in 1985. Hours later, he killed her 5-year-old son from a previous relationship. Against death penalty: Joseph Shippen, far left, Assistant Rector of the Christ Episcopal Church in Macon, Georgia, and Episcopal Bishop Rob Wright, second from left, stand with protestors before the scheduled execution of  Marcus Wellon Tuesday . Powerful message: An unidentified death penalty opponent stands on the grounds of the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson, Georgia . Taking a stand: Bishop Wright, left, and the Rev. Shippen speak out against the execution of Marcus Wellons . Henry had previously pleaded no contest to second-degree murder for fatally stabbing his common-law wife, Patricia Roddy, in 1976, and was on parole when Suzanne Henry and the boy were killed. Asked Tuesday if he had discussed with the Department of Corrections what happened in Oklahoma and if any changes were needed in Florida, Gov. Rick Scott said, 'I focus on making sure that we do things the right way here.' Florida and Missouri trail only Texas as the most active death penalty states. Texas has carried out seven executions. Florida has executed five men in 2014 and Missouri has executed four. Combined, the three states have performed 16 of the 20 executions this year. Wellons was the first Georgia inmate executed since February 2013 and just the second since 2011.","Georgia inmate Marcus Wellons the first execution since April .

"‘You have seen a little glimpse of the future and that is what this club is about,’ said an emotional Ryan Giggs after watching 18-year-old James Wilson live up to the finest traditions of Manchester United by scoring twice on his debut against Hull City on Tuesday night. But it’ll be the club’s next manager Louis van Gaal rather than Giggs who has the ultimate responsibility to ensure the Class of ’14 – Wilson, Tom Lawrence, Adnan Januzaj and others – become the future legends of Old Trafford. It’s been United’s way since the days of Matt Busby to trust young players. Sir Alex Ferguson thought David Moyes would be a good custodian of the tradition, but he was wrong. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Xavi, Iniesta and Muller . History: United have always brought academy players, like Wilson, into their first team . New blood: Youngster James Wilson (second from left) volleys home his first goal for Manchester United . Graduates: (From left to right) Paul Scholes, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs all came through at United . Values: Louis van Gaal has a record of bringing through young talent at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich . Despite his reputation, Van Gaal may actually be a better fit for Wilson and the other teenagers picked by Giggs in his last home game as interim manager. Scratch beneath the surface with Van Gaal – he's renowned for being arrogant, demanding and a disciplinarian – and you’ll find a very impressive track record in developing young players. Some would point out that Ferguson’s decision to throw in the kids at Manchester United in 1995 – David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes – came only a few months after Van Gaal had won the Champions League with an Ajax team packed with youth; Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Marc Overmars, Patrick Kluivert and Kanu among them. It was 18-year-old Kluivert who scored the winning goal against an AC Milan team previously regarded as invincible in the final. Coming through: Marc Overmars (left) and Xavi (right) both benefited from Van Gaal's youth policy in the 1990s . Faith: Van Gaal gave Andres Iniesta (left) his debut for Barcelona when he was just 18 years old . Instant impact: Patrick Kluivert (left) scored the winning goal in the 1995 Champions League final for Van Gaal . Andreas Pereira . Attacking midfield, Age: 18 . Real flair player, very skilful. Signed from PSV Eindhoven and has an eye for scoring spectacular goals such as the one against Liverpool in the Premier League U21 semi final last weekend. Belgian -born but qualifies for Brazil also. Joel Castro Pereira . Goalkeeper, Age: 17 . Born in Switzerland but is Portugal U18s number one. Highly-rated goalkeeper joined after a trial and is tipped to carve out a career at the top. Has excellent attitude, is 6ft 3ins tall, a good shot-stopper and not afraid to come for crosses. Sean Goss . Midfield, Age: 18 . Cultured 6ft 3ins tall midfielder who was signed from Exeter City for £100,000. Sprays the ball around very well and always finds time on the ball. Not had opportunities to break into U21s due to amount of midfielders but has excelled in U18s. Marcus Rashford . Attacking midfield, Age: 16 . One of the top talents in the country for his age group; Highly sought after by England's top clubs, is skilful midfielder who is also comfortable playing in the second striker role. Has played above his age group throughout his young career. Ro-Shaun Williams . Centre-back, Age: 15 . Tall for his age at 6ft 2ins, Williams is a dominant centre back but has good feet and is able to bring the ball out of defence with an eye for a pass also. Has made number of appearances for United's U18s and has been capped by his country. It’s a . pattern that has emerged throughout the Dutchman’s career. At Barcelona, . he gave Andres Iniesta his debut at the age of 18. With Bayern, Thomas . Muller and other young German players got their chance under Van Gaal. Why? First of all, Van Gaal likes attacking football. He spends far more . time working on that than defence and young players have the pace, . energy and sense of adventure you need in an attack-minded team. The way the Ajax side of ’95 dismantled ageing legends like Franco Baresi by playing with a fast, positive tempo marked a seachange in European football. Their average age was only 23 and that included veteran Frank Rijkaard. Secondly, Van Gaal likes there to be only one voice in decision-making – his own. Young . players are more likely to be open to new ideas from the coach. Essentially, they want to play and they want to please, and are happy to . be guided by a figure like Van Gaal. Older professionals may backchat . or be more resistant. Ferguson may have found the same with United. At . United, Van Gaal will find plenty of young players to assess. Not only . those like Wilson, Januzaj and Lawrence who made such an impression . against Hull, but others like Nick Powell and Michael Keane who have . been on loan this season in The Championship. Even Ferguson’s last . signing Wilfried Zaha, who fell out badly with Moyes, is still only 21. There is one proviso of course. They have to be good enough. When the . name Fergie’s Fledglings was coined, it wasn’t for the Class of ’92 of . Beckham, Scholes, Neville etc – but for the previous generation; Russell . Beardsmore, Mark Robins, Lee Martin. They were given their first-team chances early by Ferguson and helped him win his first trophy, the FA Cup in 1990. But . ultimately despite their youth and energy bringing a feelgood factor to . Old Trafford, Ferguson decided they weren’t good enough for the highest . level. It’s . a sobering thought for the group who may yet become 'Van Gaal’s . Vanguard'. But they will at least get their chance. As Giggs, microphone . in hand on Tuesday night, reiterated: ‘This club always gives youth its . chance.’ Future star: Van Gaal helped Thomas Muller emerge from Bayern Munich's academy and into the first team . Wise words: Van Gaal gives Muller some advice during a Bundesliga clash with Nuremberg in September 2009 . Target? Van Gaal is believed to want a reunion with Bayern star Toni Kroos at Old Trafford after helping to develop him at the Allianz Arena . Room for improvement: Wilfried Zaha has been on loan at Cardiff after failing to make an impression under former boss David Moyes . Experience: United youngster Nick Powell (left) has impressed on loan at Championship side Wigan this season . AJAX . He . made them one of the most remarkable teams of the Champions League . era. With an average age of just 23, they took the Dutch ideal of Total . Football to new heights and beat mighty Milan 1-0 to win the 1995 . Champions League. They also reached the final the following year against . Juventus which they lost on penalties, making them the team to have . come closest to retaining Europe’s biggest prize. Eventually their best . players were sold on but that young Van Gaal team of ’95 will still go . down in history as one of the best-ever. It was: Edwin van der Sar, . Michael Reiziger, Danny Blind, Frank de Boer, Frank Rijkaard, Clarence . Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Jari Litmanen, Finidi George, Marc Overmars, . Ronald de Boer. Subs – Patrick Kluivert, Kanu. Half the team were aged . 22 or under and Seedorf, Kluivert and Kanu were all teenagers. BARCELONA . He . had two spells at the Nou Camp and though his second stint (2002-03) was unsuccessful with Barca going through a transitional phase, history . shows Van Gaal was an important catalyst for the success that followed. He . gave 18-year-old Iniesta his debut in the Champions League against . Bruges, and the youngster gave a performance described in the next day’s . Catalan press as 'sensational'. He proved to be a good judge, Iniesta . came to win everything in the game with Barca and scored Spain’s winning . goal in the 2010 World Cup final. Carles Puyol and 22-year-old Xavi . were also regulars in his team. The midfield partnership of Xavi and . Iniesta came to symbolise the domination of Spanish tiki-taka football . for a decade. BAYERN MUNICH . Bayern . was in chaos when Van Gaal arrived – in civil war after unsuccessful . spells in charge by Felix Magath, Ottmar Hitzfeld and Jurgen Klinsmann. Van Gaal did things his way, strong leadership and emphasis on young . players, introducing 20-year-old Thomas Muller and Holger Badstuber, 19, . into a team that won the Bundesliga. Toni Kroos, 20, also forced his . way into the line-up after serving a spell on loan at Bayer Leverkusen.","Louis van Gaal will be the man responsible for nurturing Manchester United's young talent when he takes control of the club .

"The road to jihad in Syria for six young Australians at the hands of Kings Cross bouncer turned Islamic State facilitator Mohammed Baryalei was one of five star hotels, phone fails and police arrests before crossing the border to join an army of '15,000 holy warriors', court documents show. Telephone intercepts of conversations between the Australians aged in their twenties and thirties allegedly recruited by Sydney man, Hamdi Alqudsi, to fight in Syria show that although the men stayed in a five-star hotel, they were also at the mercy of mix-ups and poor connections. The alleged telephone conversations have been tendered in a statement of facts by the Australian Federal Police in a case against Alqudsi, 39, a Sydney disability pensioner who was ordered to stand trial on Friday on charges of having allegedly recruited seven young Australians to go and fight in Syria. Scroll down for video . Alleged Syrian recruiter: Hamdi Alqudsi (pictured outside the Downing Centre Court in central Sydney) is to face trial on seven counts of recruiting men to enter 'into a foreign state, namely Syria, with intent to engage in hostile activity in Syria, in particular, engaging in armed hostilities in Syria' A report suggests the recruits are staying at five star hotel, the Ottoman Palace Antakya in Turkey . In the transcripts of the phone calls it is claimed that Mohammed Baraylei, the former Sydney man who rose to purportedly become a chief lieutenant of ISIS and may have died in Syria, was unreliable as the contact man on the ground. The alleged telephone calls show that in July last year, when one of the recruits Mahmoud Aboshi reached Syria, he called Alqudsi to confirm he had crossed the border. Mahmoud Aboshi allegedly said, 'when we were across, it was beautiful'. 'Don't forget my jiahd over here is your jihad over there': alleged telephone conversation between Hamdi Alqudsi (pictured outside the Downing Centre Local Court where he was committted to stand trial on Friday) and on eof the young Australian men he recruited to go and fight in Syria . The Bab al-Hawa border crossing, where the alleged terror recruits are alleged to have crossed into Syria . Mr Alqudsi who was charged last December on seven counts of recruiting the men to enter 'into a foreign state, namely Syria, with intent to engage in hostile activity in Syria, in particular, engaging in armed hostilities in Syria'. Three young Australians connected with Mr Alqudsi,  have been sent to their death in Syria, including former Gold Coast private schoolgirl, Amira Karroum. Line up and shot: Beautiful Gold Coast private schoolgirl, Amira Karroum (pictured) secretly flew to Syria last December after her husband, Tyler Casey, was allegedly recruited by Hamdi Alqudsi. Ms Karroum and Casey were shot dead in mid-January in the northern Syrian town of Aleppo . In the police facts it is claimed the men Alqudsi allegedly recruited are Ms Karroum's husband, Tyler Casey, who also has died, and former Australian infantry soldier Canal Temel, 22, from the Sydney suburb of Auburn, who was shot in the head during a siege in January. Mr Alqusdi's next alleged recruit was Turkish-Australian Mehmet Biber , 21, onetime poet and soccer nut of the western Sydney suburb of Merrylands, believed to still be fighting in Syria. Another would-be soldier for the ISIS forces in Syria, Amin Mohamed, 23, from Lidcombe in Sydney's inner west, who was arrested while trying to board a plane in Brisbane last December. The police claim three other alleged recruits - Mahmoud Aboshi, aka Abu Alem, of Melbourne, Muhammed Abdul-Karim Musleh, aka Abu Hassa, and Nassim Elbahsa - are fighting in Syria. The  transcripts have conversations allegedly between Alqudsi and the men. Arrested boarding a plane: New Zealand-born Amin Mohamed (above), 23, from Lidcombe in Sydney's inner west, allegedly bought a mobile phone in a false name and made plans to travel to Syria via Turkey with Alqudsi's help. He was arrested while trying to board a plane in Brisbane last December and charged with preparing to engage in foreign hostile activities . Dawn raid: Hamdi Alqudsi was arrested last December at this four bedroom house (pictured) at St Helens Park in far south-western Sydney where he had been living quietly with his family. Police allege he was helping young Australians to go and fight in Syria . The police brief of facts claims the recruits had difficulties getting into Syria, with Baryalei not turning up to collect them and the young men being handed over to police. Mohammed Musleh tells Alqudsi in a phone call on the evening of July 3, that he has met up with ‘a brother’ known as Abu Yahya who belonged to the Ahrar Al-Sham Battalion, who are a coalition of Islamists fighting in the Syrian civil war. At 11.27pm on the same evening, Caner Temel speaks with Alqudsi and tells him he, Biber, Musleh and Tyler Casey are having difficulties contacting Baryalei. Transcripts in the police brief show that just after midnight on July 4, Biber calls Alqudsi and asks if his wife can support Biber’s wife back in Australia, explaining he is having problems with his family who want to come and visit him. Tyler Casey also calls Alqudsi and makes the same complaint, wondering if they are dialling the wrong international country codes. It appears the young men are staying in a five star hotel, the Ottoman Palace Antakya. Moahhamed Ali Baryalei (pictured in Sydney) was unreliable on the ground in Syria and would not always turn up to meet young Australian recruits allegedly sent over by Hamdi Alqudsi . Alqudsi says, ‘They want to come to Syria?’, to which Biber says his parents ‘want to visit Istanbul as they don’t know the truth’. Minutes later, at 12.47am, Biber’s wife sends Alqudsi a series of text messages saying her parents in law have reported Biber to the police and are ‘trying to find the person responsible’ for his journey to Syria. On July 21 last year, the police transcript says Alqudsi receives a phone call from another of his alleged recruits, Mahmoud Aboshi, who has landed in Turkey and is waiting to meet up with Baryalei and another go-between called Abu Hashem. In the transcript it appears Abu Hashem can hardly speak English, but Aboshi manages to enter Syria on the morning on July 23. Dead or alive? Mohamed Baryalei, a former Sydney bouncer and actor now believed to have died in Syria, is pictured (above) in Sydney in 2012, when he was a street preacher for his brand of Islam . The transcript in the police brief includes a number of alleged phone calls, including one at 5.47am between Alqudsi and Aboshi, in which he confirms he has just crossed the border. Alqudsi says to Aboshi, ‘Don’t forget my jihad over here is yours over there, so what’s happening now you are inside Syria, yeah’. Aboshi replies, ‘When we were crossing the border there were gunshots on top of us, it was beautiful.’ On September 5, Alqudsi allegedly talks with the sixth alleged recruit, Amin Iman Mohamed (aka Abu Bilal). Alqudsi tells Mohamed he has received ‘ a message from the boys and Baryalei’ and there was ‘a big job coming up’. He said he had spoken to the commander at the headquarters where the boys were saying, who had told him, ‘They have a big, big surgery, big, big operation coming up involving one thousand and five hundred brothers … fifteen hundred holy warriors that may attain martyrdom in the path of Allah. The commander had said, ‘My boys better hurry up the caravan is moving because Allah knows better, but due to the crusaders making moves on Turkey, the door may be on its way to be closed.’ Alqudsi explained further that the commander had said, ‘More importantly brothers, you are missing out big time on the reward the companions sue to push each other to get to the front line. ‘God willing you boys better start pushing before the front lines are full.’ Mohamed told Alqudsi ‘the three doctors’ were ‘ready for the surgery’, himself and ‘two other doctors back home in New Zealand’. There was also ‘another doctor, but he didn’t have his surgical equipment ready’. On another call Alqudsi and Mohamed discuss money and flight tickets. Four days later he calls to say he has acquired a new phone number ‘under an infidel’s name’ and is waiting for a passport. Alqudsi instructs Mohamed to shave his beard and dress as a tourist and that all of the other ‘boys’ have left Turkey and have gone to the battlefield and that the ‘Amir’ has told him, ‘they will never come back until victory or martyrdom, so maybe you will never see them again’.

"American journalists have been given a gentle reminder regarding the etiquette of dealing with dignitaries by a media organisation, ahead of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's royal visit next month. The Duke and Duchess will visit New York City and Washington, DC, for three days, their first official visit to the US in three years. According to Politico, the Senate Periodical Press Gallery yesterday emailed its members with what will be seen as a timely reminder of how journalists will be expected to behave when dealing with the royal couple. Scroll down for video . Dress right, the British are coming: US journalists covering royal events during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's visit next month have been ordered to dress smart for the occasion . These include 'not taking pictures in the wrong places, not walking backwards and not being so absorbed in a phone as to run into people'. Other media outlets have been directing their staff to the Buckingham Palace website, where a strict dress code can be found for journalists wishing to cover Royal events. The rules state: 'Journalists wishing to cover royal engagements, whether in the United Kingdom or abroad, should comply with the dress code on formal occasions out of respect for the guests of the Queen, or any other member of the royal family. 'Smart attire for men includes the wearing of a jacket and tie, and for women a trouser or skirt suit. 'Those wearing jeans or trainers will not be admitted and casually dressed members of the media will be turned away. This also applies to technicians.' Doing it right: Actress Bette Midler looked delighted, and smartly dressed, when she met Prince William, Duke of Cambridge at the The Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium last week . Well, she tried: Lady Gaga wore a bright red latex dress when she met Queen Elizabeth II following the Royal Variety Performance in Blackpool, England in 2009 . The Royal couple will travel to New York on December 7th for a programme of events on behalf of the Royal Foundation and other charities. The engagements include promoting sustainable conservation issues, young people's mental health and supporting disadvantaged young people. William and Kate will arrive on the evening of the 7th December and will spend their first night in the US at a private dinner on behalf of the American Friends of the Royal Foundation. The Foundation was set up by Princes Harry and William in 2009 and officially launched in 2011 as the main vehicle for their philanthropic activities, including the Invictus Games. Prince William will spend the day in Washington DC on December 8th while Kate remains in New York. During his visit, the Prince will attend an anti-corruption conference at the World Bank, focusing on the transportation of illegal wildlife parts across borders. In his absence, the Duchess will accompany the First Lady of New York City, Chirlane McCray, on a visit to a local child development centre. The bump is coming: This will be the first foreign visit for the Duchess since announcing her second pregnancy, but Prince George will not come with the Royal couple to the US . Quick visit: The Duke and Duchess will visit New York City and Washington, DC, on December 7-9 . He will also attend a reception in New York for the Tusk Trust on the same day, before rejoining the Duchess of Cambridge to watch a basketball game. NBA brass are said to be over the moon that the royal couple have chosen to attend Brooklyn's Barclays Center to see Cleveland Cavaliers take on the Brooklyn Nets . The following day, both the Duke and Duchess will visit an inner city youth organisation, focused on social support and learning for poorer children - another key focus for the Royal Foundation. Also on the agenda is an event celebrating the British creative talent boasted by New York's media and creative industries. Prince William, who like Prince Charles has long been fascinated with technology, will attend an event hosted by a New York-headquartered technology company, which will bring together entrepreneurs from both the UK and the US. The final engagement of the visit will be the University of St. Andrews 600th Anniversary Dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. St Andrews was the Scottish university where the Duke and Duchess first met in 2002 after enrolling on the same History of Art degree course. Kensington Palace said: 'The couple really are very much looking forward to all the special moments of the visit. They've been an integral part in planning it.'","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will visit the US on 7-9 December .

"One of four young men charged with throwing a rock onto a darkened central Pennsylvania interstate testified Tuesday that they intended to do some damage during a night of mayhem last month but did not anticipate their actions would cause severe injuries to an Ohio teacher. Keefer McGee took the stand against co-defendant Brett Lahr after McGee and the other two waived their right to a preliminary hearing. The judge determined there was enough evidence to send the case against Lahr to county court for trial. McGee said the two others — Dylan Lahr and Tyler Porter — jumped out of his car after he stopped at an overpass on Interstate 80 on July 10, armed with rocks they had collected earlier. 'I knew they were going to throw rocks, but never thought they were going to hurt anyone as they did it,' McGee said. Praying for recovery: Sharon Budd, 52, pictured with her husband, three sons and a daughter, is still undergoing treatment after her skull was shattered in a random rock attack . 'Blood on their hands': Brett Lahr, 18 (left), . and his 17-year-old brother Dylan (right), were charged with aggravated assault . and conspiracy charges along with two other teens in the rock-throwing . case . Scene: A group of teenagers threw rocks from this overpass in Milton, Pennsylvania, in July and one landed on the Budds' car . A 4.6-pound rock smashed through the . front windshield of a car passing below, landing directly on the head of . Sharon Budd, a middle school language arts teacher from Uniontown, . Ohio, on her way to see a show in New York. Budd, . a passenger in the vehicle driven by her daughter, suffered massive . head injuries and is recovering in a rehabilitation center, with another . surgery planned for the coming weeks. Union . County District Attorney Peter Johnson said McGee agreed to cooperate . in exchange for lesser charges and a sentence of less than two years . that would send him to the county jail rather than state prison. McGee, . 17, said he, Porter, 18, and Dylan Lahr, 17, stole steaks from a . grocery store and played video games before deciding to 'smash . mailboxes, throw rocks at cars, just go out and be bad.' Brett Lahr, 18, . Dylan's brother, joined them after getting off work at a sandwich shop. McGee . said they first drove two vehicles through a corn field, causing what . the farmer said was less than $100 in damage, and Dylan Lahr smashed . windows in a home with a baseball bat before he stopped his vehicle on . the overpass. In court records, Porter has been quoted as saying he . dropped a rock but didn't hit anything, but Dylan Lahr struck a vehicle. McGee . testified that the rock made a 'really loud crash' when it hit Budd's . Nissan Rogue. He wiped away tears before recalling how they all laughed . as they drove away. 'They . weren't looking for a car to hit in particular,' said McGee, who told . the judge he had been involved in unspecified earlier rock-throwing . incidents. 'Like, they weren't waiting for one. They hit one as they saw . it.' He drove them back to . the Lahr home, where they began to watch a movie before deciding to . return to the scene to see what happened — twice. During one of those . trips, an alert police officer noted their license plate, leading . investigators to the four. Injured: Sharon Budd, left, was struck by a rock thrown from an overpass as her family drove on I-80. Moments before, she spoke with her son Lucas (right), who has been deployed to Afghanistan . Shattered: Screws, bolts and plates now hold . together the face of the 52-year-old married mother of four, seen left . with her husband, Randy Budd . Altered: Mrs Budd and her family. Doctors were forced to remove the right frontal lobe of Sharon Budd's brain, which helps determine personality . Massachusetts truck driver Matthew Baker testified his rig also was struck around that time in that same area by something that damaged his bug shield and its metal frame. Baker, who was not injured, said he caught a glimpse of the object as it whizzed past. Budd's husband, Randy Budd, who was in the backseat behind their daughter, recalled how the attack occurred shortly after Sharon got off the phone with their son, who was about to be deployed to Afghanistan with the military. 'It felt like an explosion,' Randy Budd testified, calling her injuries the 'most gruesome thing that I've ever seen.' 'I'm pretty sure I was looking at brains and skull and she, remarkably, kind of came to but wasn't saying anything,' he said. 'She was just jerking, grabbing her head, so we were holding her hands down.' Victim Sharon Budd stands with her husband Randy, who said the rock attack was the 'most gruesome' thing he's ever seen . Emergency responders raced her to a hospital, where she underwent surgery that night. Doctors had to remove parts of her skull and brain, and she has lost the use of one eye, while the other was damaged. Her long-term prognosis is unclear. The defendants face charges of aggravated assault, conspiracy, trespassing, propelling missiles into occupied vehicles, agricultural vandalism and reckless endangerment. Brett Lahr's lawyer, Brian Manchester, argued that his client's actions did not meet the legal threshold necessary to show he was a co-conspirator or accomplice. 'There is no evidence that there was a conspiracy that Brett Lahr participated in to go out and throw rocks at moving vehicles,' Manchester argued. 'He's just somebody sitting in a vehicle. ... Mere presence is not enough.' Johnson said McGee's deal calls for a guilty plea to second-degree felony aggravated assault.","Keefer McGee took the stand against co-defendant Brett Lahr as part of a deal with prosecution .

"Holly Willoughby has been voted the ultimate role model by UK mothers for the second year running. The TV presenter beat the Duchess of Cambridge and Angelina Jolie to the top spot by polling 38 per cent of the vote. Kate, who is currently expecting her second child with Prince William, secured 29 per cent of the votes, whilst Angelina, who has a six strong brood with Brad Pitt, got 17 per cent. Scroll down for video . She's the favourite: Holly Willoughby was voted the best celebrity role model for the second year running by UK mothers . Tough competition: Holly beat both Angelina Jolie (left) and the Duchess of Cambridge (right) to the top spot . The poll was carried out by breastfeeding experts Lansinoh who surveyed over 2000 mums in the UK and over 13,000 worldwide. Their healthcare associate Katie Hilton, who is also a midwife, nurse and mother-of-one, believes Holly, 33, won because UK mothers can relate to her. She said: 'The survey results suggest that mums in the UK relate to down-to-earth celebrity mothers over glamourous, Hollywood celebrities. 'Her role on This Morning means that Holly Willoughby is somebody that mums wake up with in the morning when we are getting the kids ready for school or nursery. 'She comes across as very grounded and unpretentious and mums like to talk to other women that they can relate to.' Holly recently welcomed a third child with her husband TV producer Daniel Baldwin. Upon his arrival in September she tweeted, 'I'm sooo happy to tell you all - we've just had a baby boy! Chester William Baldwin made a grand entrance at 8lbs 12. He's just perfect. (sic).' She also has Harry, five and a daughter named Belle, three. Another champion: Jennifer Garner, pictured here with her husband Ben Affleck, was crowned the best celebrity role model by mothers in the USA . As well as being carried out in the UK, the survey was put to women from other countries across the globe including Brazil, China, France, Germany, Hungary, Mexico, Turkey and the USA. Angelina topped the poll in seven out of the nine countries but she did not win the ultimate role model title in her home country the USA. It was actress Jennifer Garner who took the accolade with 26 per cent of the votes, closely followed by Jessica Alba who came in with 23 per cent. Jennifer, 42, has three children with actor Ben Affleck who she married in 2005. The Duchess of Cambridge appeared in the top three in France, Germany the USA and the UK. Runner-up: Although Jennifer Garner won, Jessica Alba proved popular with American mums securing 23 per cent of the vote .","Holly Willoughby voted UK's best celebrity role model .

"Samantha Cameron is pressing her husband to do more to help ease the humanitarian disaster caused by the Syrian civil war, it was claimed yesterday. The Prime Minister’s wife has urged Mr Cameron to act after seeing the plight of refugees fleeing the conflict for herself. One Cabinet Minister yesterday claimed Mrs Cameron is the ‘biggest explanation’ for his approach to the conflict which has already cost almost 100,000 lives. Tragic stories: Samantha Cameron talks to a girl who saw her uncle being killed in the street in Syria and helped to bring his body indoors, and her aunt, who was travelling in a car out of Syria when a sniper shot at her car and killed her baby son . Traumatic: Mrs Cameron urged the Prime Minister to act after meeting a Syrian mother whose baby is suffering from a broken leg in a refugee settlement in Lebanon . Mrs Cameron is an ambassador for  Save . the Children and visited children traumatised by the war in a refugee . camp in Lebanon in March. She said at the time: ‘As a mother, it . is horrifying to hear the harrowing stories from the children I met . today. No child should ever experience what they have.’ Citing senior government sources, The . Times reported she had since pushed for a bolder humanitarian response. It claimed a Cabinet minister had told the newspaper that Mrs Cameron . was the ‘biggest explanation’ for the prime minister’s stance on Syria, . regarded to be the most hawkish in Europe. But one source said the Prime Minister . himself also ‘got religion’ on Syria when he visited a refugee camp on . the Jordanian border last year. And as the Mail reported yesterday, Mr . Cameron has ditched plans to send arms to the rebels after warnings . from military commanders that there is little point getting involved . unless the Prime Minister is prepared for all-out war with the Assad . regime. There is far more widespread support . among ministers for further intervention to deal with the humanitarian . disaster, which has led to more than 1.5 million Syrians fleeing to . neighbouring countries. The Prime Minister’s former spin . doctor Andy Coulson recently described Mrs Cameron as an asset who . should be allowed to contribute more widely to strategy sessions. Her . admirers say she is Mr Cameron’s ‘best focus group’. Downing Street denies that Mrs Cameron . has sought to push her husband where he does not want to go on Syria, . saying that policy is decided by the National Security Council. The UK has given £348m in humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies, to those affected by the fighting in Syria. For some in the Tory party, Samantha Cameron is the secret weapon who could help win husband David the next election. While . rarely seen speaking out in public, her influence on her husband - and . therefore the government's strategy - is significant. In addition to her influence over Syria, she has played a key role in shaping Tory policy. Seen . as a key moderniser, she backed her husband in shifting the . Conservative positions on climate change, gay rights and humanitarian . aid. In particular it . is said she has warned her husband against focusing too much on the . importance of marriage if it risks sounding 'anti-single parent'. When . Mrs Cameron appears on stage to congratulate her husband at the end of . conference speeches she does so knowing that some of the key lines . uttered were her own work. The . daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield, the 8th Baronet Sheffield, she has . shaken off her aristocratic roots to show she has the common touch. As . a student in Bristol she got a dolphin tatooed on her ankle and became . friends with trip-hop artist Tricky - all a long way from her life . bringing up a family in the Downing Street. She has urged the PM to focus on pro-family policies and not obsess about issues which only resonate in the Westminster village. The . couple are fiercely protective of the children, Nancy, Arthur and . Florence - who was born just months after Mr Cameron became PM in May . 2010. Just over a year earlier their six-year-old severely disabled son, . Ivan, died. Mrs . Cameron has secured a broadly positive press since moving into Number 10 . three years ago, largely by keeping below the radar save for charity . appearances. But behind . the scenes her influence is significant, and could prove a strong . counter-balance to Tory traditionalists demanding a heavy emphasis on . Europe and welfare. In May former Tory spin doctor Andy Coulson urged Mr Cameron to listen to his wife. He said: 'She is one of the few people able to see straight to the heart of a matter and offer a clear, sensible view.' Tour: Mrs Cameron joined Justin Forsyth, CEO of Save the Children, for the visit to a refugee settlement in Lebanon, close to the Syria border in March . Rehabilitation: The PM's wife met Syrian refugee children at one of Save the Children's specialist centres in Lebanon, close to the Syria border. The centre helps children to overcome trauma, and supports children to cope with the distressing scenes they have witnessed inside Syria .","Mrs Cameron urged British action after harrowing visit to a refugee camp .

"Cricketer Phil Tufnell has recently been raving about a hair transplant after having the treatment to revive his thinning locks. But one man bitterly regrets the day he decided to fork out on the cosmetic surgery. Mal, 50, a self-employed glazier from Birmingham, was one of the unlucky 10 per cent for whom a hair transplant simply doesn't take - and he was instead left with a unsightly scar that stretched across the back of his head. He said: 'I had the transplant and three years later I didn't look any different . to before. I regret having it done in the first place, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. Bald truth: Mal paid for a hair transplant after losing his locks but it was successful . 'I ended up worse than when I started. I had spent the money, and I . have been disfigured, and the top of my head is still the same.' Mal said the scar made him feel so self-conscious he would only go out in public wearing a cap - which he learnt wasn't practical on windy days. 'Once it blew off and I had to chase it down the street,' he said. He added: 'Some people will point the scar out, other people will be quiet but I'll . know they've noticed it. They say ""what's that at the back of your head?"" He was left with scarring on the back of his head that made him feel self-conscious, left, but a new treatment has made it less visible. right . 'When I tell them it was a hair transplant they say, ""well that's a waste of . money"".' In an attempt to hide the scar, Mal took an extreme measure. 'If I have to go out without my cap on, I get a pencil and shade . the scar in. Then from a distance it doesn't look too bad,' he said. The glazier had visited other hair specialists who recommended he wore wig but Mal didn't feel comfortable with that and hated the idea of having a comb-over. New look: Mal has had his head tattooed so he looks like he has shaven hair. He said it was painful but worth it . Then he appeared on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters who recommended another course of action - tattoos. The treatment involves individual pigmentation to give the illusion of a shaved head. As it is a tattoo, there is no fear of hair loss again and in Mal's case, it conceals his scar. While the treatment was painful, Mal showed off the results on the show and said he was delighted with his new look. He said: 'The scar blends in, you really have to look for it now so no one notices it. The treatment was painful at time but definitely worth it. I've thrown that pencil away, no more shading in the mirror! Extreme Beauty Disasters is on TLC Thursdays at 8pm .","Hair transplant didn't work for Mal, 50 .

"Thousands of Swedes have taken to the streets in a protest against racism following a neo-Nazi attack on a similar rally last weekend. Police estimated that more than 16,000 people took part in the protest in Stockholm yesterday, which came after around 30 neo-Nazis attacked another rally - throwing bottles and firecrackers at protesters.

The crowd chanted 'End racism now' and 'No racists on our streets', while prominent Swedish artists played on a stage set up on a football pitch. Parts of Karrtorp, which does not have a particularly large migrant population compared to other areas of the city, were sprayed-painted with swastikas and Nazi slogans before last week's protest.

"With blood spattered over his injured face, this is Ronnie Lee on his way to hospital minutes after being glassed in an unprovoked attack by a woman. Lucky not to lose an eye, the 24-year-old telesales company director needed four stitches following the assault. But despite his injuries, his assailant, estate agent Yasmin Thomas, 21, walked free from court this week with a suspended sentence – despite notching up her 18th conviction for assault. Innocent victim: Ronnie Lee, pictured left in an ambulance after the attack, says he is disgusted with the justice system after his attacker Yasmin Thomas, right, was given a suspended sentence for the attack . Yesterday Mr Lee said he was disgusted at the leniency of the sentence, which includes an anger management course. He said: ‘If it was the other way around and I did that to her, I would be going straight to jail. ‘What happens next time if she does something and it’s life threatening? She could end up killing someone. ‘She’s got 18 convictions already. She’s a danger to herself and others around her. ‘If someone had the number of convictions she’s got I would think for at least one of them there would be a lesson learnt. I don’t think the justice system has provided a judgment that will set an example.’ Mr Lee was with his friend Richard Evans at the Bar So nightclub in Bournemouth in February when they were approached by Thomas and her friends. ‘Richard and I went out for a drink to celebrate setting up our new business together,’ Mr Lee said yesterday. ‘We had been at Bar So for about an hour. We stepped on the dance floor and the lady in question, Yasmin, was there. ‘I didn’t know her at all. One of her friends stole Richard’s e-cigarette and threw it on the floor. Leniant: Thomas, who has 17 previous convictions for assualt, arrives at Bournemouth Crown Court this week to hear her sentence . ‘Yasmin picked it up and tapped me on the shoulder and gave it to me. I was surprised and handed it back to Richard. ‘She then said ‘‘Aren’t you gonna say thank you then?’’ I was confused and didn’t say anything. She threw a drink on my face first and then smashed the glass on my left eye socket.’ Mr Lee suffered a deep cut close to the eye and other smaller cuts to his face. He said: ‘It was only ten minutes from being on the dance floor to being in the ambulance. A nurse pulled glass out of my cheek and eye and I had four stitches in my eyelid. 'He told me that if it had been a couple of millimetres closer to my eye I would have been blinded. ‘Since then I’ve had some anxiety when I go out and I find myself trying to be careful. It’s put me on edge.’ Thomas, an estate agent at Palmer Snell in the Westbourne area of Bournemouth, pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm when she appeared at Bournemouth Crown Court. Judge John Harrow described her criminal history as ‘breathtaking’ but did not send her to jail, instead handing her a 12-month sentence suspended for two years and 80 hours of community service. She was also told to pay Mr Lee £1,000 in compensation and a £100 victim surcharge. Sentencing her, Judge Harrow said: ‘You have a breathtaking record of violence, one of the worst I have ever seen from anyone your age. 'It is not without a lot of hesitation and some reservations, I must confess, that I’m going to suspend that 12-month sentence for two years. ‘Any offence at all will be sent back to this court and you will go straight down those steps to prison for at least 12 months.’ Tobias Ellwood, MP for Bournemouth East, criticised the sentence and said he would be discussing it with the Attorney General to review it.","Ronnie Lee, 24, attacked with glass while on night out in Bournemouth .

"A hair-loss medication reportedly tried by Wayne Rooney may cause prolonged and possibly irreversible impotence, scientists have claimed. The recent findings come after one patient bravely stepped forward to reveal the drug left him with no sex drive and even shrank his genitals. Kevin Malley, 30, was prescribed with the drug Propecia after he worried he could be losing his hair. He said he only planned to take the pill for a year. Concern: Men worried about losing their hair may consider treatments such as Propecia. However in the UK the drug label warns about possible 'persistent' sexual side effects . However, just five months after he started taking it in May 2011 he found he was completely impotent and his testes also became smaller. Worried, he consulted his doctor and was told the symptoms would disappear after he stopped taking the drug. But he says a year on and nothing has changed. It will come as no surprise to Dr Michael Irwig from the University of Washington. He recently published a study in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, that found the ingredient finasteride, which is found in Propecia, can cause persistent sexual dysfunction, including low sexual desire, erectile dysfunction and problems with orgasms. The male pattern baldness drug is manufactured by Merck and was approved by the FDA in 1997. While labeling on the medication in the U.S. currently warns about possible reversible sexual side effects, there is no reference to the effects being persistent, Dr Irwig said. However, other countries including the UK and Sweden do require medical companies to include the 'persistent risk' warning on the labeling. It was reported that Wayne Rooney started taking the medication in 2009 after he became sick of other footballer's jibes about his receding hairline. He has since had a hair transplant. Unfortunate side-effects? Wayne Rooney was reported to be taking Propecia in 2009. It has since been linked with impotence . Dr Irwig first became aware of the problems caused by finasteride several years ago when he encountered several men who reported they had developed sexual dysfunction while taking the medication. 'It’s been very frustrating for a lot of these men because they’ve sought care from medical professionals who have looked at the literature and have not seen a risk of persistent sexual dysfunction,' says Dr Irwig. 'So a lot of these patients have been told to see psychiatrists and psychologists and that it’s all in their head.' Dr Irwig then noticed that men had reported sexual dysfunction for months even after they stopped taking the medication. 'I came across a website called propeciahelp.com with more than 1,400 registered users - many young healthy men who developed the same sexual side effects from finasteride - and I discovered that nobody had published a series looking at these men - who they are, how long the sexual side effects lasted, what types.' Dr Irwig’s study included results from interviews with 71 men aged 21 to 46 years old to assess how long they took finasteride, the type and duration of sexual side effects and their sexual frequency before and after the medication. Dr Irwig discovered that 94 per cent developed low libido, 92 per cent developed erectile dysfunction and decreased arousal, and 69 per cent developed problems with orgasm. On average, the men used finasteride for approximately 28 months but experienced persistent sexual side effects for an average of 40 months, from the time they ceased taking the medication to the time of the interview. Dr Irwig also found that the average number of sexual episodes per month dropped after finasteride use. 'It turns out that almost all the men had multiple sexual function problems,' says Dr Irwig. 'Before finasteride use, the men experienced average sexual activity of approximately 26 episodes per month, but after use, it came down to approximately eight per month - an almost two-thirds reduction. 'Twenty per cent of patients I interviewed experienced persistent sexual dysfunction for more than five years, which makes me wonder if their persistent sexual dysfunction is permanent,' he adds. Controversial: Merck says no evidence has proved a causal relationship between Propecia and long-lasting sexual dysfunction . This was certainly Mr Malley's experience. He told Good Morning America: 'I kept expecting the side effects to go away, but they did not, they only got worse.' Mr Malley said before he took the drug he was engaged and worked as a public health researcher at a university in Las Vegas. After he developed symptoms his fiancee broke off the engagement and he said he had to resign from his job because of cognitive problems. He said he is angry no one warned him the drug could have such lasting effects. 'Even if the side effects are rare, that doesn't mean that I should not . have been warned. I did have a life before this,' he told Good Morning America. Dr Irwig said roughly 5 per cent of men who take medicine will experience sexual dysfunction, and of those 'it’s hard to tell how many will experience persistent symptoms'. 'We know that this is a potential problem, but we can’t quantify what the exact risk is. I can’t tell a man if he has a 1-in-100 chance, or a 1-in-1000 chance of developing persistent sexual dysfunction, but it’s pretty clear there’s a relationship here,' he says. Topical Rogaine can be used as an alternative to Propecia - applied directly on the skin, it does not get absorbed by body and thus does not cause sexual side effects - but Dr. Irwig says Propecia is very effective in treating hair loss and thus is commonly prescribed. So Dr Irwig says it is crucial physicians treating male pattern hair loss discuss the possibility of persistent sexual side effects associated with finasteride with their patients. 'I think it’s very important that doctors who are prescribing this medicine talk about potential risks, so men can make an informed decision,' he said. In a statement, Merck said no evidence has proved a causal relationship between Propecia and long-lasting sexual dysfunction. A spokesman said: 'Merck believes that PROPECIA (finasteride) has demonstrated safety and efficacy profiles and that the product labeling appropriately describes the benefits and risks of the drug to help inform prescribing. 'A causal relationship between the use of PROPECIA and continued sexual dysfunction after discontinuation of treatment has not been established.   We encourage patients to talk with their doctor if they have any questions or concerns about their health, or about PROPECIA.'","Doctor reveals twenty percent of patients he interviewed for Propecia study experienced persistent sexual dysfunction for more than five years .

"Bosses at Milton Keynes' tourist board have offered to give X-Factor host Dermot O'Leary a tour of the town after he tweeted he was off to the ‘land of roundabouts.’ Destination MK, the official tourism service for the town, said they would love to show the Radio 2 DJ around after he called residents ‘roundabout loving Keynesian's’. The 41-year-old posted the tweets to his 2.4m followers before heading to WHSmiths in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire on Thursday to sign copies of his new book, The Soundtrack To My Life.

"Police have seized and searched the taxi that Jesse Matthew, the prime suspect in the kidnapping of UVA student Hannah Graham, was driving the night Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington vanished in 2009, it was revealed today. According to a source with knowledge of the investigation, Matthew was driving the cab in 2009 on the night 20-year-old Harrington went missing after a concert in Charlottesville. According to CNN, police have seized the taxi that Matthew was driving that night from a farm after DNA evidence that was found last month linked the 32-year-old to Harrington's death. Scroll down for video . Taxi driver: Jesse Matthew (pictured), 32, was driving a cab the night Morgan Harrington, 20, went missing in Charlottesville in October 2009 . Matthew was arrested last month and charged with abduction with intent to defile in the Graham case after leading police on a manhunt that ended in Texas. He is currently behind bars. Graham, 18, a sophomore at UVA, was last seen on a surveillance video walking with Matthew on the Charlottesville downtown mall on the morning of September 13. She hasn’t been seen or heard from since. The 32-year-old nursing assistant also has been linked by DNA evidence to the disappearance of 20-year-old Morgan Harrington five years earlier. The young woman went missing October 17, 2009, after attending a Metallica concert at John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville. The Virginia Tech student's corpse was discovered on a farm in Albemarie three months later. 'This is what we hoped for, that more pieces of the puzzle would come together,' said Dan Harrington, the victim's father, to the New York Daily News. 'It's exciting, it's encouraging to hear but it's still sad for us too. It will hopefully open up more doors for us.' Speaking to federal and state officials, Matthew’s former co-workers recalled that on the night of Harrignton’s disappearance, the suspect was working as a cab driver. Charlottesville taxi driver Melvin Carter Jr also told NBC29 that he had been told by a police detective that Ms Harrington got into a cab after the fateful rock concert. Prime suspect: Matthew (left) has been charged with abduction with intent to defile in the disappearance of UVA sophomore Hannah Graham (right) Another victim: Morgan Harrington, 20, was found dead on a farm three months after she was seen leaving a Metallica concert . ‘[They] said yes, she did jump into a taxi cab her last time being seen alive,’ said Carter, Jr. ‘He could have made an impression on her because what I heard from her mental state, she was upset, so she may have found someone who was loving and trusting and comforted her,’ Carter speculated. Following the 20-year-old’s disappearance, Matthew was interviewed by police along with dozens of cab drivers who were behind that wheel the night of October 17, 2009. Captured: Matthew was extradited from Galveston County, Texas, last month following a manhunt . In this photo taken on Tuesday, Sharon Johnson, left, president of search and rescue group DOGS-East, along with Virginia ABC Special Agent Anthony Jimenez, second from left, consult with local residents during a search along a back road in Charlottesville for Hannah Graham . Premonition: Matthew's fellow cabbies recalled how at times he would get upset when they would jokingly compare him to a sketch of Harrington's killer and a suspect in a 2005 rape . Two weeks ago, police working on the Harrington and Graham cases recovered Matthew's old cab from a Virginia farm. Meanwhile, federal and state investigators have interviewed about 20 taxi drivers in Charlottesville asking about Morgan Harrington and Matthew's demeanor. Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, released a statement Thursday saying their family have been hoping that more pieces of the puzzle would come together. ‘It's exciting, it's encouraging to hear but it's still sad for us too,’ the statement read. ‘It will hopefully open up more doors for us.’ Filled with hope: Dan Harrington, Morgan's father (left), released a statement Thursday saying their family have been hoping that more pieces of the puzzle would come together .

People who knew Matthew in 2009 told CBS6 how they would joke with him that he resembled a sketch connected to a 2005 rape case in Fairfax and the Harrington case. Matthew at times would ignore their jabs, but every once in a while he would appear shaken and take off on his own for hours. The FBI indicated that based on forensic evidence, Harrington’s killer also raped a woman in Northern Virginia in 2005 .","Matthew's former co-workers in the taxi industry told police he was driving a cab the night Harrington went missing .

"France is to bulldoze camps containing hundreds of illegal migrants hoping to travel to Britain from Calais because of a growing danger to public health, it emerged today. It follows reports of young men dying and suffering serious injury as they try to get across to the coast of England. Police in the French port said that many of the settlements would be 'cleared by the end of next week,' to stop them getting bigger. France is to bulldoze camps containing hundreds of illegal migrants hoping to travel to Britain from Calais because of a growing danger to public health, it emerged today . Police in the French port said that many of the settlements would be 'cleared by the end of next week,' to stop them getting bigger . There are fears that there will be a repetition of the so-called 'The Jungle', an infamous camp which was destroyed in 2009 after becoming a magnet for migrants. Local prefect Denis Robin also said there were particular 'fears for public health', especially as the makeshift camps do not have basic supplies like water. Hundreds of people living in squalid conditions has also led to outbreaks of Scabies, acontagious skin condition caused by tiny mites which burrow into the skin, causing severe itching and rashes. There are fears that there will be a repetition of the so-called 'The Jungle', an infamous camp which was destroyed in 2009 after becoming a magnet for migrants . There are currently up to 1000 migrants living rough in Calais, with up to 650 around the port area alone . Charity workers helping refugees from wars in Syria and Afghanistan reacted with outrages to the planned clear-out, blaming it on a shift to the far-right in French politics. Ethiopian man, Senay Berthay, 25, was found in Calais's Batellerie dock on March 14 . But following a meeting with human rights groups, Mr Robin, said: 'I'm going to close three camps on public property at the port next week. It is out of the question that we can let another Jungle emerge.' Mr Robin insisted that the clear out would assist the most vulnerable migrants, allowing the sick and aged to get emergency health care. 'Fragile members' of the migrant community, including children, will be allowed temporary accommodation in a holiday camp in the Pas de Calais, while adults can request 'emergency housing'. But critics say the migrants will simply be left on the street, without even a roof over their heads. There are currently up to 1000 migrants living rough in Calais, with up to 650 around the port area alone. Most play a nightly cat and mouse game with the police and border officials as they try to reach Britain in the back of lorries. Once in the UK they will claim asylum, which entitles them to generous benefits, or disappear into the black economy. Familiar tactic: A gang tries but fails to get into one lorry at port in Calais . Martine Devries, of the international charity Medecins du Monde, told the Voix du Nord newspaper: . 'They're taking advantage of treating people for scabies to destroy the camp. It's a waste of equipment and where are the migrants going to go?' Mr Devries added: 'We get the feeling the authorities think once everything is destroyed all this will go away.' Four migrants died in one week alone in March this year. On March 9 an Albanian man was killed on a motorway outside the town. Three days later, Ethiopian Mesfin Germa was hit by a lorry as he walked to the port. The . body of a 25-year-old Ethiopian man, Senay Berthay, was found in .

It is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction. Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart has long argued that Britain's 'generous welfare system' is the real cause of the migrant crisis in her town. Referring to international treaties governing the treatment of migrants, Ms Bouchart said: 'Calais is a hostage to the British. That's enough. It's no longer tenable. It's necessary to renegotiate these accords. We're not here to do their job.' The Socialist government of French president Francois Hollande has continued the policy of razing illegal migrant camps on the edge of major cities such as Paris and Marseille. Court orders are regularly obtained for their destruction, with riot police moving in with the bulldozers.","Reports of young men dying as they try to get across to England .

"A white man speaking 'fluent English' was in charge of an Somali Islamist group al-Shabaab which gunned down at least 60 people in a Kenyan coastal town on Sunday evening, according to witnesses. Several residents in Mpeketoni reported that they saw a pale-skinned man who spoke English and Arabic giving orders to the gunmen. The eyewitness accounts support the theory that the men were sent by al-Shabaab by a seasoned foreign jihadi unit now working with the Somali Islamists. Scroll down for video . Residents barricade a road as they protest against the recent killings in the village of Kibaoni. Militants linked to Al Qaeda have carried out two massacres in the area - claiming 60 lives . A man observes the remains of destroyed vehicles and buildings in the town of Mpeketoni after the area was attacked by extremists this week. Terror group Al Shabaab have warned tourists they visit the country 'at their own peril' 'I saw a white man who was speaking in fluent British English commanding the rest of the attackers,' said Mary Gachoki, a teacher who lives in Mpeketoni and speaks good English told The Telegraph. Today the Inspector General of Police said several people have been arrested including suspected ringleaders. David Kimaiyo also said that someone had been arrested for using social media to say that  al-Shabaab was behind the attacks. 'We have arrested several suspects in connection to Mpeketoni incident including the owner and driver of one the vehicles used by attackers,' Mr Kimaiyo said on Twitter. 'Also in police custody is a suspect who was operating social media accounts purportedly used by al-Shabaab to claim responsibility.' Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta  said al-Shabaab was not behind deadly attacks on Kenya's coast, contradicting the militant group's claims . Today it emerged that reports 12 women were abducted from the Poromoko district near Mpeketoni were abducted have turned out to be false. Yesterday Kenya's president said al-Shabaab was not . behind deadly attacks on Kenya's coast, contradicting the militant group's claims. Somalia's al Shabaab militant group has said its gunmen carried out the attacks on the town of Mpeketoni on Sunday night and on a nearby village early on Tuesday morning. In comments that could further stoke political tensions in a country where allegiances generally run along ethnic lines, President Uhuru Kenyatta instead pointed the finger at rivals he described as 'hate-mongers', though he did not name anybody. 'The attack in Lamu was well planned, orchestrated and politically motivated ethnic violence against the Kenyan community,' Kenyatta told the nation in an address, referring to Lamu county where the two attacks took place. 'This, therefore, was not an al Shabaab terrorist attack. Evidence indicates local political networks were involved in the planning and execution of the heinous crime. This also played into the opportunist network of other criminal gangs,' he said. Blaming domestic rivals could ease pressure on Kenyatta's government, which has faced strong criticism about its handling of security and the threat from Somali-linked militants. Analysts said politicising the issue of security by either side risked undermining efforts to tackle shortcomings. Kenyan police officers patrol Mavuno villages near Mpeketoni after unidentified gunmen attacked the coastal Kenyan town. Hotels are believed to be 80 per cent empty in Mombasa, the country's second city . Kenya police observe the remains of burnt-out cars at a police station in Mpeketoni.  Kenya's tourist board in London has attempted to play down the threats in a bid to save the tourism industy . 'We live at a time when our people are vulnerable to reckless leaders and hate-mongers who manipulate them to create hate, intolerance and fanaticism, which makes them easy prey to radicalisation and crime,' Kenyatta said in his address. Though Kenyatta, an ethnic Kikuyu, did not mention him, his comments appeared directed at his opponent and main presidential challenger in last year's election, Raila Odinga, an ethnic Luo, who returned to Kenya in May after a long period abroad. Odinga has been rallying supporters and has urged dialogue with the government. He has condemned the latest assaults. In Sunday's attack, gunmen stormed Mpeketoni, which lies near the popular tourist attraction of Lamu town, and killed 49 people. Then 24 hours later, gunmen raided nearby Poromoko village, going through the town from house to house and ordering residents to recite an Islamic creed, witnesses said. Kenya has blamed al Shabaab for a spate of gun and bomb attacks in recent months. Kenya also holds al Shabab responsible for an attack on Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in September last year in which 67 people were killed. Al Shabaab has said its attacks are intended to punish Kenya for sending troops to Somalia to confront its Islamist fighters. Kenya has previously said it would keep its troops in Somalia. Witnesses in Mpeketoni said they heard the gunmen speak Somali, although that does not automatically link them to al Shabaab as Kenya has a large minority with Somali origins who also speak the language. Violence between different ethnic groups is not uncommon in Kenya. Riot policemen remove a road barricade of a truck burnt by protestors along the streets after the attack in Mpeketoni . Kenya has blamed al Shabaab for a spate of gun and bomb attacks in recent months. Kenya also holds al Shabab responsible for an attack on Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in September last year in which 67 people were killed . Tribes of Somali origin and other ethnic groups have in the past fought over land and other issues, though that has mostly occurred in Kenya's lawless northern border area. After the 2007 presidential vote in Kenya, ethnic tensions erupted into violence that killed about 1,200 people. In a statement condemning the Mpeketoni attack on Monday, Odinga said: 'This is not time for blame games ... We must as leaders and as a nation rally together to respond to this serious national tragedy.' The new attacks have fuelled public criticism of the government for failing to do more to improve national security. Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku, who has defended his government's security efforts, has been a particular target for fury. Many Kenyans have said he should have been fired after the Westgate crisis, particularly after soldiers involved in retaking the mall from militants were found to have looted it. Ole Lenku said he sacked a senior regional officer in Lamu county after this week's attack. Brutal: Kenyan residents at the scene of one of the bodies of those killed in nearby Mpeketoni on Sunday.

Cowardly: At least 48 people were killed in the Sunday night raid and two hotels were set on fire before the gunmen fled into surrounding undergrowth . Kenyatta said security officials, who he said ignored intelligence, would face charges. The series of recent assaults have hammered the vital tourist industry, particularly on the coast. Some hotels in the palm-fringed coastal region say they face closure, while others which offer safaris up-country say bookings are down 30 percent - a worrying sign as the July-to-September peak tourist season approaches. 'This government is full of talk and no action,' said one angry resident in Mpeketoni, speaking as Ole Lenku arrived in the town on Tuesday. 'They keep saying the country is safe and we keep on suffering at the hands of terrorists.'

"The eldest of four Sydney bothers who fled to Syria to fight with ISIS and were deemed 'too fat to fight' has now been spurned by his scorned fiancee. Omar El Baf, who spent thousands of dollars on a 'honeymoon' and furniture for his former-wife-to-be just days before he fled overseas, contacted her out of the blue. But one of the men who was considered too out of shape to help the Islamic terrorists fight in the Middle East has now been rejected again, as his heartbroken fiancee has blocked him on Facebook and vowed never to speak with him again, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. Scroll down for video . Omar El Baf, (far right), has messaged his-ex fiancée on Facebook. It is the first sign the four brothers are alive since they fled to Syria in November . Omar paid $13,000 for his future honeymoon just a couple of days before he vanished in November, as well as a deposit for furniture for their future home. The Facebook message is the first and only sign that the four siblings from Yagoona in south-west Sydney, who have not been heard from in months, are still alive. The four men, aged between 17 and 28, told their parents they were taking a holiday in Thailand after winning tickets in a competition. They later revealed via a text message to their sister that they had arrived to Syria. 'We made it to Bilad al-Sham, we will see you in paradise,' the message read.

The parents believe their boys have been lured into the clutches of the Islamic State terrorist organisation. Bilad al-Sham is a region in Syria. Despite the text, the parents went to the airport to pick up their sons but they never arrived. They now believe their boys have been lured into the clutches of the Islamic State terrorist organisation. Unlike some before them, the siblings were 'clean-skins' and had not been on any watch-lists that would have alerted immigration controls. In a statement last month, their mother pleaded with them to come home. 'My sons, you are dear to us. You are good at heart. You have done nothing wrong. Come back. We love you.' Taha El Baf, 17, from Yagoona, and his three older brothers flew to Syria to join the Islamic State last month . In November, leading Islamic community leader Dr Jamal Rifi told radio station2UE: 'The family is distraught, their main concern is to initiate contact, the concern are not concerned how they were radicalised but that they want them to come back. He said the brothers showed no signs of radicalisation before they left,  and that he suspects that that someone in Australia convinced them to travel to Syria. Dr Rifi said the family alerted the authorities to the brothers' departure and it was now up to them to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'.

Horseplay: A herd of white horses gallop through the saltwater of the Rhone River in France . The animals belong to several ranches along the Camargue, a natural region located south of Arles, France . The photographs, taken at sunset, capture the horses between the Mediterranean Sea and the two arms of the Rhone River delta . The herd is carefree and playful, kicking up water as they splash in the surf . This is the third time that the photographer has made the trip to region to photograph these majestic creatures, building up quite a portfolio of images along the way. 'In these three years, I have seen many horses - usually they can run for ten minutes until the leader decides to quit,' Xavier said. 'I love seeing horses like this - running free in the wild. They are one of my favourite animals, displaying a combination of power, beauty and water in a great place with magnificent light.' He added: 'I remember taking these particular photos. It was a magical moment. 'The sky was ablaze with yellow clouds when a herd of white horses came running through the marsh. 'I chose a short lens to capture the beautiful landscape and I believe I took one of my best pictures.' These Camargue horses are named after the region of southern France they are native to . The images are slightly blurred due to the horses' quick movements . The rare white creatures are believed to be ancestors of Palaeolithic era horses, which lived over 17,000 years ago . The horses have been running wild in this area for years, but belong to ranches along the remote coast of the Camargue . 'I love seeing horses like this - running free in the wild,' photographer Xavier Ortega says .

"After having three children, a mother from Plymouth hoped to get her confidence and svelte figure back by having a tummy tuck. But the operation went disastrously wrong, leaving Gemma, 30, looking like she had 'been bitten by shark.' The mother-of-three shares her story in the latest episode of Last Chance Salon, where she hopes cosmetic surgeon Mr Vik Vijh can repair her misshapen stomach. 'I feel like a freak': Gemma's stomach was left swollen, scarred and lumpy after her botched tummy tuck . Gemma explains how she saved up £3,200 with her husband Chris' support to have a tummy tuck in the hope she could have a flat stomach again after having three children. 'My husband was working out of the . country at the time and my plan was my body would be all fixed and how I . wanted it by the time he came back,' she said. Gemma went to Poland to have the operation but her nightmare began when she woke up during the surgery. 'Everything is wrong': Surgeon Mr Vik Vijh at the Last Chance Salon said it was one of the worst cases of surgery gone wrong he had ever seen . Op regrets: The mother-of-three said she looked like she'd been bitten by a shark thanks to the scarring, misaligned belly button and lumpy skin folds she was left with . 'I woke up during anesthetic and couldn't move . which was horrible, I was trying to open eyes,' she recalled. 'They must have noticed I . wasn't completely under as I was gagging on the tube in my throat.' But Gemma's ordeal did not end there. After flying back to her home in Devon two days after the operation, she developed gangrene and then had to be hooked up to a machine to 'suck all the infection out.' She was left with a scared and misshapen body she was ashamed of. She said: 'It looks like I've been bitten by a . shark. The scar is all crinkly, my belly button is too high and off to . the side. One area looks swollen, it's just a big mess. It looks . horrible.' Fix: Gemma has a flatter stomach, realigned belly button and less skin folds after reconstructive surgery, right . She added: 'It does affect my relationship with my husband because I don't want to be naked with him because I feel a bit like a freak.' After visiting  Mr Vijh at The Last Chance Salon, he commented that her botched tummy tuck was 'one of worst cases I've seen'. 'Everything is wrong,' he added. But the surgeon, who specialises in cosmetic and reconstructive surgery, was confident Gemma's problem could be solved - if she could dare to go under the knife again after her previous experience. Gemma plucked by the courage to have the reconstructive surgery at Nuffield Health Hospital in Hereford and was delighted with the results. Confidence restored: The mother said she's delighted with the results of the second operation . They fixed her underlying abdominal muscles, lumpy lipo and realigned her belly button. She was left with some scarring but Mr Viji said this should fade in six months. 'It's amazing, I can't believe it,' Gemma said of her new body. 'My belly button is in the right place and the swelling gone.' She added that the surgery has given her a new lease of life and her confidence back. 'We've booked a holiday in August and I can't wait to get my bikini on which I would never have done before,' she said.

"The WW9000 machine is allows a person to control and monitor their washing using their smartphone . Finding time to put a load of washing on and take it out again before it starts to dry can be taxing when trying to juggle other household chores. But Samsung has set out to make the job less onerous with the launch of a smart washing machine that can be operated using a smartphone app. The WW9000 machine is the first domestic Wi-Fi washing machine to be sold in the UK. It is also the first to be made by the company that allows a person to remotely control and monitor their washing using their mobile – letting them get about and about while their clothes are being cleaned. Samsung is not the only manufacturer to offer machines that can interact with a smartphone. LG and Haier have smart models and Samsung itself has equipped some current machines with a feature called Smart Check, which allows people to detect and diagnose errors with an app. But the WW9000 is the only one in the range to let people start and stop a cycle from their mobile. The futuristic washing machine, which will go on sale in May across Europe, also has a ‘super speed wash setting’ that cleans clothes in under an hour by quickly filling the drum with water through its twin water supply. It is not known if or when the model will be sold in the U.S. or Asia. An 'auto optimal wash' option uses four sensing technologies to determine the right wash cycle, looking at temperature, washing time, rinse cycle and spin speed, based on the size of the laundry load and how dirty the clothes are. It has intelligent settings to tackle specific kind of stains, including gardening and cooking, as well as sports and hygiene care functions, but Samsung has not yet said how much the smart machine will cost. The futuristic washing machine, which will go on sale in May across Europe, also has a 'super speed wash setting' that cleans clothes in under an hour by quickly filing the drum with water through its twin water supply . The array of options can be navigated by a 5inch colour touchscreen instead of knobs and dials so that the machine can easily display the most used and favourite settings to let users navigate all the options easily. The machine has been designed to reduce the amount of energy used by using an ‘ecobubble’ generator to dissolve detergent quicker. Air and water are pulled in to generate bubbles, dissolving and activating the detergent, which then penetrates faster and more evenly throughout the wash load, according to Samsung. This helps to dissolve washing detergent, creating rich soapy foam that penetrates clothes faster, so less hot water is required, and therefore saves energy on every load, it claims. The WW9000 model has an extra large door and a ‘translucent deep blue crystal finish’ that Samsung says ‘creates a beautiful spectrum of colours when it comes into contact with light’. An array of washing options can be navigated by a  five inch colour touchscreen (pictured) instead of knobs and dials so that the machine can easily display the most used and favourite settings . Design: A big door is placed higher up than usual on the machine so that people do not have to bend down as far to retrieve their washing from the machine, which has a streamlined appearance. Easy to use: A five inch colour screen lets people choose cycles, including their most-used cycle, by touching a button. The washing can be started and stopped using a smartphone app. Auto-optimal wash: Sensing technology is used to gather information about the size and dirtiness of the load as well as how much detergent is needed. Based on this information, the setting determines the most suitable wash cycle, temperature, time, rinse cycle and spin speed. Super Speed Wash: Laundry can be done in 60 minutes as the machine uses a twin water supply to fill the drum quickly. Specialty cycles: These are cycles designed to blitz garden and cooking stains, among others. Energy saving: The washer uses ‘ecobubble’ technology. Air and water are pulled in to generate bubbles, dissolving the detergent faster so that temperatures can be lower and less energy is used. Quiet: A 3D vibration sensor system keeps the drum well balanced at high spin speeds by ensuring 14 stainless steel balls spin together in the opposite direction to the laundry load. At lower drum speeds, powerful magnets hold the balls firmly in place and significantly decrease vibration and noise, the company said.","WW9000 washing machine is designed to be remotely operated as well as by a large colour touchscreen on the appliance .
Samsung's machine is built to cut energy and has smart cycles including a setting that can wash clothes in less than one hour .

"Bali's pro-death penalty governor doesn't want Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran executed on his island, because it could be bad for business. Made Mangku Pastika, a former head of Indonesia's national narcotics agency, testified against members of the Bali Nine in a 2007 challenge of their death sentences, believed that the Australians’ execution on the island would spoil the harmonious relationship between the two countries. Indonesia is set to confirm it had a record one million visits from Australians in 2014, the vast majority of them to Bali. Scroll down for video . Drug smugglers Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran have been denied presidential clemency and are to face a firing squad . Bali Governor Made Mangku Pastika does not want Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran executed on the island as it may create bad blood between Indonesia and Australia . Andrew Chan's brother Michael emerges from Kerobokan jail, Bali, where he visited his brother on Sunday . A time and place is yet to be set for the executions. But General Pastika says they shouldn't be carried out in Bali. ‘If it's possible, please not in Bali, just somewhere else,"" he told reporters, without giving his reasons. ‘I think they want Bali to keep in harmony, remain safe, remain peaceful. So if possible, not in Bali, please.’ It’s a change of tact for General Pastika who when testifying against members of the Bali Nine in a 2007 challenge of their death sentences described drug traffickers as ‘mass murderers’ who were deserving of death. The families of Chan and Sukumaran (seen as a child in picture above) are pleading for mercy . Sukumaran and Chan have now been denied presidential clemency and only a last-ditch legal bid stands between them and the firing squad. Their families have made a desperate plea to Indonesia's president to reconsider the pair's executions in light of the work they have done to improve the lives of fellow inmates. On Thursday, Chan's last-ditch attempt at a clemency bid was rejected by President Joko Widodo , following Sukumaran's rejected bid in December, officially exhausting the  legal appeals against their death sentence for attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia. General Pastika made it clear he was against the executions taking place on the island saying:  'If it's possible, please not in Bali, just somewhere else.' The decision comes as Australian media personalities, including Asher Keddie and Alan Jones, have joined the campaign initiated by artist Ben Quilty to request mercy from Indonesian authorities. Relatives of Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, said they were devastated to hear the decision about the clemency bids, and pleaded for the president to visit the pair in Kerobokan Jail. Raji Sukumaran, Myuran's mother, said that she was 'sure he would not have the heart to order them to be executed' if he saw their efforts towards reforming themselves and every aspect of the running of the jail. Mrs Sukumaran told The Sydney Morning Herald that she was confident that if the president could see how much they had changed he would put a stop to the executions, which have been scheduled to happen this year. Ranjini Sukumaran, the mother of Bali Nine ringleader Myuran Sukumaran, said that he is a different person . The pair have been on death row since 2006, and could face death as early as next Sunday under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. Their families said that they were at a loss to deal with a prison system that was not structurally built to recognise the efforts of prisoners to reform themselves, but hoped that this would change. Myuran's younger brother Chinthu Sukumaran said that Indonesian authorities needed to actually visit the prison to see the changes that had occured. 'Everyone who goes in there and spends a couple of minutes, they are just very impressed,' he said. The pair have dedicated much of their time to advocating against the very illegal activity that landed them in jail- drugs. Chan and Sukumaran have also instigated tertiary courses in computer studies, arts, English, and graphic design. Chan and Sukumaran (above) are scheduled for execution in 2015 and could face the firing squad on Sunday . Chinthu Sukumaran (far left), Michael Chan (left), Ranjini Sukumaran (right) and Brintha (far left) speak to journalists about their desperate plea to have their family members freed . Sukumaran is only a year away from completing his Bachelor of Fine Arts through Monash University, and along with Chan has aided the introduction of cooking, philosophy and psychology lessons and a first aid course. Bali locals have made a show of support, coming out to buy Sukumaran's art in the wake of his rejected clemency appeal. His mother made an emotional appeal on Saturday, speaking of how sorry her son was and how much he had changed as an individual. 'No mother should have to go through this, it's killing us. Please, something has to be done, please help,' Channel Seven reported Mrs Sukumaran as saying. When testifying against members of the Bali Nine in a 2007 challenge of their death sentences,  General Pastika described drug traffickers as ‘mass murderers’ Mrs Sukumaran said that she was 'terrified'. 'I've been told my son will be taken out and shot at any time. I don't know what to do. He doesn't deserve to die.' The Australians may only be given several days notice if scheduled for execution, facing the imminent possibility of their death following the recent increase in criminal executions after a five year respite. Chan and Sukumaran are still hoping that a last-ditch legal bid stands between them and a firing squad . They have been informed that when they are executed they will face the firing squad together for their plot to smuggle over 8 kilograms of heroin into Australia. 'He was only a teenager,' said Michael Chan, who is planning to fly over to see his brother in the next few days. 'There are no words that would make it better, [it's] just to be there with him,' he said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott spoke to both men's families on Friday and said the Australian government was 'continuing to make every possible effort' to stop the executions. 'He was only a teenager,' said Michael Chan, who is planning to fly over to see his brother in the next few days . Mrs Sukumaran made an emotional appeal on Saturday, speaking of how sorry her son was . Mrs Sukumaran said that she was 'terrified' for her son . Mrs Sukumaran did not comment on what's being done to try to save her son but said she had full confidence in the Australian government. 'I'm not giving up and I know the Australian government will do everything it can to bring the boys home or even to stop the execution,' she said. 'They can't do this to them.' Andrew Chan's brother Michael said he was not giving up hope because 'there are things that are being done' that would remain 'behind closed doors'. But the reality of his 31-year-old brother's fate was hitting home. 'The last couple of days have probably been worse for wear,' he said. 'I don't think I've felt this way, probably, since the beginning when it first all happened. But to know that we're sort of nearing the end of the road is heartbreaking.' Chan and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006 . Sukamaran's mercy plea was rejected by the Indonesian government on December 30th . Mr Abbott (with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, left) said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution . Despite Indonesian President Joko Widodo vowing not to grant pardons for drug smugglers, the attorney-general's spokesman, Tony Spontana, said earlier in the week that there was a chance for the executions to be delayed. 'But with regards to death penalty, we have the mechanism to review the decision,' Mr Spontana said. 'Starting from the decision made by the District Court all the way to decision in Judicial Review, including the clemency decision,' reported The ABC. If Chan and Sukumaran are executed under the same conditions that previous inmates have faced, they will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled. The pair will be offered blindfolds to wear, and will have white aprons around their neck and a red target on their chest. Julian McMahon, the pair's Australian lawyer, said that executions were 'not clean killings', and that prisoners may be tied to a plank before being shot. Chan was arrested at the age of 21 for his role in the Bali Nine drug smuggling ring . 'If the prisoner isn’t dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head,' Mr McMahon said. Mr McMahon said that Sukamaran and Chan were traumatised by their impending execution, and often dreamed of being shot in the heart by the prison's firing squad. Sukamaran and Chan attended school together at Homebush Boys High School in Sydney's west, and Chan said the pair had been relying on each other in an attempt to 'trying to stay strong for our family and friends at this difficult time.' 'It is hard to think that our lives are in the hands of two men - Tony Abbott and Joko Widodo - who have the power to grant life and death - please pray for a change of heart for these men and for our families,' he wrote in comments passed onto the Facebook page Friends of Andrew Chan. Mr McMahon labelled the potential executions 'chilling', and said that he could not fathom simply taking prisoners outside and shooting them. 'It seemed impossible to be true that they would take out these people on the weekend and just shoot them. That was my first reaction,' Mr McMahon said. News of the looming executions has galvanised Australians seeking clemency for Chan and Sukumaran, with 2,500 signatures on a petition begging Indonesian president Joko Widodo for mercy on their behalf.

"So full of life: Lanna Hamann, 16, was vacationing with friends in Mexico last week when she went into cardiac arrest after spending a day downing energy drinks on the beach . A 16-year-old girl vacationing in Mexico with her friends suddenly died from a heart attack over the weekend, and her mother believes that energy drinks were to blame. Kris Hamman, of Peoria, Arizona, says her daughter Lanna, a star softball player at Sunshine Mountain High School, traveled to Rocky Point, Mexico, last week with her friends and their parents for a summer getaway. According to Lanna's friends, the girl spent Saturday on the beach consuming energy drinks but no water. Her mother says that night, Lanna complained to a friend's father that she was feeling ill. A short time later, the athletic teen collapsed and went into cardiac arrest, which ultimately resulted in her death. Mrs Hamman admitted that the same thing could have happened back home in Arizona, but she urged other parents to keep a closer eye on their kids. ‘[Watch] what they're drinking and [make sure] they're drinking water instead of an energy drink,’ Hamann told the station KPHO. On Sunday, dozens of Lanna's friends held a vigil to remember the popular high school sophomore. Due to complications with the girl's birth certificate, the Hamman family have been experiencing trouble bringing her body to the U.S. for burial. Scroll down for video . Too young: Lanna was described by her friends as a high school softball star who loved going on hikes . The family's friends have launched an online fundraiser on GoFundMe.com to help raise the $13,000 needed to bring Lanna Hamman home from Mexico. Those who knew the vivacious raven-haired beauty took to Twitter to raise awareness of the Hamann family's plight using the BringLannaHome hashtag. Family friend Nicole Escobar described Lanna as a girl with a beautiful smile who loved to play softball and go on hikes. Lanna's parents traveled across the border Tuesday to sign the 16-year-old's death certificate and accompany her body back to Arizona. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration launched an investigation into five deaths linked to energy drinks and one non-fatal heart attack.

"Thousands of miles from suspected alien crash sites, the people of Portsmouth have good reason to consider themselves safe from the prying eyes of extra-terrestrials. But images shared by residents of what appears to be a UFO earlier this week suggest otherwise. Hovering ominously in the dusk sky, the dark grey, disc-like object has sparked mystery among sceptics and space enthusiasts alike. Mystery: Residents were baffled by the sighting of a grey disc-shaped UFO in Portsmouth on Tuesday night . And as weather experts rule out the possibility that the object was a cloud, the town has been left wondering just exactly what it was flying over its homes on Tuesday evening. Johnny Blackwell from Southsea said: 'I don’t believe in UFOs, but when I saw this I didn’t know what it was. 'It didn't look like a cloud, and it was moving very fast. 'It was a grey, disc-like shape, which I know sounds like a stereotypical UFO, but that’s what it looked like. 'I don’t know much about military aircraft, but this was very fast-moving and very odd to see,' the 23-year-old added. Another observer, who declined to be named, said: 'My initial thought was it was an aeroplane, but it was just moving too quickly. 'I was the only one that saw it but was quick enough to take the picture. 'I definitely believe in UFOs and am very interested in science fiction, and often look up at the sky in the evening wondering if there is anything or anyone else out there.' Twitter users shared their confusion online. Josh Harcourt-Kelly wrote: 'Watching the sky and saw what looked like a UFO! Starting to believe in what people have been saying.' Accompanied with the hash-tag '#pompeyufo,' another, writing under the name Meral, said: 'What's this I'm hearing about a UFO spotted over Portsmouth'. The 'fast-moving' object appeared at around 7pm and appeared to some observes to be flying too quickly to be a plane or military aircraft . Experts dismissed claims that the object was a cloud, saying it was 'nothing to do with the weather'. Laura Young, from the Met Office, said: 'After looking at the images, I can say the object is nothing to do with the weather. 'There is no meteorological explanation for it. It's not a cloud.' Karen Masters, senior lecturer in the institute of cosmology and gravitation at The University of Portsmouth, added: ‘Given the pictures show a dark object against a daytime sky, it’s clearly not an astronomical object. 'Many UFO sightings are the planet Venus, but this one can’t be that.' Those fearing alien invasion can rest easy however as even if there is extra-terrestrial life somewhere in the galaxy, it is too far away to make contact with Earth, she added. 'The distances in space are so vast that it’s just not possible for aliens to be visiting Earth, so any interpretation suggesting this is an alien spacecraft is clearly wrong.'","Mysterious flying object spotted above Portsmouth at dusk .

"Musicals and I rarely mix and, much like first dates, I give them until the interval before I decide if I’m going to hang around any longer. Far from making me feel good, Mamma Mia’s cheesy plot and schmaltzy songs made me feel slightly sick. I walked out, feeling like I’d met my Waterloo. I also hated every garish second of Guys And Dolls. I cannot abide the mix of saccharine sweetness, contrived sing-a-longs and false happy-ever-afters which are too often the trademarks of musicals. So, six years ago when Jersey Boys opened in London’s West End, I felt a familiar sense of foreboding as we trooped in. Oh what a night: Kay has seen Jersey Boys, the musical about Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, a whopping 12 times . I loved the music of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, but was certain this would be a clumsy production which would destroy my happy memories of some great songs. So how unprepared was I for the emotional rollercoaster that left me gripping my seat, weak with excitement and with tears streaming down my cheeks. I don’t think anybody else in the audience gave me a second glance. They were too busy crying, clapping and dancing themselves. Never before has a rags-to-riches story encompassed such steely determination and bitter loss while managing to be utterly life-affirming. That is why — and please don’t think me mad — I have been to see the show 12 times. And it goes without saying no one is more excited at the prospect of seeing the movie version, directed by Clint Eastwood, which has just opened here. I only hope it has the same power as the stage show. Memories of Mum: Kay Burley and her mother Kathleen . So why the obsession? Quite simply, Jersey Boys makes me feel closer to my mother, Kathleen, who I lost to breast cancer in 1993. She was aged just 59. Mum’s favourite group were The Four Seasons, so when I first saw Jersey Boys in 2008, I was transported back to the cosy world of my childhood in Wigan. There I was, a young girl in my mother’s council-house kitchen with its formica worktops, swirling lime, orange and yellow Sixties’ wallpaper, and the Roberts radio blaring out Four Seasons hits. My younger sister Jacqueline and I would sit, transfixed, as our mum twirled around as she made our tea — probably egg and chips — singing out loud. Mum couldn’t carry a tune in a bucket. But as soon as her favourite hit, December, 1963 (Oh, What A Night), came over the airwaves, her voice would rise lustily — crashing and falling  — as she joined in with Frankie. So that first time I saw Jersey Boys, the sense of her loss hit me like a blow. I was instantly taken back in time, and could see her in front of me — stars in her eyes and granite in her voice. She was a northern lass who worked in a cardboard box factory — exactly the market those working-class boys, Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, had always set out to enthral. She was so proud of me and the career which took me to London and on to television as a presenter for Sky News. Even now, when I’ve had a particularly tough day, I go for a run and talk to her about life. I can almost hear her saying: ‘Don’t worry about it, our Kay.’ Meet the boys: Kay with the stars of the show (L to R) Michael Watson, Edd Post, Ben Wheeler and Matt Nalton at the Piccadilly Theatre . And when things get really bad, I don’t reach for wine — I call the box office knowing the show always delivers the message that you must pick yourself up and dust yourself down. Mum first developed cancer aged 50, but put up a brave fight and eventually got the all-clear. But the disease returned. Little did we know we would only have her for another six weeks. I’ll never forget when, typically forthright, she said: ‘I’m dying, Kay.’ When I said I couldn’t cope without her she said: ‘You are going to have to cope, because you need to look after your dad.’ When she went, my dad, Frank, was devastated. He died of a heart attack two years later aged 65. When Mum died, my son, Alexander, who I brought up single handedly, was just eight months old. I can only console myself that at least she got to meet him. But her death meant, as a new mum, I couldn’t ask her all the questions about babies, such as why they won’t stop crying? Emotional rollercoaster: Every time Kay sees Jersey Boys the memories of her mother mean she is reduced to tears . Now Alexander is 21 and has just graduated from London School of Economics with a politics degree. I dearly wish Mum could have seen what he went on to achieve. These are the thoughts which flit into my head as I sit watching Jersey Boys, making waterproof mascara a must before any visit. Such is the power of The Four Seasons’ music, I even named my red setter Cherry (pronounced Sherry), after one of Mum’s favourite hits, Sherry Baby. I got Cherry in 1994, and she was my constant companion over the next 14 years. She instinctively comforted me if I was upset, and remained my faithful friend as relationships came and went and as I raised my son. My lovely dog died when she was 14, leaving me utterly bereft, and just the opening bars of Sherry Baby are enough to reduce me to floods of fresh tears. When my girlfriends accompany me to the show, they rest their hands on my shoulder before the song even begins. Mega fans: Many fans of the show have seen it more than 200 times . But I find there is something truly uplifting about the story of four poor Italian-American boys who fought their way out of New Jersey to sell 175 million records. There are moments in the show where you feel as if your heart is being ripped out. Frankie Valli’s youngest daughter, Francine, died from a drug overdose, and the moment in the musical where he is handed her belongings by a nurse is heart-rending. But there’s humour when the boys lose their virginity, and one-liners such as ‘Never lie to your mother, always lie to your wife.’ It’s a perfect musical for a single girl like me because it fulfils every emotion — every joy and every failure — you have ever felt. But it’s also macho and motivational. I wasn’t at all surprised to learn that Sir Alex Ferguson took the entire Manchester United squad to see the musical two seasons ago. I have a wry smile (as an Arsenal supporter) when I think of Rooney and Giggs sitting there, discreetly dabbing their eyes. Inspiring: Jersey Boys spells out the importance of friendship through the upheavals of life . Other celebrity fans include Simon Cowell — who like me, hates  musicals, and David Beckham. When the show moved to a new theatre in March, I went to the first performance and spotted Gok Wan, the Birds Of A Feather girls and most surprisingly, the cast of TOWIE. They walked in with bright smiles and emerged looking shell-shocked — as if they’d had a musical epiphany. It’s a sign of my true devotion that I’ve seen the show twice again since then. I even interviewed the cast for my LBC radio show.

"U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice passed up a golden opportunity on Friday to walk back her Sunday television praise for accused Army deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl as an American who had 'served the United States with honor and distinction.' Rice waded once again into controversy with comments on ABC's Sunday morning news program 'This Week,' setting off an immediate firestorm among Americans who had already learned that Bergdahl was no ordinary hostage overseas. Taliban forces in Afghanistan turned him over to U.S. Special Forces on Saturday after nearly five years of captivity following his voluntary walk-off from his base near the Pakistan border. The United States released five Taliban terror leaders in exchange, sending them to Qatar for a one-year period of loosely defined house arrest. An Army-led investigation conducted in the months after Bergdahl's 2009 disappearance determined that he left a remote outpost deliberately an intentionally. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . U.S. National security adviser Susan Rice defended her singular praise of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, insisting that she was lauding his decision to enlist in the Army, and not his apparent behavior in Afghanistan . 'Honor and distinction': Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl (R) was handed over by the Taliban on Saturday after nearly five years in which he reportedly vacillated between escape attempts and efforts to join in jihad, preceded by a voluntary walk-off from his military outpost . Six soldiers who served in the Bergdahl's platoon said Thursday that they all believed he had willfully deserted the U.S. Army'; We would all die for him,' said one, 'and he left' According to more recent reports, including one that aired Thursday on the Fox News Channel, Bergdahl became a Musilm during his time with the Taliban, even declaring himself a mujahid – a warrior for Islam. That revelation put added pressure on Rice to clarify what she had meant. 'I realize there has been lots of discussion and controversy around this,' Rice told CNN during an interview near the 70th anniversary commemoration of the D-Day invasion in Normandy, France. 'But what I was referring to was the fact that this was a young man who volunteered to serve his country in uniform at a time of war. That, in and of itself, is a very honorable thing.' CNN's Jim Acosta pressed on. 'But ""honor and distinction""?' he asked. 'Jim, really,' Rice replied. 'This is a young man whose circumstances we are still going to learn about. He is, as [are] all Americans, innocent until proven guilty.' President Barack Obama himself used the phrase 'honor and distinction last year to describe a group of 220 Marines, 18 sailors and 3 soldiers who were killed when a Hezbollah suicide bomber attacked a Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. On the thirtieth anniversary of that attack, Obama said 'they were faithful to their comrades in arms and served with honor and distinction in the finest tradition of the U.S. military.' Until Sunday, that was the last time the phrase appeared in official White House transcripts. Rice chose her words carefully on Friday, but less so on Sunday. Asked then by host George Stephanopoulos whether she thought Bergdahl would face Army discipline or a court-martial upon his return, Rice said that 'anybody who's been held in those conditions in captivity for five years has paid an extraordinary price. But that is really not the point.' 'The point is, he's back,' Rice declared. 'He's going to be safely reunited with his family. He served the United States with honor and distinction.' She added that she hoped Bergdahl had 'the opportunity to recover in peace and security and be reunited with his family,' and called it 'such a joyous day.' White House press secretary Jay Carney declined to answer questions on Monday about Rice's claim, referring reporters' inquiries to the Department of Defense. Since then, Republicans on Capitol Hill have stepped up their pressure on Rice. Rice (R) is among Presdient Barack Obama's most trusted aides and travels with him on Air Force One and Marine One, alongside such West Wing luminaries as Press Secretary Jay Carney (L) Susan Rice, the president's most trusted national security aide, got in hot water by saying on June 1 that accused war deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl had 'served the United States with honor and distinction' On Tuesday, New York Rep. Peter King told CNN that the Obama insider's statement made him 'wonder about all the things the president is saying, including the fact he thinks Qatar is going to somehow provide security so these five detainees will not be back on the battlefield.' On Wednesday, Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on Fox News that Obama should 'give a full accounting for what he knew and when he knew it, and why he sent Susan Rice on Sunday shows to say he served ""with honor and distinction."" American people need to know the truth.' Ohio Sen. Rob Portman piled on a day later, complaining to Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that Rice had pronounced Bergdahl an honorable soldier 'before there is any Army investigation.' Rice has been a GOP lightning rod since September 2012 when she said on five Sunday political talk shows just days after the Benghazi, Libya terror attack that a spontaneous mob of protesters upset over an American-made anti-Islam video – not armed militants allied with al-Qaeda – had attacked a U.S. diplomatic post. She worked from a set of 'talking points' that day, an internal summary of messages that the Obama administration found acceptable. It later emerged that officials at the CIA, the State Department and the White House altered those talking points to omit mention of organized terror groups. Heady company: RIce (front, L) sat at the right hand of President Obama on June 5 when he met with British Prime Minister David Cameron (R, center) during the G7 Summit at the European Council in Brussels, Belgium . The attack and its aftermath came less than two months before President Obama was to stand for re-election – in part, on a message that al-Qaeda was 'on the run.' Rice, then the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, withdrew her name from consideration for the job of secretary of state months later when Hillary Clinton left the position. Obama later chose her as his national security adviser, a job that doesn't require Senate confirmation. On Friday she doubled down on the Benghazi controversy, too, . 'Are you being up front by the American people,' Acosta asked her, 'or are you being guided by talking points?' 'With Benghazi,' she claimed, as has been recounted on many occasions, I provided the best information that the U.S. government had at the time. Parts of it turned out to be wrong. I regret that the information I was provided was wrong, and that I delivered it to the American people.' 'That doesn't make me a liar. That makes me a public servant trying to say what we knew at the time.' The first draft of her talking points after the Benghazi attack included a CIA assessment that, 'We do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qaeda participated in the attack.' Later versions described only an 'on-going' investigation to learn 'who is responsible for the violence.'","National Security Adviser Susan Rice said the day after Taliban forces released accused Army deserter Bowe Bergdahl that he had 'served the United States with honor and distinction'

"U.S. prisoner of war Bowe Bergdahl could have his life turned into a film by the team behind Zero Dark Thirty, the big-screen dramatisation of the hunt for Osama bin Laden. The director and producer of the award-winning film are rumoured to be 'in the early stages' of planning a feature after following Bergdahl's story 'for several years'. Sergeant Bergdahl spent five years in Taliban captivity after going missing from a U.S. Army post in Afghanistan. Scroll down for video . Background: . The investigation will look at what led to Bergdahl, pictured with a . Taliban fighter before he was freed last month, leaving his base in . Afghanistan and being held captive for five years . New project: The team behind Zero Dark Thirty, pictured above, are reportedly planning to dramatise the life of the man who was until recently the only U.S. prisoner of war . Raid: Zero Dark Thirty was a timely rendition of the manhunt for Osama bin Laden, which culminated in a raid on his Pakistani compound, as depicted above in the film . He was released to the U.S. Government last month in a controversial prisoner swap which saw the White House hand back five dangerous Taliban leaders. He was brought back to the United States last weekend as is currently recovering at an Army hospital. His return has prompted speculation that director Kathryn Bigelow and writer/producer Mark Boal could base a production on his five years as the country's only prisoner of war. The two brought out Zero Dark Thirty, a dark portrayal of the ten-year manhunt and eventual killing of Osama bin Laden, just a year after he was killed in a raid on his Pakistan compound. According to Deadline Hollywood, the film is in the works but only at a very preliminary stage. It is also rumoured that Fox Searchlight are poised to dramatise Sergeant Bergdahl's life. The film company is said to have acquired rights to a long-form investigative article about the soldier, written by Michael Hastings of Rolling Stone magazine. Home ground: Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, pictured moments before being freed by the Taliban, has arrived at a medical center in San Antonio . Inquiry: A General is due to begin an investigation into the capture of Bowe Bergdahl, believed to be the man circled. The 28-year-old was flown to a Texas base, above, on Friday . Briefing: In their short briefing, the military said that Bergdahl will gradually be shown media reports abou his disappearance . Sergeant . Bergdahl himself is still being looked after by the Army after his . return on May 31. Yesterday military chiefs said he was being slowly . informed of the huge attention surrounding his return, for which some . have severely criticised the government. He . arrived in the predawn hours of Friday at Brooke Army Medical Center in . San Antonio, Texas, on a military flight from Germany, dogged by . questions surrounding his disappearance from a U.S. Army post in . Afghanistan and the deal the Obama administration reached to free him. 'He is . gradually being provided media coverage about him,' Colonel Hans Bush, a . reintegration mission spokesman for U.S. Army South, said in a brief . statement. Colonel Bush said Sergeant Bergdahl is yet to be reunited with his parents and that he will decide when he wants to see them. He said: 'He . has acclimated to his time change from Germany. He is eating and . sleeping on a routine schedule. His debriefings and medical care . continue.' The . U.S. military said on Monday it had begun an investigation into . Bergdahl's 2009 disappearance in Afghanistan, with no time set for its . completion. While . the Army also gave little information about his health and . emotional state, officials said they were pleased with his physical . state on arrival. The . military hospital in San Antonio where Sergeant Bergdahl has been receiving what . the Army calls 'reintegration' treatment has teams of specialists and . has been helping returning prisoners of war for decades. Background: The investigation will look at what led to Bergdahl, pictured with a Taliban fighter before he was freed last month, leaving his base in Afghanistan and being held captive for five years . The soldier was handed over to U.S. forces in Afghanistan on May 31 in exchange for . five Taliban leaders held at the Guantanamo prison in Cuba. His release . initially sparked a wave of support that was quickly overshadowed by a . political uproar over the freeing of the senior Taliban members. Lawmakers . criticized the Obama administration for failing to give them 30 days' notice before transferring prisoners from Guantanamo as required by law. Some . charged that in making the exchange, the administration had effectively . violated its policy against negotiating with terrorists. Some . of Sergeant Bergdahl's former comrades in Afghanistan claim he had deserted . when he walked away from his post, which led to his capture. As he continues his rehabilitation at the Army medical center in San Antonio, Texas, the investigation into his disappearance will get under way. Part of it will examine what led to Sergeant Bergdahl leaving his base, which resulted in his capture. An investigation at the time concluded that he had left of his own free will, but a military official has told CNN the Army has no definitive proof he deserted. Sergeant Bergdahl has not yet been reunited with his parents. It is not unusual for former hostages to delay meeting close friends and family, as it can be an emotional strain. Army life: Bergdahl, left, was a member of Blackfoot Company, 1st . Battalion 501st infantry Regiment . A spokesman for his parents, Bob and Jani, said they were overjoyed that he had returned to the U.S. They are waiting for the right moment to visit their son, who is currently being cared for by a specially trained team who have been preparing for his return since he was first taken hostage.","Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal 'interested in story of Sergeant Bergdahl'

"Not everyone is welcoming Bowe Bergdahl home with open arms. Some of the men who served with the Taliban POW believe that he deserted his post. And they say six American soldiers died because of his actions. Bergdahl's release, brokered with the Taliban in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees, has ignited fury in some corners of the U.S. military community and re-opened old wounds. 'Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him,'  former Sergeant Matt Vierkant told CNN. A former superior of the 28-year-old soldier, Greg Leatherman, said he hopes the military investigates Bergdahl and questions whether he did, indeed, desert his post in Afghanistan on June 30, 2009. Scroll down for video . Obama also brushed aside questions today about the circumstances surrounding Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's capture by insurgents in 2009, saying the U.S. has an obligation to not leave its military personnel behind . Cover-up? Bergdahl, the last American hostage from the Iraq or Afghanistan wars, was released this weekend in a prisoner exchange that saw five Guantanamo terrorism suspects freed. Meanwhile, some of the soldiers who served with Bergdahl say they were made to sign a highly unusual non disclosure agreement covering his disappearance . The Facebook page 'Bowe Bergdahl is NOT a hero!' has 5,400 members and bears a picture of the six paratroopers who lost their lives while looking for their captured comrade. A White House petition to punish Bergdahl for being absent without leave (AWOL) has nearly 2,000 online signatures. These critics say that even after five years of Taliban captivity, . Bergdahl gets to come home to his family - but six of his comrades never . made it back alive. 'I was pissed off then and I am even more so now with everything going on,' Mr Vierkant said. The . men who are said to have died looking for Bergdahl are: Staff Sergeant . Clayton Bowen, 29, and Private First Class Morris Walker, 23, who were . killed in an IED explosion on August 18, 2009.

Second Lieutenant Darryn Andrews, 34, (left) and Private First Class Matthew Michael Martinek, 20, (right) died after a rocket-propelled grenade ambush on September 4, 2009. Most members of the military community voice support for Bergdahl, however. When a discussion on the Facebook page of his battalion filled up with negative comments, a moderator chimed in: 'I challenge any one of you who label him a traitor to spend 5 years in captivity with the Taliban or Haqqani, then come back and accuse him again. Whatever his intent when he walked away or was captured, he has more than paid for it.' Stories from the soldiers in Bergdahl's unit have begun to emerge of a young man whose mind had begun to wander. Mr Leatherman said Bergdahl 'always looked at the mountains in the distance and talked of ""seeing what's on the other side.""' 'He walked off. He left his guard post. Nobody knows if he defected or he's a traitor or he was kidnapped. 'What I do know is he was there to protect us and instead he decided to defer from America and go and do his own thing. 'I don't know why he decided to do that, but we spend so much of our resources and some of those resources were soldiers' lives.' - Former Private First Class Jose Baggett . One . Twitter user who calls himself only Cody and offers a detailed . description of Bergdahl's disappearance said Bergdahl had begun behaving . strangely before his disappearance. He said Bergdahl told him: 'If deployment is lame, I'm going to get lost in the Mountains and make my way to China.' The twitter user's identity could not be verified by MailOnline. Rolling . Stone magazine also quoted emails Bergdahl is said to have sent to his . parents that suggest he was disillusioned with America's mission in . Afghanistan, had lost faith in the U.S. Army's mission there and was . considering desertion. Bergdahl told his parents he was 'ashamed to even be American'. Bergdahl, who mailed home boxes containing his uniform and books, also wrote: 'The future is too good to waste on lies. And life is way too short to care for the damnation of others, as well as to spend it helping fools with their ideas that are wrong.' The military seems to tacitly acknowledge that Bergdahl violated military regulations of some kind. However, officials also say he's unlikely to be disciplined for it. One source told CNN: 'Five years is enough.' Soldiers described a massive effort by the U.S. Army to recover Bergdahl after he was taken captive - one in which soldiers were ordered to go on patrols and take risks in ways they never would otherwise. Twitter user Cody, who claims he served with Bergdahl, said the search left Bergdahl's comrades vulnerable. 'While searching for him, ambushes and IEDs picked up tremendously. Enemy knew we would be coming,' he wrote. 'So without (Bergdahl) going missing we wouldn't have been in certain places.' Furthermore, drones, planes, helicopters, soldiers and even food were diverted to the mission. CNN reports that the lack of resources led to a delay in the military closing Combat Outpost Keating. On October 3, Taliban insurgents overran the base and killed eight American soldiers. Former Private First Class Jose Baggett, 27, who served in Bergdahl's company, told CNN that he lost two friends in the search for the captured soldier. And he blames Bergdahl for the deaths. He said: 'He walked off. He left his guard post. Nobody knows if he defected or he's a traitor or he was kidnapped. 'What I do know is he was there to protect us and instead he decided to defer from America and go and do his own thing.

Shot by renowned photographer Margaret Bourke-White, who is better known for her work during conflict, the photos show scantily-clad dancers waiting to go on stage.

Saturate yourself with your subject and the camera will all but take you by the hand.' These previously unseen and lesser known photographs of burlesque and ballet dancers backstage are just some of her work on show at a new exhibition in her honour. Held in the Daniel Blau gallery in London until 20 December, the presentation features contrasting facets of the photographer's work. A selection of more than 60 vintage photographs includes incredible images of the Second World War in North Africa and Italy, which embody Bourke-White's courage and determination.

While crossing the Atlantic to North Africa, her transport ship was torpedoed and destroyed. Bourke-White survived the attack and continued on her travels to Europe to cover the bitter daily struggle of the Allied infantrymen in the Italian campaign. In the male-dominated world of early twentieth century photojournalism, Bourke-White was a pioneer. In her extensive and diverse career, she photographed many historic moments. This 1936 picture is entitled: Backstage In a Degas Setting the . Ballerinas of the Ballet Russe Pause . Bourke-White's intuition and dedication gave her the knack of being at the right place at the right time. She was the first Western photographer permitted to document Soviet Industry after the revolution, the first female war correspondent, the first woman permitted to work in combat zones and the first woman to fly on a bombing mission during the Second World War. Bourke-White shot the first cover of what was to become the iconic LIFE magazine in 1936, the publication that would later send her to cover the Second World War.

"In the clear: No further action will be taken against Oxford Union President Ben Sullivan . The president of the Oxford Union will not face charges over claims he raped one fellow student and attacked another. Ben Sullivan, a third-year undergraduate, was arrested at dawn early last month in his college room at Christ Church and has been on bail for six weeks. Yesterday police informed the 21-year-old that no further action would be taken against him following an investigation into the allegations, thought to have been made by the young women more than a year ago. Mr Sullivan's arrest rocked the prestigious 200-year-old debating society, a breeding ground for political leaders whose former presidents include cabinet ministers William Hague and Michael Gove, London Mayor Boris Johnson and prime ministers from William Gladstone and Herbert Asquith to Edward Heath. Publicity surrounding the case  sparked a boycott campaign by students that saw a host of high-profile speakers cancel their appearances. A picture of banker's son Mr Sullivan in evening suit and bow tie made headlines across the world, even though he had not been charged. Human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Tawakkol Karman, Interpol secretary-general Robert Noble, US entrepreneur Julie Meyer and David Mepham, the UK director of Human Rights Watch, were all said to have pulled out of debates at the Oxford Union citing concerns about Mr Sullivan's arrest. A letter written by student politicians to around 30 speakers who had been booked to attend asked them to boycott the Union, and for Mr Sullivan to resign in what they called a 'push for equality'. The letter, by student union official Sarah Pine, was signed by feminist activists Laurie Penny and Caroline Criado-Perez. Case dropped: Ben Sullivan, 21, will face no further action over allegations of rape and attempted rape . Mr Sullivan, a former pupil at . £22,000-a-year St Paul's School in London, repeatedly rejected calls to . stand down as president while the police carried out their . investigation. He avoided a vote of no confidence after fellow Union . officers defeated a motion to call one by a single vote. The rape was alleged to have occurred in January 2013 and the attempted rape in April 2013. Last . night Nigel Evans, the Tory MP and former Deputy Speaker of the Commons . who was cleared of a number of rape and sexual assault charges earlier . this year at Preston Crown Court, said Mr Sullivan's case demonstrated . the need for alleged rapists to be given anonymity until they are . charged. Mr Sullivan, 21, will face no charges after police decided there was insufficient evidence . Mr Evans, who has been supporting the student, said: 'To go through the torture of a public trial by students is appalling. 'Anonymity . would have made his life easier by a great margin. It would still have . been very stressful but he wouldn't have had to put up with people . dropping out of speaking at the Union and a vote of no confidence in . him. It gives further credibility to my campaign to have that. The glare . of publicity this lad went through is appalling.' Mr Evans is calling . for the Home Affairs Select Committee to investigate the granting of . anonymity to arrested sex offenders until they are charged. A . judge could still decide to name them if the circumstances were . exceptional, he said. Last month Jennifer Perry, an author who was . booked at speak at the Union on stalking and harassment, said she felt . uncomfortable about the feminist boycott. She . said: 'It shouldn't be a group of young women making that decision; it . should be in the hands of the police. This campaign could harm their . investigations.' Mr . Sullivan, a history and politics student who is taking his final exams . this summer, was informed yesterday afternoon there would no charges. He . spent  a quiet evening with his family. A . Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: 'We have decided that there . is insufficient evidence to prosecute a 21-year-old man from Oxford who . was arrested following a complaint of rape and a complaint of attempted . rape made by two women. We will be writing to the complainants to . explain our decision in more detail.' The . Union released a statement last night saying: 'As far as the Society is . concerned, this is the end of the matter. We would like to thank Mr .

"A second great white shark has been found dead in nets just 400m off the coast of Bondi Beach in Sydney, sparking fears for swimmers as the temperatures heat up over the weekend. It is the second shocking discovery in three days and is just hours before beaches are expected to be packed as temperatures peak at 26 degrees. Ian Puckeridge, who works as a spear fisherman, spotted the shark lying dead in the net on Friday morning, Channel Seven reports. Scroll down for video . This second 2.5m great white shark was found dead at Bondi Beach on Friday morning . Animal rights protesters say the animals are killed 'unnecessarily' This is the second great white shark found in just three days in the nets at Bondi as the weather heats up . He told 7News said: 'It's quite awesome to see them in the water when they're alive, not so great when they're dead and laying on the bottom in a net.' It is estimated the shark had been trapped in the net for about two days. The Department for Primary Industries reportedly told 7News that inspectors had not found the shark on Friday morning and could not confirm it was caught in the nets. The first shark is thought to have died in the nets and was picked up by a contractor boat on behalf of the Fisheries department at around 11.30 am on Wednesday. It was taken from Bondi to the Fisheries wharf in Sydney harbour where it was unloaded into a container to be taken for testing and an autopsy. Photos taken by a witness on a nearby boat show the shark, hung from its mouth, being winched in the air by men in hard hats and high-vis jackets at the wharf. A 2.5 metre great white shark was caught in nets at Bondi Beach . A spokesperson for the Department of Primary Industries told Daily Mail Australia: 'A male great white shark of approximately 2.5m in length was found in a shark net off Bondi Beach.' 'The shark was found during routine inspections by specialist contractors who carry out operations as part of the NSW Shark Meshing Program,' the Department confirmed. 'DPI research staff will conduct a necropsy (or autopsy) for research purposes, as is practice for some sharks caught in our shark nets as part of national and international research projects. This will be carried out by DPI research staff.' Witness Nick Wenham told Daily Mail Australia: 'It was definitely from Bondi Beach. It's a 2.5-3m great white that needed to be taken to the Fisheries for testing because it's a protected species.' The shark is thought to have died in the nets and was picked up by a Fisheries department boat . 'The shark was found during routine inspections,' the Department confirmed . Shark nets are on 51 beaches in New South Wales and are maintained by the Department of Primary Industries . 'It was dead with its tail removed. We followed the boat from Bradley's head in the harbour up to the fisheries where I took the pictures. 'The shark went into the container behind and they shut the doors as soon as it was in,' Mr Wenham added. 'The tail was on the back deck,' he pointed out. Michael Kennedy, director of the Humane Society International Australia, said shark nets 'are old fashioned and cruel and should be to be taken out'. A dog onboard the boat inspected the dead great white . Animal welfare campaigners believe shark nets are cruel and inhumane . 'DPI research staff will conduct a necropsy (or autopsy) for research purposes,' a Department spokesperson said . 'In theory if it is alive they are supposed to release them but if it died it should be used for research so it didn't die in vain,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Groups like ours are totally opposed to shark nets … research recognises that they are a key threat to a whole range of species… but they are scared of what would happen if they are remove the nets,' Mr Kennedy said. 'Even people whose sons and parents have been killed in the surf don't want revenge killings … I think that is the attitude today in Australia.' Shark nets are on 51 beaches in New South Wales and are maintained by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries. The nets are generally 150 metres long and 6m wide and can be established 500 metres from the beach. 'The program protects around two million people who swim at these beaches each year,' a Department spokesperson said. 'The nets do not stretch from one end of a beach to the other. They are not designed to create a total barrier between bathers and sharks. They are designed to deter sharks from establishing territories, thereby reducing the odds of a shark encounter,' they added.

"The daughter of the first American soldier killed in the war in Afghanistan has hit out at the Obama administration for releasing the Taliban leader who was responsible for her father's murder in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl. Appearing on Fox News Friday, Alison Spann, the daughter of CIA operative Micheal 'Mike' Spann who was killed in 2001, spoke of her bitter disappointment upon hearing about the prisoner swap earlier this month. 'My initial reaction was shock,' Spann told Fox. 'I was . shocked that our president would release five of the most high-risk . prisoners being held in Guantanamo, among them, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, in exchange for one American. Scroll down for video . Alison Spann, the daughter of slain CIA operative Micheal Spann, spoke of the shock and disappointment she felt after hearing that the Obama administration exchanged five Taliban operatives for a single American soldier . Alison was just nine when her father was killed during a prisoner uprising at a compound where he was interrogating Taliban fighters on November 25, 2001. Fazl, the leader of the prisoners at the compound, ended up in Guantanamo Bay - until two weeks ago when he and four others were switched for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. 'As a whole, my family was extremely upset and . saddened that our government would do something like this, especially in . light of the fact that it seems that people in the intelligence . community are fairly united in their belief that these terrorists are . likely to seek to further harm Americans in the future.' She said she still cannot understand why the county that her father fought for would release the man responsible for his death. Missed: Alison Spann, pictured left with her father, Johnny Michael Spann, and right, said she was shocked when she learned that the U.S. had released the Taliban leader responsible for his 2001 death . 'I do not believe that it was the right move by the administration,' she added. 'You cannot release someone of such a . high caliber within the Taliban community and expect him to suddenly . emerge as a peaceful being.' Ms Spann suggested that after being detained in prison for so long, Mullah Fazi would be more motivated than ever to seek revenge against the U.S. 'These prisoners had one goal when they went into Gitmo and I feel certain that they left Gitmo with that same goal, and that is to do harm and spread evil in the world,' Alison Spann said. Her father, who had served in the Marines for eight years before he joined the CIA, was 32 when he died at the Qala-i-Jangi . compound near Mazari Sharit in northern Afghanistan early in the war. Leader: Mullah Mohammad Fazl, left, was the leader of the prisoners during the uprising that killer Spann, right . Deal: The Taliban leader was released in exchange for U.S Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, pictured, two weeks ago . Before he . left, he had told his daughter: 'You know people want to kill us and . they're trying to kill us. People like me have to go do the things that I . have to do.' He was buried at Arlington . National Cemetery, where then-CIA Director George Tenet said he had . given up his life trying to build a 'better, safer world'. Alison Spann . 'To that place of danger and terror, . he sought to bring justice and freedom,' Tenet said. 'For Mike . understood that it is not enough simply to dream of a better, safer . world. He understood that it has to be built – with passion and . dedication, in the face of obstacles, in the face of evil.' Fazl had been deputy defense . minister and commander of all Taliban troops in the northern Afghanistan . region at the time of the September 11 attacks and he had also been accused of personally supervising the . murders of thousands of Shiite and Tajik Sunni Muslims, Fox reported. More than 2,300 Americans have died in Afghanistan since Spann's death. Bergdahl . returned to the U.S on Friday after his release from five years in . captivity in Afghanistan in the controversial prisoner swap with the . Taliban. Daughter: Alison, a recent college graduate, said her whole family was upset by the government's decision . Loved: Alison and her siblings, Emily and Jake, visit his grave at Arlington Cemetery. Jake was just six months old when his father was killed during a prisoner uprising in a compound in Northern Afghanistan . Bergdahl, . who has been recovering at an Army medical facility in Germany since . his release last month, 'will continue the next phase of his . reintegration process,' at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam . Houston in San Antonio, Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby . said. Officials have kept quiet about Bergdahl's condition to avoid rushing his back into the public spotlight after the captivity and amid a public uproar over the circumstances of his capture and release. The Idaho native was captured in Afghanistan in June 2009 and released by the Taliban on May 31 in a deal struck by the Obama administration in which five senior Taliban officials were released from detention at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In her Fox interview, Alison Spann reserved judgment on Bowe Bergdhal, noting that there are still many lingering questions that need to be answered regarding the circumstances of his captivity, but she strongly condemned the prisoner exchange. 'I believe that the implications from this decision will be seen in the near future,' she added. The Army has not formally begun a new review into the circumstances of Bergdahl's capture and whether he walked away without leave or was deserting the Army when he was found and taken by insurgents.

"Influential Muslims have lined up to criticise Marks & Spencer for letting checkout staff refuse to serve shoppers buying alcohol or pork. They described the workers’ veto as ridiculous and said it was ‘a policy that  beggars belief’. The incredulity among Islamic observers came as M&S chiefs issued an apology over the affair, in which shoppers at a London store were told to find another till when they tried to buy wine from a Muslim member of staff. 'It's ridiculous': Legal consultant Khola Hasan criticised Marks & Spencer after the chain allowed Muslim employees to excuse themselves from serving alcohol or pork. The store has since apologised over the affair . A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain said yesterday: ‘An employer can refuse Muslim employees permission to be excused from serving alcohol or pork because it would impact on customer service, as has happened in this case. Perhaps the solution should have been to deploy the Muslim employee who objected to serve alcohol or pork on tasks away from the till.’ The rights of staff to observe their religious beliefs in the workplace have drawn legal and political controversy over the past few years. Christian workers who asked not to be made to conduct civil partnership ceremonies or to give sex advice to gay couples have been sacked, and judges have ruled that those who do not like their employer’s rules should find another job. M&S store chiefs, however, told Muslim checkout workers they were entitled to abide by their religious belief that they should not handle alcohol or pork. A spokesman for the chain insisted yesterday that its rules put customer service first, adding: ‘We apologise that this policy was not followed in the case reported.’ M&S apologised after it emerged a Muslim check-out worker refused to serve a customer alcohol . An M&S spokeswoman said the store's policy is that members of staff who cannot handle specific food or drink products, as a result of their religious beliefs are given a 'suitable role' Inayat Bunglawala (pictured) said: 'I have never come across a Muslim.. who would refuse to serve a customer' But the company found little sympathy among prominent moderate Muslim leaders yesterday. Khola . Hasan, a legal consultant who has advised the Islamic Sharia Council, . told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I was quite dismayed when I heard . this news about M&S. I’m just wondering how far till workers can go? Are they there to police what people are buying? Few interpreters of the Koran claim the holy text forbids any contact with pork or alcohol. Rather, the guidance to the  faithful is tolerant of those who break the rules out of necessity. Among the passages that deal with food and drink, Sura two, verse 173, reads: ‘He has forbidden you carrion, blood, and the flesh of swine; also any flesh that is consecrated other than in the name of God. 'But whoever is compelled through necessity, intending neither to sin nor to transgress, shall incur no guilt. God is forgiving and merciful.’ The same Sura, verse 219, falls short of outright condemnation of drinking alcohol. It reads: ‘They ask you about drinking and gambling. Say, “There is great harm in both, although they have some benefit for men; but their harm is far greater than their benefit”.’ There is no ban in the text of the Koran on selling alcohol. ‘Will a till worker refuse to process a cake that has got champagne in it or a chocolate that has got brandy in it? ‘Muslims cannot eat any meat that is not halal, so will they refuse to process chicken or beef or lamb because it’s not halal? I don’t know how far we are going to go. I think it’s ridiculous.’ Miss Hasan said that Islamic law does not prohibit Muslims from selling alcohol in a supermarket. She added: ‘I think that we have to live together and that includes Muslims. How are we going to live together if we are sitting in a shop saying, “I won’t serve you and I won’t talk to you because you’ve got this in your hands?”.’ Inayat Bunglawala of Muslims4UK said: ‘I have never come across a Muslim in the retail trade who would refuse to serve a customer. If you are working in that trade, I don’t think anyone will hold it against you if you are working at a checkout and passing through cans of drink or packages of pig meat.’ M&S has faced a series of threats from customers who said they would take their business elsewhere rather than be told to wait for another till. One shopper at the store involved said: ‘I had one bottle of champagne and the lady, who was wearing a headscarf, was very apologetic but said she could not serve me. She told me to wait until another member of staff was available. I was taken aback.’ The M&S statement said: ‘Customer service is our priority. ‘Where we have an employee whose religious beliefs restrict food or drink they can handle, we work closely with our member of staff to place them in a suitable role, such as in our clothing department or bakery.’","Muslim Council of Britain said situation should have been handled better .

"John Cantlie, the British hostage being held by ISIS, has been used in a new slickly-produced video released by the insurgents in which he admits that he is likely to be executed. The photojournalist, who was captured last year while working in Syria, is seen addressing the camera in the propaganda video as he also reveals details of an apparent botched U.S. raid to rescue him and his fellow captives. In the lecture-style footage, titled Lend Me Your Ears Episode 6, Mr Cantlie appears to be reading from a prepared script as he sits behind a desk wearing an orange jumpsuit. The photojournalist, who was captured last year while working in Syria, is seen addressing the camera in the propaganda video as he sits behind a desk wearing an orange jumpsuit . The clip, which lasts for almost nine minutes, opens with the 43-year-old photojournalist giving an account of what he claims was a failed rescue attempt by American forces in July . It is the seventh video that ISIS has released that shows the British hostage. The clip, which lasts for almost nine minutes, opens with the 43-year-old photojournalist giving an account of what he claims was a failed rescue attempt by American forces on July 4 - American Independence Day. He goes on to say that he has 'accepted' that he will suffer the 'same fate' as his executed cellmates but that he blames the British and American governments and not the insurgents, who he refers to as the mujahideen. Asked about this latest video, Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of a further video and are analysing its contents.' It comes just days after a video purporting to show the severed head of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig and a mass murder of Syrian soldiers emerged. Since August, IS has filmed and posted online the deaths of four Western hostages. British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were beheaded on camera by the jihadi organisation. In the most recent video from the militants, which has been posted online, Mr Cantlie looks gaunt as he delivers his lecture from inside a dark room. He begins by saying: 'In this programme I will tell you about a failed raid to rescue us and how it feels to be left for dead by your own government.' It marks a departure from the last video of Mr Cantlie - released last month - which saw him being used as a news reporter from the battle-ravaged city of Kobane. In this latest clip, the sixth in the apparent 'series', Mr Cantlie said that he accepts he will most likely face the same fate as his cellmates, but says he blames David Cameron and President Obama . In the latest clip, Mr Cantlie goes on to claim that the Americans staged an 'incredibly complex, risky and expensive' attempt to rescue hostages in July. He said: 'The raid involved two dozen Delta Force commandos, several Black Hawk helicopters, gunships, Predator drones, F18 Hornet Jets and refuelling aircraft. 'It took weeks of rehearsals and must have cost tens of millions to perform - but we weren't there. 'The Islamic State, anticipating such a move, just put us into cars and moved us to another prison days beforehand.' He also admits that he 'long ago' 'accepted' that his fate will be 'overwhelmingly the same as his cellmates'. But while he says that he blames Prime Minister David Cameron and President Obama for his situation - not his captors. He also claims that the leaders knew he was being held hostage for 'more than a year' and added that they were aware that they could be beheaded. He claimed that the leaders are 'treating their lives like a gamble, like a roll of the dice,' and said that their actions felt like the 'ultimate betrayal' He said: 'Obama and Cameron act all shocked and appalled each time one of us is killed but they have known this was coming for months. 'They have known our six names, who was holding us, and the consequences of not negotiating for over a year. 'So for them to act all shocked each time one of us is executed is a massive lie to the public and our families. 'Long ago I accepted that my fate would be overwhelmingly the same as my cellmates and I am angry about it.' He claimed that the leaders are 'treating their lives like a gamble, like a roll of the dice,' and said that their actions felt like the 'ultimate betrayal'. He also accuses Britain and America of taking military action rather than negotiating the release of hostages through options such as ransom payments. He says: 'We were left to die. It's the worse feeling in the world being left behind like that. 'We have been in the longest, paid our dues, watched everyone else go home, never stopped believing and wham! Have some of that. You're not worth negotiating for.' He focuses on the French government's record for paying out ransom demands, stating that 'since 2008, France has reportedly paid $58 million of ransom payments to different Islamic groups, nearly 10 million a year.' The British journalist comments: 'Wouldn't it be cheaper to release the Muslim prisoners as asked?' He also raises the case of Bowe Robert Bergdahl, a US Army soldier who was held captive by the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network in Afghanistan from June 2009 until his release in May 2014. Mr Cantlie says: 'He was one man. We were six and Islamic State asked for Muslim prisoners in exchange for all of us. Yes, Bergdahl was a soldier and three of us were British but a civilian live, all six of them, not worth discussing?' He added: 'We are not big people. We are not special. We are not US soldiers. But we are no more less important than everyone else who went home.' The footage, seen above, marks a departure from the fifth video that was released of Mr Cantlie, which saw him being used as a news reporter from the battle-ravaged city of Kobane . Towards the end of the video, he says: 'I will continue to speak out against this military action ... for as long as the mujahideen allow me to live.' It is not the first time Mr Cantlie's experience in journalism has been utilised by ISIS, as last month his name was put to an article which appeared in a propaganda magazine designed to inflame the feelings of IS followers. This is the seventh video to feature Mr Cantlie and comes after his sister said last month that she thinks he believes 'two-thirds' of what he says on camera. Jessica Cantlie also made an emotional appeal for her brother's return, pleading with the terrorists to reopen lines of contact to secure his safe journey home. She has also previously appealed for 'direct contact' with the militants holding him. Last month Mr Cantlie's father died following a public appeal from his hospital bed. Paul Cantlie, 80, spoke directly to ISIS extremists in a heartfelt video, pleading for his son's return. He died from complications following pneumonia last month. Al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen today denounced the Islamic State group for declaring a caliphate on territory it seized in Syria and Iraq without the correct mandate. Sheikh Harith al-Nadhari, who claims to be the groups spiritual guide said their actions are 'driving a wedge' among jihadi groups. The clip emerged as the Islamic State released a seventh propaganda video showing British hostage John Cantlie. Sheikh Harith al-Nadhari was referring to Islamic State's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's recent call for followers to 'explode volcanos of jihad everywhere.' Al-Nadhari said ISIS ""forced the nation, all the nation, to pledge allegiance' in absence of 'consultation' with other Jihadi leaders. His message was posted on one of Yemeni Al-Qaida's official Twitter pages. He said: 'They revoked the legitimacy of all the Islamic groups across the Islamic world .... and drove a wedge among Mujahedeen ranks by collecting allegiances from within the Jihadi groups. 'They announced the expansion of their caliphate in a number of countries in which they have no mandate.' The Islamic State extremists initially fought to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad. But other groups, including al-Qaeda central command, disavowed them. Smaller groups across the region have pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi while the larger al-Qaeda affiliates remain silent regarding al-Baghdadi's outreach. Among the more significant loyalty pledges came from Egypt's Ansar Beit al-Maqdis. The U.S. considers al-Qaida in Yemen to be one of the most dangerous local branches of the global terror organization because it has been linked to several failed attacks on the U.S. homeland. The group is led by Nasser al-Wahishi, a onetime close associate to Osama bin Laden. In the video message, al-Nadhari reiterated the group's allegiance to bin Laden's successor Ayman al-Zawahri, in defiance of al-Baghdadi's outreach initiative.","John Cantlie is seen addressing the camera in slick propaganda video .

"The 'confessed killer' of the murdered Miss Honduras beauty queen smiled chillingly into the camera on his way to the cells last night, as his victims' grieving mother warned that the suspect's family will try to buy his freedom. Teresa Muñoz told MailOnline she feared that Plutarco Antonio Ruiz, detained for the murders of Maria Jose and Sofia Alvarado, will never be brought to justice in a country where corruption is rampant. The bodies of the two sisters were found buried in a river bank near the spa where they had disappeared a week earlier. Police believe Sofia's boyfriend Ruiz shot her in the head in a jealous rage, before shooting Maria Jose twice in the back. They say he has confessed to the deaths. Scroll down for video .

Elizabeth Alvarado (left), is escorted to testify before a judge for her possible involvement as an accomplice to the killing of the two sisters which Ruiz (right) confessed to on Tuesday . Mrs Munoz, who buried her two children near their hometown of Santa Barbara yesterday, warned that bribes for suspects are common as police sent four suspects to jail. Suspected accomplice Aris Maldonado was arrested on Tuesday alongside 32-year-old Ruiz, while spa owner Ventura Diaz and his wife Elizabeth Alvarado were arrested the next day for allegedly burying the bodies. Despite being under investigation, after his arrest Maldonado managed to post a message on Facebook  protesting his innocence. It stated: 'Thanks to the people who are with me at this difficult and unjust moment in my life. Tabloid newspapers invent everything but I have faith in God and know everything will turn out okay.' The sisters' heartbroken mother Teresa Muñoz showed MailOnline childhood photos of her daughter Maria Jose, pictured above . Mrs Munoz (right) told MailOnline she feared her daughters' killer will never be brought to justice in a country where corruption is rampant . Clasping two family albums, Mrs Munoz sat with friends as she showed MailOnline childhood photos of the sisters and talked about her daughters. She said that someone had told her one of her daughters would become a model, she would have guessed Sofia because her elder daughter was always more of an extrovert while Maria Jose was more timid. But she believes that Maria Jose's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously. 'I believe that if my daughter had not been a representative of her country, her death wouldn't have brought any justice,' she said. The bodies were recovered after being found buried near a river bank close the spa where they disappeared . Jose Luis Mejia, director of the Technological University campus in Santa Barbara, where Maria studied, agreed that the deaths would not have become a national outrage if it had not been for the model's standing. 'If she had been any other girl, if she hadn't been Miss Honduras, this would have been one more crime amid the impunity of Honduras,' he said. 'They would have said what they always do: that this was the settling of accounts between drug traffickers, and they wouldn't even have bothered to investigate.' San Pedro Sula, just over 30 miles from Santa Barbara where the girls were murdered, is the murder capital of the world with more than 1,200 killings a year among its nearly one million inhabitants. Mrs Munoz said that someone had told her one of her daughters would become a model, she would have guessed Sofia because her elder daughter was always more of an extrovert while Maria Jose was more timid . Mrs Munoz tried to smile as she spoke about her two daughters,  Maria Jose (left) and Sofia (right) before warning of her fears that their killer might never be brought to justice if his family try to buy his freedom . The youngest of three sisters, Alvarado began competing in beauty pageants at age 13. She won Miss Northwest Honduras, Miss Teen Honduras and, finally, Miss Honduras, the stepping stone to the Miss World pageant. After each competition, she would come back to Santa Barbara and share the details of her experiences with friends . 'Her successes were our successes,' said schoolmate Ludin Reyes. 'We were friends and fans.' While Alvarado pursued her dream, and her oldest sister married and moved away. She was a teacher until the school where she worked closed, and in love with a married man who left his wife to be with her, before he was murdered in October 2013. Beauty queen Maria Jose Alvarado, 19, was due to compete in this year's Miss World competition in London .

The youngest of three sisters, Maria began competing in beauty pageants at age 13. She won Miss Northwest Honduras, Miss Teen Honduras and, finally, Miss Honduras, the stepping stone to the Miss World pageant . Sofia's new boyfriend Ruiz was known about town as a man to be feared from a family deeply involved in drug trafficking, officials say. Although he had no police record, he was seen as someone who could offer protection or eliminate enemies. 'This is a drug trafficking corridor,' said Lt. Col Ramon Castillo, an army officer in charge of security in Santa Barbara. 'David Ruiz, Plutarco's brother was 'the bull' and when he was killed in February, Plutarco took his place. ... Plutarco is a violent person with a bad character and he solves everything with a pistol in his hand.' Police say Ruiz shot Sofia because she was dancing with another man. After a fierce argument, he pulled out a pistol and fired at Sofia first, then Maria as she tried to flee. Aris Maldonado (left) and Ventura Diaz (right) escorted to testify before a judge over their alleged involvement in the deaths of Maria Jose and Sofia Alvarado . General Ramon Sabillon, the National Police director, said  Ruiz had confessed to the killings on Tuesday and led authorities to the bodies in a mountainous area in Santa Barbara. It is a mystery to Maria's friends why she went with her sister to the rundown 'spa,' or riverfront restaurant, that was believed to be a place that Ruiz used to conduct illegal business. But Alvarado looked up to her big sister and, after baking a cake together, apparently wanted to join Sofia to celebrate Ruiz's birthday on November 13. The day after the party, Ruiz told the sisters's family the women had left the with someone else, and he invited them for lunch. Later, he even went with them to file a missing persons report with police. Maria's body, wrapped in brown plastic, was loaded into the back of a pickup truck just hours before she was to have boarded a flight to London to compete in the Miss World pageant. A winner will be crowned on December 14.","Plutarco Antonio Ruiz is detained for killing Maria Jose and Sofia Alvarado .

"Wearing heat-proof suits and masks to deal with the toxic fumes, researchers gather molten rock from the top of the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii. Researchers are working to understand . an eruption that destroyed the town of Kalapana more than 20 years ago, hoping that their studies will . allow other settlements to be better prepared in the future. Between 7 May and 5 September 1990, the fishing village of Kalapana was slowly encased in molten rock, which burned everything in its path. Today, a No Parking sign is virtually all that remains of the historic settlement. The Kilauea volcano in Hawaii has been constantly erupting since 1983 and in 2010 swallowed the nearby town of Kalapana, encasing it in molten rock . Scientists are now taking lava samples from the top of the volcano (left) in order to help them predict future eruptions and stop any more towns being destroyed. A 'No Parking' sign (right) is virtually all that remains of Kalapana, though luckily nobody was killed in the eruption . The 'shield' volcano, so called because it resembles a knight's shield, is 4,000ft high and has been constantly erupting since 1983 . In these pictures researchers work on the top of the 4,000ft Kilauea volcano. The shots were taken by local photographer G. Brad Lewis, 56, who said: 'Erupting volcanoes have always fascinated me. 'But to be able to get so close and personal to Kilauea Volcano has been a real treat. As a photographer, nothing is more exciting than photographing the many aspects of an erupting volcano. 'I get within inches of the hot lava, at times, depending on which way the wind is blowing. But like any living thing, I am limited by how much heat I can handle.' As these pictures from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii show, almost nothing remains of the town of Kalapana except for signposts and fire-hydrants. The volcano is also a tourist destination, with people travelling to watch the spectacular views as lava flows into the ocean and sends plumes of steam into the air . Between the 7 May and 5 September 1990, lava swept through the town, burning everything in its path, although luckily nobody was killed . Scientists take a sample of lava from inside a 'lava tube' (left), a molten flow of lava encased within solidified rock. Right, molten rock flows from the volcano . Luckily no residents were killed when the town was swallowed by the river of molten rock which stuck in 1986 and again in July 2010. Now scientists are taking samples from the volcanoes to work out when and where they might strike in order to protect other towns and save lives. To do this they must don suits similar to those worn by fire-fighters and capable of withstanding heat of up to 350C (662F). 'Taking lava samples is important for the scientists to understand the nature of the lava and to predict future flows,' said Brad. 'The more personal they get with the volcano, the better they can understand the many aspects of an eruption.' Photographer G Brad Lewis, 56, captured the scientists at work. He said in order to work in such intense heat he has to wear shoes with soles stitched rather than glued on, otherwise the glue would melt .

The Halema'uma'u vent at the top of the crater, and the Pu'u O'o vent (part of which is pictured) are the only two active vents . Kilauea Volcano is a shield volcano so called as its shape resembles a warrior’s shield. It is primarily made up of fluid lava flows and has been constantly erupting since 1983. 'There are many dangers on the volcano,' said Brad. 'I always wear protective clothing and carry a respirator designed specifically for volcanic fumes. 'I wear boots with the soles sewn on, not glued, or they would melt off. A good compass, GPS, and rain gear are also critical. White-outs are common on the lava fields. 'Seeing molten lava for the first time is an amazing experience, and very humbling. I love to watch people seeing the volcano for the first time – they are in sheer awe.'","Kilauea volcano in Hawaii's Volcanoes National Park has been constantly erupting since 1983 .
In 1990 a new lava flow destroyed the historic fishing village of Kalapana, encasing it in rock .
Scientists are now studying the volcano by taking samples of 1,200C lava from the active vents .
The hope is that study will help predict future eruptions and stop other towns being destroyed ."

"A former mob hitman is coming forward once again to say that he is the man who killed President John F. Kennedy. James Files says that he was the man on the grassy knoll back on November 22, 1963, and that he fired the bullet into Pres. Kennedy's head that ultimately killed him. He says the other shot that hit Pres. Kennedy came from his boss, Charles 'Chuckie' Nicoletti, who was hiding out in the book depository, the same place Lee Harvey Oswald is believed to have been at the time of the shooting. Scroll down for videos . Confession: James Files (above) says he is the man who assassinated Pres. John F. Kennedy . New claim, again: Files has claimed before that he was in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963, firing the shot that ended the life of Pres. Kennedy as he drove through on his motorcade (above) Location: Files says he took his shot from the infamous grassy knoll (seen in the background above) Files also says that Oswald, who was charged, but then shot dead before he could be tried or convicted in the killing, never filed a single shot. He described what happened in a new documentary that aired on Newsmax TV, I Killed JFK. He says he chose the grassy knoll so he could pretend to be a worker at a nearby rail yard, and come and go without being noticed. Then, as Pres. Kennedy's motorcade approached, he sprung into action. 'I was aiming at his right eye. When I pulled the trigger it was almost like looking from six feet away through the scope,' he explains. 'As I squeezed his head moved forward. I missed and got it right along the temple, right behind the eye. I squeezed off my round. I hit him and blew his head backward. I fired one shot and one shot only.' He then walked off with no one noticing, not even the two police officers he claims were standing 25 feet away. Hideout: Files also claims his boss, Charles “Chuckie” Nicoletti, was in the nearby book depository (above), and not Lee Harvey Oswald . Convicted: In the end, Oswald (above) was charged with the murder . He did however leave a trinket, biting down on the shell casing that came from his gun. The documentary claims that casing matches one a young boy and his father found buried in the knoll over 20 years later. At least one former FBI agent, Zack Shelton, believes Files story, including the location from which he shot Pres. Kennedy. 'I have tried to verify Files' story. A lot of that story I have been able to verify,' says Shleton. Five government investigations since the assassination have determined it was Oswald who shot Pres. Kennedy. Files, who has told this story many times before, including in a 2010 interview with Playboy, is currently serving a 50 years sentence following a 1991 conviction for the attempted murder of two police officers during a roadside shootout.","James Files claims in the documentary I Killed JFK that he was the man who killed President John F.

"Security forces in Delhi have been placed on high alert after receiving warnings of a possible terrorist attack on the metro system. Security has been doubled across crowded areas of the underground rail network with passengers being frisked on entry and their baggage searched. The Islamic Terrorist group Indian Mujahideen is understood to have threatened a Mumbai-style attack some time during the first 10 days of 2014. Threat: Indian Military intelligence has received warnings of a terror attack on the  Delhi underground rail network . All passengers on the Delhi Metro network are being frisked and their baggage searched, authorities say . On November 26, 2008 12 gunmen went on a shooting and bombing spree across Mumbai which left 166 people dead. Foreign travellers are being advised to remain vigilant and comply with the demands of local authorities. A gunman walks through a Mumbai railway station during the attacks of 2008. A terror group has threatened to conduct a similar attack in Delhi sometime . India's Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has been increasing the working hours of its 5,000 staff working across Delhi's 140 Metro stations. A spokesman told the Hindustan Times: 'We have personnel working in three shifts. Their eight-hour shifts have been increased to 10 hours so that we have more hands at any given point. 'The alert talks about the possibility of a Mumbai-type attack on Delhi Metro. 'We are concentrating mainly on the outside security because it is impossible for someone to carry a weapon beyond the check-point. 'We already have 100 per cent frisking and baggage screening in place. Now, the guards have been asked to pat down suspicious passengers'. An additional threat has been received of a possible hijack attempt at Delhi Airport. It is believed the Indian Mujahideen may be trying to secure the release of its leader Yasin Bhatkal who was arrested in August 2013. Extra Quick Reaction Teams (QRTs), bomb disposal experts and dog teams have been placed on standby with security increased at the most busy stations including Ashok Park Main, Inderlok, Kirti Nagar, Rajiv Chowk, Kashmere Gate and Central Secretariat. Over two million passengers use the Delhi Metro every day.

"Four entertainers could face the sack after photos emerged of them re-enacting a Jihadi execution at a children's summer camp in France. The leaders at the retreat on the island of Groix, off southern Brittany, took 18 pictures while acting out executions similar to those carried out by the Islamic State terror group. It is unclear whether any of the children at the camp - suitable for those aged between eight and 12 - watched the incident. Camp mentors at a summer retreat for kids in Groix, France, are pictured acting out an execution scenario . In one image shows one of the men kneeling on the floor, holding a newspaper, with his head covered. One of the four men is holding what looks to be a knife to his neck while another holds what appears to be a gun to his head. In another image, a child is reportedly shown watching the gruesome charade. The children's camp is owned by the northwestern Paris commune of Colombes. Mayor Nicole Goueta found the images on a USB stick while preparing a presentation on summer holidays run by her region. Goueta has made an official complaint to police with regard to the images and the four leaders have been suspended from duty with further disciplinary proceedings expected. Mayor of the commune of Colombes, Nicole Goueta, who found the images on a USB stick . 'We were preparing an exhibition with pictures of summer camp vacations organised by the city in August on the island of Groix,'  Goueta told Le Parisien. 'They gave us a USB key with these pictures in which they simulate acts of torture and barbarism. There are 18. 'On one of them, we see a child in the corner, sitting on the ground, with a terrified look. But we only see the foot of a facilitator.' Goueta confirms the photos were taken during a camp that was held from August 4 to 21 for 45 children. The summer camp on the island of Groix, off the coast of Brittany, is run by the Paris commune of Colombes . 'I hope that the children were absent at the time of the photos,' she said. 'But its leaders, educators ... it is to them that Colombians entrust their children. This is an unacceptable attitude.' One of the men is said to have been the 33-year-old deputy director of the camp while the other three were temporary employees aged 22 and 23. 'The mere existence of these photos requires me to act decisively,' Goueta said. 'Given the international context, it will return to the police and justice whether these managers are open to the theories of radical Islam.'","Camp leaders on the island of Groix seen in photos acting out executions .

"Jose Mourinho expressed outrage at Ashley Barnes' tackle on midfielder Nemanja Matic, calling the studs-up challenge during Chelsea's draw with Burnley potentially career-ending and 'criminal'. Burnley's Barnes escaped a red card from referee Martin Atkinson during the 1-1 draw after catching Matic on the left shin with his studs before Matic was sent off for his angry reaction. Mourinho, speaking on Goals on Sunday at his own request, said Barnes should have been sent off for the tackle and another one on Branislav Ivanovic and that a ban of six weeks would be fair. Nemanja Matic reacts angrily after being sent off for his reaction to a tough challenge from Ashley Barnes . This studs-up tackle from Barnes infuriated Matic and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho backed up his player . Mourinho described the tackle as 'criminal' during his appearance on Goals on Sunday on Sky Sports . 'What happened yesterday was similar to what happened with [Eden] Hazard at Stoke,' said Mourinho. This one yesterday is even worse because this can be end of career. This is end of career. I have to say this is end of career. Matic is a very lucky guy. This is end of career.' The Portuguese claimed his players, especially volatile striker Diego Costa, are unfairly treated by officials during a 27-minute rant on the highlights show and defended Matic's reaction to the tackle in which he pushed Barnes to the ground. 'I cannot find the words to describe what that player did. I can clearly understand football is about emotions and sometimes you lose the emotions. Clearly Matic had a reason to lose his emotions,' he said. 'What could be the consequence of Matic's push? For the other player, nothing. One second later, he stands and goes. The consequence for Matic could be end of career.' He said the tackle was 'criminal', referencing Sky Sports' labelling of offences by Costa as 'crimes'. Atkinson shows the red card to Matic after the Serbian pushed Barnes over in retaliation to the tackle . Jose Mourinho appears on Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday after Chelsea's controversial draw with Burnley . 'When you say Diego crimes you cannot say a harsh tackle [for Barnes]. You have to say a criminal tackle,' Mourinho raged. 'You say Diego crimes because of a situation he put his boot on a hand. When this is Diego crimes, the minimum you have to say is [Barnes' tackle was a] criminal tackle.' Mourinho then speculated as to what punishment, if any, awaits Barnes. 'When Diego Costa had three matches banned, tell me how many this player [Barnes] deserves? Probably three matches to Matic. How many matches you think this player deserves? Mr Atkinson did not see anything. This is about footage, and analyse. I ask if Matic is going to get a three-match ban, if Diego got three matches, how many matches this player gets? I'm asking you. I'm asking the people at home. 'Yesterday I asked a couple of friends that were having dinner with me and my family at my house. You know what they were saying?

"Assassination claim: Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat died of thromboccytopenia . At first they thought it must have been something he’d eaten. About two hours after having supper, at 11.30pm on the evening of October 11, 2004, Yasser Arafat felt sick. The 75-year-old chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation vomited twice, then felt a little better. But when he awoke the next morning, he felt worse. A doctor diagnosed viral gastroenteritis, and the Palestinian leader was given medicine. By that evening he seemed to be responding well, and a report later stated he ‘continued with his usual activities’ at his compound in Ramallah on the West Bank. Over the next few days Arafat’s condition stabilised, but did not improve. Medical staff were baffled, and it was only when Tunisian doctors were summoned, nearly two weeks after he fell ill, that the real cause of Arafat’s illness was diagnosed: thrombocytopenia — a reduced number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are a key part of the clotting system, and a low count can lead to spontaneous internal bleeding. Bone marrow samples were taken and, as he deteriorated further, Arafat was flown to the Percy Military Hospital in Paris. On November 3, he fell into a coma, and in the early hours of November 11 he died of internal bleeding in the brain. For nearly a decade, the true cause of death of a man regarded by some as the world’s most evil terrorist has remained a mystery, amid accusations from his family and supporters that he was poisoned. This week, however, the world came a step closer to finding out the truth. Two years ago, Arafat’s widow and daughter demanded a French judicial inquiry into his death. Since then Swiss scientists have investigated his belongings for traces of poison. Polonium-210, a toxic radioactive material, was found on the PLO leader's toothbrush, claim scientists. File picture . And they have announced the results in the medical journal The Lancet: they found traces of a highly toxic radioactive material, polonium-210, on his headwear, underpants and toothbrush. In the article, coyly titled ‘Improving forensic investigation for polonium poisoning’, the team say they took samples of blood, sweat and urine from Arafat’s clothes and found they contained significantly higher than expected levels of polonium-210. ‘These findings support the possibility of Arafat’s poisoning with polonium-210,’ the report baldly states. It is a conclusion that tallies with another investigation of Arafat’s belongings, which was published in May last year. The authors of both reports stress that their findings are not definitive, but they certainly point to an assassination. Palestinian children sit next to candles and a mock coffin for the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat during a ceremony marking the third anniversary of his death . For a start, Arafat’s symptoms were almost identical to those of a 43-year-old Russian admitted to University College Hospital, London, in November 2006, suffering from a mysterious illness. He died on November 22 that year. That man was a former Russian intelligence agent called Alexander Litvinenko. A post-mortem examination revealed he had been poisoned by polonium-210. Did the Palestinian leader suffer the same fate? And if so, who were the killers? To most people the answer seems obvious — Israel, or to be specific, the Israeli Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations, better known as Mossad. Certainly the organisation does not shy away from ‘dirty tricks’ including kidnapping and assassination. Killing Arafat would have been well within its remit. In 2010 two car bomb blasts killed one Iranian nuclear scientist and wounded another in Tehran. Many believe Mossad was behind the blast . After all, Arafat conducted a terror campaign against Israel and the West for decades, and groups under his direct or indirect command were responsible for hundreds of bombing, hijackings, assassinations and other attacks. Since it was founded in December 1949, Mossad has earned an almost mythic notoriety. One of its earliest successes was the abduction of Adolf Eichmann — the Architect of the Final Solution — from a street in Buenos Aires in 1960. According to one account, the ultra-secret agency within the organisation that carries out assassinations is appropriately called the Kidon ¿ bayonet . While Eichmann was taken to Israel to face a trial and execution, other Nazi war criminals were dispatched with less due process. In 1965, a 64-year-old Latvian called Herberts Cukurs was lured into a small house in Montevideo, Uruguay, by a portly, balding man calling himself Anton Kunzle. As Cukurs stepped into the hall he was leapt upon by a Mossad team and killed with two bullets to the brain. His body was packed into a trunk with a note that identified his killers as ‘Those Who Will Never Forget’. The hit had been carried out in revenge for the murder of Jews by Cukurs in Riga during the war. Mossad has a long memory and its revenge is brutally efficient, as witnessed in Operation Wrath of God, its response to the 1972 massacre of 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team by Palestinian terrorists. The operation lasted for two decades and involved a worldwide series of shootings and bombings. All the assassinations were meticulously planned. While some were straightforward shootings, others, such as the killing of Mahmoud Hamshari, the PLO’s man in France, were more complicated. Towards the end of 1972, a Mossad team placed a bomb under a phone on Mahmoud’s desk. An agent pretending to be a journalist rang up. When Mahmoud answered, the Israelis detonated the bomb with an electronic signal down the phone line. According to one account, the ultra-secret agency within the organisation that carries out assassinations is appropriately called the Kidon — bayonet. In 1997, the Kidon was supposedly behind the botched attempt to assassinate Khaled Meshaal, the leader of Hamas. Opponents: An Israeli soldier fires a tear gas canister at Palestinians throwing stones during a military operation in the West Bank . The plan involved spraying a poison developed at Israel’s top secret Nes Tziona biological institute into the ear of the terrorist leader while he was in Jordan. The attempt, on September 25, 1997, was a fiasco. Though agents managed to spray the poison into their target’s ear, two of them were arrested almost immediately. The Jordanians were furious and insisted that Israel supply an antidote to save Khaled’s life. Such failures are rare for the Kidon, though. Its most recent spectacular assassination was the killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a senior Hamas commander found dead in Dubai in January 2010. It quickly became apparent that his death was not natural, and that it was a Mossad hit. To the fascination of the world, authorities in Dubai  released images of the faked passports of the killers, who were posing as tourists from countries including Britain and the U.S. Today, one of the riskiest jobs in the world is being an Iranian nuclear scientist. On January 11, 2011, Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, deputy head of the Natanz uranium enrichment plant, was blown up in his car by a magnetic bomb as he drove to work. His death followed those of three other scientists in 2010. At the beginning of this month, when Mojtaba Ahmadi, of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ cyber warfare unit, was gunned down by black-clad gunmen on motorcycles near his home in Karaj, northwest of Tehran, Mossad was top of the list of suspects. But the question remains: was Mossad responsible for Arafat’s death? Clearly, the Israelis had the ability to kill him and, as he was a sponsor of terrorism against them, they had tried before. In 1985 the Israeli air force attacked a PLO base in Tunis, admitting it had targeted the building where Arafat had offices. Arafat survived because he was out jogging. In 2003, the year before the PLO leader died, his security adviser Hani al-Hassan claimed that his boss had survived no fewer than 13 assassination attempts, including a package of anthrax that was sent to him in May that year. Attempts on Arafat’s life had started in the Sixties. In December 1967 he narrowly escaped being killed at his villa in Ramallah. Hearing Israeli voices, he leapt from the second floor and hid in a parked car. On another occasion, in Beirut, Israeli snipers were said to have had Arafat in their sights, only for the hit to be aborted on the orders of General Ariel Sharon. So Israel has form on Arafat and, as a nuclear power, it was able to acquire polonium-210. Could one of its agents have applied a lethal dose to Arafat’s toothbrush, so it was absorbed through the gums? It sounds far-fetched ... but so does spraying poison in an enemy’s ear. The case is still far from clear-cut. After all, Arafat was considered a spent force by 2004 — so what had Israel to gain by assassinating him? Some suspect that the trace levels of polonium-210 were so high they might have been planted by Palestinians to frame the Israelis. We must wait a little longer and see what tissue samples from Arafat’s disinterred body tell us. But even if turns out that Mossad did not kill him, we can be sure the Kidon will continue taking scalps for many more years to come.","The 75-year-old died of a blood condition in 2004 aged 75 .

"Oxford University: Places come from the top five comprehensives . Five elite British schools are sending more pupils to Oxford and Cambridge than all of the country's 2000 comprehensives and colleges combined, a study has revealed. Four prestigious private schools and only one state school produced 946 Oxford and Cambridge entrants over three years. At the same time the 2,000 worst-performing state schools, two thirds of the national total, produced only 927 Oxbridge students. The leading fee-paying schools, which charge around £30,000 a year, are Eton, Westminster, St Paul’s School and St Paul’s Girls School. The only state school to make the grade, Hills Road college, is based in the heart of Cambridge and caters for the children of leading academics and scientists based in the university city. The startling figures were disclosed in the first study of its kind by the Sutton Trust, an education charity which analysed the onward education destinations of 750,000 school leavers. The data also shows that grammar schools fare very well when it comes to university places. On average, grammars sent 65 per cent of their pupils to the top 30 institutions, compared with only 28 per cent for comprehensives. The 100 elite schools – 3 per cent of the national total – accounted for 32 per cent of admissions to Oxbridge. Only 12 council areas sent more than 2 per cent of A-level candidates to Oxbridge – and all but one of these were in the south-east of England. The exception was Trafford in Greater Manchester. The findings highlight the extent to . which the choice of school dictates the life chances of youngsters and . the Coalition said the report showed Labour had failed young people. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said: ‘This report is a damning indictment of Labour’s failure to improve social mobility. ‘Despite all their promises, they . left hundreds of thousands of children with little to no chance of . getting to the best universities. Cambridge students: Four prestigious private schools and one state school produced 946 Oxford and Cambridge entrants over three years . ‘We are tackling these inequalities by increasing the number of good schools and targeting funding at the poorest pupils.’ The Sutton Trust figures show that Westminster, attended by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, sent the most pupils to Oxbridge between 2007 and 2009 – 235. Next was Eton with 211, followed by Hills Road with 204, St Paul’s School with 167 – a staggering 46 per cent of its pupils – and St Paul’s Girls School with 129. The grammar sending the largest proportion of students to Oxbridge was Queen Elizabeth’s in Barnet, North London. Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said schools would try harder to raise standards if they were made to publish data showing the destinations of their leavers. Brian Lightman, of headteachers’ union ASCL, suggested poor pupils were put off applying to Oxbridge. ‘Regardless of ability level, students from more disadvantaged backgrounds will sometimes find Oxford and Cambridge a foreign and intimidating world,’ he said. Meanwhile, almost 200,000 youngsters have been denied university entry after a record surge in applications. A total of 669,956 youngsters chased the 479,000 places available in the final year before tuition fees rise up to a maximum £9,000. Students without offers will have to scramble for places through clearing when their  A-level results are published next month. But opportunities are expected to be limited because few students will take a gap year ahead of the fees rise.

"The Prince of Wales presented rock star Cerys Matthews with her MBE today - and congratulated her in Welsh. Charles bestowed the honour on the 45-year-old singer during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace, and took the opportunity to demonstrate the language he learned before his investiture as Prince of Wales. 'He said congratulations in Welsh, which is a tough word - llongyfarchiadau,' Matthews after the investiture. Llongyfarchiadau! Prince Charles offered his congratulations in Welsh as he made Miss Matthews an MBE . 'I recently was invited to one of his and Camilla's evenings in the Llwynywermod, where he has a house. 'It's a very magical part of the world and it sort of makes sense that he's got a place there because of his interest in botany and the natural sciences, so we talked about that.' Matthews, who was born in Cardiff and raised in Swansea, is best known as the lead singer of pop band Catatonia, but feels just as at home humming along to centuries-old folk tunes. 'I've been a collector of songs since I was a child,' she said. 'Early jazz, country blues, Spanish songs, Catalan songs, Welsh, Irish - I think you find so much about humans and their history, the story of man, in a beautiful two-minute song. Proud: Miss Matthews told of Charles' language skills as she posed for photographers after the event . Friends: Miss Matthews also said she is a regular visitor to Prince Charles' Welsh residence . 'Quite often songs travel way further than we can ever travel, and they can outlive us all. There's one I'm thinking of - Who's Going To Show Your Pretty Little Feet ... it started off life as a Scottish song about a girl getting pregnant by the lord, and him not marrying her, her being ostracised. Her baby and her die of exposure. 'But the song goes over the sea, with the migrants from Scotland, to Appalachia, where it's picked up by people like Woody Guthrie and it becomes 'The longest train I ever did see was 100 coaches long, and the only woman I ever did love was on that train and gone'. 'From one tragic story of class divide, essentially, it becomes a very American love story.' Matthews is an ambassador for the Prince's Trust, among other charities, and, since 2008, has presented a show on BBC Radio 6 Music. She wore a tailored black jacket for the occasion teamed with a black feathered hat by London milliner Jess Collett. Stylish: Miss Matthews looked wonderful for the event and wore a hat by milliner, Jess Collett . Honoured: Penelope, Viscountess Cobham was honoured with a CBE during the same ceremony .

"As she stepped off the royal train at Elgin Station yesterday, a succession of flunkies could be seen ferrying the Queen's wardrobe from the locomotive to a waiting van. Piles of garment bags and stacks of hat boxes could all be seen peeking out - and all this just for one weekend away. But as royal watchers know, the monarch, 88, has a reputation for never travelling light  and has a team of dressers to ensure that no matter what happens, the Queen will always look pristine. Experienced traveller: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh arrived in Elgin by Royal Train yesterday . In total, the Queen's wardrobe department includes 12 people whose job it is to make sure she looks great on big occasions such as yesterday's visit to RAF Lossiemouth. For that, she wore a chic lavender coat by designer Karl Ludwig and a matching hat by dresser Angela Kelly, all accessorised with one of her trademark Launer handbags. Kelly, who has been working with the Queen since 1994, is the head of the wardrobe team, which also includes three dressmakers, a milliner and four dressers, who, as their job title suggests, help the Queen get dressed as well as keeping unworn garments in pristine condition. During busy periods, such as 2012's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the team drafts in extra staff, with an additional two needed for the spate of events that accompanied the Jubilee celebrations. Doubling up: Angela Kelly, her personal assistant and curator of the royal wardrobe, ensures that a duplicate for every outfit is close to hand in case of spillage or a similar fashion disaster . Cosmetic carriers: Within her beauty bags is specially made foundation, hat-pins and lavender-scented cloth . Outfits are chosen by the Queen, with Miss Kelly , Angela makes notes of the Queen’s wishes and ideas for alterations before producing a final technical drawing from which the pattern is cut. To stop her feeling uncomfortable or getting too warm when she is on official business, the Queen insists on loose clothing. All of her clothes are made of natural fibres: 100 per cent pure cotton or wool, no linen (it creases too easily) and certainly no polyester. When she travels, Angela Kelly, her personal assistant and curator of the royal wardrobe, ensures that a duplicate for every outfit is close to hand so that if something is spilled on her clothes or there is any other mishap, Her Majesty can discreetly change into a new set without anyone knowing - which perhaps explains the two garment bags in the back of the van. If disaster does strike, the ensemble won't be sent to a dry cleaner - all clothes are hand-washed, steamed and pressed by one of her three dressers to avoid any unpleasant chemical smells. Tagged: Each of the bags bore a large yellow label marked: The Queen . Anniversary: The Queen and Prince Philip spent their 67th wedding anniversary at RAF Lossiemouth . As for cosmetics,  Angela Kelly uses a special, secret formula for the Queen’s foundation, which prevents too much shine on her face. Another royal beauty secret is a gel that keeps her hair firmly in place (even in gale-force winds) and is mischievously known among royal staff as ‘liquid concrete’. Her Majesty’s hairdresser also keeps a couple of huge hat-pins handy, just in case the ones already in place don't prove equal to the task. Incidentally, you will never see Her Majesty removing her headgear in public; she always waits until she is safely back indoors. And it isn't it just clothes and make-up in the Queen's cases. When she is travelling, the monarch is never without several cases of Malvern water - always still, never sparkling. She is jokingly said to suffer withdrawal symptoms when deprived of her bottle of Malvern.Then there’s a plentiful supply of Earl Grey tea, her favourite, which is made especially for her by Twinings. She favours a blend of China and Darjeeling, ‘delicately scented with oil of bergamot’, and drinks it with a special sweetener, which she carries herself. Arm candy: The Queen with one of her favourite Launer baggs - the brand say she takes a selection on trips . Staying hydrated: Her Majesty always travels with Earl Grey tea, left, and several cases of Malvern water . Coffee is supplied by the Savoy Hotel coffee department and is much favoured by the Duke of Edinburgh. Though she carries her own bag (which contains just a handkerchief, lipstick, a tiny mirror and a copy of the day’s programme), one of her ladies-in-waiting always has what is known as the ‘Brown Bag’. This holds all the essentials she might need in an emergency: spare pairs of tights, gloves, sweeteners and a moist, lavender-scented cloth in case of extreme heat. She also carries a hook to hang her bag on from the table, her reading glasses, mint lozenges and a collection of good luck charms given to her by her children, including miniature dogs, horses and saddles. One item the Queen does not pack is her own lavatory seat - unlike Prince Charles, who it is said takes a white leather one on every official trip. Outfits (and duplicates) Hand steamer .

"Wonderbra's 'Hello Boys' advert was the 1994 billboard that - quite literally - stopped traffic. It also aroused the ire of feminists, many of whom described it as degrading. Now the model who starred in the ad has opened up about the criticism she received at the time and said, far from being degrading, it was actually empowering. 'My Wonderbra campaign empowered women,' said Czech-born Eva, 43. 'It didn’t degrade them like some said or say. Empowered: Supermodel Eva Herzigova, the star of Wonderbra's Hello Boys campaign, maintains that it helped empower women and improve advertising for good, despite the backlash of criticism it received . Speaking to the Evening Standard, she continued: 'It was controversial at the time, sure - but it made waves and you can see its influence still today. 'It was one of the most successful advertising campaigns in history and I am so proud to be a part of it.' The advert, which was shot by Ellen von Unwerth and saw Eva posing in a black Wonderbra and pants, certainly proved controversial. Much of the controversy centred on traffic accidents, with some commuters blaming the huge roadside poster for their lack of concentration. Others claimed the racy ad was derogatory towards women, even as they flocked to buy the bra in their millions. Despite the controversy, the makers of the ad were honoured in 2011, when the billboard was declared the most eye-catching ad of the previous 20 years. Still going strong: The ad sparked a sensation when it was unveiled and was blamed for stopping traffic and causing accidents. Eva, now 41, thinks it changed advertising for the better . As for Eva, now a mother-of-three, her career is still going strong. In a recent interview with Net-a-Porter's The Edit, the supermodel discussed the longevity of her career, which has spanned more than 24 years. ‘I’ve always worked hard and picked the right work,' she said. ‘In this society, where people sell their souls on Facebook and Twitter, I don’t go out there selling myself - I am very private.’ She reflected on her career's turning point, which saw her feature in a Mario Testino and Carine Roitfeld editorial for The Face. 'For me, that shoot was a slap in the face to those who put me in the pin-up box,' she said. 'That was my jump from commercial to editorial. I could hear people gasp as they realised it was me.’ Despite her success, the fashion world almost lost her to Hollywood. 'After doing a few films, I went to LA looking for an agent – and it was just pathetic. 'I met people who said, ""Yes, we can talk about the movie over dinner."" I was like, ""What dinner? I can just read the script here."" Having been exposed to the sleazier side of Hollywood, Herzigova gave up her acting dream and returned to modelling full time - and became a mother. 'I never saw myself as a mum,' she admits. 'There are girls who grow up thinking of marriage and babies, but I never wanted that. But now it is everything to me. ‘When I had the first [baby], I wondered why I waited so long, but it was timing – I never had the right man before.’ Longevity: Eva says she has always worked hard and picked the right work but doesn't like to 'go out selling herself' and prefers to remain private .","Eva, 41, was star of Wonderbra's Hello Boys advert in 1994 .

"Climate change skeptics have branded protesters who marched through Manhattan on Sunday as hypocrites for leaving litter strewn across the city. New Yorkers uploaded images to social media sites showing piles of trash - included ditched paper and cardboard signs - left behind after thousands took part in the People's Climate March. 'Their love for the Earth is so real, they couldn't even use a trash can,' one critic, known as @chelsea_elisa on Twitter, wrote beneath an image of an overflowing trash can. 'Somehow this doesn't seem too green 2me,' David Kreutzer, a research fellow at the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, wrote alongside another photo of litter on the ground. Scroll down for videos . Trash: Climate change protesters who marched through the streets of Manhattan on Sunday have been branded hypocrites for leaving over-flowing trash cans in their wake. This image was shared on Twitter . Disrespectful: Trash can be seen littering the route following the climate change march on Sunday . How green? Other protesters came under fire for using paper or cardboard signs at Sunday's protest . Speaking to the New York Post, Kreutzer slammed the marchers for wasting paper to create the signs, as well as burning fossil fuels to take buses or planes to the event. 'The hypocrisy varies from person to person,' he said. 'The ones that fly in on private jets are the most hypocritical.' Celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo, were seen parading through the streets of New York City - presumably after catching flights to be there. They joined as many as 300,000 others - including United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and U.S. senators - to march through the streets. Thoughtless: Another Twitter user shared this image, claiming it captured trash following the march . Anger: As well as leaving garbage behind, some took buses or flew across the country to join the event . Calling for change: At least these protesters remembered to recycle their signs along the route . Ignored: Costumes, protest materials and plastic bottles can be seen strewn along the route in Manhattan . Environmentally friendly? A large plastic Starbucks container can be seen left behind on a post . The protest came ahead of Tuesday's UN-hosted summit to discuss reducing carbon emissions that threaten the environment. Organizers said some 550 busloads had arrived for the rally, which followed similar events in 166 countries including Britain, France, Afghanistan and Bulgaria. The march snaked through Midtown from Columbus Circle to Times Square and the Far West Side. So many people attended the route that, at one point, the march came to a halt because the entire 2.2-mile route was full. Debris: The protesters had been held before a UN-led meeting to discuss reducing carbon emissions . Clear up: More than 300,000 people marched along the 2.2 mile route of the protest on Sunday . Mess: Plastic cups and card is left behind in Midtown following the march, according to one Twitter user . Protesters in London, pictured, also bizarrely chose to make hundreds of signs from paper and cardboard . They billed the event as the largest gathering focused on climate change since 2009, when tens of thousands gathered in Copenhagen in a sometime raucous demonstration that resulted in the detention of 2,000 protesters. In this year's march, protesters carried pictures of sunflowers and, at the rally's head, a banner reading: 'Front lines of crisis, forefront of climate change'.

"Pop-rocker Richard Marx has listed his Chicago mansion for sale at a record $18 million as he finalizes his divorce from wife of 25 years, Dirty Dancing actress Cynthia Rhodes. Split: Richard Marx and his actress wife Cynthia Rhodes (seen here in 1994) confirmed their divorce in April. They are now selling their marital home . The couple - who have three adult sons, Brandon, 23, Lucas, 21, and Jesse, 20 - announced their split in April, but have been separated since July last year. Their marital home is a sprawling nine-bedroom estate on Lake Michigan in Lake Bluff that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its design and history. Marx and Rhodes purchased the three-story house for $4.7 million in 1997 when their children were young. The 51-year-old singer, whose career has been built on love ballads like Right Here Now, said he has not spoken to anyone about what lead to the breakdown of his marriage - and intends to keep it that way. 'I wouldn't discuss that with even some of my close friends,' he told People. 'It's really nobody's business. 'What I will say is that I had the great fortune and blessing to not only be married to Cynthia for all those years, but to just share her company. 'There's not a finer human being. 'I'm very grateful that we were together, had three amazing sons and I can't say enough about what an amazing person she is and how lucky I was to share that time with her.' Marx also denied that his new album, Beautiful Goodbye, was penned in the wake of the breakup. 'It has been a painful time,' he told the magazine. 'But I don't necessarily want to bury myself in songs about it, frankly, out of respect. 'I have nothing but love and respect for my ex-wife and I don't really want to delve into that in songwriting so much. 'Not to say that I never will, but I didn't feel like that's where I wanted to write from. 'I wanted to write from a more positive, inspired, hopeful place.' With the price tag set at $18 million, Marx's waterfront abode comes in at number four for the most expensive properties ever listed in the Chicago area, according to The Chicago Tribune. In addition to the nine bedrooms, there are eight bathrooms, a home theater,  and a 8,000-square-foot recording studio attached to the house.

"The smell of books that lingers in second-hand book stores is distinctive, but it is hard to know exactly what creates the nostalgic aroma. Now one British chemistry teacher has created an infographic to explain how and why the scent of antique and new books differ. Old books have a sweet smell with notes of vanilla flowers and almonds, caused by the breakdown of chemical compounds in the paper, while new books smell like they do because of chemicals used in their manufacture. One British chemistry teacher has created an infographic to explain the scent of antique and new books. The anonymous blogger started publishing his infographics six months ago after creating some posters to brighten up his classroom and hopes to explain the chemistry of everyday substances. 'Old book smell' is generated by the breakdown of cellulose and lignin in paper, which produces organic compounds. Benzaldehyde adds an almond-like scent, vanillin smells of vanilla and ethyl hexanol has a ‘slightly floral’ scent. Ethyl benzene and toluene, which are also produced give off impart odours. These volatile organic compounds are created by reactions known as ‘acid hydrolysis’ and  together make up the smell of old books along with other alcohols produced by the reactions. No-one is sure of exactly which chemical compounds contribute to 'new book smell'. The scent differs from book to book as different chemicals are used in the making of different volumes. It is thought the smell derives from three main sources: The paper, inks used to print the book and the adhesives used in book binding. The anonymous blogger said the chemical breakdown of compounds within paper leads to the production of ‘old book smell’. Paper contains cellulose and small amounts of lignin - a complex polymer of aromatic alcohols – and finer papers contain less lignin than cheaper material like newsprint. Lignin is what makes paper yellow with age because oxidation reactions cause it to break down into acids, which then help break down cellulose, he explained in the Compound Interest blog. The smell of old books comes from chemical degradation and a number of compounds have been pinpointed. Benzaldehyde adds an almond-like scent, . vanillin smells of vanilla and ethyl hexanol has a ‘slightly floral’ scent. Ethyl benzene and toluene, which are also produced give off sweet . odours. Old books (stock image) have a sweet smell with notes of vanilla flowers and almonds, caused by the breakdown of chemical compounds in the paper, while new books smell how they do because of chemicals used in their manufacture . These volatile organic compounds are created by reactions known as ‘acid hydrolysis’ and together make up the smell of old books along with other alcohols produced by the reactions. Some compounds such as furfural are useful to determine the damage to antique volumes. It can be used to date tomes as well as to determine their composition. Books published after the mid-1800s emit more furfal than older volumes which are composed of cotton or linen paper. The anonymous blogger said that it is difficult to pinpoint specific compounds found in new books, mainly because the chemicals used to manufacture books vary, meaning the smell differs between literary works. ‘Add to this the fact that there are literally hundreds of compounds involved and it becomes clearer why it evades attribution to a small selection of chemicals,’ he wrote. Benzaldehyde adds an almond-like scent, vanillin smells of vanilla and ethyl hexanol has a 'slightly floral' scent. Ethyl benzene and toluene, which are also produced give off sweet odours . It is thought that ‘new book smell’ derives from three main sources: the paper, inks used to print the book and the adhesives used in book binding. Lots of chemicals are used to make paper, which is largely manufactured from wood pulp. Chemicals such as sodium hydroxide – which is often known as caustic soda – can be added to decrease the acidity and cause fibres in the pulp to swell. The fibres are bleached with a mixture of other chemicals including hydrogen peroxide and are mixed with water, which itself contains additives. Some of these chemicals react and release volatile organic compounds into the air, which create the distinctive smell that varies from book to book depending on the adhesives, ink and paper used.","Old books have a sweet smell with notes of vanilla flowers and almonds, caused by the breakdown of chemical compounds in the paper .

She was rebuked by businesswoman Rachel Bull, a descendant of Polish grandparents, who said services were at ‘breaking point’. London had the most people using a foreign tongue. This graph shows the top five most reported main languages other than English (or Welsh in Wales) The new Census data revealed 100 different languages spoken across the country, from the well-known to the almost forgotten. Just 33 people gave their main language as Manx Gaelic, the ancient language of the Isle of Man which was officially recored as extinct in 1974. Elsewhere 58 people said Scottish Gaelic, 557 people said Cornish, 510 said Caribbean Creole and 461 listed gypsy/traveller languages.

"Gordon Ramsay, pictured today at the High Court with his wife Tana, has denied lying about his father 'forging' his signature on a rental agreement . Gordon Ramsay has insisted he is not lying about his signature being 'forged' on a £640,000-a-year rental agreement for a  lease on his London restaurant. The celebrity chef is embroiled in a High Court battle over claims his father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson used a ghost writer machine to forge his signature on a 25-year contract for the York & Albany pub near Regent's Park. Mr Ramsay claims the machine - which electronically replicates a signature using a fountain or ballpoint pen - was used without his consent. He is now asking Chancery Division judge Mr Justice Morgan to grant him a declaration that the rental guarantee, signed in 2007, is not binding. But film director Gary Love, who owns the York & Albany, has described Ramsay's allegation as an 'absurd' attempt to wriggle out of his rental commitments. Today, during cross-examination on the second day of the case, Mr Ramsay denied lying about the nature of the allegedly forged signature, telling the court that his 'deep and extensive trust in Hutcheson was entirely misplaced'. Mr Hutcheson - the father of Mr Ramsay's wife Tana - was previously at the helm of Gordon Ramsay Holdings but left in 2010 after being accused of plundering £1m from company accounts. Mr Hutcheson always denied to comment and said he would 'respond through the legal process’. Following a lengthy legal dispute, he was reportedly given around £2million in a settlement and severed ties with the company. In court today, Romie Tager QC, who cross-examined Ramsay on Mr Love's behalf, suggested to the chef that he was not telling the truth. He claims Mr Ramsay knew about Mr Hutcheson using the ghost writer to sign business documents long before the York & Albany deal. Mr Tager said to him: 'When you expressed great displeasure about the signature being forged on documents, that is all manufactured. 'The fact is you didn't care whether the machine was used to write the signature and you don't really care today.' But Mr Ramsay replied: 'That is untrue. I brought this case to court because of the shock and unhappiness of being somewhat stitched on a guarantee my wife and I not were not a party to.' The chef is in a dispute with Gary Love (left) who says that Mr Ramsay's claims about his father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson (right) forging his signatures are 'absurd' Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH) won a bidding war in 2007 to secure the 160-year-old York & Albany building in the exclusive area of  north London. At the time, Mr Hucheoson was CEO of the company. It has since been turned  into an upmarket restaurant, bar and hotel, with rooms starting at £150. The chef said in a written statement that the lease was not binding on him personally but on Gordon Ramsay Holdings Ltd (GRHL) and on Gordon Ramsay Holdings International Ltd (GRHI). Mr Ramsay said it would have been 'unthinkable' to enter into a personal guarantee for each of the many restaurants he opened. Christopher Hutcheson, left, is accused of using the Ghost Writer machine to forge his son-in-law's signature on 'various contracts' while at the helm of Gordon Ramsay Holdings. He left the business in 2010 . Following their dispute in 2010, Mrs Ramsay (left) is thought to have severed ties with her father (pictured right with her mother, Greta) He said that would entirely defeat the purpose of running each of them through separate corporate vehicles. He added that the York & Albany was not a business venture he was 'personally taking forward' but that he was merely 'lending his name to help promote it and attract customers'. He said: 'I am appalled at the extent to which Chris used the Ghost Writer machine to sign documents ostensibly on my behalf in circumstances where I had no knowledge of the documents that were being 'signed' or the matters to which they referred.' In 2010 Mr Hutcheson left his position in the company amid reports that he had a 'fiery relationship' with Mr Ramsay. It was later claimed in court the former manager had breached terms of his confidentiality contract to access private emails and plunder more than £1million from the TV chef's empire. The company acquired the York and Albany in 2007 after winning a bidding war for a lease on the 160-year-old building. It is now an upmarket pub, restaurant and hotel in north west London's Regent's Park . Mr Hutcheson was accused of writing himself 'five-figure cheques', and involving Mr Ramsay's siblings-in-law in the schemes. In 2012 their dispute was settled, with Mr Ramsay's wife thought to have severed all ties with her family. The latest legal row comes as Mr Ramsay's lawyers were 'piecing back together' what remains of his business following his father-in-law's departure, the court was previously told. Giving evidence yesterday, Mr Ramsay said that between six and nine months after Mr Hutcheson was 'removed from the business' in 2010, 'it was discovered then that the lease was signed by the ghost machine'. He said it was discovered that 'there were several documents that had been forged'. Mr Hutcheson is accused of using the Ghost Writer machine to sign 'various contracts' in his son-in-law's name without his knowledge during his time at the company. The case continues.","Chef's father-in-law Chris Hutcheson left as CEO of his company in 2010 .

"A 23-year-old woman has spent an astonishing £10,000 on new clothes because she doesn't want to be seen wearing the same thing twice online. Rachael Adams from Essex, says that after being tagged on Facebook or Instagram in a new dress, she will then banish it to the back of her wardrobe. The personal assistant has admitted she's splurged a small mortgage on an array of party outfits so she can keep up appearances on social media. Scroll down for video . Rachael Addams from Essex has admitted she's splurged a small mortgage on an array of party outfits . The personal assistant has invested £10,000 into her image so she can keep up appearances on social media . 'It's social media's fault,' Rachael says. 'You know other people will notice if you wear the same thing twice and you don't want to be seen as boring. 'It would just be so embarrassing to be seen in the same dress again. I'm usually tagged in about 80 pictures after a night out so it's really obvious.' She goes out at least twice a month and buying a new outfit each time has cost her over £10,000 in six years. Rachael says: 'I notice if my friends or people on Facebook and Instagram do it and I wouldn't slag them off. But it is frowned upon.' Rachael (left), pictured with a friend on a night out, suffers from Outfit Repetition Syndrome . Rachael (right)  won't  wear the same outfit twice - and she's happy to spend £70 a pop . The party girl will happily pay up to £70 for a brand-new dress - which she will wear just once. 'If it's a birthday or special occasion I buy something a bit more special,' she admits. 'I go on at least two big nights out a month, so I need to buy two new outfits.' When Rachael was younger, she didn't feel under so much pressure. 'I wasn't too bothered, Facebook and Instagram wasn't as big when I was at high school,' she explains. But when she started going out aged 17, she felt she needed to shop for a new outfit for each new occasion. Sometimes for a spur of the moment night with the girls, she'll reluctantly wear something old. 'I really try not to do it, but if that happens, I'll ban any pictures,' Rachael says. 'All my friends are the same. 'If I do have to dig out something I've worn before I always confess because I know they'll notice.' Her boyfriend of two years, Luke Tappin, doesn't have the same problem. 'He thinks it's such a waste of money, he's got suits and blazers that he wears over and over again,' Rachael says. 'It's more of a girl thing, we're a lot more judgemental.' Her boyfriend of two years, Luke Tappin (left), doesn't have the same problem . Rachael has to clear out her bulging wardrobe three times a year, selling clothing on eBay, at boot sales and by donating to charity shops. 'If I really love something, I might keep it but I wouldn't wear it again,' she says. 'Most things I get rid of after a few months to make space for my new stuff.' She's already planning for the festive season. 'I've worked out I'll need to buy nine new outfits for girls' nights as well as work parties and family get togethers. 'For New Year's Eve and Christmas Eve, I'll definitely be spending more. It'll be about £500 in total on new clothes.' Rachael's now joined forces with Oxfam to encourage more women to donate their barely worn clothes to its charity shops. She says: 'When they've only been worn once, they're just going to waste so you can make space in your wardrobe and help charity at the same time.' He thinks it's 'such a waste of money' - he's got suits and blazers that he wears over and over again . When Rachael started going out aged 17, she felt she needed to shop for a new outfit for each new occasion . A survey carried out by Oxfam has revealed an astonishing 67 per cent of 18 to 24 year olds feel the same as Rachael. Thousands of women are suffering from so-called 'Outfit Repetition Syndrome'. Out of the 2,000 women surveyed, 46 per cent said they wouldn't wear their favourite party outfits more than five times. Women in the Midlands are the most prone to ORS, with the East and West Midlands taking the top two spots of being the most concerned about outfit repetition online. Scottish ladies meanwhile remained largely unfazed. East and West Midlands also topped the poll of women who re-use their staple party outfits the least and are the most eager to find something unique at an affordable price. A spokesperperson for Oxfam said: 'The days of the staple party dress are officially over. As social media usage increases, so does ORS.' Fee Gilfeather, of Oxfam Trading added: 'Bring in your overexposed but hardly worn party outfits to an Oxfam shop, and make your new selection from somebody else's pre-loved style. 'It's the low-cost, feel good way to create a unique party look. Then you can be the star of the ball, as well as the social media wall!'

"A 33-year-old New York man has been charged with manslaughter over the beating death of his wife's grandson. Poseidon Quinones, 3, was killed by blunt trauma to the torso after being found unresponsive in his bed early Saturday morning in the Bronx. The little boy lived with his paternal grandmother, Madeline Yensi, 46, in an apartment on 163rd St in Southview and had bruises on his head and all over his body. On Thursday Fernando Yensi, Mrs Yensi's husband, was arrested and charged with Poseidon's death, according to NBC New York, however the full details of what happened to the toddler have not been released. Beaten to death: Poseidon Quinones, 3, was killed by blunt trauma to the torso after being found unresponsive in his bed at his grandmother's apartment in the Bronx on Saturday morning . Charged: Fernando Yensi, 33, was arrested and charged with manslaughter Thursday over the death of his step grandson, Poseidon Quinones . Mrs Yensi is the mother of Poseidon's father, Benjamin Quinones, 23. In a disturbing twist, Mr Quinones claims that Fernando Yensi, his stepfather, abused him as a child as well. 'He swung on me when I was 13 years old,' Mr. Quinones told The New York Times. Mr Quinones said his mother threw him out of the house after the alleged abuse. 'I’ve been on my own ever since,' he said. Mrs Yensi was cited by the city’s Administration for Children’s Services as being an 'inadequate guardian' in 1998. The citation was from a 'lack of supervision' she had shown to a child in her car, The Times reported. It is unclear how Mrs Yensi came to be approved to care for Poseidon. She has not been charged over the boy's death. Tragic: Poseidon had been in foster care and lived in a homeless shelter with his father before his grandmother became his guardian . Poseidon’s mother, Ashley Ramirez, 21, alleges that the grandmother had been abusing the boy for some time. Ramirez said she lost custody of her son after a fight with the boy’s father. Before living with Yensi, Poseidon had been in foster care and also lived in a homeless shelter with his father. Neighbors say they heard Mrs Yensi telling paramedics that Poseidon had been sick on the day he was found unconscious.

The good Lord sent him to do a job and that's my Phil,’ she told 3TV. A robbery of $18,000 from two strip club employees Tuesday in east Phoenix led to a police chase and the wounding of veteran Phoenix Officer Scott Sefranka and Grigg. Two suspects, 26-year-old Roger Allen Sharp and 36-year-old David Lee Murray, have been charged in the robbery and shooting, and a third man was arrested Friday, ABC15 reported.

"A kindly Walmart employee who organized a food drive for fellow workers has raised questions once more about pay and working conditions at America's biggest employer. A picture was posted online on Thursday of a box at an Oklahoma City store asking employees to donate canned goods for 'to associates in need' on medical leave of absence. A bake sale was also being held by employees in need in Indiana along with food drives in Ohio as campaigners put pressure on the company not to ignore the voices of employees who are going hungry. Walmart pays many of its workers less than $25,000 a year, Bloomberg reported last year, with some full-time employees averaging $15,500. The 2014 federal poverty line for a family of four is $23,850. Scroll down for video . A picture was posted of a food drive for canned goods at an Oklahoma City store, organized by a kind  employee for 'associates in need', raising questions about Walmart's pay and conditions . At one Indiana store, staff have been organizing bake sales, encouraging workers to support their colleagues with food donations . A food drive for employees at Walmart who walked out after struggling to get buy of the pay and hours at the company . The kind employee behind the food collection is Dawnne Sulaitis, who has worked at the company for 19 years. She asked permission to collect canned goods and just wanted to help families down on income during the holidays. MailOnline was unable to reach Ms Sulaitis nor management at the Walmart store in Oklahoma City where she works on Friday however Walmart management provided their employee's statement. In an email from a Walmart spokesman, Ms Sulaitis' statement read: 'Two associates are on medical leave of absence and are unable to work, leaving their families who depend on two incomes down to only one. 'I think that putting a Thanksgiving meal on the table should be the last thing these people have to worry about, and so my next question was whether I could start a food drive at the store to help them out. 'Collectively, we’re 300-plus associates at this store, and I knew that together we could make a difference. Since then, we’ve gotten two good-sized boxes of food filled, and I even baked cookies at my home to sell and raise extra money. 'But what I certainly didn’t expect? Learning that there have been quite a bit of unfavorable media stories out there regarding this drive... 'I can’t reiterate it enough: I was just trying to lend a helping hand. There’s a lot of kindness in this store and a lot of good intentions. I don’t know who these associates are or the details of their situation, and it doesn’t matter. 'Thanksgiving is about helping people, and I’m going to press on and keep a positive attitude about doing what I can.' Campaign group, Making A Change At Walmart, gave other examples of employees holding food drives to feed their colleagues. Staff at one Indiana store have been organizing bake sales, encouraging workers to support their colleagues with food donations. One Pennsylvania store is reportedly organizing a holiday 'giving tree' to help out other employees, according to The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union briefing on Friday, but this has been unconfirmed. In Ohio, workers from Dayton, Cincinnati and other cities walked off the job in protest of the company's illegal treatment of workers, according to the campaign group. Community members donated food for Thanksgiving dinners while expressing outrage at the Walton family for their company's low pay and erratic scheduling. Pastor Troy Jackson, who was organizing donations, said: 'We're donating food to Walmart workers today because that's what neighbors do. But we shouldn't have to. 'The Waltons are the richest family in America and their company can afford to pay its employees a decent wage.' Rich pickings: The Walton siblings from left, Alice Walton, Jim Walton and Wal-Mart Chairman Rob Walton, the children of the late Wal-Mart Stores Inc. founder Sam Walton, appear on stage during the company's annual shareholder meeting in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The Walton clan are worth more than $150bn . Raymond Bravo and other Walmart workers block traffic in front of the San Leandro store on Thanksgiving weekend last year. Bravo who was fired from the California store after organizing for better wages and working conditions was later arrested long with four others . The organization is asking that Walmart pay a living wage of $15 an hour and provide consistent, full-time hours for its staff. One employee from Minnesota, Cantare Davunt, added: 'We work hard and we don't want charity. We want a fair wage.' The campaign group said that many employees are afraid to speak out about their conditions for fear of having their hours cut or even being fired. Black Friday strikes have been organized by Walmart campaigners across the U.S. at Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Miami and D.C. Walmart spokesman Cory Lundberg told MailOnline on Friday that Walmart offers 'extremely competitive' wages and has a unique program allowing staff members to pick up extra hours. Campaigners counter that by Walmart raising the wage standard, its influential power as America's biggest employer would have a 'trickle down effect' on other retailers. Walmart confirmed the average hourly rate for full-time and part-time associates is $11.83. For full-time associates the average hourly wage is $12.92. Walmart classes full-time as 34 (or more) hours per week. Mr Lundberg  said those who are campaigning for higher wages represent a small minority of the '1.3 million people who choose to come to work at Walmart each day', highlighting the companies opportunities for promotion. The Walmart store in Oklahoma City where one employee is collecting canned food to stop fellow employees going hungry while they are on medical leave of absence . For those at the lower-end of the wage scale, Mr Lundberg said they would still earn more at Walmart 'than a unionized grocery store down the street'. He said that strikes in 2013 claimed to be taking place at 1,600 locations but in the end only represented a small segment of their workers. He added that Ms Sulaitis efforts were much appreciated by her colleagues 'because they were missing their Walmart wages'. In 2013, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation gave in cash and in-kind contributions of $1.3 billion around the world, the company added. The Walton Family is the richest family in America, with Christy, Jim, Alice and Rob Walton, consistently being in the top ten of the Forbes 400 since 2001 with a combined wealth of more than $150billion. Despite their extreme wealth, according to a union-backed report by the Walmart 1percent and cited by Forbes, the Waltons contributed just $17.6million to charity between 2008 and 2013. They make around $8.5million a day from their Walmart dividends. Over the same period, Warren Buffet contributed $8.4 billion to non-profit organizations – 477 times more than the Waltons combined. Dawnne Sulaitis, Dairy Department Manager at Walmart said in a statement on Friday: . 'To me, Thanksgiving is a time to reflect on what you have and what you can do for others. My store is practicing this for our community right now with a coat drive for an area homeless shelter, and I’ve been doing my part by washing the coats, so they’re clean and ready to go. About three weeks ago, I wondered if there was anything else I could do closer to home, so I asked our store’s personnel manager if there were any associates we work with who needed extra help this season. The answer was yes. Two associates are on medical leave of absence and are unable to work, leaving their families who depend on two incomes down to only one. I think that putting a Thanksgiving meal on the table should be the last thing these people have to worry about, and so my next question was whether I could start a food drive at the store to help them out. Collectively, we’re 300-plus associates at this store, and I knew that together we could make a difference. Since then, we’ve gotten two good-sized boxes of food filled, and I even baked cookies at my home to sell and raise extra money. It’s been great to see everyone’s positive reaction here to helping associates who are facing the unexpected. But what I certainly didn’t expect? Learning that there have been quite a bit of unfavorable media stories out there regarding this drive. I talked with at least four reporters today, and I told each of them that I really appreciate them listening and wanting to hear from me directly. I can’t reiterate it enough: I was just trying to lend a helping hand. There’s a lot of kindness in this store and a lot of good intentions. 'I don’t know who these associates are or the details of their situation, and it doesn’t matter. Thanksgiving is about helping people, and I’m going to press on and keep a positive attitude about doing what I can.'","A picture was posted online on Thursday of a green box at an Oklahoma City store asking employees to donate canned for 'associates in need'
One employee said today: 'We work hard and we don't want charity. We just want a fair wage'
Walmart says it pays 'extremely competitively' and those campaigning only represent a small number of those who choose to work at Walmart .
The Walton Family is the richest family in America with a combined wealth of more than $150billion; Walmart has $16billion in annual profits .
The Waltons make $8.5million a day from Walmart dividends but one report claimed they donated just double this amount to charity between 2008-2013 combined ."
"A mother with HIV is pregnant with her second baby since diagnosis – despite the risk of passing the virus to her child or husband. Amanda Mammadova said ‘it wouldn’t be the end of the world’ if her baby is born with the illness, adding: ‘Having HIV wouldn’t affect my child’s life.’ The 34-year-old personal trainer was diagnosed with the virus in 2010 – just three months after meeting her husband, Turkish native Ali, 29. She contracted the virus from an ex-partner who unknowingly had the disease, and although she feared her new boyfriend would call off their relationship, he vowed to support her. They married eight months later. Amanda Mammadova, who is HIV positive, is pregnant with her second child after she and her husband Ali chose to try and conceive naturally, having done so with their daughter Saabria . Mrs Mammadova, from Milton Keynes, already has a 14-year-old daughter from a previous relationship but her husband agreed to risk getting HIV so they could have a baby together. The couple naturally conceived their now 21-month-old daughter, Saabria, who was born HIV-free. Despite having unprotected sex, her husband did not contract the virus either. They decided to try for a second baby – and are now expecting their new arrival in June. If an HIV-positive mother takes the appropriate anti-viral drugs during pregnancy and labour and does not breast-feed, the risk of transmitting the virus to her child is around 1 per cent. Mrs Mammadova 's viral load - the amount of HIV in her blood - is low, meaning the risk of transmission during sex is low. The couple's daughter Saabria was born HIV negative and Mr Mammadova has regular tests . Mr Mammadova is waiting for a test to establish if he has contracted the virus while the couple were trying for their second child, who is due in June . And for Mrs Mammadova, this risk is further reduced given that she is an ‘elite controller’ – meaning her immune system is ultra-effective at controlling the virus. Such patients are said to have a very low risk of passing on HIV to partners during sex or during pregnancy to an unborn child. Both mother and baby will also be given a course of anti-HIV treatment upon birth, which will help reduce the risks of transmission. But Mrs Mammadova admitted that there is still a chance the virus could be passed on to her husband or child. If either were to contract the virus, they would have virtually the same life-expectancy as someone without it – but they would have to spend the rest of their lives on daily medication, with regular GP check-ups. If their immune system is badly compromised – through developing another illness, for example – it could develop into AIDS, the later stage of the illness, where life expectancy is on average three years. Mrs Mammadova said that while she would rather her child was born without the virus, she added: ‘I wouldn’t be devastated if my child had HIV. It isn’t a death sentence any more. It wouldn’t hold them back and they would go on to achieve everything they wanted. When Mrs Mammadova is 20 weeks' pregnant she will begin to take anti-retroviral drugs to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to her unborn baby. The drugs reduce the risk to less than 0.5 per cent, experts say . Mrs Mammadova said she tried to persuade her husband to opt for insemination but he refused and was adamant he wanted them to conceive naturally like a normal couple despite the low risk of transmission . ‘It hasn’t ruined my life – in fact, it has got better since my diagnosis. Having HIV isn’t the end of the world, it’s something that you live with. It doesn’t define who you are.’ Mrs Mammadova said her husband is tested for HIV every six months. ‘Ali has always supported me and is willing to get HIV in order for us to be a normal couple,’ she added. ‘He reassured me he wasn’t bothered whether he contracted HIV or not as I was his wife ... he wanted us to conceive naturally. ‘I had always wanted a family but when I was first diagnosed I thought my chances had been destroyed. ‘I also have an older daughter and I was worried I wouldn’t see her grow up but doctors … gave me hope for the future. ‘I want other people to understand the importance of getting checked. Diagnosing HIV in the early stages saves lives. ‘I hope my story shows people that the disease doesn’t need to hold you back.’ Daisy Ellis, acting policy director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, an HIV awareness charity, said: ‘The strength of our antenatal screening programme means the UK has one of the lowest rates of mother-to-child HIV transmission in the world. ‘If a woman with HIV wants to start a family, the NHS will take every measure possible to stop the virus being passed on.’ HIV is a virus that attacks the body's immune system - the body's defence against diseases. Figures published this week revealed the number of people infected with the virus in the UK has reach an all-time high. Nearly 110,000 are living with the condition, but around a quarter are unaware they have it. Recent research has found that between 70 and 90 per cent of people may experience symptoms of infection a few days after they have been infected. A fever, rash and severe sore throat should always be considered a potential indicator of HIV. The symptoms usually disappear within two to three weeks. A person described as living with HIV means they have HIV in their body. New figures published this week revealed the number of people infected with HIV, pictured under the microscope in purple and green, in the UK has reached an all-time high, with 111,000 living with the condition, but around a quarter unaware they have it . A person is considered to have developed AIDS when the immune system is so weak it can no longer fight off a range of diseases, which it would normally cope with. There is currently no cure for HIV. But those with the virus receiving treatment can live a healthy, active life. If the virus is diagnosed late, treatment may be less effective in preventing AIDs. Those who are diagnosed early and respond to treatment can be healthy, work, and have relationships like anyone else. HIV treatment was transformed in 1996 with the introduction of Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). It means a person diagnosed in time and who adheres to their medication can, in the vast majority of cases, manage their health condition and look forward to a near normal life expectancy. ART can cause some side-effects including fatigue, depression and diarrhoea, though they are increasingly well-managed. How is HIV passed on? The virus can be passed on through infected blood, semen, vaginal fluids or breast milk. HIV is most commonly passed on during: . Can women living with HIV still have a baby? HIV can be passed from mother to child, but there are steps that can be taken to reduce the possibility of the child contracting HIV to less than one per cent. They include the mother taking anti-retroviral drugs while pregnant, delivering the baby via Caesarean section and not breastfeeding the baby.

"A police grenade was today blamed for the death of a young French eco-protester as fellow activists said Francois Hollande's government has blood on its hands. Remi Fraisse, 21, died early on Sunday morning during a fight with riot officers as he campaigned against the building of the Sivens Dam in the south west Tarn region of France. Seven police officers were injured after around 2,000 people gathered to protest, with some throwing Molotov Cocktails. An environmental protester holds a sign commemorating activist Remi Fraisse, 21, as a police grenade was implicated in his killing . Mr Fraisse died during clashes with police on Friday near the site of the Sivens Dam, south west France. Around 2,000 people gathered at the demonstrations, with some throwing Molotov Cocktails at officers . Prosecutor Claude Derens today said that Mr Fraisse died from a large wound at the top of his back caused by an explosion - and that more work was being done to establish weather a grenade was to blame . In a statement which implicated police in the death, prosecutor Claude Derens said: 'The big wound on the top of Remi Fraisse's back was caused, in all likelihood, by an explosion.' He said there would be further action to determine whether 'a grenade, thrown from the area where police were entrenched, was at the origin of the explosion'. Mr Hollande's former ecology minister Cecile Duflot said: 'For me it's an absolutely intolerable situation and an indelible stain on the action of this government.' Former members of President Francois Hollande's government have spoken out over the death, calling it a 'stain' on his administration (pictured, forensic officers examine the site where Mr Fraisse died) Mr Friasse was found dead at 2am on Sunday after vicious clashes with police officers (pictured, forensic officers examine the scene of his death, and protesters write tributes nearby) She said it was disgraceful that 'for 48 hours, no member of the government has expressed condolences, to say that it regretted what happened.' MEP Jose Bove directly blamed Mr Hollande's increasingly authoritarian government saying: 'It's evident that the Interior Minister is responsible for the death of Remi Fraisse'. Referring further to Bernard Cazeneuve, Mr Bove said: 'I accuse the Minister of the Interior of having put police officers in this zone to create tension. 'I ask him to explain. Is it that the government does something like this without saying anything. Bernard Cazeneuve doesn't know what's democratic.' Demonstrations have been going on for weeks over plans to build the dam, which will destroy a nature reserve . MEP Jose Bove accused the Minister of the Interior of stationing police in the region to deliberately escalate tensions with protesters . A man plays a guitar in front of police lines near the proposed site of the Sivens Dam during protest in France . In turn, Mr Cazeneuve accused political enemies of trying to undermine the government, saying: 'I see a lot of accusations even as criminal investigations are underway.

Fraisse's body was discovered at two in the morning on Sunday, after Molotov cocktails were thrown at security forces. There have been weeks of protest against the dam, which will destroy a biodiversity reservoir, despite ensuring irrigation.

"Twin babies might be hard work for their exhausted mothers – but all that effort is worth every second when it’s time for a cuddle. These delightful pictures show Kabatwa, the proud mother, drawing her youngsters to her during a Rwandan rainforest downpour - less ‘Gorillas in the Mist’ than gorillas in the deluge. With fewer than 900 mountain gorillas left in the wild, the birth of twins is particularly exciting for conservationists as well as for their mother. Scroll down for video . Help, Mum, it's starting to rain: Her hair matted by the deluge, Kabatwa her long comforting arms around her boys. It's been an exciting day but soon it will be time for bed . Let's go exploring: Hand-in-hand, Isango and Isangano discover the delights of their forest home . Mountain gorillas have babies only every four or five years and twins are extremely rare. This pair are only the fifth set recorded in Rwanda in 40 years. They are called Isango (which means ‘Appointment’) and Isangano (which means ‘Crossroad’) -  the Rwandans favour what we would think of as unusual names for gorillas - there are others called ‘Word’, ‘Known’, ‘Advisor’ and ‘Greetings’. Isango and Isangano – pictured here at five months – were born in 2011. The family belong to a group of nine gorillas known as the ‘Hirwa’ (‘lucky one’) group, living in the Parc National des Volcans (Volcanoes Park), Rwanda. Gorilla mothers invest huge amounts of time and love in their offspring. The babies are born helpless, with their eyes tightly shut. For the first three to four months, they cling to their mother’s chest 24 hours a day while she spends long periods stroking, touching and kissing them. After four months, youngsters are able to sit up and to stand with a helping hand. Soon afterwards they begin to crawl and start to explore the forest floor – and the other members of the group. When these pictures were taken, the twins were just starting to become more independent. Hold on tight: The big wide world can be a scary place for these brothers . They were old enough to cadge piggy-back rides from Mum and to enjoy playing with other babies or even adults. Mountain gorillas – who are shaggier than their lowland cousins - live in family groups of up to 30, with typical groups containing 11. They are led by a dominant male silverback, who is fiercely protective of any babies. Any member of the group will defend the youngsters if they are attacked or threatened. David Hewitt of the UK charity Gorilla Organisation said: ‘For the first few months infants cling to the mother all the time so they are under her watchful eye. But once they begin to get more active and start exploring they can be in greater danger. ‘A major threat comes from snares put out by poachers to trap antelope and other bush meat. The babies get entangled in the snares. ‘They can also get in the way when two adult males get rambunctious.’ However, the males are usually tolerant of youngsters. Although a silverback will rarely play with a baby, it will happily allow an infant to clamber over its back.’ A helping hand: Mother gives two of her boys a piggy back while on their forest adventure . The mothers nurse their young until the age of two and the infants sleep with Mum in nests made of twigs and leaves until they are three. Females reach sexual maturity aged six, when they can weigh up to 300 pounds. However, these boys will not be sexually mature until 10 when they will weigh around 500 pounds. Mountain gorillas can live for 30 to 35 years in the wild. Of all the great apes, gorillas are the best at looking after twins. Chimpanzee and orangutan twin births usually result in one baby dying within two weeks. Mountain gorillas are on the verge of extinction, and are threatened by the loss of forests for farming and firewood and bush meat hunting. However, numbers have increased in recent years after a concerted conservation effort, funded in part by wildlife tourism. In the late 1960s there were fewer than 600 mountain gorillas. Around half of the world’s mountain gorillas live in the rainforest in the mountains of the Virunga volcano chain, straddling the borders of Rwanda, the Congo and Uganda. The area was a base for Dian Fossey, the gorilla expert murdered in 1985 whose memoir ‘Gorillas in the Mist’ was a hit film starring Sigourney Weaver.

"Want to know just  how terrible Britain’s mobile phone network is? Take a trip to Tanzania. Last year on a research trip to Africa, I stood on a remote hillside hundreds of miles from any sizeable town and phoned home. Incredible as it seemed, in the middle of nowhere, in one of the poorest countries in the world, my phone was showing five bars of signal. Five bars! Up until that point, having used my phone only in Britain, I didn’t know that was possible. Yet despite the strong signal, I didn’t manage to speak to my wife. She was camping with our daughter in the New Forest and there was, of course, no signal. Struggle: David Cameron as he revealed that he struggles to stay in touch with world leaders when holidaying in Cornwall due to porr phone signal . The fact that I was forced to leave a voicemail thanks to Britain’s often hopeless phone system spoke volumes. Black spots, calls that cut out and half-snatched conversations are daily irritants for millions. The problem was highlighted this week by David Cameron as he revealed that he struggles to stay in touch with world leaders when holidaying in Cornwall. The coverage is so bad that the most powerful man in Britain has to drive up the nearest hill to make a call. But it’s not just Cornwall, rural Wales or the far-flung reaches of Lincolnshire where phone calls are impossible. Much of our road network, railways and even parts of our large, crowded cities have no signal. So how did we get to the state where coverage is still so poor? And can anything be done to force the phone industry to end the black spots? Problem: The coverage is so bad that the most powerful man in Britain, pictured with wife Samantha in Polzeath, has to drive up the nearest hill to make a call . The first British mobile phone call was officially made on New Year’s Day 1985 by comedian Ernie Wise, and the first analogue service was updated to a digital network in the mid-Nineties. That second-generation voice and text network began to be replaced in 2003 with a third generation — or 3G — network that could handle the internet, too. Today, most phones use the 3G network. Work on expanding the latest network — 4G, which promises broadband speed on your mobile — started in earnest last year. The speed of the mobile revolution was driven by the market — and the realisation that there were huge profits to be made. So operators creating the network of masts went for the easy targets of the densely populated cities first. Smaller towns and transport links came next, and then finally villages and some of the more populated rural areas. But not all. With no financial incentive from customers or tough Government regulation, there was little reason to extend the network to remote, sparsely populated parts of the UK. Outreach: The Government says it is investing £150¿million in 500 new phone masts, such as this one in the Brecon Beacons, in rural black spots where there is no coverage . In 2000, the sales of the newly available 3G licences to operators raised £24.5 billion. But those licences were given on condition that companies cover 80 per cent of the population with 3G. That target rose to 90 per cent in 2010. The companies had until June last year to meet the higher target — and all did apart from Vodafone, which reached it in January. But while nine out of ten people sounds good on paper, the flaw with the Government targets is that they cover population, not geography. Out of the 63 million people in the UK, 84 per cent live in England and a third live in the South-East. Thus mobile phone companies can meet their 90 per cent targets while leaving huge regions uncovered. Talk to the four main mobile phone operators — Vodafone, O2, EE and 3 — and they’ll tell you that coverage is widespread in the UK. About 99 per cent of the population has 2G coverage at home, while between 90 and 95 per cent have 3G. But figures from the regulator Ofcom show that 23 per cent of the countryside can’t get 3G, while only 20 per cent is covered by all four 3G operators. About 13 per cent of Britain, including 4 per cent of roads, has no mobile signal at all. Patchy: Signal strength is worst in rural areas - in Cornwall, Devon, Suffolk, Dorset, west, central and north Wales, Cumbria and most of rural Scotland (pictured- . Signal strength is worst in rural areas — in Cornwall, Devon, Suffolk, Dorset, west, central and north Wales, Cumbria and most of rural Scotland. And those Ofcom figures describe only the strength of a mobile phone signal outdoors. Once a signal has tried to barge its way through the bricks, concrete and steel of our homes, reception is even weaker. You might expect signals to be weak in remote mountain tops. But why are there signal failures in the heart of cities? Black spots aren’t just caused by a lack of masts. Buildings or hills can block the signals from transmitters relatively close by. That’s why it’s possible for you to get a perfect signal out in the street but struggle at home unless you hang out of the bathroom window. Equally, the sheer number of people in cities can cause a problem, even if you’ve got three or four bars of signal. It happens during sports games, or after disasters. After the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005, the network quickly became overloaded and went down for the millions desperately trying to ring loved ones. Operators were forced to restrict calls to emergency services in the area around the bombings. Mobile phone base stations are able only to cope with a set number of calls at a time. If you regularly find you get a signal but can’t get through, then your operator has failed to invest enough in new masts to keep up with demand. Another major gripe for travellers is trying to use their phones on a train. There are technical reasons why it is harder for phones to connect while zooming through the countryside at 80mph, but mostly it’s down to a lack of investment in trackside masts. A study published this year showed rail passengers are without a 3G signal 28 per cent of the time, while on motorways, passengers are without a signal for 24 per cent of the time. Rated: EE has the most reliable and best-quality coverage, according to the independent analysts RootMetrics . When it comes to coverage, EE has the most reliable and best-quality coverage, while Vodafone’s is the worst, according to the independent analysts RootMetrics. But your experience of your mobile phone company will vary hugely according to where you live, work and travel. The company 3 may do well in RootMetrics’ tests of 3G coverage. But if you live in a  3 black-spot in Winchester, you may find it less impressive. The differences between providers are likely to get smaller over time with the advent of 4G. Vodafone and O2 are working together on the creation of 4G masts, which should improve coverage. The signals should travel further and so could reach rural areas where you can’t get 3G. Vodafone and O2 claim they will offer 4G to 98 per cent of the population by the end of 2014. EE also says it can do that by the end of this year. The Government says it is investing £150 million in 500 new phone masts in rural black spots where there is no coverage. The latest plan, announced last week, is to force companies to allow ‘national roaming’. So if coverage with one network drops, your phone will automatically seek out a rival. Roaming is proven to work when abroad. But the operators say it will discourage investment in masts. Why build a mast up Snowdonia if your rivals will be able to use it? There are technical problems, too, in ensuring calls don’t cut off when your phone goes from one company to another. And working out billing and data limits could be a nightmare. If you have patchy coverage in your home, you can get two types of boosters. Some plug into your internet router and act like a mini mast with a range of about 15 metres. Others connect to the internet and smartphones using your home’s Wi-Fi network. Bill Moore, CEO of RootMetrics, says some phones — such as Samsung Galaxy and HTC models — are better at picking up weak signals. ‘There are differences between handsets, even when the hardware looks the same, and it will affect your coverage,’ he says. Moving closer to a window also helps. Phone signals struggle with brick walls, but don’t object so much to glass. But ultimately, until the provision of a truly national mobile phone network is treated with the same seriousness as the National Grid, your best bet may be to move to Tanzania.","David Cameron revealed he struggles to get mobile signal in Cornwall .

"A former Picture Page cast member has become the latest women to make sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby, claiming he drugged her and sexually assaulted her when she was a 15-year-old aspiring actress. Mother-of-three Renita Chaney Hill, who appeared alongside the comedian in the educational program, said the pair had relationship for four years during the 1980s while he paid her college tuition. The 47-year-old from Pittsburgh said she would be flown to different cities around the country and when they stayed in hotels, he would insist she had a drink, even though she was still in high school. She told KDKA she believed that is when he drugged her as she did not remember anything until she woke up the next morning. Allegations: Mother-of-three Renita Chaney Hill, 47, claims that Cosby would fly her to stay in different hotels around the country where he would drug her . Encounter: She first met the comedian when she was a 15-year-old aspiring actress and was chosen to appear on Picture Pages (right) in the 1980s . Educational: Cosby presented the short programs aimed at preschool children from 1974 until the early 1980s which involved him playing games and painting pictures . The pair first met when Cosby was in Pittsburgh filming for his children's educational show Picture Pages. He fronted the educational program aimed at pre-school children from 1974 until the early 1980s . He was looking for cast members so Hill's modelling agency put her forward and she got the job. 'Promises of bright lights and fame. That’s where I thought I was headed, that’s what everyone who knew me thought I was headed,' she told KDKA. 'He would fly me to a number of cities. He would be busy during the day, then I’d come to his hotel room at night,' she added. Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it. Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client. Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee. Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. Angela Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992. Renita Chainey Hill - The 47-year-old mother-of-three who met Cosby when she was offered a role on Picture Pages in Pittsburgh claimed he would fly her to different cities around the United States and drug her during a four-year relationship. 'One time, I remember just before I passed out, I remember him kissing and touching me and I remember the taste of his cigar on his breath, and I didn’t like it. I remember another time when I woke up in my bed the next day and he was leaving, he mentioned you should probably lose a little weight. I thought that odd, how would he know that.' When she turned 19, she cut off all ties with Cosby, even though he was paying her way through school. Her parents seemed happy with her continuing what seemed like a mentoring relationship, but Hill had enough, and even gave up her dream of becoming an actress. Hill claims her husband and three daughters are aware of what happened. She told the station she has no apologies for waiting 30 years to tell the story and said she decided to come forward when Cosby's lawyers criticized other alleged victims. Hill added: 'No one wants to be associated with something like this. But the bottom line for me is that no one has the right to violate someone else, no matter who they are. I don’t care how big they are or how the community sees them, it’s not right.' Earlier on Friday, Angela Leslie, a former model and actress, accused Cosby of sexually assaulting her in a luxury Las Vegas hotel suite after trying to ply her with alcohol. She claimed that the TV star forced her to masturbate him after pouring her a strong drink. Leslie, now 52, was reportedly invited to meet Cosby at his hotel in 1992 after sending him a letter and photograph. She was hoping to get career advice from the star after initially meeting the comedian two years previously on the set of The Cosby Show. Actress Louisa Moritz came forward on Thursday and accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex and implied he would further her career if she went through with it. Moritz, 68, said that she was backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971 when Cosby stuck his penis in her mouth. The One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest actress told TMZ: 'He took his hands and put them on the back of my head and forced his penis in my mouth, saying, ""have a taste of this. It will do you good in so many ways.""' As the allegations continued to come out, Cosby was in the Bahamas performing. During the appearance, the 77-year-old put his head in his hands and pretended to sob, new video obtained by MailOnline has revealed today. He joked that parents would not let their children near him, as fans in the audience laughed and applauded the skit. 'Parents are coming and taking their children home, saying to me ''Bill Cosby you are an evil man!'',' the entertainer said through faux tears on stage. But the entertainer then shook it off, smiled and started what became a well-scripted 90 minute performance. Glends Newell-Harris, the President of  The Links Incorporated, the charity who organised the show, said in a statement: . 'The scheduling of Mr. Cosby to perform at the Nassau (Bahamas) Chapter’s fundraiser was done in good faith and in advance of the allegations coming to light. 'As a women’s organization committed to uplifting and empowering women, The Links, Incorporated does not tolerate crimes against women. 'Recent accusations against Bill Cosby are alarming and unsettling. We trust that the appropriate authorities will conduct a thorough investigation. 'The Links, Incorporated believes in the judicial system of the United States as well as every citizen’s right to due process. 'Being that no formal charges have been filed against Mr. Cosby, we therefore don’t deem it appropriate to further comment on the accusations. 'Proceeds from the event benefitting The Links Foundation, Incorporated were generated from the sale of tickets purchased by community members who believe in and support the work of The Links Foundation, Incorporated. A total of nine women have now come forward this month claiming the famed entertainer abused them. However he has cancelled upcoming shows in both Las Vegas and Arizona. The accusations has also caused Netflix and NBC to ax projects by the veteran comedian. He pulled out of scheduled slots with Queen Latifah and David Letterman and, when asked about the allegations in a November 6 interview with the Associated Press, said: 'There's no response ... I don't talk about it.' Severing all ties: When Hill was 19, she decided to end contact with Cosby and gave up her career as an aspiring actress .

"Hookahs have become popular among students across America - but new research has found they contain damaging chemicals. A new study has found fumes from the water pipes contain the toxin benzene, which has been linked to an increased risk for leukemia. Researchers have previously warned of an impending health epidemic caused by a huge rise in the number of students smoking hookah pipes. The  new study has found fumes from the water pipes contain the toxin benzene, which has been linked to an increased risk for leukemia. Hookah, an ancient form of smoking, in which charcoal-heated tobacco or non-tobacco based shisha smoke is passed through water before inhalation, is rapidly gaining popularity among adolescents in the US. A recent study found 18% of high school seniors have reported engaging in behavior researchers describe as 'equivalent to smoking 10-40 cigarettes in a single sitting, and then kissing everybody as well'. The latest research, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, caused researchers to call for better education on the use of hookahs. 'In contrast to what is believed, hookah tobacco smoking is not a safe alternative to smoking other forms of tobacco,'  Nada Kassem of San Diego State University said. Researchers analyzed levels of S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA) - a metabolite (byproduct) of benzene - in the urine of 105 hookah smokers and 103 nonsmokers exposed to smoke from the water pipes. After an event in a hookah lounge, SPMA levels were four times higher than normal in hookah smokers and 2.6 times higher than normal among people who had attended but hadn't puffed on a hookah. After a hookah-smoking event in a private home, SPMA levels were two times higher among hookah smokers, but normal among nonsmokers. 'Hookah tobacco smoking involves the use of burning charcoal that is needed to heat the hookah tobacco to generate the smoke that the smoker inhales,' Kassem explained. 'In addition to inhaling toxicants and carcinogens found in the hookah tobacco smoke, hookah smokers and nonsmokers who socialize with hookah smokers also inhale large quantities of charcoal combustion-generated toxic and carcinogenic emissions,' she said. Studies estimate one hookah session can be the equivalent of smoking from 10 to 40 cigarettes. Kassem believes that 'because there is no safe level of exposure to benzene, our results call for interventions to reduce or prevent hookah tobacco use, regulatory actions to limit hookah-related exposure to toxicants including benzene, and include hookah smoking in clean indoor air legislation.' Researchers have previously warned of an impending health epidemic caused by a huge rise in the number of students smoking hookah pipes. A study by researchers affiliated with New York University's Center for Drug Use and HIV Research (CDUHR), in the August 2014 edition of Pediatrics identifies how prevalent Hookah use is and which teens are most likely to be using it. Studies estimate one hookah session can be the equivalent of smoking from 10 to 40 cigarettes. Dr. Richard Hurt of the Mayo Clinic said that's because of the long duration of a hookah session. 'When you smoke a cigarette, a person smokes it maybe for just a few minutes and then you're through with it. 'But hookah sessions are social and people sit there for an hour or so kind of puffing on these things, thinking that the water is filtering out all the bad stuff, when the reality is it does not do that,' Hurt said. A study funded by the National Institutes of Health reports a single hookah session delivers 1.7 times the nicotine, 6.5 times the carbon monoxide and 46.4 times the tar of a single cigarette. The researchers found the annual prevalence (use in the last 12 months) of hookah use was nearly 1 in 5 high school seniors. 'What we find most interesting is that students of higher socioeconomic status appear to be more likely to use hookah,' said Joseph Palamar of NYU Langone Medical Center. 'Surprisingly, students with more educated parents or higher personal income are at high risk for use. 'We also found that hookah use is more common in cities, especially big cities. 'So hookah use is much different from cigarette use, which is more common in non-urban areas.'","Recent study found 1 in 5 high school seniors use Hookahs .

"An enormous blue diamond formerly owned by millionaire gardener and philanthropist Rachel Mellon has sold for $32.6million at auction - a new record. The Fancy Vivid Blue diamond, mounted in platinum, weighed in at 9.75 carats, and sold for more than any other blue diamond at Sotheby's auctioneers. An anonymous collector for Hong Kong paid the huge sum for the rock, beating off six contenders. The sale smashed expectations of around $15million. Scroll down for video . Record-breaker: The Fancy Vivid Blue diamond, belonging to Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, pictured above, has sold for $32.6million at auction . Former owner: Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon died aged 103 this March. Above is the last known photograph of her, from January 2000 when she was 90 years old . It far exceeded the previous blue diamond record, held by the Wittelsbach Diamond, which sold in 2008 for $24.3million. The price was exceeded despite the Wittlesbach being much heavier at more than 30 carats. Mellon, nicknamed Bunny, died in March at 103. She was the widow of philanthropist Paul Mellon, heir to the fortune of the then-Mellon Bank, and one of the richest men in the United States. She herself inherited a fortune derived from Listerine mouthwash, which was invented by her grandfather. Mellon was a close confidante of political figures including Jackie Kennedy, whom she befriended while her husband John F Kennedy was a senator for Massachusetts in the 1950s. Art collectors: Rachel poses alongside her husband Paul Mellon, heir to a banking fortune . After JFK ascended to the presidency, Mellon was invited to redesign the White House Rose Garden. The President was so pleased with the results that, two days after the Cuban Missile Crisis ended, he wrote her a note to say the area: 'has been our brightest spot in the somber surroundings of the last few days.' She also designed a second garden after JFK died, which she insisted be named for Jackie Kennedy. Between them, Mellon and her husband amassed a huge art collection, much of which was donated to national collections. Many of the items they kept are being sold by Sotheby's in separate lots.","Fancy Vivid Blue diamond fetched record price at Sotheby's auction .

"Shooter Adam Lanza carried out the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School . Adam Lanza had always been a child in need of help. At age 3, he was referred to special education after he began to exhibit oddly repetitive behaviors and couldn't socialize like most kids. By fourth grade, he had been diagnosed with anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and autism. Yet year after year — as psychiatrists insisted that Lanza should be on treatment and strict medication — his mother Nancy refused to follow through on the requests. She chalked up her son's behavior to a presumed superior intelligence, seeing him as a gifted student, despite testing done by experts showing he presented average intelligence. But, as the years went on, the truth became clearer: Adam Lanza was a deeply troubled young man who obsessed over mass killings as he fell deeper into a pit of mental illness while his mother ignored his struggles . These are the findings of a new report by the Office of the Child Advocate in Connecticut, which released on Friday a 114-page dossier about the life of the shooter who massacred 20 children and six adult staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown on December 14, 2012. Panicked children leave the school in the aftermath of the shooting. In total, 20 kids and six adult staffers were killed . Cops maintain a perimeter outside the school in the hours following the shooting on Dec. 14, 2012 . The report charges that the local school system enabled Nancy Lanza as she accommodated and appeased her son — even as he became more withdrawn socially and exhibited frightening signs of his obsession with murder. The Office of the Child Advocate says there were missed opportunities to provide more treatment for Lanza. 'Both AL's mother and his educational team shared a goal of managing and accommodating, rather than securing treatment for, AL's disabilities, and likely this approach was fueled by a lack of critical information and guidance,' the report says. The report adds: 'There were early indications of AL’s preoccupation with violence, depicted by extremely graphic writings that appeared to have been largely unaddressed by schools and possibly by parents.' By eighth grade, Lanza's anxiety became so severe, he was placed in a program for children who are 'too disabled, even with supports and accommodations, to attend school.' A major red flag came when Lanza was 14: the Yale Child Study Center, where he underwent a psychological evaluation, said that a 'strategy of accommodating AL, rather than addressing his underlying needs, would lead to a deteriorating life of dysfunction and isolation.' The Yale center prescribed extensive treatment and ongoing expert consultation for Lanza — all recommendations that were ignored. Lanza himself refused to follow treatment for his anxiety and OCD, disagreeing with doctors over his Asperger's diagnosis and avoiding individual therapy. His mother Nancy enabled him and kept him out of treatment, the report says. 'Though AL was profoundly impaired by anxiety and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, his parents may not have understood the depth or implications of his disabilities, including his need for ongoing support,' the report says. Lanza completely stopped seeking psychiatric help after 2006. Victims: Lanza shot his mother Nancy (bottom right) before heading to Sandy Hook, where he massacred 20 children and six adults . Twisted mind: Adam Lanza spent most of his time in an online community dedicated to talking about mass murders, as seen in this email he sent days before opening fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School . In the three months before the December 2012 massacre, Lanza had not left his room in his mother's spacious colonial-style house, where he lived surrounded by an arsenal of weapons and spent long hours playing violent video games. His parents were divorced, and Lanza had not seen his father for two years. The report said Lanza's severe and deteriorating mental health problems, combined with a preoccupation with violence and access to deadly weapons, proved a recipe for mass murder. Lanza lived in 'virtual social isolation,' spending his days obsessing over mass killings and exchanging emails with a cyber community of murder enthusiasts. Although he struggled with depression and at times had suicidal thoughts, there is no evidence showing that he was psychotic throughout the period. Despite his declining mental state, Lanza's mother — with whom he'd went on a series of shooting activities over years — didn't seem to curtail his access to the high-capacity magazine weapons guns Nancy Lanza had in her home. In his last few months, Lanza spent most of his time inside his home, refusing to leave. Lanza barely ate anything and was anorexic when he died at just 112 pounds on his 6-foot frame. The report also provocatively asks whether a family that was not white or as affluent as the Lanzas would have been given the same leeway to manage treatment for their troubled child. 'Is the community more reluctant to intervene and more likely to provide deference to the parental judgment and decision-making of white, affluent parents than those caregivers who are poor or minority?' the report said. Lanza killed his mother, Nancy Lanza, then shot his way into the Newtown school on Dec. 14, 2012, and gunned down 20 children and six educators before committing suicide. The advocate's office investigates all child deaths in the state for lessons on prevention. The authors of the Newtown report said it aims to reinforce the importance of effective mental health treatment and communication among professionals charged with the care for children. 'Records indicate that the school system cared about AL's success but also unwittingly enabled Mrs. Lanza's preference to accommodate and appease AL through the educational plan's lack of attention to social-emotional support, failure to provide related services, and agreement to AL's plan of independent study and early graduation at age 17,' the authors wrote. The authors said they could not say whether more effective treatment could have prevented the tragedy. 'This report raises, but cannot definitively answer, the question as to whether better access to effective mental health and educational services would have prevented the tragic events at Sandy Hook,' they wrote. Family photos show Adam Lanza growing up surrounded by guns at his parents' house (left). Experts say his easy access to heavy weaponry contributed to his carrying out of the mass shooting in 2012 . A shattered window at Sandy Hook Elementary School following the shooting . The police investigation into the massacre concluded more than a year ago with prosecutors saying that a motive might never be known. It said Lanza was afflicted with mental health problems, but despite his dark interests, he did not display aggressive or threatening tendencies. Documents released by police in December 2013 included descriptions of sporadic treatment for his mental health troubles. At one point, experts at the Yale Child Studies Center prescribed antidepressant/anti-anxiety medication, but Nancy Lanza discontinued the treatment and never scheduled follow-up visits, police reports said. A Connecticut judge last year ordered Newtown school officials to give Lanza's records the Office of Child Advocate for its investigation. The governor's Sandy Hook Advisory Commission has been waiting for the office's report before releasing its recommendations on what the state can do to prevent and respond to future mass killings. Child Advocate Sarah H. Eagan already has met with the families of the victims and Newtown school officials to discuss the findings.

"A three-year-old autistic girl has made a splash in the art world with her extraordinary paintings. Iris Grace Halmshaw began doing art as therapy, but when her parents decided to put the works on sale they began fetching prices of up to £830. And painting has also helped improve the youngster's condition - she is now eager to play with her parents and has adopted a much happier demeanour. Artwork: This is one of the paintings by Iris Grace Halmshaw, an autistic three-year-old and budding artist . Therapy: Iris Grace was encouraged by her parents to start painting as a form of medical treatment . Her mother Arabella Carter-Johnson, of Market Harborough in Leicestershire, said she had received positive feedback since posting her daughter's paintings on Facebook. 'We realised about three months ago she is actually really talented,' she said. 'Inquiries to buy her paintings were flooding in from all over the world and a framed print sold in a charity auction in London for £830.' Iris Grace's financier father, Peter-Jon Halmshaw, added: 'When she started doing art therapy we thought it was amazing, but we're her parents so we think everything she does is amazing. 'But lots of other people started saying it was great. It went berserk from there.' So far, the family has sold eight of Iris Grace's artworks, and is planning to makes prints of the paintings available too. Striking: Iris Grace's works became instantly popular when her mother posted them on Facebook . Lucrative: Eight of her paintings have now been sold, with one fetching as much as £830 . The three-year-old, who does not speak, was diagnosed with autism last year after her parents noticed she rarely made eye contact with them, and they tried a number of different therapies to help socialise her. 'We started with play therapy and we've had speech, equine, occupational and music therapy, looked at her nutrition and quite a few other methods,' said Ms Carter-Johnson, 32. 'With the expert help of many therapists she changed dramatically in a short space of time. 'She used to be consumed by books, eye contact was a rare occurrence, she didn't want to, or know how to, play with us and got desperately distressed when we took her near any other children. 'She now rides on my back in fits of laughter, plays and communicates by creating her own signs. Impressionistic: Iris Grace refuses to use an easel, and prefers laying the paper flat on a table while painting . 'We still have a long way to go with her social skills and speech, but we are having many more good days. 'Her autism has created a style which I've never seen in a child of her age - she has an understanding of colours and how they interact. She beams with excitement and joy when I get out the paints.' Iris Grace's talent came to light a few months ago when her mother first encouraged her to start drawing. 'As part of play therapy I tried to get Iris Grace to draw,' she said. 'I then got out an easel - which she hated - but when I put the paper and paints on the table she loved it. 'She was soon high-flicking and stabbing with the brushes. She loves to experiment.' Progress: Although the three-year-old does not speak, she has become much more socially aware recently . Mrs Carter-Johnson added: 'I would love to think that Iris Grace's story can be an inspiration to any parents with an autistic child.' Michaela Butter, co-director of Embrace Arts, the University of Leicester's inclusive arts centre, said: 'As Iris Grace's paintings demonstrate so well, disability is no barrier to creativity.' The family are hoping to arrange an exhibition in London to give Iris Grace's paintings a wider audience. All profits from sales go towards art materials and paying her therapists.","Iris Grace Halmshaw started painting as part of autism therapy .

"There are some on the most impressive fireworks you'll see on July 4th - but are 23 million light years. Nasa today revealed this incredible image of the galaxy NGC 4258 (also known as M106), a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way. Instead of explosives, the galactic light show involves a giant black hole, shock waves, and vast reservoirs of gas. Fireworks far, far away: This new composite image of NGC 4258, where X-rays from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory are blue, radio data from the NSF's Karl Jansky Very Large Array are purple, optical data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope are yellow and blue, and infrared data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope are red. Radio . data shows that the supermassive black hole at the center of NGC 4258 . is producing powerful jets of high-energy particles. Researchers think that these jets strike the disk of the galaxy and generate shock waves. These shock waves, in turn, heat some of the gas - composed mainly of hydrogen molecules - to thousands of degrees. Part of the evidence for this heating process comes from the similarity in location between the hydrogen and X-ray emission, both thought to be caused by shocks, and the radio jets. The Chandra X-ray image reveals huge bubbles of hot gas above and below the plane of the galaxy. The galaxy is famous, however, for something that our Galaxy doesn't have - two extra spiral arms that glow in X-ray, optical, and radio light. A new . study of these anomalous arms made with Spitzer shows that shock waves, . similar to sonic booms from supersonic planes, are heating large amounts . of gas - equivalent to about 10 million Suns.

Part of the evidence for this heating process comes from the similarity in location between the hydrogen and X-ray emission, both thought to be caused by shocks, and the radio jets. The Chandra X-ray image reveals huge bubbles of hot gas above and below the plane of the galaxy. Nasa also revealed the individual images that make up the firework display. Here, X-rays from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory are blue, while  infrared data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope are red. These bubbles indicate that much of the gas that was originally in the disk of the galaxy has been heated to millions of degrees and ejected into the outer regions by the jets from the black hole.The ejection of gas from the disk by the jets has important implications for the fate of this galaxy. Researchers estimate that all of the remaining gas will be ejected within the next 300 million years - very soon on cosmic time scales - unless it is somehow replenished. Because most of the gas in the disk has already been ejected, less gas is available for new stars to form. Indeed, the researchers used Spitzer data to estimate that stars are forming in the central regions of NGC 4258, at a rate which is about ten times less than in the Milky Way Galaxy. Radio data from the NSF's Karl Jansky Very Large Array is shown in purple, while the optical data from Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope is on the right . The European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory was used to confirm the estimate from Spitzer data of the low star formation rate in the central regions of NGC 4258. Herschel was also used to make an independent estimate of how much gas remains in the center of the galaxy. After allowing for the large boost in infrared emission caused by the shocks, the researchers found that the gas mass is ten times smaller than had been previously estimated.Because NGC 4258 is relatively close to Earth, astronomers can study how this black hole is affecting its galaxy in great detail. The supermassive black hole at the center of NGC 4258 is about ten times larger than the one in the Milky Way, and is also consuming material at a faster rate, potentially increasing its impact on the evolution of its host galaxy.","Galaxy is called NGC 4258 (also known as M106), and is a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way .

"The producer of The Cosby Show and longtime friend of the embattled comedian released a statement today expressing shock at the sexual assault allegations but denying any knowledge of them. Tom Werner's production company Carsey-Werner worked with the comedian to create The Cosby Show. Werner, who is also chairman of the Boston Red Sox, was also reportedly part of creating the new sitcom with Cosby for NBC which has since been cancelled after ten women came forward this month to allege Cosby had attacked them, many accusing the star of drugging and raping them. Scroll down for video .

Friends: Comedian Bill Cosby greets Boston Red Sox owner John Henry during the game as Larry Lucchino, left, and Tom Werner (pictured left) look on . According to The Boston Globe, the statement read: 'The Bill we know was a brilliant and wonderful collaborator on a show that changed the landscape of television. 'These recent news reports are beyond our knowledge or comprehension.' On Thursday, Raven-Symoné blasted rumours that she was sexually assaulted by co-star Bill Cosby during their years on The Cosby Show. 'I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! [sic]' the 28-year-old wrote on Instagram on Wednesday. 'I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of!,' she added. 'Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!' Symone starred as Cosby's step-granddaughter Olivia from 1989 till 1992 (the show started airing in 1984). Symone was referencing a report posted earlier this week on fake news site Hip-Hop Hangover, claiming the actress had filed molestation charges against Cosby when they acted together on the hit sitcom. A cast shot from The Cosby Show in 1984. Producer Tom Werner, who collaborated on the hit TV show with Cosby, released a statement today where . It was announced on Friday that Bill Cosby's appearances at Las Vegas and Arizona casinos have been canceled amid widening allegations. No reason was given by Diamond Desert Casino in Tucson, Arizona for the canceled February 15 show. Las Vegas' Treasure Island confirmed on Friday that the comedian's show, the day after Thanksgiving, had been canceled, reportedly by 'mutual agreement'. In the past week, numerous allegations of sexual abuse against Cosby, 77, from a number of women have led to canceled interviews along with NBC and Netflix projects. TV Land has also announced that they will no longer air reruns of The Cosby Show on the network. Netflix postponed the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving. He pulled out of scheduled slots with Queen Latifah and David Letterman and, when asked about the allegations in a November 6 interview with the Associated Press, said: 'There's no response ... I don't talk about it.' A total of nine women have now come forward this month claiming the famed entertainer abused them. MailOnline was awaiting comment from Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, on Friday. Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him.

"Shane Coffey, 20, was jailed for life after launching a knife attack on a Surrey woman after she ended their online relationship . A baby-faced American gamer who flew to the UK and launched a frenzied knife attack on a woman after she ended their online relationship has been jailed for life. Shane Coffey, 20, was sentenced to serve a minimum of eight-and-a-half years in prison after he pleaded guilty to attempted murder and grievous bodily harm at Guildford Crown Court today. U.S. citizen Coffey, from Boston in Massachusetts, smashed through a window to break into the home of the 19-year-old woman in Epsom, Surrey, in the early hours of April 18. He then attacked her with a hunting knife, which he had concealed in his luggage, in her bed before her brother came to her aid. Both siblings suffered serious stab wounds. The court heard Coffey and Farha Dowlut had first started chatting when she was aged 14, after meeting through online gaming. Gino Connor, prosecuting, said the pair had regularly spoken online but had stopped chatting after Coffey had remotely hacked into Miss Dowlut's computer and read her chat logs with other people. They discussed Coffey visiting her at her home and exchanged Christmas gifts, which gave Coffey her address. They started talking again in November 2013 and their exchanges over message services, games and Skype were described as 'a bit flirty' at times by Miss Dowlut. 'There came a time when she realised there were family expectations and she was expected to marry a Muslim,' said Mr Connor. 'She informed the defendant they should not see each other any more but could still be friends.' He had previously sent her an Xbox console and games and, when he wanted the gifts back, she tried to sell the console online but was unable to transfer the funds to him as he did not give her the right bank information. Coffey scoped out his victim's house before breaking in and launching a frenzied attacked with a hunting knife like the one pictured. File photo . Contact between them became more sporadic and in March, after a big argument, she told Coffey to 'get out of her life.' The court heard that Coffey had booked a flight to the UK in February, as well as a stay at the Premier Inn in Epsom. He arrived at Heathrow Airport on April 17, having smuggled a Schrade combat and hunting knife in through customs in his luggage, along with cable ties and tape, and got a taxi to his hotel, close to Miss Dowlut's home. Mr Connor told the court Coffey went for a walk, as 'reconnaissance' to scope out the area around Miss Dowlut's home. At 3.07am the following morning, Coffey walked to her home and sat at the bottom of the garden for around an hour, watching Miss Dowlut's first-floor bedroom window who had fallen asleep. 'Suddenly she was awoken by a shattering and it was the noise of her bedroom window being smashed with a brick,' said Mr Connor. 'When she heard the smash she started to scream as she became aware of a dark figure on top of her.' 'He [her brother] grabbed the defendant around the neck from behind, putting him in a headlock as he attempted to pull him off his sister.' Judge Christopher Critchlow said Coffey had 'a rich and developed fantasy life with a high degree of narcissism.' 'It is difficult to imagine a more nightmarish situation for a young female asleep in her own bedroom, being awoken and attacked by a man intent on killing her,' he said. Police officers arrested Coffey at 4.48am and he was taken to King's College Hospital in London for treatment. He told a doctor there he had come to England to see his ex-girlfriend. 'He said he stabbed her because she wouldn't give the stuff back, she was there, he jumped her and attacked her,' said Mr Connor. Coffey was sectioned under the Mental Health Attack before he was charged. U.S. citizen Coffey pleaded guilty to attempted murder and greivous bodily harm at Guildford Crown Court in Surrey . In an interview with police, Coffey said voices were telling him to get his stuff back and had told him to hack in to her computer. He said he had heard voices since the age of 14 and had taken drugs including LSD, ecstasy and cannabis since he was 16. The court also heard that Miss Dowlut spent three days in hospital as she received treatment for multiple cuts to her chest, legs and arms. She suffered from shock and depression and said her A-level grades suffered as a result of the attack. Coffey admitted attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm at a plea and case management hearing on October 22. Richard McConaghy, mitigating, told the court Coffey had in fact intended to kill himself after the attack, rather than wipe Miss Dowlut's computer and hide his tracks. He said Coffey had a troubled childhood with a drug-addicted mother and alcoholic father, and was moved around between homes and care for many years. 'He found himself delving into a world where he lived his life online rather than forming particular personal, meaningful relationships,' he said. He later admitted that he had been motivated by a jealous rage at seeing chat logs between Miss Dowlut and other men when he hacked her computer, rather than voices. Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Antony Archibald, of Surrey Police, said: 'This case was extremely complex and involved a set of unusual circumstances which could never have been foreseen by the victims. 'This was an extremely frightening incident for the family, carried out by a troubled man who carefully planned the attack with disturbing precision. 'We have no doubt that Coffey intended to kill that night and he may have done had it not been for the brave and courageous actions of the family members who stopped him and quickly contacted police.' He added the case illustrated the dangers of the internet and warned users not to give out personal details.","Shane Coffey, 20, from Boston, Massachusetts, flew to the UK after his online girlfriend ended their relationship .

"U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who spent five years as a Taliban prisoner of war before being released last month, was being informed of the media attention surrounding his return as he recovers at a military hospital, the Army said on Tuesday. Bergdahl arrived in the predawn hours of Friday at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, on a military flight from Germany, dogged by questions surrounding his disappearance from a U.S. Army post in Afghanistan and the deal the Obama administration reached to free him. Scroll down for video . Home ground: Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, pictured moments before being freed by the Taliban, has arrived at a medical center in San Antonio . Inquiry: A General is due to begin an investigation into the capture of Bowe Bergdahl, believed to be the man circled. The 28-year-old was flown to a Texas base, above, on Friday .

Bergdahl's 2009 disappearance in Afghanistan, with no time set for its . completion. While . the Army also gave little information about Bergdahl's health and . emotional state, officials said they were pleased with his physical . state on arrival. The . military hospital in San Antonio where Bergdahl has been receiving what . the Army calls 'reintegration' treatment has teams of specialists and . has been helping returning prisoners of war for decades.

An investigation at the time concluded that he had left of his own free will, but a military official has told CNN the Army has no definitive proof that he deserted.
