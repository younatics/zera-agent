"An eccentric Chinese billionaire who has become notorious for madcap publicity stunts has done it again, this time taking out a full-page ad in the New York Times to invite 1,000 poor Americans to lunch. Chen Guangbiao, a recycling magnate best known in the U.S. for his over-the-top business card and a failed attempt to buy the New York Times, created a bilingual ad that appeared in print Monday extending an open invitation to low-income people to dine with him at the high-end Boat House Restaurant in Central Park on June 25. The generous tycoon also promised to hand out $300 in cash to each participant of his charity event. Lunch and a show: Chen Guangbiao, a recycling magnate from China, has taken out a full-page ad in the New York Times to invite 1,000 poor Americans to lunch, where he promised to perform We Are the World for his guests . Dining room with a view: The lunch for the 'destitute' will take place June 25 at the high-end Central Park Boat House restaurant . ‘I hope they can spend the money on . occupational training and know there are no religious or ethnic . boundaries when it comes to charity,’ he told South China Morning Post. In the ad, the controversial billionaire explained that his goal was to change Americans' negative perception of members of China's elite as 'crazy' and obsessed with material goods. ‘I want to spread the message in the US that there are good philanthropists in China and not all are crazy spenders on luxury goods,’ Chen told the South China Morning Post. Chen added that his other goal was to set an example for his less-than-scrupulous fellow one-percenters, encouraging them to become involved in philanthropy instead of splurging on luxuries, gambling and prostitution. During the planned charity luncheon, Chen is expected to entertain his 'destitute' American guests with his rendition of We Are The World performed in English. Billionaire: Guangbiao calls himself China's number one philanthropist after making billions in the renewable energy business . So far, more than 250 people have accepted the invitation to lunch. Chen said he expects to spend $1million on his latest charitable endeavor. In the New York Times advertisement, Chen . compared himself to Lei Feng, a much-admired People's Liberation Army . soldier and devoted communist who became the subject of a propaganda . campaign after his death in 1962. The renewable energy magnate made headlines in January when he handed out boastful business cards to reporters covering a press conference with two Chinese burn victims who were brought to New York by Chen to undergo reconstructive surgeries. The event was overshadowed by Mr Chen’s cards, in which he lavished praise on himself as the 'Most Influential Person of China,' his country’s Moral Leader,' 'Most Well-known and Beloved Chinese Role Model,' and 'China Earthquake Rescue Hero.' Exaggerating? Me?: Chen Guangbiao is China's 'Most Well-known', its 'Moral Leader' and 'Most Charismatic Philanthropist' according to his business card . During the same event, he also announced his intentions to . buy the New York Times for $1billion, something he changed to $3billion . when he was told that the newspaper is worth $2.5billion - but his bid fell through. Chen, however, is not ready to give up on his dream. Speaking to South China Morning Post this week, the billionaire expressed interest in buying the Times' opinion section, which he envisions as a bilingual page dedicated to charity and the environment.","Chen Guangbiao took out a full-page in New York Times inviting 'destitute' Americans to dine at Central Park Boat House June 25 .

"Halloween is known for its typical American themes of cats, witches and pumpkin lanterns. But move further south and the festival of All Hallows' Eve is somewhat less commercial and brings colour and depth to the morbid holiday. Day Of The Dead (Día de Muertos) originated as an Aztec tradition in Mexico, celebrating the lives of the deceased through preparing sugar skulls, marigolds and  their favourite food and drinks over three days (October 31 - November 2). Scroll down for video . A woman disguised as Catrina poses for a photo in Guadalajara, Mexico on November 2012 . La Calavera Nicole (or the Elegant Skeleton), is an early 1900s image by José Guadalupe Posada . These are historically brought to a loved one's  grave, which can be decorated, to pay homage to a deceased relative - a tradition based on Mexico's pre-Hispanic culture. In modern times the Day Of The Dead's themes are adopted in many countries and cultures and is an increasingly popular fancy dress and party theme in the UK. The Lady Of The Dead, or La Calavera Nicole (or the Elegant Skeleton), is an early 1900s image by Mexican artist José Guadalupe Posada depicting a female skeleton dressed in an upper class hat. She started life as a satirical portrait of Mexicans who hoped to adopt European aristocratic traditions in the pre-revolutionary era, according to the artist. Nowadays, she has become known as La Catrina, or Catrina, an icon of Día de Muertos, and one of the most popular ways women dress for the occasion. In 2012, Guadalupe Posada's painting celebrated 100 years. A woman arranges offerings at a relative's grave on the Day of the Dead, at a cemetery in Oaxaca, 2013 .

Kate Moss dressed up as a variation of Catrina for Jonathan Ross's famous Halloween party last October, weeks after Sandra Bullock stepped out in a similar, expertly executed outfit. Pinterest held a Day Of The Dead themed styling event at Mexican eaterie Wahaca, Soho, taking the most pinned looks from the site then teaching pinners how to recreate them. Femail writer Deni Kirkova got the full makeover and a one-to-one with each beautifying expert. We now bring you the low-down on how to get a gorgeous Catrina-inspired look at home this Halloween. Kate Moss honours Mexico's Day Of The Dead at Jonathan Ross's annual Halloween party last October (l) and Sandra Bullock nailing the look on her way to a party with her son Louis a couple weeks earlier (r) STEP ONE: HAIR . Victory rolls or indeed almost any voluminous hair style from the 1940s involving curls and pins will work wonder with a marigold headdress and a beautifully made-up face. I was styled by the wonderful girls from Hoxton hair salon Rockalily. ReeRee talked me through how to recreate victory roll hairstyle at home. Steps: . 1. Curl all your hair, then section a portion of it. For the victory rolls, grab the hair from behind your ear. 2. The victory roll needs a base to sit on, which you can created here with some good back combing. Spray to seal. 3. Roll the hair. You can either use your finger, your thumb, or even just by pinching it into shape. Try and find what works best for you. 4. At this stage you may want to play around with different placement ideas for the roll. 5. Pin the victory roll into place using a pins, using between 2-5 pins per roll. 6. Repeat on the other side! If there's a fringe, you can add another roll at the front - position them wide or high to suit and flatter your face shape. 7. Pin faux marigolds or roses as you please. Curl all your hair, then section a portion of it. For the victory rolls, grab the hair from behind your ear . The victory roll needs a base to sit on, which you can created here with some good back combing. Spray . If you're planning on taking a food break - now's the time, after the hair but before all the face paint! We feasted on tortillas with guacamole and refried beans, pork tacos and churros - heavenly . STEP TWO: FACE . The make-up look was created by London Body Painting's Sarah. She used water-base face paints with sponges and brushes, choosing a pastel colour theme face for me. It was a soft pretty look quite different from the black and red colour Catrina faces seen so often. What you'll need: . - Pale foundation or white face paint . - Turquoise face paint or eyeshadow . - Pink blusher . - Black face paint or liquid eyeliner . - Sponge and some makeup brushes . Sarah chose a pastel Catrina face for me, a soft pretty look quite different from the black and red scheme . We used water-base face paints with sponges and brushes . After the base and contouring, draw a circle around each eye in turquoise and fill it in, then add small lines . Steps: . 1. Apply white (or mint) base to face leaving the eyes. Sponge on face shaping such as sullen, sculpted cheekbones for a real skull look (even though it's still pretty!) 2. Draw a circle around each eye in turquoise and fill it in . 3. Add small dots or lines around the outer circle of the eyes . 4. Add a dusting of pink blush on the cheek bones . 5. Draw on the lines from each corner of the mouth and add vertical ones . 6. Add black tip to nose . Draw on the lines from each corner of the mouth and add vertical ones . The complete look was quite striking,and you can make it even more extravagant with a flower garland . STEP THREE: NAILS . Nail artist Emily from WAH London did my nails at the event. We did 8 nails in one base plain colour, and the nail on the ring finger of each hand in a Day Of The Dead design. To do all 10 you'd need about a day and infinite patience! We used seven colours on each skull nail (if you're counting the white base!), eight tiny gold balls, a couple of 3D fimo flowers and 2 gems. You can get WAH Nail Art Pens from their website or from Boots, at £7 per colour. You can also get all sorts of nail art tools, fimo pieces (like the little clay flowers used for the skull eyes) and gems from eBay. Steps: . 1. File and buff nails, then apply base coat . 2. Paint the nail all white . 3. Start with the triangle on the forehead, then the nose, then the teeth: Create a straight line near the edge of the nail, then create the scallopedgnashers . 4. Use fimo 3D flowers for the eyes and stick gem in centre (you can get these on eBay!) 5. Finally, be creative! Add beads, swirls, dots and hearts with a nail art pen . 6. Seal with top coat . Cheeky tip: If you have a gel kit, leave the flowers off, apply a coat of clear top gel, pop the flowers and gems on, and cure the nail. This should make it hold for much longer.

"A seriously burned father hurled himself into an inferno in a desperate attempt to save his wife and five of his children, it emerged today. Yelling out for his wife, Bassam Kua, 51, tried to reach them, but couldn't. His daughters Amal, nine, and Hanin, 14, their younger brothers Yehya, two, and Mustafa, five, and also their mother Mona, 41, died in the blaze. Tragic: Basma (left), Yehya (centre) and Hannin died in the blaze . The family's eldest daughter Nur, 16, survived by jumping out of an upstairs window and the father escaped through the back door. But Nur is still in a critical condition, officials said. Father Bassan is stable. Thirty firefighters were called to . the semi-detached property in Sonia Gardens, Neasden, north-west London during the early . hours of yesterday morning after a blaze took hold of the ground and first . floors. Tributes: Flowers are left at the Kua's house . Devastated: A community mourns sisters Basma, 13, and Hannin, 14 . The fire ravaged both the ground and first floors of the semi-detached house in Neasden, north-west London . A picture posted on a Facebook tribute page identifies a young girl wearing red as the 13-year-old victim Basma. The family are believed to be Palestinian refugees who came to Britain seeking a better life. They were renting the semi-detached house. The fire is being treated as . unexplained, and the Metropolitan Police and London Fire Brigade have . begun an investigation, a police spokesman said. Matthew Gardner, Met Police borough commander, said it was 'not being treated as suspicious'. At a press conference this afternoon, he said officers would be making 'reassuring patrols' across the area in the coming days. Neighbour Mary O'Keefe, 54, told The People: 'There was a loud woosh like a gas canister had blown up and I heard a man shouting over and over again, ""My wife, my wife'. 'After that all I could hear were children crying and screaming. It was terrible.' Scroll down for video . A neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I was in my room and the window was open. 'I heard a loud bang, it was literally like an explosion, almost like a bomb. 'I thought it was really strange and . within four minutes I heard sirens and police cars and we looked out the . window and the fire had literally reached the top within five minutes. 'We all went outside and we saw firemen looking out the window and shouting ""there's people in there"".' 'It was horrific, my dad says he's never seen anything like it in his whole life, honestly I was so shocked.' Tia . Hirani, 13, said in the immediate aftermath: 'I'm not 100 per cent sure . if it was Basma in the fire but from here it looks like it was her . house. 'She's one of the most caring people . I've ever met, she helps everyone. 'I've known her for two years roughly, . we go to Crest Academy together. 'I've known her from year seven, we've had a few falling outs but that's just what friends do. 'She's got an older sister called Noor, I think she just finished year eleven but I'm not sure. 'I'm quite scared in case it is . actually her house, I'm just worried in case it's her house because me . and her are quite best friends.' Tia said she had tried calling her friend but had not been able to get through. Another friend of Basma Kua, Lareb . Nasar, 13, was at the scene and said: 'I got here and found out that it . might have been her house. I'm really worried and really upset as well, . it's a very tragic incident.' Asked what her friend was like, Lareb . said: 'Basma was really good at English and she loved writing, she was . good at science as well. It is not yet known how the fire, which left six dead, started . 'She . was always one of the smartest in our years and she was a really good . person as well.' Both girls said they thought that the Kua family are . originally from Palestine. The fire brigade said the blaze was under control by 2.50am. An . LFB spokesman said: 'It is understood that there were six fatalities - . it is thought that this may be three children, two teenagers and one . adult, but we await confirmation. 'Two further people escaped from the . house before firefighters arrived at the scene, both were injured and . were taken to hospital by ambulance.' The fire swept through the house in the early hours of the morning . Despair: A friend of the family is taken to the scene of the tragedy . An . LAS spokeswoman said that the two injured victims, a 51-year-old man . and 16-year-old girl, were taken to Saint Mary's Hospital in Paddington. She said: 'We were called at 12.51am . by the LFB to reports of a fire at Sonia Gardens. 'We sent the air . ambulance doctor in a car, four ambulance crews and a hazardous area . response team. 'Sadly . four youngsters and an adult were dead at the scene. 'Our staff treated a . five-year-old boy in cardiac arrest but despite extensive efforts they . were unable to resuscitate him. Firefighters were called during the early hours of this morning after the blaze took hold . A forensics officer and firefighters attempt to establish what caused the devastating blaze . 'We treated two further patients for burn injuries, a man, reported to be 51 and a 16-year-old female. They were both taken to St Mary's hospital as a priority.' A Met Police spokesman said the girl was understood to be in a critical condition while the man was less serious. He . added that they were awaiting official confirmation of the six deaths . and that post-mortem examinations would be scheduled in due course. 'We . are working with the fire brigade to establish the circumstances of the . fire but it is currently being treated as unexplained,"" he added. Tragedy: Six people died in the house fire in Sonia Gardens, Neasden . Station manager Glen Gorman, who attended the scene, said: 'There's no doubt, this is an absolute tragedy. 'My thoughts, and those of my colleagues at the London Fire Brigade, are with the friends, family and loved ones of those affected at this extremely sad and difficult time. 'We are now working with the police to ensure a full and thorough investigation is carried out.' He added: 'Crews worked extremely hard in some very, very, difficult conditions and were able to prevent fire spreading to adjoining properties and causing further injuries or even further tragedy.'","Sisters Basma, 13, Amal, 9, and Hannin, 14, killed in blaze .

"A food factory worker was killed when a 'wall' of frozen fish pallets fell on top of him as he tried to rebuild a stack that had already toppled over once, an inquest heard. Tomas Suchy, 22, was helping colleagues re-stack a pile of boxes which had fallen over in the store room of Interfish in Plymouth, Devon, when the incident occurred. The Slovakian-born worker and three fellow employees had almost finished stacking the pallets in the stock room, where temperatures are -25C, when the pile gave way. Tomas Suchy, 22 (pictured), was helping colleagues re-stack a pile of pallets - each containing 52 boxes -which had fallen over in the store room of Interfish in Plymouth, Devon, when he was crushed by them falling . A co-worker sounded the alarm by shouting 'run away' but it was too late and Mr Suchy was killed instantly by 'catastrophic' head injuries caused by the falling boxes. The boxes weighed 25 kilos and there were 52 on each pallet. Mr Suchy, who studied architecture at university, was hit by a number of pallets and also suffered a number of other fatal injuries, the inquest into his death in Plymouth heard yesterday. Robert Lanjeckl, who had worked at Interfish for a year prior to the accident, told the inquest: 'We had nearly finished the work and then suddenly (a co-worker) was shouting ""run away"". 'The whole wall just fell over.' The inquest also heard from former employees of Interfish, who said it was not an isolated incident and criticised the company over its poor health and safety. Tom Reid, a former forklift-driver at Interfish said that he had been involved in a similar incident in the past, and suffered a shoulder injury from falling boxes of fish. He described the pallets as in 'pretty bad condition' and said that he had warned his manager of the dangers. He said: 'I told my manager: ""This is s***. It is dangerous"". 'He said: ""Do the best you can"" and to ""carry on"".' The Slovakian-born worker suffered 'catastrophic' head injuries after being crushed by pallets, which fell on top of him while he was trying to stack them at food-processing firm Interfish (pictured) in Plymouth, Devon . Emma O'Hara, a health and safety executive, said there was 'no robust monitoring' at the food processing firm. She told Mr Suchy's inquest: 'The boxes were stacked excessively high. Some of the stacks looked unstable and were leaning into one another. 'Some had not been placed directly on the one below and one stack was balanced on only two boxes of fish that weren't palletised. 'There were a number of damaged boxes and pallets. 'There was no safe system of work or instruction to staff. Safe checking relied on (experienced) staff working in the area.' After Mr Suchy's death, the food processing company was handed four prohibition notices and one improvement notice by the Health and Safety Executive. The firm complied with each and introduced a range of measures to ensure similar incidents do not occur. The legal representative for Interfish said: 'Everything the company was asked to do was done.' The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death at the inquest.","Tomas Suchy was helping colleagues re-stack pile of boxes at food factory .

"A female school teacher in California has been arrested after allegedly having sexual encounters with a female student in her classroom. Rebecca Eileen Diebolt was arrested yesterday by detectives in Placentia on suspicion of allegedly copulating with a person under the age of 18 while working at Valencia High School. She is also accused of sexual penetration with a person under the age of 18. Rebecca Eileen Diebolt, a 35-year-old teacher, who has been arrested for allegedly having a sexual relationship with a female pupil .

"Not certain: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend expressed her uncertainty that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone shooter in her uncle's 1963 assassination . The niece of president John F Kennedy said today she's not certain Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone shooter in her uncle's assassination 50 years ago. Former Maryland Lt Governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend expressed her doubt in an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. 'I don't know, I don't know,' she said. 'I think, I don't know.' Townsend is the niece of President . Kennedy, as the eldest child of younger brother Robert F Kennedy. While her father was the victim of an assassination as well, she doesn't . believe it's helpful to dwell on the past. 'I'm . not going to solve that problem and what I'm going to do is focus on . things to make a difference,' she said. 'That was a really terrible time . in our country's legacy.' Conspiracy . theories surrounding the president's assassination have been reviewed . in recent weeks as the nation approaches the 50-year anniversary of his . assassination. President Kennedy was shot while driving in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. Moments before: President Kennedy was shot on November 22, 1963 as he was driving through Dallas, Texas with his wife, first lady Jacqueline Kennedy . Family ties: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend is the daughter of JFK's brother, Robert F Kennedy (right). Kathleen is pictured between her father and mother Ethel, with brothers Joseph Patrick II (second left) and Robert Francis Jr (left) The main suspect behind the assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, was apprehended shortly after the shooting, but shot and killed himself by nightclub operator Jack Ruby as he was being transferred to county jail. Since Oswald never got a trial, no one knows for certain his motivations behind the assassination. While conspiracy theories surrounding Kennedy's death have largely been downplayed in the past, they are now becoming more mainstream with testimonies like Townsend's. Secretary of State John Kerry also recently lent credibility to one conspiracy theory, during an interview with Tom Brokaw about the assassination. Secretary Kerry revealed that he doesn't . believe Oswald would have worked alone as the government claimed in . their official finding. Suspect: Secretary of State John Kerry said that he believes that an outside force- possibly in the Soviet Union or Cuba- influenced Lee Harvey Oswald's decision to kill President Kennedy . 'To this day, I have serious doubts that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,' Kerry said. 'I . certainly have doubts that he was motivated by himself, I mean I'm not . sure if anybody else is involved- I won't go down that road with respect . to the Grassy Knoll theory and all that- but I have serious questions . about whether they got to the bottom of Lee Harvey Oswald's time and . influence from Cuba and Russia.' The particular theory that Kerry mentioned is one that was ignored by the Warren Commission who investigated the 1963 shooting. A . number of witnesses recalled seeing smoke and smelling gunpowder near a . grassy knoll along the parade route, hinting that there could have been . a second shooter who fired from a different angle. Looking back: The interview was part of a series being compiled by Tom Brokaw (left) about the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's death . The connections that Lee Harvey Oswald had to Russia and Cuba that the Secretary of State mentioned are far more factual convictions, as it is known that Oswald defected to the Soviet Union and moved there. He only returned to the U.S. the year before Kennedy was shot. When he did come back to the U.S., Oswald lived in New Orleans and rented out a room from an advocacy group called Fair Play For Cuba. He spent a good deal of time with communist sympathizers, and traveled to Mexico in September 1963- just two months before Kennedy's assassination- in hopes of obtaining a visa and going on to Cuba, but his visa application was rejected. ‘I think he was inspired somewhere by something and I don't know what or if or any- I can't pin anything down on that,’ Kerry said in the interview.","Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said today she's uncertain Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone shooter in her uncle's 1963 assassination .

"An 80-year-old Jewish woman has spoken of how a picture of her at six-months-old was declared the image of a 'perfect Aryan baby' by the Nazi party and used in propaganda material. Hessy Taft was taken by her mother to well-known Berlin photographer Hans Ballin to have her baby photograph taken in 1935. Unbeknown to her family, Mr Ballin submitted the picture to a competition run by the Nazi party to find the 'perfect Aryan baby'. Hessy Taft, an 80-year-old Jewish woman, has spoken of how a picture of her at six-months-old was declared the image of a 'perfect Aryan baby' by the Nazi party and used in propaganda material . Prof Taft told Germany's Bild newspaper: 'I can laugh about it now. But if the Nazis had known who I  really was, I wouldn't be alive.' The picture was believed to have been chosen as the winner by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, The Telegraph has reported. Prof Taft's mother, Pauline Levinsons, was unaware the picture had been submitted to the competition until she saw her daughter on the front cover of a Nazi family magazine some months later. She confronted the photographer, who told her: 'I wanted to make the Nazis ridiculous.' The image also went on to appear on postcards. The Nazi party, however, never discovered the true identity of the baby girl. Prof Taft, who is now a chemistry professor in New York, recently handed the magazine featuring her baby photograph on the cover to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Israel. Prof Taft, who is now a chemistry professor in New York, recently handed the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Israel the magazine featuring her baby photograph on the cover . Goebbels played a key role in implementing Hitler's agenda after he was put in charge of the party's propaganda machine. He organised attacks against Jewish people, banned them from the world of the arts and media, censored the news and supported Nazi propaganda films. As the Second World War turned in favour of the Allies, he increased his propaganda in order to convince the German people of the idea of 'total war' and mobilization. Goebbels killed himself and his wife, and their six children with cyanide capsules the day after Hitler in 1945. The picture was believed to have been chosen as the winner by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels (pictured) Last week it was reported historians had discovered Hitler was a tax dodger who hid a vast fortune across several Swiss bank accounts. Documents have emerged showing the dictator amassed hundreds of millions of pounds in today’s money, which he concealed from the German people. It appeared to vanish completely after his death, along with his substantial art collection. But historians have now managed to trace the money through tax documents and bank statements. They believe he was worth around 1.1billion Reichsmarks, the equivalent of £3.6billion today.","Baby picture of Hessy Taft submitted to Nazi contest by Berlin photographer .

"Syria's spiraling violence has resulted in the confirmed killings of nearly 93,000 people, but the real number is likely to be far higher, the United Nations revealed today. The new death toll released in Geneva points to the seemingly unstoppable carnage that has engulfed Syria for more than two years. An average of more than 5,000 people have been killed every month since July, while the Damascus region and Aleppo have recorded the highest tolls since November, the UN's human rights office said in its latest study of documented deaths. Among the victims were at least 6,561 children, including 1,729 children younger than 10. Scroll down for video . Toll of civil war: A picture taken in April shows a mass grave of people allegedly killed by Syrian forces. Nearly 93,000 people have been killed in the conflict, the UN said today . In Damascus, officials said that at least one mortar shell fell on the edge of Damascus International Airport close to the runway, briefly disrupting flights in and out of the capital. The country's transportation minister Mahmoud Ibrahim Said told Syrian TV that a shell fired by 'terrorists' struck near a warehouse, breaking its windows and injuring a worker there. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says rebel fighters targeted the airport with home-made rockets. The attack came a few weeks after the government announced it had secured the Damascus airport road, which had been targeted by rebels in the past. The incident also came as President Bashar Assad's forces wage an offensive to drive rebels out of central provinces of Homs and Hama, as well as the northern province of Aleppo, following a major success in regaining control of the strategic town of Qusair near the border with Lebanon. Shocking: A boy carries a weapon as he walks with members of the Free Syrian Army in Deir al-Zor. Among the victims in the conflict were at least 6,561 children, including 1,729 children younger than 10 . Boosted by their battleground victory, regime forces appear set on securing control of the central region, a linchpin area linking Damascus with regime strongholds on the Mediterranean coast, and Aleppo to the north. In a new analysis of the Syrian death toll issued in Geneva, the U.N.'s human rights office documented 92,901 killings between March 2011 and the end of April 2013. But the U.N.'s top human rights official, Navi Pillay, said it was impossible to provide an exact current figure. The last such analysis, released in January, documented nearly 60,000 killings through the end of November. Since then, U.N. officials had estimated higher numbers. 'The constant flow of killings continues at shockingly high levels, with more than 5,000 killings documented every month since last July,' said Pillay. 'This is most likely a minimum casualty figure. The true number of those killed is potentially much higher.' Victim of war: A man carries a boy who was severely wounded during heavy fighting between Syrian rebels and Syrian Army forces in Idlib in March . The conflict in Syria began in March 2011 as largely peaceful protests against Assad's autocratic regime. After a relentless government crackdown on the protests, many Syrians took up arms against the regime, turning the uprising into an armed rebellion that morphed into civil war. The U.N. said the average monthly number of documented killings has risen from around 1,000 per month in the summer of 2011 to an average of more than 5,000 per month since last July. At its height from July to October 2012, the number of killings rose above 6,000 per month. 'Civilians are bearing the brunt of widespread, violent and often indiscriminate attacks which are devastating whole swaths of major towns and cities, as well as outlying villages,' Pillay said. 'Government forces are shelling and launching aerial attacks on urban areas day in and day out, and are also using strategic missiles and cluster and thermobaric bombs. Opposition forces have also shelled residential areas, albeit using less fire-power, and there have been multiple bombings resulting in casualties in the heart of cities, especially Damascus.' The most documented killings were in rural Damascus, with 17,800 people dead. Next were Homs, with 16,400; Aleppo, 11,900; and Idlib, 10,300.","Victims include 6,561 children, of whom 1,729 were under ten years old .

"An expedition to bring back the remaining gold from a steamship that sank in 1857 off South Carolina in one of the nation's worst maritime disasters has recovered almost 1,000 ounces of gold - the first gold recovered from the wreck in almost a quarter century. The S.S. Central America was bringing gold back from the California when it sank in a hurricane claiming 425 lives. In addition, thousands of pounds of gold went to the bottom aboard the 280-foot, side-wheel steamship. About $50 million was recovered during expeditions to the wreck in the late 1980s and early 1990s before legal disputes shut down the operation. Odyssey Marine Exploration of Tampa, Florida, announced Monday that almost 1,000 ounces of the gold was recovered during a reconnaissance dive last month. Scroll down for video . Discovery: Five gold bars recovered from the wreck of the S.S. Central America off the South Carolina coast are seen in this April 15, 2014, photograph provided by Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. Odyssey announced on Monday, May 5, 2014, that the bars are among nearly 1,000 ounces of gold that has been initially recovered from the wreck of the ship that sank during a hurricane in 1857. An earlier expedition a quarter-century ago recovered gold bars and coins worth about $50 million at that time . Worth a fortune: These gold bars were salvaged during Odyssey's first reconnaissance dive to the SS Central America shipwreck site, which lies 2,200 meters deep and 160 miles off the coast of South Carolina . The newly recovered gold includes five gold bars and two $20 Double Eagle gold coins. One of the coins was minted in San Francisco the year that the Central America sank. The gold bars weigh between 106 and 344 ounces. 'While we weren't planning to recover gold so quickly, it did confirm that the site has not been disturbed since it was last visited in 1991 and there is gold remaining,' said Mark Gordon, Odyssey's president and chief operating officer. An expedition that left North Charleston in April is expected to be on the site about 160 miles off the coast until late summer. Gordon said that in recent weeks the crew of 41 aboard the Odyssey Explorer has been conducting an extensive survey of the site and the recovery of more gold will begin once that is completed. It is not clear how much gold might remain. The ship was carrying gold bars shipped by banks and commercial interests. Passengers were thought to be carrying a lot of gold of their own in the form of coins — perhaps an amount equaling the commercial shipment. The initial expeditions 25 years ago were halted because of legal disputes. Searching for treasure: In this April 22, 2014, file photo, the Odyssey Explorer sits at a dock in North Charleston, South Carolina. The vessel left in April 2014, on an expedition to recover the remaining gold from the wreck of the S.S. Central America off the South Carolina coast . One of . them involved investors from Ohio who staked out the money for shipwreck . enthusiast Tommy Thompson, an Ohio native, who led the 1988 expedition . that recovered the initial cache of gold. The . investors claimed they had fronted Thompson almost $13 million but . never saw any return. Thompson has been a fugitive for almost two years . after failing to show up for a court hearing. A deal approved by an Ohio judge in March cleared the way for the new expedition. The . receiver for Thompson's companies will get more than half of anything . that is recovered, to be disbursed in part to the investors who backed . the initial expedition. The . work to recover the gold follows a long court battle over treasure . salvaged from the shipwreck in the late 1980s by a pioneering young . engineer whose efforts were detailed in the 1998 bestselling book, Ship . of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea. The . 85-metre-long sidewheel steamship carried as much as 19 tonnes of gold . ingots, freshly minted gold coins and raw gold from the California . mines, as well as the personal wealth and belongings of its 477 . passengers, most of whom were lost when the ship sank in September 1857. Watery grave: The SS Central America sunk in 1857, drowning 425 of its 477 passengers and crew and taking with it a fortune in gold . The ship's gold was initially valued at $760,000 US in 1857 but is worth millions of dollars today, according to Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc, a Florida-based company which won the contract to revisit the shipwreck. 'There's no doubt in our minds that there's going to be an economic return,' Mark Gordon, the company's president and chief operating officer, said on Monday. Gold recovered from the ship by a team led by Ohio engineer Tommy Thompson, which discovered the Central America using sonar and robotic technology he developed, became the focus of an extended legal fight over rights to the treasure and return for investors. Thompson has been a fugitive since 2012 when he failed to appear in court. Last year, a court in Ohio appointed a receiver who will distribute some of the profits from further exploration to the former investors. In March, the receiver awarded Odyssey the contract to revisit the shipwreck, which lies over 257 kilometres offshore and about 2.2 kilometers below the surface. Remaining riches: An Ohio judge approved a deal to recover the remaining gold from a ship that sank off the Carolina coast . 'We know that the wreck was only partially excavated, only about five per cent of the site,' Gordon said. The . company's research vessel, Odyssey Explorer, sailed from Charleston, . South Carolina, last week with 41 crew members for a project he . estimated will cost between $5 and $10 million. The . Central America steamship ran between Panama and New York, carrying . prospectors and their fortunes made in the California Gold Rush. On its . last trip, it held tons of commercial gold valued at about $93,000 in . 1857 and passenger gold valued at up to $1.2 million, court experts . estimated. Historians . say the ship's sinking triggered a New York banking panic that was part . of a larger U.S. financial crisis known as the Panic of 1857. U.S. $20 Double Eagle gold coins fetch $5,000 apiece on average from collectors, he said. The market price for pure gold bullion Monday was around $1,309 per troy ounce. Bob Evans, of Recovery Limited Partnership, the court-appointed receiver that hired Odyssey, told Bloomberg there may be up to $86 million of gold still lying on the ship. Researchers will remain on site for up to five months, rotating crew around the clock and making occasional port calls on Charleston, South Carolina, Gordon said. The company expects to report in about 60 days what the wreck might yield.","The SS Central America sunk off the coast of South Carolina in a hurricane in 1857 .

"Groningen attacking midfielder Albert Rusnak is being earmarked for a return to the Premier League this summer - despite only leaving Manchester City last month. A clutch of top-flight sides, including West Ham and Swansea, are monitoring the Slovakia Under 21 international after earning rave reviews in Holland this season. Italian side Palermo are also keeping close tabs on the creative midfielder. Albert Rusnak is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs . Rusnak joined Groningen in January after being released by Manchester City . Rusnak has developed a reputation of scoring spectacular goals during his time in the Eredivise this season, and his strikes have not gone unnoticed. The 20-year-old spent the first half of the season on loan at Dutch side SC Cambuur, where he scored four goals in 17 starts for the club. His displays at SC Cambuur alerted Groningen, who moved for Rusnak on a permanent move after the forward was allowed to leave City on a free transfer. And the ex-City man has continued his penchant for spectacular goals at his new club, scoring two in six games. The attacking midfielder took the decision to leave City last year in search of first-team football. Rusnak was highly-rated by City coaches following his arrival from FC Kosice as a teenage prodigy. But the club's big spending era ultimately meant the talented Slovakian could not break into the senior set-up. And the youngster could now be set to line-up against City as early as next season as English sides weigh up a summer swoop.","West Ham and Swansea are keen to sign midfielder Albert Rusnak .

"Two male nurses were caught on camera performing sexual acts on and beside a 98-year-old stroke victim. The in-home nurses, Russel Torralba and Alfredo Ruiz, masturbated and fondled each other at the foot of the woman's bed in San Diego and are now being investigated for their shocking behavior, XETV reports. In one instance one of the men performed an explicit act on the woman’s body. Scroll down for video . Home footage: Two male nurses have been accused of engaging in a sex act while caring for an elderly stroke patient after this footage of the alleged incident emerged . Fellow nurse Russel Torralba has also been charged with neglect by a caregiver and a lewd act by a caregiver but he remains at large . The woman is unable to speak or communicate with her hands after suffering a stroke and right-side paralysis in 2005, but is fully aware of her surroundings, the family’s attorney, William Berman, says. 'I myself couldn't believe it,' Berman told XETV. He said it was the most shocking case of elder abuse he has seen in 15 years of practice in that specialty . The home-shot footage is from March 3 and March 11, 2011. Family members have additionally discovered instances of sexually inappropriate acts on five occasions dating back to February 27, according to public records. The family had been paying Torralba and Ruiz $55 an hour, over $1,300 a day, for their services. In court: Alfredo Ruiz, 42, is alleged to be one of the nurses in the video footage and has been held on $200,000 bail . The current suspension on the two men bars them from working for home health agencies, but allows them to work in hospitals. A hearing on the permanent suspension of their licenses is scheduled for November 14. The state Department of Consumer Affairs launched an investigation last year into AMS Home Care Solutions, the agency the men worked for. 'We are working to shut them down,' Russ Heimerich, a spokesman for the department told the San-Diego Union-Tribune. The San Diego District Attorney's office is reviewing the case for possible criminal prosecution. The case against the two men has been adjourned by a San Diego court until January .

"Two Met police officers will face a court trial in a rare private prosecution over claims they smashed their way into a man’s home and kidnapped him. Sergeant Gareth Blackburn, 38, and Detective Constable Stephen MacDonald, 42, were summoned to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court today to face allegations of affray, burglary, aggravated burglary, misconduct in public office, kidnap and false imprisonment. It is alleged they unlawfully entered the home of former aircraft engineer Michael Doherty, 40, in West Drayton, Middlesex and forcibly removed him. Accused: Sgt Gareth Blackburn (left) and Det Stephen MadDonald (right) are alleged to have entered unlawfully smashed their way into Michael Docherty's home and forcibly removed him . Mr Doherty, who has brought the private prosecution against the officers, claims they smashed their way into his home with a battering ram in front of his terrified wife and daughter on September 4 2008. Doherty had reported a crime to police but when they failed to take action he repeatedly phoned the police station. Claim: Michael Docherty says the two officers trespassed into his home on September 4 2008 . He was then accused of harassing a civilian worker at the station and the two officers came to his address to arrest him. According to the summons, issued by District Judge Deborah Wright at Uxbridge Magistrates court in west London last month, the two officers trespassed and 'attempted to inflict grievous bodily harm on the home owner.' The summons says: 'You were on the property as a trespasser and you threatened to smash down a glass-panelled door which the homeowner was holding closed. 'You threatened and used a battering ram to support your threat of violence. The occupants were caused fear for their personal safety. 'You wilfully failed to perform your duty to such a degree that it amounted to an abuse of the public trust which had been placed in you.' Both officers are alleged to have carried Doherty away 'when you had no lawful authority to do so. 'There was no consent from the victim and you used unlawful violence to carry out this kidnap.' 'You were tasked to carry out enquiries into allegations of harassment, however when lawfully refused entry to the home of Mr Doherty you did without lawful authority force entry into their private home,' it says. The officers, who remain on full duties and gave their address as Uxbridge Police Station, will appear at Southwark Crown Court for a plea and case management hearing on October 19. The issuing of a summons by a district judge against police officers is extremely rare. Criminal cases are usually brought by the Crown Prosecution Service. The Metropolitan police opposed the granting of the summons.

"The attention may be focused on Andy Murray as he attempts to claim the Norman Brookes . Challenge Cup for the first time in Australia, but, as always, his girlfriend Kim Sears stole the spotlight. The 25-year-old showed off her toned and tanned legs in a pair of Ted Baker shorts as she cheered her partner on in his men's singles match against Go Soeda of Japan at the Australian Open 2014 tennis tournament in Melbourne. She looked fresh-faced as she opted for a natural make-up look and wore her hair in her trademark loose curls. High-street Kim strikes again!

His number one fan:  Kim opts for a low key look as she watches Andy in his first round match against Go Soeda of Japan during day two of the 2014 Australian Open at Melbourne Park . Eye spy!

"Some of Britain’s best hospitals are to set up outposts in China and the Middle East to generate more cash for the NHS. Great Ormond Street and the Royal Marsden are among those expected to build centres around the world, spreading their expertise in paediatrics and cancer care and generating much-needed income. The Health Service is hoping to capitalise on the publicity from Danny Boyle’s depiction of the NHS in the Olympics opening ceremony – watched by an estimated one billion worldwide – by launching a major push to win contracts with foreign health services. In the limelight: A tribute to the Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games . Saying thank you: Nurses and the NHS featured heavily in Danny Boyle's opening show for the London 2012 Olympics . The Department of Health and UK Trade and Investment, the business wing of the Foreign Office, are setting up an organisation called Healthcare UK to promote NHS brands, as well as private healthcare firms such as Bupa and drug companies including GlaxoSmithKline. Others being touted for business include the Moorfields Eye Hospital, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, world famous for its spinal injuries unit, and Imperial College Hospital, which is a world leader in robotic surgery. Some NHS trusts already attract paying patients from around the world. But health chiefs think they can provide a world-class service closer to their homes. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil and even Libya – where the post-Gaddafi regime is rebuilding the health service – are also thought to be prime targets for the new hospitals. Expanding: Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London is one of the institutions looking to build centres around the world . Making the most of a golden opportunity: The Royal Marsden Hospital, a specialist cancer treatment facility in London, is another organisation looking to expand . NHS Trusts will supply staff and expertise and train up local doctors and administrators to run a franchise operation. Already . Moorfields Eye Hospital runs a Dubai outpost while Imperial has two . successful diabetes centres in Abu Dhabi. And senior managers from South . East Coast Ambulance Trust recently visited Libya. Healthcare UK will seek to expand the opportunities for NHS trusts, as well as leading healthcare firms, and promote them in a co-ordinated way. A prospectus for foreign clients boasts: ‘The combined strengths of the NHS and industry make the UK a source of valuable experience and expertise and an ideal partner for overseas healthcare providers.’ Chinese officials have already told Health Secretary Andrew Lansley they admire his restructuring of the NHS and are keen to co-operate. Shaking some moves: A lot of the nurses featured in the Opening Ceremony actually work for the NHS . Success story: The Opening Ceremony was a big hit around the world . Health minister Anne Milton said: ‘The NHS has a world-class reputation, and this exciting development will make the most of that to deliver real benefits for both patients and taxpayers.’ Under the plans NHS Foundation Trusts will be allowed to plough profits from private operations into building franchise outlets abroad. Taxpayers’ cash will not be used. Officials also envisage some NHS Trusts would decide to join forces with private companies who could provide the initial capital to build overseas hospitals and they would then take on the financial risk. UKTI hopes the initiative will also allow  medical technology firms to sell their products abroad, generating valuable income for the UK. The Department of Health insists no project will get the green light if it hurts patient care in the UK. A spokesman said: ‘Under no circumstances will the quality or extent of NHS services be compromised by the sharing of NHS expertise abroad. ‘If anything the reverse will be true, as NHS Trusts will benefit from increased income which will benefit services to patients.’","Hospitals expected to set up centres around the world include Great Ormond Street, Royal Marsden and Moorfields Eye Hospital .

"The 20-year-old Indian woman who was gang-raped by 13 men was sexually assaulted while tied to a raised bamboo platform so her entire village could watch the torture, it emerged today. The head of the village, who led the kangaroo court which sentenced the woman to the savage rape as punishment for her falling in love with a man from another village, told the other judges to ‘go enjoy yourselves’. It was previously reported that she had been raped repeatedly in a hut, but today it emerged that she had been publicly humiliated on a platform set up close to the village headman's hut in the Suri district, West Bengal, the Times of India reported. Scroll down for video . Abhorrent: The 20-year-old woman, pictured arriving at a hospital in Western Bengal, was  raped by more than a dozen men while tied to a bamboo platform in front of the entire village . Police arrest around a dozen people in connection with the gang rape of a 20-year-old woman from Birbhum District in West Bengal, India. Disgusting: The village elder, who led the kangaroo court, told the other 'judges' to 'go enjoy themselves' with the 20-year-old . As the woman remained in intensive care today, further horrific details of the gang-rape punishment emerged. Villagers told the Times of India that after the kangaroo court ordered her to be sexually savaged after she was caught sitting with her Muslim lover in another village, she was dragged onto a raised bamboo platform 'so that the gang rape was viewed by the entire village, children included.' The head man, named as Boloi Murdy, who convened the makeshift court in the courtyard of his home, at first ordered the woman or her family to pay a fine of 50,000 rupees (£485). Murdy is reported to have told the men who gathered to watch the cruel spectacle: 'If the family does not pay up, go and enjoy yourselves.' The terrified woman and her lover had sat tied to separate trees as the 'court' discussed her 'crime'. Her lover was released after he promised to pay his fine, but the woman was not spared because her family did not have the money to pay immediately. Crime scene: The woman was tied to a tree (pictured) before she was dragged to a shed and raped . Unspeakable abuse: The woman, seen surrounded by family members as she is escorted into hospital, was locked in a shed and raped overnight by 13 men, ten of which had been 'judges' in the kangaroo court which sentenced her . The dozen men were tied together with ropes as they were taken to a police station . Inhumane: The 13 men pointed out by the woman is said to have been 'teenagers and men as old as her father' Disgusting crime: Some of the 13 suspects arrives in at a police station after being arrested . She was tied down to the bamboo platform and then, according to villagers who spoke to the Times of India, 'her cries rent the air all night but no-one stepped forward to help her Even her family, who lives 50 meters away, could not rescue her.' The paper said the woman's family was not given even a night's time to arrange for money to pay the fine and once the headman ordered rape it was free for all. 'Among those who raped her were teenagers and some old enough to be her father,' said a villager. 'Almost the entire village - including children - had joined the kangaroo court. 'All of them hailed it as the correct move.' The village has no electricity or school and, says the paper, the administration has always been wary of interfering with tribal traditions, leaving local rulers to live by their own laws. 'Even on Thursday, a day after the gang-rape by up to 13 people, the village didn't show any hint of repentance,' says the paper. 'The women, in fact, barracked police, insisting the men had done nothing wrong and that the woman had to be punished.' Even the authorities have shown indifference to the woman's treatment. The paper claims that at first the police did not seek custody of the accused men, allowing them to go free until their court appearances - which is unprecedented in gang-rape cases. Later they decided to hold the group in jail for 14 days. To add to the woman's shameful treatment, the public prosecutor did not even turn up in court because it was a holiday and no government official has bothered to meet the woman's family or visit the scene of the crime. Villagers were heard shouting that they would never allow the young woman or her family to return to the village, accusing the victim of framing the accused men because she had been ordered to leave the village if she continued with her affair. A local politician, Mukul Roy, in a statement said: 'The government is firm and will take strictest action against the culprits. It is a social malaise and we shall combat it politically, socially and administratively.'","Woman, 20, sentenced to 'gang rape' by village court in east India .

"On the two-year anniversary of the disappearance of a mother of three in Orlando, Florida, police have announced that they are set to reveal new evidence relating to the disappearance of Michelle Parker. Just hours after appearing on The People's Court in a dispute with her ex-fiance in 2011, Parker vanished, now police have announced that they will be holding a press conference on Monday to unveil 'new, never disclosed video evidence' relating to her disappearance. Mother of three, Parker disappeared on November 17, 2011 after dropping off her two youngest children - three-year-old twins - with their father, her ex-fiance Dale Smith. New evidence: Michelle Parker disappeared two years ago after appearing on The People's Court with her ex-finance Dale Smith, new police have revealed they have new video evidence . Earlier that day, the couple had appeared on an episode of The People's Court in a dispute over a lost $5,000 engagement ring. In the weeks after her disappearance, Parker's family and friends helped law enforcement conduct extensive searches, reports The Orlando Sentinel. Her black Hummer was found abandoned at an apartment complex and her cell phone was discovered underwater near a bridge, but no trace of the 33-year-old ever emerged. Orlando police Chief Paul Rooney referred to Smith as the prime suspect in Parker's disappearance, but he has never been charged. Crusading mother: Michelle Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in March claiming that Smith is to blame for the disappearance of the woman, who is presumed dead . Weeks after the disappearance, Smith was given full custody of the couple's young twins. Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, has unsuccessfully tried to get custody of the children. In March, she filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her daughter's former fiance. She is seeking damages totaling over $15,000, alleging that . Smith was 'negligent or otherwise committed a wrongful act and caused . the death' of the woman. Her body has never been found, but . the lawsuit claims that the 33-year-old 'died on or about November 17, . 2011 as a direct and proximate result of the negligence of the . defendant.' '[Yvonne Stewart] doesn't want to . believe it happened, but everyone knows what happened and when it . happened,' Parker estate attorney John Morgan said to ABCNews.com. 'We . think she was killed.' The lawyer claims he is in possession . of text messages between Parker and Smith, as well as other evidence . that he would no further elaborate on, saying that he does not want . Smith to be 'ready for that.' Dispute: Michelle Parker appeared on The People's Court to dispute an engagement ring with ex-fiance Dale Smith. The program aired two years ago and on the same day Parker disappeared . 'We'll be most interested when we get a chance to depose him,' Morgan said. 'Will he take the fifth or tell the truth?' Smith's attorney, Mark Nejame, . insists that Morgan and Parker's family have nothing to connect his . client to the woman's disappearance. 'They're barking up the wrong tree,' Nejame said. 'They've been frustrated for a long time because law . enforcement hasn't found a scintilla of evidence that ties him to her . disappearance or murder... Just because everyone thinks he did it doesn't . mean he did it.' The lawyer said that Smith . voluntarily spoke to police on four separate occasions and submitted to a . full home inspection just hours after his ex-fiancee was reported . missing. 'Our hearts go out to Michelle . Parker's family, truly, but sadly a lawsuit against Dale Smith is not . going to bring them any closer to finding out what happened to Michelle . Parker,' he said. 'Rocky': The couple's relationship was described as 'tense' by friends . The attorney described his client as a . good father to his five-year-old twins. Parker's 11-year-old son lives . with his father in Pennsylvania. The grandparents have a written . agreement with Smith for the custody of the children, but Stewart has . been pushing for clearer rights established and legal right to petition . the court for visitation. Stewart's missing daughter had a very stormy relationship with Smith. Police conducted a night-time raid on Smith's father's home during investigations but would not comment on the findings of the search or and what sparked the raid. Parker's friend Angela Launer told ABCNews.com: 'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself.' Launer, 34, said the relationship was 'rocky' and 'tense.' Dale Smith (left) remains the prime suspect in the unsolved disappearance of Michelle Parker (right) She said: 'He hurt my best friend. I didn't like him because he made her cry. No one should ever be treated that way.' Parker applied for a restraining order from Smith in 2009, but was denied one for lack of evidence. It has also been revealed that Smith was dishonorably discharged from the Marines in 2003 after several court martials, including military convictions for drug possession and domestic battery, reports Huffington Post. On the TV show Parker and Smith argued over whether Parker had to pay for a $5,000 engagement ring she tossed away during one of their arguments. The judge ruled the two should split the cost. Parker's family began to realize something was wrong when her 11-year-old son let the family know that he was home from school and his mother was not there. Launer said: 'She would never have taken off, done that to her brother, sister or mother... that's why we're crying every day.'","Michelle Parker, 33-year-old mother of three, argued with ex-fiance Dale Smith, 40, on The People's Court then vanished same day show was aired .

"Alexander Gustafsson entered the Octagon to a deafening reception from almost 30,000 fans, but left with tears in his eyes after a devastating punching display from Anthony Johnson. Johnson, in just his third fight at light heavyweight, landed a right hand early in the first round from which Gustafsson failed to recover. The Swede took a severe beating on the canvas before  referee Marc Goddard stepped in to end his punishment and set Johnson up for a shot at champion Jon Jones. VIDEO Scroll down UFC Fight Night Anthony Johnson & Alexander Gustafsson interviews . Anthony Johnson sends in a barrage of punches to stop Alexander Gustafsson in a stunning performance . Johnson celebrates his victory in the first round of what was expected to be a prolonged battle in Sweden . Johnson appeared as shocked as the near-30,000 crowd in the Tele2 Arena in Stockholm . 'Jon Jones, I hope you get well brother,' said Johnson. 'Let’s get this championship on and make the crowd excited about this.' Johnson was competing for just the third time since his return to the UFC less than a year ago. Having finally found a weight division to suit, the American upset Phil Davis with a unanimous points win in Baltimore. He followed that up with a stunning 44-second knockout of Antonio Rogerio Nogueira three months later. But Gustafsson was expected to provide an altogether tougher challenge. The Swede came agonisingly close to dethroning Jones in what was one of the best fights in UFC history in 2013. And after a second-round victory over Londoner Jimi Manuwa last March, Gustafsson was set for his rematch with Jones in September only for a knee injury to rule him out. While Jones would go on to beat Daniel Cormier in Las Vegas at the turn of the year, Gustafsson prepared for an emotional homecoming at the magnificent Tele2 Arena in Stockholm. Johnson's power was evident from the early stages as he rocked Gustafsson before going in for the finish . It was Johnson's right hand which did the damage and Gustafsson could not recover his senses . Johnson sensed he had Gustafsson in trouble and made sure he made no mistake in finishing the job . Gustafsson had hoped to set up a rematch with light-heavyweight champion Jon Jones with a victory . But his dreams of another title shot are now in tatters after Johnson's explosive performance. The No 3 ranked contender needed a little over two minutes to make a statement that was not lost on Jones. 'Wow,' he tweeted. 'Man this fight's going to be awesome.' Jones is currently dealing with the fall-out from testing positive for cocaine a month before his clash with Cormier but is expected to return later in the year. 'I'll be the hardest puncher he's ever faced and he's faced a lot of top quality guys,' Johnson said. 'Hopefully I can do things to him that no-one has ever done to him. 'Alexander gave him the worst beating he's had and hopefully I can give him one 10 times as bad. 'It didn't seem real. I couldn't believe I stopped the guy who, in my opinion, beat Jon Jones. No-one has ever stopped Alexander  like that before and I was just speechless.' Johnson lands a kick on Gustafsson as he takes complete control of the light-heavyweight showdown . Gustafsson made his entrance into the arena cheered on by 30,000 of his countrymen in Stockholm . Gustafsson lands a shot on Johnson but it proved to be a rare success before he was taken apart . Johnson was in only his third fight in the division since returning to the UFC early last year . Gustafsson was subjected to a long punishment on the canvas as he failed to defend himself adequetly . Johnson (right) celebrates after his stunning performance against Gustafsson in Stockholm . Gustafsson sits slumped on his stool after suffering his second defeat in three fights . Gustafsson, meanwhile, was still emotional sometime after the fight had ended. 'I got hit,' he said. 'I felt fine going into the fight and for the few minutes we were fighting. He caught me and took the opportunity. 'Anthony is a beast and he did what he had to do. 'I'm going to take a few days off and go back to the gym. You always learn from your mistakes and I learned I need to keep my guard up.' Earlier, in the co-main event, Dan Henderson suffered a controversial defeat to Gegard Mousasi. Henderson, fighting at middleweight for the first time in more than five years, was dropped in the first round and the fight was stopped quickly; perhaps prematurely. Henderson, who appeared at the post-fight press conference wearing a patch over his left eye, said: 'I got hit and I couldn't see very well out of my left eye. He just clipped me a little bit. But I was aware of what it the whole time, you know. But it’s not his fault, he is a good guy.' Mousasi, who bounced back from a defeat to Ronaldo Souza in September, said: 'I feel good. I like Dan Henderson but of course I’m happy and pleased that I won. It was a good victory. Gegard Mousasi punches Dan Henderson as he recorded a first-round victory in their middleweight clash . Mousasi dropped Henderson and pounced quickly to end the fight with a barrage of blows on the canvas . 'I thought it was a good stoppage. Right when he went down, I would have been able to put another punch in it but I didn’t because I thought the referee would stop it. 'And then I thought, well maybe they aren't going to stop it, so I kept punching afterwards. So I think it was a good stoppage.' In another potentially pivotal fight in the light-heavyweight division, Ryan Bader won a split-decision victory over Phil Davis after three tentative rounds. 'It was a split decision but I walked out with a win so I’m happy,' Bader said. 'Performance wise, I felt like I was a bit sloppy at times. He’s obviously a really good wrestler. His stand up is just sporadic. 'At the end of the day, I came out of there with a win and I got the job done. Now, back to training – try to sharpen up those skills. Who knows what’s next? 'I needed to get over that hump of beating one of those top five guys, so I’ll just go on from there. I’ve fought the who’s who of MMA so whoever is next, whatever is next, let’s just do it.'

"For Leanne, a 40-year-old website designer from Australia's Gold Coast, kicking back is a matter of saddling up. But her hobby isn't riding horses. Instead, it's becoming a replica of one, complete with a saddle, bridle and bit. Leanne, who goes by the name of Shyanne when in her pony get-up, also likes to trot about pulling her friend Grace behind her in a custom-made trap. Giddy up! Leanne, pictured with her friend Grace, spends her time off dressed up as a pony . Relaxing: Leanne says her penchant for pony-style dressing helps her relax and come out of her shell . But while it might sound bizarre, Leanne is adamant that not only is it just a bit of fun, it takes her to a 'wonderful place' where she can relax and truly be herself. When I'm in the pony gear, I feel freer,' she explains. 'It's about who you are, it's about expressing yourself. I become me.' Leanne, who has always been an animal lover, owns several real horses, as well as a cat named Ember, and says she sees her horses as equals. But when she becomes a horse herself, it is her friend Grace who takes the reins, leading her about and 'driving' the trap just as she would with a real pony. 'I steer by giving her commands via turns of the reins,' she explains. 'That's a good method and she can respond to pressure on either side of her mouth, same as you would with a horse.' Grace also has an insight into why Leanne loves becoming a pony so much, arguing that it is partly a way for her to overcome her crippling shyness. 'She is a very introverted person,' she explains. 'But when she's in that zone, she's another person. I think it's a way of expressing another large part 0f her personality. That's very much her identity.' 'It is very understandable that a shy person might love animal play,' comments sexologist and sociologist, Dr Carol Queen. 'Taking on a new identity or even just new garments can take you out of the cage of your own shyness. Passion: Leanne, who says she has always had pets, owns several real horses of her own . Unusual: Leanne goes for a trot, pulling her custom-made trap with her friend Grace holding the reins . 'There's something about the way she must feel in her pony finery with her mane and her tail and her ears and her beautiful bridle, the whole nine yards, that liberates her and gives her a more fabulous field in which to gallop.' And Leanne certainly isn't shy about getting out and about in her pony ensemble, despite the full look including a rather revealing rubber jumpsuit. From a trip to the shops, a gallop around the yard or even a day out at the races, nowhere is off limits for Leanne's pony persona. But although she does get the odd strange look, Leanne says the overwhelming reaction to her unusual look is a positive one. Equals: Leanne says she sees horses and ponies as her equals rather than as animals . Passion: Leanne is so comfortable in her pony ensemble, she has even worn it to go to the races . 'I think when the world looks at me as a pony, they see something that makes them think ""Oh my God, that's amazing"",' she says. But regardless of what people think of her look, the real attraction for Leanne is the sense of peace she gets from her pony alter-ego. For me, it's spiritual,' she says. 'It's a different realm. You're not worried about bills, you're not worried about going to work. 'I become freer, I'm me. I'm very introverted and I do express through being a pony girl. And that's a wonderful place to be for somebody. That's a great place to be.' Unfortunately, however, transforming into a pony doesn't come cheap with each of Leanne's ensembles costing between £5,000 and £10,000. Worth a try: Leanne says she would like to see other people giving pony play a try . Also expensive is the makeover currently underway in her back garden, which will eventually boast a set of human-sized stables and a sand-floored school. 'It's something to spend my money on,' she shrugs. Expensive though it might be, Leanne hopes that more people will give pony play a try - even if it means wearing an uncomfortable-looking bit. 'Once the bit's in, the tongue is out so you're not speaking,' she explains. 'If you drool while wearing a bit, you've got to be wearing the wrong-size bit.' Nevertheless, she adds, being in pony mode can take you to some 'wonderful places'. 'I get up, go to work but I just choose to escape sometimes,' she adds. 'I think more people should experience it. And if it's not fun, you're not doing it right!'","Leanne, 40, from Australia's Gold Coast, relaxes by dressing as a pony .

"Britain's oldest woman has died - two weeks after the death of Britain's oldest man. Grace Jones, the last surviving Brit who was born in the 19th Century, was 113 years and 342 days old when she passed away peacefully on Thursday. Her death - weeks before her 114th birthday - was announced days after it emerged Britain's oldest man Ralph Tarrant has also died, at the age of 110 years and 115 days. Britain's oldest woman Grace Jones, left, and Britain's oldest man Ralph Tarrant, right, have both died . Britain's oldest person Grace Jones, centre, pictured with her local MP Simon Hughes, left . Born on December 7, 1899, seamstress and civil servant Miss Jones was engaged to a soldier who was killed in action in the First World War. She never married, and spent almost her whole life living in her council flat in Bermondsey, south London, doing her own shopping well up to the age of 110. She stayed there even after a violent career criminal kicked the door down and pushed her up against a wall to steal £100 from her handbag - shortly after her 112th birthday. Speaking after Jesse Coker, 46, was jailed for four and a half years, she said: 'He said he was from the police. After I opened the door, he pushed me and got my bag. I have been frightened ever since.' The spinster, who outlived her seven siblings, added at the time: ‘I am so old that all my friends and family are now dead. I think I’m very lucky to have such good neighbours. ‘They are my family now, and they know it. They are very good to me.’ To your health! Britain's oldest man Ralph Tarrant, pictured turning 110, put his long life down to scotch with sugar and hot water. He died of pneumonia. His family said he was 'fun-loving' but 'grumpy at times' Ralph Tarrant, left was married to his wife Phyllis, right, for 78 years. They were Britain's oldest married couple . Ralph and Phyllis Tarrant in Llandudno, Wales, in 1933. They celebrated their platinum anniversary . The committed Christian was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital in London after a fall a few weeks ago and moved to a nursing home, where she died at about 10am today. Her MP, Simon Hughes, said: 'She went out as recently as this autumn, and was mentally as bright as a button with a brilliant memory right up until last Sunday.' 'Grace will be dearly missed by her many . friends and neighbours and by the wider Bermondsey community. Britain's new oldest woman is Ethel Lang. Born on May 27, 1900, she was just 171 days younger than Miss Jones and also worked as a seamstress. She lives in a care home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. Mrs Lang left school at 13 and in 1922 she married William Lang, a local plumber. She celebrated her 113th birthday in May in true English style - with a piece of cake and a cup of tea. Her granddaughter-in-law Denise Bates told the Barnsley Chronicle that Mrs Lang had lived in the town all her life. She told the paper in May: 'Ethel celebrated her special birthday quietly, receiving a birthday card from the Queen, and was visited by her family and friends who she enjoyed a piece of cake and a nice cup of tea with.' 'We are all . very sad today but we pay tribute to Grace for her wonderful, vibrant . and long life, for her commitment to her faith, her family and her . community, and we know that a woman of such strong Christian faith faced . death with no fear. 'Although she found her failing strength . frustrating, right up until her last week Grace's memory and intellect . were undimmed. 'All those who met Grace knew they had met one of London's most doughty individuals and she will never be forgotten.' Today it emerged RAF veteran and retired insurance worker Ralph Tarrant - who became Britain's oldest man in January - has also died. The sprightly pensioner also lived alone - smoking until the age of 70. He did his own shopping and celebrated his 110th birthday in July surrounded by family and friends, putting his longevity down to scotch with a drop of sugar and hot water. He had been one half of Britain's oldest married couple until his wife of 78 years, Phyllis, died aged 102 two years ago. The pensioner died of pneumonia on October 30 . at the Northern General Hospital in his home city of Sheffield. Speaking at his birthday this summer, he said: 'This birthday . is absolutely impossible to believe. 'I’ve been told by many I’m unique, how the days have gone I just don’t know, it’s hard to believe.' His secret to long life was 'a drop of . whiskey, with a bit of sugar, with a drop of hot water to make it like a . Drambuie. Mr and Mrs Tarrant, who were Britain's oldest married couple, on their wedding day in 1933 . 'I’ve been . very athletic and interested in health and strength from a young age.' Mr Tarrant had two children, eight grandchildren, 11 grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren. Born in . Nottingham on July 7, 1903, Mr Tarrant moved to Sheffield when he was seven. He . left school at 13 and started work as an office boy at a local . steelworks. Ralph Tarrant, who was Britain's oldest man until his death two weeks ago, pictured in his youth . He became a steel inspector and served as a . corporal in the RAF, then moved into selling insurance until his retirement - 45 years ago, in 1968. He met his wife Phyllis in 1922 and they married a day after his 30th birthday, in July 1933. They stayed together for 78 years, becoming Britain's oldest married couple. The pair lived independently together, and they loved travelling, shopping trips and lunch clubs. When Phyllis died in February 2011, the couple had a combined age of 209. His daughter Chris Carter said: 'He was amazing. He was very independent and very hardworking. 'I always considered him a fun-loving guy, although he was grumpy at times. He loved to walk, although the last month he couldn’t. 'He wasn’t going to give in, although in the end I think he knew. He was ready.' Chris' daughter, Tara, gave birth on the day before the pensioner’s funeral last Tuesday. She added: 'He went and gave room for another one to come in.' Miss Jones and Mr Tarrant lived through several key moments in human history. Miss Jones was born during Queen Victoria's reign and Mr Tarrant was born while King Edward VII was on the throne. They lived through both World Wars and 22 prime ministers. When Miss Jones was born, Australia was not even a country.

Its director Dr Stephen Coles, based at the University of California, specialises in performing autopsies on those aged over 110. He told MailOnline: 'They all have different ideas and some contradictory ones about their secret to long life. 'Some do say ""it's because I drink whisky"" but others say ""it's because I never drink whisky"". Some people say ""it's because I smoke cigars"" and we know that's wrong. 'We do a very careful analysis and it turns out there's very little, practically nothing in common between these people - different religions, occupations and nationalities. 'There's one thing that appears in all of these people and that's that they have long-living parents and siblings, and their children probably will be too.'","Seamstress Grace Jones was 113 and RAF veteran Ralph Tarrant was 110 .

"Kim Richards' says she warned her niece Alexia about her pitbull terrier Kingsley before the savage attack that resulted in the teen needing surgery. The attack on the 18-year-old saw the dog bite her multiple times, with the most severe wound ripping through the flesh on her hand to reach the bone in her thumb. She is understood to have required two different surgeries. And now Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Kim has released a statement to RadarOnline about the incident. Incident: Kim Richards has come out with a statement regarding the attack on her niece . 'The events that led up to Kingsley biting Alexia resulted from the girls entering my bedroom after I already told them my room was off limits,' Kim told the website. 'Alexia has been away from college for months and hasn't seen Kingsley in a long time. 'Kingsley is used to the home being full of children and since the kids have gone away, the house has become quiet. While the two have been very close and friendly in the past, the dog has become very protective of me in the meantime.' Adding: 'When guests are over, Kinglsey stays in my bedroom and has been given access to a special fenced in area in my backyard. Anyone entering the house is made aware that the dog should not be bothered.' Devoted mother: Kyle Richards sleeps over at Cedars Sinai hospital on Monday as her daughter Alexa is treated after being attacked by her aunt Kim's dog Kingsley in LA . Kim then went on to explain her recollection of the events on Saturday when her niece was savagely attacked:  'The second I realized Alexia had been bitten on the finger leaving a puncture mark on her thumb, I immediately called my sister, Kyle, and took her to the nearest emergency room.' The wound, however, was reportedly more than just a puncture, but a gash to the bone requiring two surgeries. 'After the wound was cleaned and bandaged the girls went on with their day and I stayed in contact to make sure that my niece was ok,' Kim continued. 'After she re-entered the hospital two days later, I have visited and continue to make sure that she is in good spirits. The one procedure that Alexia has had was to clean the wound to make sure it would not get infected.' Family pet: Kim with the dog that attacked her niece; it is not the first time Kingsley has bitten . She went on to discuss the fate of the dog: 'At this point I am looking at options to what the next step is for Kingsley,' she revealed. 'As many of you can relate, he is my best friend. This is a very difficult decision and time for all of us, but the safety of my family always comes first.' According to website TMZ Kingsley went for Alexia during a family gathering, early on Saturday morning at Kim's house. A group including Alexia's mother Kyle were at the home on Halloween, and had been near the dog without incident  when it 'went into attack mode out of nowhere'. Aggressive: The animal previously bit a trainer hired to domesticate it . The animal has previously featured in the plotline of RHOBH where it was seen being very aggressive towards other dogs. After Kim sought  help controlling the dog, it bit the trainer she hired, one of four known biting incidents. Back in March the dog savaged a friend of Kim's while she was sat on her bed chatting to the star. The bite went through to the woman's bone in her arm and paramedics were called. A further incident occurred when an unknown victim was bitten this summer. Following that attack LA's department of Animal Control Services did visit the home to assess the dog, but the animal was left in Kim's care. However as the latest attack was not reported to authorities, Kingsley remains at mother-of-four Kim's home. Attack: Kinglsey was seen biting his trainer in an old episode of the RHOBH . Unless a victim or member of their family contacts the ACS then no action will be taken. If a report is made an assessment will take place to decide if the animal is under control in Kim's care. ACS visited the star's home over the summer after it attacked another visitor, but at the time Kim was only given a warning. David Utter, who originally trained the pitbull, has also given a statement regarding the dog to TMZ. He claims the dog should be muzzled at all time and now that the dog has attacked four people direct and immediate action should be taken. Utter says the Kingsley should be immediately taken away from Kim. Kim's sister Kyle, mother to Alexia, has previously commented that she felt 'nervous' about Kingsley's behaviour. On an reunion episode of RHOBH earlier this year, Andy Cohen was seen reading a comment from a fan that stated: 'Kim I worry that I'm going to pick up that paper one day and read about your dog having eaten you.' Kyle admitted: 'I do worry a little bit to be honest. You hear these stories and I think oh my gosh. 'When she [Kim] doesn't answer her phone or a text I tell her ' I get worried that the dog maybe did something'.' Taking to her Instagram account, Kyle shared with 616,529 followers: 'Regarding Alexia: She was attacked by a dog and has to have surgery . Her philosophy: Kyle posted this inspirational message about her experience . And she said the attack on the trainer was a warning sign for her. 'I got nervous, just because of the stories I've heard. Nothing from what I seen, he's always sweet.' Kyle slept over at Cedars Sinai hospital in LA on Monday night, while Alexia underwent the first of two surgeries. Taking to her Instagram account, Kyle shared with 616,529 followers: 'Regarding Alexia: She was attacked by a dog and has to have surgery. 'As always, she is trying to make the best out of a bad situation .Thank you for your thoughts & well wishes'. The mother-of-four had earlier posted pictures of her daughter on a hospital bed with her family and friends around her. 'Slumber party at Cedars Sinai Hospital with @alexiaumansky @farrahbritt @sophiakylieee,' she wrote posing with her daughters. Flashback: Kyle, pictured, and Kim are on better terms these days, but the dog attack is bound to place a strain on their fiery relationship, seen here in the RHOBH finale episode in 2010, rowing with her sister . Pointing the finger: The squabbling sisters had an infamous showdown in the back of a limousine where Kyle accused her sister of being an alcoholic . While Kim and Kyle have been on better terms in recent years, the dog attack is bound to place a strain on their fiery relationship, which has been an ongoing storyline on The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills over the years. The finale of the first season in 2010 saw tensions coming to a head between the pair, with Kim's erratic behaviour and constant slurring of words leading her sister to surmise she had a substance abuse problem. The squabbling sisters had a dramatic showdown in the back of a limousine, with Kyle branding her sister an alcohol and threatening to withdraw financial aid she and husband Mauricio Umansky gave to her. Family: Kyle pictured with Alexia in May . Kim briefly entered rehab in December 2011, and later admitted that she was an alcoholic in an interview with Housewives mastermind Andy Cohen. Speaking about her sister's admission at the time, Kyle told Good Morning America: 'I'm proud to hear her say that. I'm proud of her. I know that's the biggest step in recovery, to admit that.' She went on: 'There were things going on that the audience wasn't aware of. I had had a lot of pain and built up anger and frustration towards [Kim], and obviously she did towards me too. It was a vicious cycle. 'It was very difficult to have people dissect and analyse your relationship thinking they know you from a TV show when it's been a long time in the making.' Kim, a former child Disney star, now says she is sober, which has been documented over the last couple of seasons of the reality show.","Alexia, 18, was bitten several times and required two surgeries .

"The planet's last major cold spell 13,000 years ago was caused by a catastrophic deluge of frigid fresh water from north-west Canada into the Arctic ocean, a new study suggests. Detailed computer simulations show meltwater from the enormous Laurentide Ice Sheet halted the sinking of very dense, saltier, colder water in the North Atlantic. That stopped the large scale ocean circulation - the so-called thermohaline circulation - that transports heat to Europe and North America, causing the continents to dramatically freeze. Detailed: A new model of flood waters from . the melting Laurentide Ice Sheet shows how water first flowed north-west . into the Arctic, weakening deep ocean circulation and leading to . the Earth's last major cold period . The findings offer a new explanation for the cause of this last big chill, which scientists had thought was caused by freshwater flowing into the Atlantic through Canada's Gulf of St Lawrence. It led to a cold spell lasting more than 1,000 years known as the Younger Dryas or 'Big Freeze', during which temperatures in parts of the northern hemisphere fell to about 10 degrees C colder than they are today. 'This episode was the last time the Earth underwent a major cooling, so understanding exactly what caused it is very important for understanding how our modern-day climate might change in the future,' said Alan Condron, of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Ice around the South Pole has expanded to cover a record area, scientists have revealed – after saying that the North Pole had lost an unprecedented amount of its ice. Researchers say – rather confusingly – that both occurrences are down to the ‘complex and surprising’ effects of global warming. The record Antarctic sea ice cover was revealed in satellite images from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado. At the end of the southern winter in September, ice covered 7.51million square miles of sea – more than at any time since records began in 1979. For the last 30 years the amount of Antarctic sea ice has been increasing by 1 per cent each decade. While the rest of the world has been getting warmer over the last 50 years, large parts of the Eastern Antarctic have been getting cooler. Scientists say a cooler Antarctic fits in with the unpredictable nature of climate change. The cooling began after Lake Agassiz, . at the southern edge of the Laurentide ice sheet covering much of the . Canadian Arctic, broke through an ice dam and dumped thousands of cubic . kilometers of cold water into the ocean. Using a high resolution, global, ocean-ice circulation model 10 to 20 times more powerful than previous ones, the researchers compared how meltwater from the two different drainage outlets affected ocean circulation. The original hypothesis, proposed 1989 by Wally Broecker of Columbia University, suggested that Lake Aggasiz drained into the North Atlantic down the St Lawrence River. But using the new model, Dr Condron, working with Peter Winsor of the University of Alaska, found that this proposed route would have weakened the oceans' thermohaline circulation by less than 15 per cent. That level of weakening, they say, is unlikely to have accounted for the 1,000-year cold climate event that followed the flood. Meltwater from the St Lawrence River actually ends up almost 1,900 miles south of the deep water formation regions, too far south to have any significant impact on the sinking of surface waters. By contrast, Dr Condron and Dr Winsor's model shows that if the meltwater first drains into the Arctic Ocean, narrow coastal boundary currents efficiently deliver it to the deep water formation regions of the sub-polar north Atlantic, weakening the thermohaline circulation by more than 30 per cent. They conclude that this scenario, showing meltwater discharged first into the Arctic rather than down the St. Lawrence valley, is 'more likely to have triggered the Younger Dryas cooling.'

Argentina's Patagonia ice-sheet: Much of . Europe and North America would have looked like this after the . meltwater from the Laurentide Ice Sheet brought about a dramatic global . cooling . Reporting their findings in the . journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they wrote: . 'With this higher resolution modelling, our ability to capture narrow . ocean currents dramatically improves our understanding of where the . fresh water may be going.' Dr . Condron added: 'The results we obtain are only possible by using a much . higher computational power available with faster computers. 'Older models weren't powerful enough to model the different pathways because they contained too few data points to capture smaller-scale, faster-moving coastal currents.' 'Our results are particularly relevant for how we model the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice sheets now and in the future. 'It is apparent from our results that climate scientists are artificially introducing fresh water into their models over large parts of the ocean that freshwater would never have reached. 'In addition, our work points to the Arctic as a primary trigger for climate change. This is especially relevant considering the rapid changes that have been occurring in this region in the last 10 years.'",Findings show how the conditions in the Arctic can act as a 'primary trigger' for climate change - relevant given the changes happening now .
"The Rangers Fans Fighting Fund will back The Rangers Supporters Trust with hard cash if need be in their bid to keep Ibrox Stadium out of the clutches of Mike Ashley. The RST welcomed the 'substantial legal fund available, should it be required,' to fight any attempt to give the Newcastle owner and Gers shareholder security over the cash-strapped club's two biggest assets. Gers fans protested outside Ibrox before the Championship clash with Hearts on Friday night after it emerged Ashley had filed documents notifying land register bosses that he planned to take out security on the stadium and Murray Park training ground, in return for a reported £10million loan offer. Mike Ashley (left), with Derek Llambias, has offered Rangers a £10m loan in bid to take control of the club . The future of the Scottish giants remains uncertain following continuing financial problems . Chairman David Somers previously stated that Ibrox would never be used as security against a loan. A spokesman for the Rangers Fans Fighting Fund said: 'The Rangers Fans Fighting Fund was launched by Ibrox legends Walter Smith and Sandy Jardine in 2012 to help safeguard and protect the club's future and assets. 'In recent days it has become crystal clear that the club's current board is considering the use of Ibrox Stadium and Murray Park in order to secure a further loan from Mike Ashley. 'Mr Ashley already has security over Edmiston House and the Albion Car Park and the RFFF, like almost all Rangers supporters, feels securitising our historic stadium and training ground is a step too far. 'Ibrox, in our view, is sacrosanct. It is a memorial to the sixty six who lost their lives (in the Ibrox Disaster). 'Some of the greatest names in Scottish football history have graced the hallowed turf down the years and it should never be used as collateral in order to secure a loan that is not in the best interests of the club. 'For that reason, the RFFF confirms it is willing to provide support and assistance to any fan group determined to protect the club's assets. Ashley wants to use the Ibrox Stadium and club's training ground as security against his loan . 'We enjoyed a positive meeting with representatives from the Rangers Supporters Trust yesterday and we have agreed to back their initiative to prevent the securitisation of Ibrox and Murray Park. 'Rangers fans donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Fighting Fund during the administration process when their club was at risk and it appears our major assets are at risk once again. 'Now, more than ever, we need the Rangers fan base to unite with the collective goal of protecting our assets and taking the club forward. 'FCA rules prevent the direct investment of the RFFF funds in shares. 'Fan ownership initiatives introduced by the Trust and Rangers First can make a positive and immediate difference and the RFFF will do everything possible to provide support to such organisations. 'The fans, after all, are the lifeblood of this great institution and always will be.' Caretaker manager Kenny McDowall has added to the turmoil by resigning for 'personal reasons' Rangers chairman Sandy Easdale (left) has increased his shareholding to just under 6.5 per cent . A statement on the RST website expressed its delight and gratitude to the RFFF's backing and vowed 'to fight any attempt by this board to pass security over Ibrox to Mike Ashley'. 'We will work closely with the RFFF going forward to ensure every avenue is explored,' read the statement. 'The RST is not taking this action for the benefit of only its own members but for every Rangers fan and fan group. 'The RFFF represents a time when all Rangers fans were 100 per cent united in one cause and the board should be under no illusions that we are again. 'We are delighted to provide the necessary legal standing, through our shareholder status, to enable Rangers fans to fight for our spiritual home. Rangers First supporters group protest in the hope of saving the future of their club . 'Derek Llambias, Barry Leach, David Somers and James Easdale should be under no illusions that we will examine every available legal remedy to stop them passing our club's assets to Mr Ashley. 'They are, in our opinion, neglecting their duties to the club, the fans, the PLC and its shareholders in order to do Mr Ashley's bidding. 'There will be a forensic examination of the directors' actions and also the actions of Paul Shackleton and Adrian Hadden at the Nomad, WH Ireland. 'It is our understanding that they would have to agree to, and sign off, the granting of a security over Ibrox and we maintain that proper levels of corporate governance are not being adhered to.

"Kyle Richards' daughter Alexia was savagely attacked by a pitbull terrier under the ownership of her sister Kim Richards. Despite the teen requiring surgery following the vicious encounter, Kyle is unsure whether her sibling will take actions to prevent further attacks by removing the dog from her home. In a chat with TMZ, the 45-year-old reality star admitted she has no clue what her sister will do with the pitbull now that it has brutally bitten 18-year-old Alexia. Tragic accident: Kyle Richards' daughter Alexia was savagely attacked by a pitbull terrier under the ownership of her sister Kim Richards . When asked if the teen is recovering, Kyle said: 'Alexia is doing well, thank you.' Adding that she believed her daughter would regain full mobility in her hand after she was bitten multiple times by the dog. Kyle was also quick to point out that she bore no hard feelings towards her sister regarding the matter. But when asked if she knew the fate of Kingsley the pitbull, she replied: 'I have no comment on that. I have no idea. I know that she feels very badly about what happened. The dog is very important to her. And I have no comment on it other than that.' Incident: Kim has come out with a statement regarding the attack on her niece . Meanwhile, Kim has said she warned her niece Alexia about her pitbull terrier Kingsley before the savage attack that resulted in the teen needing surgery. The attack on Alexia saw the dog bite her multiple times, with the most severe wound ripping through the flesh on her hand to reach the bone in her thumb. She is understood to have required two different surgeries. Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Kim released a statement to RadarOnline about the incident. Devoted mother: Kyle Richards sleeps over at Cedars Sinai hospital on Monday as her daughter Alexa is treated after being attacked by her aunt Kim's dog Kingsley in LA . 'The events that led up to Kingsley biting Alexia resulted from the girls entering my bedroom after I already told them my room was off limits,' Kim told the website. 'Alexia has been away from college for months and hasn't seen Kingsley in a long time. 'Kingsley is used to the home being full of children and since the kids have gone away, the house has become quiet. While the two have been very close and friendly in the past, the dog has become very protective of me in the meantime.' Adding: 'When guests are over, Kinglsey stays in my bedroom and has been given access to a special fenced in area in my backyard. Anyone entering the house is made aware that the dog should not be bothered.' Family pet: Kim with the dog that attacked her niece; it is not the first time Kingsley has bitten . Kim then went on to explain her recollection of the events on Saturday when her niece was savagely attacked:  'The second I realized Alexia had been bitten on the finger leaving a puncture mark on her thumb, I immediately called my sister, Kyle, and took her to the nearest emergency room.' The wound, however, was reportedly more than just a puncture, but a gash to the bone requiring two surgeries. 'After the wound was cleaned and bandaged the girls went on with their day and I stayed in contact to make sure that my niece was ok,' Kim continued. 'After she re-entered the hospital two days later, I have visited and continue to make sure that she is in good spirits. The one procedure that Alexia has had was to clean the wound to make sure it would not get infected.' She went on to discuss the fate of the dog: 'At this point I am looking at options to what the next step is for Kingsley,' she revealed. 'As many of you can relate, he is my best friend. This is a very difficult decision and time for all of us, but the safety of my family always comes first.' Aggressive: The animal previously bit a trainer hired to domesticate it . According to website TMZ Kingsley went for Alexia during a family gathering, early on Saturday morning at Kim's house. A group including Alexia's mother Kyle were at the home on Halloween, and had been near the dog without incident  when it 'went into attack mode out of nowhere'. The animal has previously featured in the plotline of RHOBH where it was seen being very aggressive towards other dogs. After Kim sought  help controlling the dog, it bit the trainer she hired, one of four known biting incidents. Back in March the dog savaged a friend of Kim's while she was sat on her bed chatting to the star. The bite went through to the woman's bone in her arm and paramedics were called. A further incident occurred when an unknown victim was bitten this summer. Following that attack LA's department of Animal Control Services did visit the home to assess the dog, but the animal was left in Kim's care. However as the latest attack was not reported to authorities, Kingsley remains at mother-of-four Kim's home. Attack: Kinglsey was seen biting his trainer in an old episode of the RHOBH . Unless a victim or member of their family contacts the ACS then no action will be taken. If a report is made an assessment will take place to decide if the animal is under control in Kim's care. ACS visited the star's home over the summer after it attacked another visitor, but at the time Kim was only given a warning. David Utter, who originally trained the pitbull, has also given a statement regarding the dog to TMZ. He claims the dog should be muzzled at all time and now that the dog has attacked four people direct and immediate action should be taken. Utter says the Kingsley should be immediately taken away from Kim. Kim's sister Kyle, mother to Alexia, has previously commented that she felt 'nervous' about Kingsley's behaviour. On an reunion episode of RHOBH earlier this year, Andy Cohen was seen reading a comment from a fan that stated: 'Kim I worry that I'm going to pick up that paper one day and read about your dog having eaten you.' Kyle admitted: 'I do worry a little bit to be honest. You hear these stories and I think oh my gosh. 'When she [Kim] doesn't answer her phone or a text I tell her ' I get worried that the dog maybe did something'.' Taking to her Instagram account, Kyle shared with 616,529 followers: 'Regarding Alexia: She was attacked by a dog and has to have surgery . Her philosophy: Kyle posted this inspirational message about her experience . And she said the attack on the trainer was a warning sign for her. 'I got nervous, just because of the stories I've heard. Nothing from what I seen, he's always sweet.' Kyle slept over at Cedars Sinai hospital in LA on Monday night, while Alexia underwent the first of two surgeries. Taking to her Instagram account, Kyle shared with 616,529 followers: 'Regarding Alexia: She was attacked by a dog and has to have surgery. 'As always, she is trying to make the best out of a bad situation .Thank you for your thoughts & well wishes'. The mother-of-four had earlier posted pictures of her daughter on a hospital bed with her family and friends around her. 'Slumber party at Cedars Sinai Hospital with @alexiaumansky @farrahbritt @sophiakylieee,' she wrote posing with her daughters. Flashback: Kyle, pictured, and Kim are on better terms these days, but the dog attack is bound to place a strain on their fiery relationship, seen here in the RHOBH finale episode in 2010, rowing with her sister . Pointing the finger: The squabbling sisters had an infamous showdown in the back of a limousine where Kyle accused her sister of being an alcoholic . While Kim and Kyle have been on better terms in recent years, the dog attack is bound to place a strain on their fiery relationship, which has been an ongoing storyline on The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills over the years. The finale of the first season in 2010 saw tensions coming to a head between the pair, with Kim's erratic behaviour and constant slurring of words leading her sister to surmise she had a substance abuse problem. The squabbling sisters had a dramatic showdown in the back of a limousine, with Kyle branding her sister an alcohol and threatening to withdraw financial aid she and husband Mauricio Umansky gave to her. Family: Kyle pictured with Alexia in May . Kim briefly entered rehab in December 2011, and later admitted that she was an alcoholic in an interview with Housewives mastermind Andy Cohen. Speaking about her sister's admission at the time, Kyle told Good Morning America: 'I'm proud to hear her say that. I'm proud of her. I know that's the biggest step in recovery, to admit that.' She went on: 'There were things going on that the audience wasn't aware of. I had had a lot of pain and built up anger and frustration towards [Kim], and obviously she did towards me too. It was a vicious cycle. 'It was very difficult to have people dissect and analyse your relationship thinking they know you from a TV show when it's been a long time in the making.' Kim, a former child Disney star, now says she is sober, which has been documented over the last couple of seasons of the reality show.","Alexia, 18, was bitten several times and required two surgeries .

"These dazzling images reveal the night sky as it is seldom seen from a city of 5million people. Photographer Justin Ng spends more than two hours per shot painstakingly capturing the movement of thousands of stars across the void, with spectacular results. While images of 'star trails' - caused by the earth's rotation when photographed on a long exposure - are common, the 36-year-old digitally enhances his images taken in Singapore and combines several together to create the otherworldly final effect. Mr Ng began taking astronomical images after he accidentally captured the Milky Way in 2012, on a visit to Mount Bromo in Indonesia. 'People are generally sceptical on star trails images taken in Singapore because the city is heavily light polluted,' he said. 'Many people don't believe such incredible star images can be taken here. 'In my shots, however, you can see the awe-inspiring views I've witnessed.' However, he added: 'I see myself as an artist rather than a journalist, so some of my images may not make the purists happy. In order to create high quality night sky images, almost all of the images need to go through Photoshop.

"Vladimir Putin mobilised more than 150,000 troops and an armada of ships yesterday for a drill to test the combat readiness of forces in western Russia as tensions over Ukraine continue to grow. In addition to the soldiers – nearly twice the British Army’s manpower after planned cuts – 880 tanks, 210 aircraft and 80 warships will take part in the operation. The manoeuvres raised fears that the Russian president may be planning to send forces into Ukraine after the toppling of its Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovych. Scroll down for video . Violence: Protesters clashed in Simferopol, Ukraine (left) as Vladimir Putin (right) mobilised troops in Russia . The might of the Red Army: Just a fifth of Russia's forces are considerably bigger than Britain's whole arsenal . Clashes: Fist fights broke out today between pro- and anti-Russian protesters in the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine. In response Russia has reportedly ordered an immediate test of 150,000 troops .

They came up against pro-Russian protesters . Injuries: A pro-Russian demonstrator is taken away by medics after the scuffles in Simferopol, Ukraine . Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said unspecified measures were also being taken to protect the country’s Black Sea fleet in Crimea, southern Ukraine. He claimed the operation was not linked to the crisis in Ukraine, insisting it was intended to ‘check the troops’ readiness for action in crisis situations that threaten the nation’s military security’. The drill comes 48 hours after Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said the country’s interests and citizens in Ukraine were under threat in language that echoed his statements justifying Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008 when he was president. The US and EU nations have warned Russia against military intervention in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that Mr Putin wants to be part of a Eurasian union he is creating. The crisis began three months ago after Mr Yanukovych ditched closer ties with the EU in favour of Mr Putin’s scheme. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, who is overseeing the reduction of the Army to around half the size of the Russian mobilisation, said yesterday: ‘We will obviously want to take proper cognizance of any activities by Russian forces. We urge all parties to allow the Ukrainian people to settle internal differences and determine their future without external interference.’ He was speaking as Nato defence ministers, meeting in Brussels, issued a statement ahead of a two-day summit supporting Ukrainian sovereignty and independence. US secretary of state John Kerry said Russia should respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine and be ‘very careful’ in its behaviour.

Crimea is strategically vital to Vladimir Putin's Russia because it juts into the Black Sea. Pictured: Tartars . Dressed for war: A pro-Russian demonstrator holds the Russian flag during the protests in Ukraine . More violence broke out today between pro-Russian demonstrators and supporters of the new government in the eastern peninsula of Crimea . In a TV interview, he added: ‘What we need now to do is not get into an old Cold War confrontation.’ Mr Shoigu said the Russian tests will be conducted in two stages. At first, military units will be brought to ‘the highest degree of combat readiness’ and deployed to land and sea positions. The second stage will include tactical exercises involving warships from the northern and Baltic fleets, while some warplanes will move to combat airfields. Mr Shoigu said the forces must ‘be ready to bomb unfamiliar testing grounds’. The change of government in Kiev has raised questions over the future of Russia’s naval bases in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, the lease for which was extended until 2042 by Mr Yanukovych. Most observers believe the new leadership will not push for the withdrawal of the Russian fleet, as this could create further tensions. Yesterday, thousands of protesters took part in rival rallies in Crimea’s administrative capital Simferopol ahead of a planned session of the region’s parliament. Fights broke out between pro-Russians and more than 10,000 Muslim Tatars who rallied in support of the interim government, chanting: ‘Ukraine is not Russia!’ Blows were exchanged by groups arguing over the future of their country as Putin readies his troops . Pro-Russian activists have clashed with demonstrators backing Ukraine's new government in Crimea .

Tribute: Citizens lay flowers and candles where protesters were killed in a clash with riot police in Kiev . The tensions in Crimea highlight the divisions that run through the nation of 46million, and underscore fears that the country’s mainly Russian-speaking east and south will not recognize the interim authority’s legitimacy. Ethnic Ukrainians loyal to Kiev have joined the Tatars in an alliance to oppose any move back towards Moscow. Ukraine’s interim president Oleksandr Turchinov has expressed concern about the ‘serious threat’ of separatism following the ousting of Mr Yanukovych, who was last night put on the international wanted list, accused of being behind the killing of more than 100 protesters by riot police last week. Russia has portrayed the overthrow of Mr Yanukovych, whose whereabouts are unknown after he fled on Thursday, as a violent seizure of power, while many EU countries back the regime change. Pro-Ukraine protest groups last night named their proposed cabinet for the interim government. MPs were expected to vote on the nominations today. Russian flags can be seen in the background as demonstrators clash with those carrying the Ukrainian and Tartar flag in the foreground . The news of further clashes underscores the difficulties facing Ukraine as the pro-European West divides from the Russian East . Yesterday Crimean citizens cheered as riot police from the pro-Russian Berkut brigade fled there, while in the West other were forced to knee on a stage and beg for forgiveness . During a meeting in Kiev today, former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko was seen for the first time without her wheelchair as she shook hands with US Deputy Secretary of State William Burns . The 'Euromaidan' council of protest leaders made its announcement of Yatseniuk, plus candidates for several other key ministers, after its members addressed crowds on Kiev's Independence Square. Oleksander Turchinov said the new government would have to take unpopular decisions to head off defaulting on its debts and to guarantee a normal life for Ukraine's people. The Euromaidan's proposals have yet to be approved by parliament. The council also named career diplomat Andriy Deshchytsya as foreign minister. Oleksander Shlapak, a former economy minister and former deputy head of the central bank, was named as finance minister. Andriy Paruby, head of the 'self-defence' force protecting the Kiev protest zone from police action during the three months of conflict, was named secretary of the powerful National Security and Defence Council. Crimean Tartars were expelled from their homes by Russia during the Second World War and so have a history of bad feeling towards the Kremlin . However Crimea has very close ties with Russia and houses the nation's Black Sea Fleet . Police had attempted to keep the two group apart but they were unable to stop the fighting . Earlier today, John Kerry and William Hague urged Ukraine to stay unified while asking Russia to allow the country to make its own choices about its future . There are fears within the international community that Russian president Putin (pictured here with former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych) could send troops to the country in an attempt to quash the uprising . Crimean Tartars have an historic grudge with Russia, so support the new revolution sweeping the nation . John Kerry also urged Russia and other nations to ensure the revolution was '100 per cent' peaceful from now on after nearly 100 people died in clashes . Ukraine has just emerged from a bloody revolution, but its problem have only just begun . As tensions flare between the East and West of Ukraine, and politicians scramble to from a government, a new threat to Ukraine's future has emerged. The country faces financial collapse as international loans dry up. The interim president Olexander Turchynov has appealed for £20billion from foreign nations in order to stop the country going bankrupt. And now concerned citizens are withdrawing money from their bank accounts en masse, worried that they will lose everything if the nation goes bust. In just two days from February 18, around £1.8bn was withdrawn from bank accounts across the country. After an agreement to sign a deal introducing a new interim government withdrawals slowed down in the West, but remain high in the East where tensions over Russia's relationship with the country remain high. The interim government is now considering measure to limit cash withdrawals to stop the banks going into meltdown. Speaking to Bloomberg, Lilit Gevorgyan, senior economist at IHS Global Insight in London, said: 'Ukraine’s economy needs rescue and that adds pressure on the revolutionary political forces to create a truly national unity government. 'The large bailout plan that Ukraine currently seeks won’t be handed out by international donors to a weak and non-inclusive government.'","150,000 troops are on high alert with 880 tanks, 90 aircraft and 80 ships .

"When two young ladies on a day trip to a Michigan amusement park in 1915 threw their message in a bottle into the water, they probably never gave a second thought to someone finding their note generations later. Yet just a day after it was revealed a diver from the state found the treasure 30ft down on the St. Clair River bed, present-day descendents of the girls have now been found. Janet Baccanari received a phone call on Tuesday morning from her cousin Eric Schiebhold who had seen the story about their grandmother, Tillie Esper, who was 23-years-old on the day the note was written.

Janet Baccanari: The granddaughter of Tillie Esper received a phone call early yesterday morning from her cousin to tell her about the note that had been recovered from almost a century ago . Ms Esper was one of the two Detroit girls who wrote a message nearly 100 years ago. She along with her friend Selina Pramstaller, who was 17 at the time, decided to commemorate their day out with their message in a bottle. The message read - 'having a good time at Tashmoo.' The note contained the girls names and their respective addresses. They tossed it into the St. Clair River and watched it sink as both girls enjoyed the summers day visit to Tashmoo Park on Harsens Island. 'It’s like she came back to life,' Baccanari, 46, of Beverly Hills, said. 'It’s exciting stuff.' Mr Schiebold, 59, of Bloomfield Township said Esper had three sons and six daughters, of whom two daughters are alive and living on opposite coasts of the U.S. There are nearly three dozen . grandchildren across the country and he is now making it his business to . get in touch with as many as he can find to inform them about the find. 'I . couldn’t believe it,' he said. 'A part of me said, ‘There’s the . old-school way of doing a text message.’ I thought it was pretty . impressive.' Ms Esper was born in September 1893 to Mathias and Caroline Esper, as the youngest of nine children and married Joseph J. Schaefer, a saloon-keeper, just two years after her bottle-throwing day. She was a ladies’ hat maker but the couple found time to have nine children - the youngest of whom is still alive. Message in a bottle: Nearly a century ago, Selina Pramstaller and Tillie Esper of Detroit wrote a simple note as they enjoyed a day at a popular amusement park on Harsens Island . Gone but not forgotten: They stuffed the message in a bottle, corked it and threw it in the waters of the St. Clair River, where it sank to the bottom where it lay for 97 years to be discovered . The bottle is expected to be donated to the historical society’s museum on the island. 'What’s . surprising is it wasn’t yet completely silted over or dredged or an . anchor destroyed it,' Eric Schiebold mused. 'For that to be around that . long and found is really, really incredible.' Neither . Eric or Janet Baccanari, who is the 31st grandchild, recalled grandma . Tillie talking about Tashmoo Park or leaving the message in a bottle. Ms . Baccanari said Tillie Esper had a 'really rich, interesting life' and . that she 'got chills' when she read the incredible story of the bottle . and the connection to her grandmother. 'It . just gave me goose bumps,' she said. Tillie was apparently a lovely lady who enjoyed green tea and fish, often cooking for the family at the . summer house in Hartland. Her grandma would come to her childhood home every holiday and often on Sundays. Unfortunately, Esper’s youngest child who is still alive, is unable to appreciate the historical find because she has Alzheimer’s. Hot fun in the summertime: Tashmoo Park was an amusement park in Algonac, Michigan. Opened in 1897, it closed in 1951. The writers of the message in the bottle had spent the day here . A bygone era: Tashmoo Park offered visitors an escape from the oppressive heat and humidity of packed, sweltering Detroit in the summertime. Tashmoo Park had picnic tables, a baseball diamond, swings and rides, as well as a casino and a dancing pavilion . Since . hearing about this special 'tale across time', several descendants have got in . touch with Bernard Licata, President of the Harsens Island St. Clair . Flats Historical Society. He set himself the task of finding the families of the original writers. The message from Tillie and Selina was written in pencil on the back of a White Star Line deposit ticket. It even included the writers' addresses on Wabash and Maybury Grand, about nine blocks apart, in Detroit. Thanks . to the Internet and the Detroit Free Press, several people have been . attempting to connect the dots and he has received more than a dozen . phone calls and emails in just 24 hours. Most of the information has so far been about Ms. Esper with very few leads on the whereabouts of Ms Pramstaller's decedents. The timing couldn't be better however, because next month a special 'Tashmoo Day' event is going to be held on the island. Tashmoo was a popular amusement park on Harsens Island, but it closed in 1951. It was a favorite summer destination for Detroiters with a dance hall, amusement rides, bathhouse and swimming beach. This . summers event will celebrate days from a bygone era when the famed . Tashmoo steamship docked daily at the park in the early 1900s, allowing . passengers who boarded in Detroit to enjoy all that the park had to . offer. That message- 'having a good time at Tashmoo'- was found almost 97 years later by diver Dave Leander. 'There’s all kinds of people connecting the dots,' Licata said. 'I think it’s wonderful.' Heyday: This female reveller was just one of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who came to Tashmoo Park before it closed in 1951 . Bringing in the crowds: Steamships from Detroit and Port Huron, Michigan made frequent trips to Harsens Island . Fun in the sun: Rides (left) and swims in the river (right) were great summer activities for the visitors . Widely known: Tashmoo Park was a popular tourist attraction until it closed in 1951 .","Tillie Esper was one of two girls aboard the Tashmoo Steamer and wrote the note on June 30, 1915 .

"The body of a gang-raped teenager who was burned to death after her attackers threatened her family was 'hijacked' by police who attempted to forcibly cremate it, reports today suggest. The girl, 16, was gang-raped in October in Madhyamgram, near Calcutta, by a group of six men - who are believed to have links with West Bengal’s ruling party, the Trinamool Congress. They again attacked her the following day as she returned from reporting the crime to police with her father, it is claimed. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The mother of the 16-year-old rape victim who was burned alive following a series of threats from the perpetrators cries over the teen's body on Wednesday . The group were arrested - but the teen and her family say they received a series of threats from the men. The alleged threats included one saying the girl's taxi-driver father would be killed if she continued to pursue charges. The family’s landlord, who is reportedly related to one of the gang, allegedly told them they must leave their one-bedroom property also. On the morning of her death, two friends of the accused allegedly visited the girl's home and verbally abused the girl. The teen victim was set alight on December 23 and died from her injuries on New Year's Eve. Doctors said the victim - who had 40 per . cent burns - had suffered severe damage to her throat and face, making . it difficult for her to breathe. Location: The terrible series of events took place in Madhyamgram, Calcutta (pictured) Earlier reports suggested the victim had committed suicide - a story that initially came from police - but today it was revealed the girl said two men poured kerosene over her and burned her before she died. Doctors have also said the girl was pregnant when she died. Reports today suggest police 'hijacked' the hearse carrying the girl's body and attempted to have it cremated despite the family's wishes to wait to give her a proper funeral. On Tuesday evening police are alleged to have intercepted the hearse, which was travelling from RG Kar Hospital to a mortuary. They took it to a crematorium where the body remained for three hours, it is claimed. Officers are then said to have gone to the home of the . bereaved family at around 2am and threatened to break . down the door if they did not give them the death certificate needed for the cremation. The girl's father refused, but officers allegedly tormented the family all night. In a letter written to Govenor M K Narayanan the father said: 'The superintendent of police and other officers reached our house in the dead of the night and asked us to open the door. Taking to the streets: A group of protestors rally in Kolkata following news of the horrific series of events . 'We were scared and refused to come out before day broke. They threatened to break down the door.' It is currently unclear as to why officers were so desperate to have the girl cremated on Tuesday night. Some reports suggest it could have been due to pressure from the Trinamool Congress. Eventually, with the help of the Communist Party of India (CPM), the family took control of the body on Wednesday afternoon. CPM supporters carried out a rally with the body and the victim's father agreed to cremation after he was given assurances the family would be protected from the gang and its associates. The events have led to protests across Calcutta - with campaigners saying nothing has changed in the country since the death of a student who was gang raped on a Delhi bus last year. Brinda Karat, a leading Women's Rights campaigner in India told The Telegraph: 'This gang raped her twice, she went to the police, and they had the temerity to go to her house and threaten her. 'Clearly they have political patronage, otherwise it is impossible for that to happen. 'What is so tragic is that her life could have been saved if the government and ordinary processes of law had worked — they would not have delayed bringing justice and protection for the victim. 'It’s a year since this terrible case in Delhi outraged the country and forced the government to make public commitments about preventative, protective and legal measures to punish [perpetrators] when these cases occur.'","Girl, 16, raped by gang with alleged links to West Bengal's ruling party .

"The White House may have to scrap its plans to aggressively promote a 40 per cent national minimum wage hike now that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the move would likely cost the U.S. 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016. The CBO's report, released Tuesday afternoon, also estimated that it would pull 900,000 low-income Americans above the federal government's poverty line. The White House didn't answer questions about whether that trade-off is acceptable to President Obama, but Senate Democrats have pushed hard for legislation that would implement his goal of driving the minimum wage far above its current $7.25 level. But it quickly scheduled an afternoon conference call for reporters with Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman, and published a blog post so lengthy that it suggests the White House had advance notice of the CBO's findings. President Barack Obama posed with a group of workers before signing an executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $10.10 an hour -- but his larger effort, which requires Congress to act, is now meeting with the CBO's brick wall . The CBO says as many as 1 million jobs might be lost after a minimum wage hike to $10.10 per hour, but determined that its 'central estimate' was 500,000 jobs . That article didn't mention the report's 500,000-job estimate, but argued more vaguely that CBO said 'raising the minimum wage would increase income for millions of middle-class families, on net, even after accounting for its estimates of job losses.' The president signed an executive order on February 12 setting $10.10 as the minimum wage for employees working on new federal contracts, and has said he wants legislators to expand his order to the entire country. A conservative policy group, the Employment Policies Institute, has predicted the CBO's findings for years, saying that a $10.10 minimum wage would kill between 360,000 and 1 million jobs, mostly those of young, low-skill workers who would be the first to go if employers were forced to pay higher salaries out of the same pool of money. The group's research director, Michael Saltsman, said Tuesday that Obama's plan would be 'a blunt instrument to fix the very complicated issue of poverty in America.' 'Nearly 60 percent of the working-age poor don’t have a job and wouldn’t be affected by a raise,' he said. 'Of those who would receive a raise, a forthcoming study from Cornell and San Diego State University economists find just 13 percent live in poor families.' Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn quickly piled on. 'Whether it's Obamacare, a minimum wage hike or a trillion-dollar stimulus bill charged to the nation’s credit card, the bottom line is the President's big-government experiment kills jobs,' he said. 'It has made things worse not only for Americans who continue to look for a job, but also for the millions of Americans who have altogether given up looking for work.' Union labor has organized protests across the country to demand a minimum-wage hike, since many union contracts include higher wages that rise whenever the minimum wage goes up . Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's re-election campaign issued a statement after the CBO published its report, comparing its dour findings to news about Obamacare. Liberals, he said, 'promise a world full of prosperity, but the reality of their policies is fewer jobs and less opportunity for our most vulnerable.' But the Obama administration went on full alert. In his conference call, Furman told reporters that the CBO was dead wrong, and its report 'does not reflect the consensus view of economists who have said the minimum wage would have little to no impact on employment.' Tuesday's news will put pressure on Democrats and labor unions to justify their call for a higher minimum wage as a net benefit to the American economy. 'It goes outside the consensus view of economists when it comes to the impact of the minimum wage on employment,' he said. 'Our view is that ""zero"" is a perfectly reasonable estimate of the impact of the minimum wage on employment.' The White House has planned to spend much of next week promoting President Obama's plan as a boon to jobs and the economy, and as a social justice issue aimed at better treatment of America's poor. The president and his surrogates are likely to point to the CBO's other findings, including that 'many more low-wage workers would see an increase in their earnings,' and that 'a few higher-wage workers would owe their jobs and increased earnings to the heightened demand for goods and services that would result.' CBO's economists called a loss of 500,000 jobs its 'central estimate,' but said there is great uncertainty attached to it. A 'very slight' reduction in jobs could also result, they cautioned, or job losses as large as 1 million. Overall, 16.5 million American workers would see higher pay if the minimum wage were increased. The president claimed in his weekend radio address that 'raising the minimum wage ... would lift wages for about 28 million Americans.  It would lift millions of Americans out of poverty, and help millions more work their way out of poverty – without requiring a single dollar in new taxes or spending. Separately, the CBO wrote last week that the Affordable Care Act, the president's signature health insurance overhaul law, would drive the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time jobs out of the U.S. economy by the year 2024. --- . Mr. Martosko has worked in the past for the firm that manages the Employment Policies Institute.","President Obama has demanded a national hike in the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour .

"Graphic images of a suspected rebel 'traitor', strung up and crucified on a road sign in a Syrian town square, have been posted online by Islamist extremists. The man, whose T-shirt is drenched in his own drying blood, was executed after he was accused of helping government forces in a country torn in two by a brutal civil war. Pinned to his chest is a sign bearing a cryptic message that reads: 'Cleanliness is a civilised matter that shows your ethics and love for your country.' WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Crucified: The man, whose T-shirt is drenched in his own drying blood, was executed after he was accused of helping government forces . Behind the killing is the hardline Islamic group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), a faction so extreme that it has been disavowed by Al Qaeda. The group posted the shocking photograph online as a warning as to what happens to defectors in areas in Syria under ISIS control. In the disturbing image, a child can even be seen perching on an adult's shoulders, taking a photograph of the victim with a mobile phone. It is unclear where exactly the photograph was taken. Dangerous: . Security forces battle with ISIS members, a group so extreme it has even been disavowed by al Qaeda . It comes a month after ISIS released photographs of two men who had been similarly crucified in the town of al-Raqqa. They . were among seven people summarily executed on charges of a grenade . attack that was said to have killed a child and maimed a man. ISIS took over the city of al-Raqqa after . rebels overran it in March 2013. It was the first provincial . capital to fall under rebel control. ISIS (or ISIL) is a pro-Al Qaeda jihadist group that many feared was taking an iron grip over parts of Syria. The group was formed in April 2013 and grew out of Al Qaeda's affiliate organisation in Iraq. It has since become one of the main jihadist groups fighting government forces in Syria. Its precise size is unknown, but it is thought to include thousands of fighters, including many foreign jihadists. Analysts say non-Syrians constitute a majority of ISIS's elite fighter corps and are disproportionately represented in its leadership. It holds sway in a number of towns close to the Turkish border in the north of the country, and has gained a reputation for brutal rule in the areas that it controls. The group has been operating independently of other jihadist groups such as the Nusra Front and has had a tense relationship with other rebels in Syria. Al Qaeda refuse to deal with them. In July, a commander of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) was reportedly shot dead by ISIS fighters in the coastal province of Lattakia. There were also reports of deadly clashes between the two groups in the north-western province of Idlib. ISIS also seized the northern town of Azaz from the FSA on 18 September. There has also been friction with other Islamists. In November 2013, ISIS was accused of killing a prominent member of the Syrian Islamist rebel group Ahrar al-Sham. Tensions have been rising in recent days after it was announced yesterday that president Bashar al-Assad had won a landslide election victory with almost 90 per cent of the vote, securing him a new seven-year term. Tens of thousands took to the streets in government-held areas even before the results were announced on Wednesday evening, waving portraits of Assad and the official Syrian flag. But there are widespread claims of vote-rigging in a nation that remains sharply divided in bitter conflict. Critics said that many of those who voted did so more out of fear than commitment to Assad, whose family has ruled Syria with a rod of iron for four decades. Opposition activists say the election was likely to prolong the conflict that has . devastated their country and driven nearly half the population from . their homes and sparked an exodus of nearly three million refugees . abroad. Meanwhile, . President Barack Obama's top foreign policy advisor Susan Rice on . Friday said Washington was providing 'lethal and non-lethal' support to . select members of the Syrian opposition, offering more detail than usual . on US assistance. Top . Obama administration officials typically declined to say exactly what . equipment, arms or ammunition the United States is providing to moderate . Syrian opposition forces. But . President Barack Obama said in a major foreign policy speech last week . that the United States would 'ramp up' support for rebels fighting . President Bashar al-Assad. National . Security Advisor Susan Rice said in an interview with CNN while she was . traveling with Obama to D-Day 70th anniversary celebrations in Normandy . that she was heartbroken about the carnage in Syria's civil war. 'That's . why the United States has ramped up its support for the moderate vetted . opposition, providing lethal and non-lethal support where we can to . support both the civilian opposition and the military opposition.' Officials normally publicly refuse to comment on exactly what they are doing to train opposition groups. National . Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden declined to say whether .

Officially, US support for rebel fighters in Syria has been limited to non-lethal aid amounting to $287 million, though the CIA reportedly participates in a secret programme to train moderate rebels in Jordan. Opposition leaders are particularly dismayed that the United States has balked at providing anti-aircraft missiles to rebels, fearing they could fall into the wrong hands. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Obama is ready to sign off on training missions for selected rebel groups, to counter the rising power of Al-Qaeda-linked extremists.","The man was executed after he was accused of helping government forces .

"Inducing pregnant women once they reach 37 weeks can lower the chance of the baby dying or developing a serious health condition, a study has suggested. The research, which analysed 770,926 births over a 13-year period, found the risk of neo-natal death went down from 1.9 to one per 1,000 births from 2000 to 2012. There was a drop in the rate of cerebral palsy by 26 per cent between 2002 and 2010, according to the study of Danish babies. A quarter of women in Denmark pregnant beyond 37 weeks have labour induced. Scroll down for video . Lower risk: Inducing women at 37 weeks was found to lower chance of the baby dying or developing a serious health condition in a study of births in Denmark . There was a simultaneous halving of stillbirths, a separate study found. Risk factors such as smoking, increased maternal age and first-time motherhood were all taken into account. It found the risk of asphyxia decreased by 23 per cent from 2003 to 2012. Large, or macrosomic, babies weighing more than 9 pounds 15 ounces at birth, dropped by a third while injuries to the peripheral nerve, which link the brain and spinal cord to the other parts of the body, fell by 43 per cent. But the study also found that the risk of the baby's shoulder getting stuck during delivery, called shoulder dystocia, went up by nearly a third. Current guidelines stating that uncomplicated pregnancies should be induced in weeks 41 to 42. Professor Ojvind Lidegaard, from the University of Copenhagen and co-author of the study, said: 'We have seen significant reductions in newborn asphyxia, neonatal mortality, macrosomia and peripheral nerve injuries. 'Another similar study we conducted recently also demonstrated a halving of stillbirths following the implementation of proactive labour induction practice. 'Our results therefore suggest an overall improvement in perinatal outcomes following a national change towards a proactive management of post-term pregnancy through labour induction.' The findings are published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Its editor-in-chief, John Thorp, warned the findings required further scrutiny before being implemented elsewhere. 'Labour induction is a simple intervention, but demands a closer surveillance during labour and hospital settings must be able to support such changes,' he said.

"As the father of tennis champs Venus and Serena Williams, Richard Williams is a controversial figure who has earned a reputation as someone willing to question the sport’s establishment. His unorthodox methods were undoubtedly instrumental in helping turn his daughters into two of the biggest names in the women’s game, but it came at a price. He split from their mom Oracene and married Lakeisha Graham in 2009, and as his daughter’s careers have progressed he has taken a less viable role and is less involved in their coaching. Richard Williams, the controversial father of tennis champs Venus and Serena, has written a book about growing up in abject poverty in Shreveport, Louisiana, and his run-ins with the Ku Klux Klan . As well as becoming father to a young son, Dylan, and pursuing an interest in photography, Williams has also found the time to write a book about his life, Black And White: The Way I See It. In his book, Williams tells of his early life growing up in abject poverty in Shreveport, Louisiana, as one of six children and the only son of single mother Julia Mae. He writes that his life has been defined by his father R.D. leaving the family forcing him to fend for himself at an early age. ‘As early as I remember, I hated my name because my father’s love did not come with it,’ he writes in an extract first published in the New York Daily News. Richard Williams' unorthodox methods were undoubtedly instrumental in helping turn his daughters Venus, left, and Serena, right, into two of the biggest names in women's tennis . Richard Williams, center, with his daughters Venus, left, and Serena 1991 in Compton, CA . ‘It would always remind me of the man who left me alone, who abused my mother, and who put me way behind the starting line in the race of life.’ Williams took it upon himself to provide for his mom and sisters by any means he could, which involved going into the woods and hunting bullfrogs to eat, and fish, shooting rabbits, and stealing chickens. ‘I became fascinated with stealing at the age of eight. I don’t know if the thrill was being able to get away with a crime, or that the crime was against the white man,’ writes Williams. Aged 12 he started a produce garden and sold his fruit and vegetables at a farm stand, whatever he couldn’t grow - watermelons, peaches, strawberries, etc - he would steal from white people. As his business thrived, Williams was able to move his family into a better house. The Ku Klux Klan rampaged through the South, confident it could violate black people with impunity, writes Richard Williams . Shreveport was controlled by the local branch of the Ku Klux Klan, says Williams. ‘The Klan rampaged through the South, confident it could violate us with impunity,’ he writes. A friend, called Lil Man, was caught by the Klan for stealing and his body was found days later hanging from a tree with his hands cut off. The murder was never investigated by the local police. Williams also had a run-in with Klan members and recalls a crowd - including his own father - looking on and watching while three white men beat him in the street. ‘It is a terrible thing to be so unloved, to know your father would rather let you die than lift a finger to help you, to watch him run off and leave you all alone,’ writes Williams. Family guy: Richard Williams married Lakeisha Graham in 2009 and they have a young son together, called Dylan . ‘It was a rejection so cold it remains burnt in my memory and, in the end, it did what even white people could never do, hurt me so deep in my soul that I have never forgotten or forgiven. Such was Williams anger at the injustice that he experienced that just prior to leaving Shreveport for Chicago he decided to exact revenge on the Klan. After securing the white robes of a local Klansman, Williams dressed up and went to a nearby white neighborhood where he viciously attacked a white farmer and his teenage son with a stick . 'My hatred was up, and so was my longing to pay back somebody, anybody, for everything that ever happened to me,’ he writes.

Hospital, Bynes was taken to a Midtown police station where she is . expected to spend the night before a Friday court appearance. Bynes was photographed in police custody on Thursday night as an officer escorted her out of a police station. The actress was wearing her platinum blonde hair extensions and a black Versace sweatshirt. Legal trouble: Amanday Bynes, shown smoking a hand-rolled cigarette in New York City in April, was arrested on Thursday night on charges of marijuana possession . The former Nickelodeon star has . been exhibiting erratic behaviour of late with some eyebrow-raising . public outings and online postings. Two men who claimed they attended an . impromptu house party at Bynes' Manhattan apartment last month said . they witnessed Bynes smoking marijuana atop a bare mattress in her . bedroom. The men told . In Touch magazine in an article this week that Bynes' home was filthy . and filled with marijuana, presenting photos to back up their claims. The men said that Bynes' home was virtually unfurnished and windows were spray painted black. Bynes jumped to her own defense on Wednesday night on Twitter. She posted a tweet saying: 'That’s not my bed! Those aren’t my toes! My toes are pedicured!' In another strange incident, TMZ . reported on Thursday that Bynes was stopped from boarding a private jet . last weekend for not having correct identification. Child star: Amanda, shown in April 2001 at the Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Awards, had successful television shows in the late 1990s early 2000s . Since her driver's license has been . suspended and she had no other form of ID, the actress told the pilot to . search her name on Google to prove her identity. The pilot . checked with the jet company, but they were adamant that no special . treatment be given and Bynes was not allowed on the flight. Her bizarre antics commenced with her retirement from acting and move last year to New York. The . 27-year-old is regularly on Twitter and has sent out some concerning . tweets in which she asked Drake to 'murder her vagina' and posed topless . while complaining about her weight. Movie star: Amanda starred in the 2003 film What A Girl Wants with Colin Firth . The All That actress was arrested in . April 2012 in West Hollywood, California on driving under the influence of alcohol after the black BMW she was driving struck a Los Angeles . County Sheriff's Department patrol vehicle. Bynes . also has been on probation for driving on a suspended license related . to an incident in Burbank, California in 2012 in which her car was . impounded. TMZ reported . earlier this year Amanda was evicted from her apartment for being a . 'building nuisance,' as neighbours complained about smelling marijuana . smoke from her abode. The . Easy A actress moved to the Big Apple to become a fashion designer last . year, but the fruits of her labour have yet to surface. She also didn't have much luck with her 2007 clothing line, Dear, after retailer Steve & Barry's filed for bankruptcy.

"A 10-year-old girl in Florida has been paralyzed for almost a year with a rare inflammation of the brain and her family is blaming a flu vaccine. According to Carla Grivna, her daughter Marysue was living a perfectly healthy and happy life until last year. 'She (used to) love school, she was running, playing, singing in the church choir,' Grivna told WTSP. Suddenly sick: Carla Grivna said that Marysue was a healthy nine year old when she got her annual flu shot and suddenly became sick . Last November, Grivna took Marysue for her seasonal flu shot. She was healthy for the next couple of days, playing freeze tag with friends a few days before Thanksgiving. The next day, Grivna found her daughter paralyzed in her bed, able to open her eyes but unable to move her body or speak. Grivna and her husband called an ambulance, and at the hospital received a sobering diagnosis - Marysue had a rare infection of the brain called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or ADEM. Almost a year later, Marysue still cannot speak and must be carried to the bathroom by her father. Most of her day is spent in a hospital bed, which is kept in the Grivnas' living room because it is too big to fit in her bedroom, according to a GoFundMe page set up by the family. Now the Grivnas are saying 'the doctors won’t confirm it or deny it,' but they believe the flu shot was to blame. Paralyzed: Marysue is almost completely nonverbal and can hardly move, remaining mainly in her bed or wheelchair . Healthy: Grivna said that Marysue loved singing and playing before her paralysis from acute disseminated encephalomyelitis . 'Her father Steven and I are certain,' she told Fox News, 'due to all of our research, that this was what caused Marysue’s condition.' Research by the National Institutes of Health found that in five percent of ADEM cases, the patient had received a vaccine in the month before symptoms started. In 2008, a 75-year-old woman developed ADEM two days after being vaccinated against influenza, eventually experiencing numbness and paralysis, before dying shortly afterwards. However, doctors do not recommend against the vaccine, as researchers report a much higher percentage of ADEM cases are preceded by infection than their respective vaccines. 'If I get the flu I'm far more likely to get ADEM than from the flu vaccine,' said Dr Juan Dumois, director of infectious diseases at All Children's Hospital. Recovery is possible, according to Dr Dumois, but after six months the chances of getting better drop significantly. The family is currently trying to raise money in order to renovate Marysue's room to make it more accessible, and have raised just under $3,000 in 11 days.","Marysue Grivna, 10, developed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis days after getting her seasonal flu shot that has left her paralyzed .

"In a world first, phone maker LG has confirmed it will start selling flexible screens for smartphones and tablets - and they could be launched as early as next month. The 6-inch display will be made of bendy plastic substrates, rather than glass, and the panel can be attached to any curved device. LG Chem, the South Koren firm's research arm, has additionally said it is ready to unveil its curved battery prototype ahead of the rumoured launch of the company's G Flex handset in November. Phone maker LG has confirmed it will start selling flexible screens for smartphones and tablets, and they could be launched as early as next month. The 6-inch display, pictured, will be made of bendy plastic substrates, rather than glass, and the panel can be attached to any curved device . LG Chem, the South Koren firm's research arm, has additionally said it is ready to unveil its curved battery prototype. The team has been testing its 'cable battery', pictured, on LCD screens and it is so bendy it can be tied in knots . LG Chem used thin strands of . copper wire, coated with nickel-tin, which are then spun into a 'metal . yarn' and wrapped around a rod. The rod is then removed, leaving a strong spring which can be tucked into tight and small spaces. The team said: 'In our experiments we found that our . prototype was exceptionally ﬂexible and could suffer large strain . without malfunction.' They . added that, when designing new devices, 'the limiting factor is often the . shape of the battery' and that their battery could be 'a disruptive . technology that could open up a path for design innovation.' Although rival Samsung similarly announced plans to launch its own flexible display last month, LG is expected to beat the company to making the technology available to consumers. The G Flex phone is rumoured to launch next month. Although the handset isn't expected to be bendy, the use of a flexible screen could mean it has a more curved display than current phones. Samsung's Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus phones have slightly curved, OLED screens, but they both use curved glass, not flexible plastic. However, the first truly curved devices may not be available to customers until next year. 'LG Display is launching a new era of . flexible displays for smartphones with its industry-leading technology,' said Dr. Sang Deog Yeo, executive vice president and chief technology officer of LG Display. 'The flexible display market is expected to grow . quickly as this technology is expected to expand further into diverse . applications including automotive displays, tablets and wearable . devices. 'Our goal is to take an early lead in the flexible display . market by introducing new products with enhanced performance and . differentiated designs next year.' Although rival Samsung announced plans to launch a flexible display last month, LG is expected to be the first to bring it to market on the G Flex phone, rumoured to launch next month. Although the handset isn't expected to be bendy, the use of the screen, pictured, could mean it has a more curved display than current phones . The design is made of 0.44mm-thin plastic and has a protective film attached to the back, making it 'bendable and unbreakable.' It is vertically concave from top to bottom, has a radius of 7cm and weighs 7.2g. LG Display's technology could also be fitted to smart watches, and other devices, that can be wrapped around items, pictured . LG Display claims the flexible OLED panel is the 'world's slimmest among . existing mobile device panels.' The company's new battery technology could also revolutionise smartphones because it is so bendy it can be tied in knots. This means it can be shaped around other components. It could even improve the battery life of phones because manufacturers could add more power into the batteries, if they're not restricted by size or shape. LG Chem's cable-type lithium-ion battery can even woven into textiles. This means the technology could also be fitted to clothes, and users could end up 'wearing' phone chargers. Both LG and Samsung have already produced curved 55-inch OLED TVs on sale for around £8,500. It is unsure how much the 6-inch display or the G Flex phone will cost, but the technology is expected to come at a premium. Sony was the first company to unveil flexible display technology back in 2010, pictured, but it has not been made available to customers yet. Sony's prototype screen was so flexible it could be rolled around a pencil . Both LG and Samsung have already produced curved 55-inch OLED TVs on sale for around £8,500. OLED's (organic light-emitting diodes) are used to create digital displays in TVs, computer monitors, phones, tablets and games consoles. An OLED display works without a backlight, which means it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display (LCD). In low lighting, an OLED screen can produce a higher contrast ratio than an LCD, too. In March last year, LG Display also . developed the world's first 6-inch Electronic Paper Display (EPD) based . on e-ink that had a plastic back panel. However, . Sony was the first company to unveil flexible display technology back . in 2010, but it has not been made available to customers. Sony's prototype screen was so flexible it could be rolled around a pencil. Rumours before Samsung launched its Galaxy Gear smartwatch in August believed it would have with a flexible display, however, the device has a solid 2-inch screen fitted to a traditional watch strap. This was said to be because technology firms have yet to figure out how to mass produce the parts cheaply and come up with display panels that can be as thin as a sheet and highly heat resistant. Cambridge-based Plastic Logic is an expert on flexible displays and has created a number of prototypes and devices, including the 10.7-inch PaperTab tablet and the PocketBook CoverReader that is set to be a thin and light flip cover for HTC, Sony and Samsung phones .","Display is made of bendy plastic substrates attached to a curved device .

"Ban: The legal challenge by tobacco companies against plain packaging was rejected by the Australian High Court . Australia is banning the sale of branded packaging of tobacco products after the High Court dismissed . a challenge from international cigarette companies on the new . anti-tobacco marketing laws. The court ruled the laws did not . breach Australia's constitution dispelling the claim by tobacco . companies that they were unconstitutional because they . effectively extinguished their intellectual property rights. The case has been closely watched . around the world, including in Britain where the Department of Health’s . public consultation on plain packaging finished last Friday. From December this year cigarettes and . tobacco products sold in Australia will have to be in plain unbranded olive green packets . carrying graphic health warnings. When the new legislation was passed last year it . was challenged by tobacco companies British American Tobacco, Britain's . Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco who lost in court . today. Australian Attorney-General Nicola Roxon hailed the ruling as ‘a watershed moment for tobacco control around the world. ‘The message to the rest of the world . is big tobacco can be taken on and beaten,’ said Roxon, whose father, a . smoker, died of cancer when she was 10. ‘Without brave governments willing to . take the fight up to big tobacco, they'd still have us believing that . tobacco is neither harmful nor addictive.’ The Australian High Court’s decision . is a major blow to tobacco companies as Britain and other countries . including New Zealand and Norway are moving towards similar legislation. British American Tobacco Australia said the measures would fuel a black market for cigarettes. ‘It's still a bad law that will only . benefit organised crime groups which sell illegal tobacco on our . streets,’ BAT Australia spokesman Scott McIntyre said after the . decision. ‘Even though we believe the government . has taken our property from us, we'll ensure our products comply with . the plain packaging requirements and implementation dates.’ New cover: These are some of the proposed models following the guidelines which state that instead of the tobacco company's brand the cigarette packs will have to be olive green and carry health warnings . The court's decision was welcomed by . anti-smoking groups including non-government cancer control . organisation Cancer Council Australia. Ian Olver, chief executive said: ‘We . hope other nations follow Australia's lead and eliminate the use of . tobacco packaging as a marketing tool, to help reduce the global tobacco . death toll - which is on track to reach half a billion people this . century,’ The ruling was applauded by . neighbouring New Zealand’s Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia who . said it provided ‘a greater sense of security’ as the New Zealand . government move towards similar legislation. In Britain a consultation was made by the Department of Health on plain packaging which closed last Friday. Anti-branding: The generic box will simply carry the company's name to distinguish it from other brands after the Australian High Court ruled in favour of the new anti-cigarette marketing laws . The department of Health has yet to . report any results of the survey and told MailOnline that due to the . large number of responses it is impossible to set an exact date for . publishing. ‘Previous consultations has been . approximately 85,000 and we are expecting as many if not more answers on . this matter,’ Chelsea Austin with the Department of Health said. ‘It will take time for all to be analysed and the recommendation to be sent to the Secretary of State’. British Public Health Minister Anne Milton said today that they will look carefully at today’s judgement on Australia’s plain packaging laws as they analyse the results of the public consultation . ‘We are considering whether plain packaging of tobacco could bring public health benefits in this country in addition to what we are already doing,’ she said in a statement. ‘We have an open mind about the introduction of plain packaging. ‘Any decisions to take further policy action will be taken only after full consideration is given to consultation responses, evidence and other information. A ban on tobacco promotion was imposed . in April which means that supermarkets across England now have to keep tobacco . products behind shutters or under the counter. Australian Attorney-General Nicola Roxon, left and the Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek spoke at Parliament House, earlier today after the High Court ruled the new legislation did not break any laws requiring 'the acquisition of property on just terms' Despite the court ruling then new law in Australia still faces a number of challenges under global trade rules. Australia is already fighting trade . complaints in the World Trade Organization (WTO) from Ukraine, Honduras . and the Dominican Republic, who claim the laws unfairly restrict trade, . although their trade with Australia is negligible. Tobacco company Philip Morris also . said it would launch a legal challenge against the laws under a . bilateral Australia-Hong Kong investment agreement. ‘We believe that Philip Morris Asia's . investment treaty case and the WTO challenges are strong. As such, there . is still a long way to go before all the legal questions about plain . packaging are fully explored and answered,’ PML spokesman Chris Argent . said in a statement. The World Health Organisation . estimates more than one billion people around the world are regular . smokers, with 80 per cent in low and middle income countries. Australia wants to cut the number of . smokers from around 15 per cent of the population to ten per cent by . 2018. Authorities say smoking kills around 15,000 Australians a year.

"Ukraine's secret service claims to have arrested a Russian-led sabotage cell that planned to bring down a plane on Ukraine's Independence Day. Kiev's SBU espionage agency said the saboteurs had conducted 'terrorist' attacks in the Kharkiv region, which has remained in government hands throughout the bloody seven-month conflict. The group, allegedly found with an extensive stash of Russian-made weapons, planned to down a military plane on 24 August, Ukraine's Independence Day, it was claimed.

"Physicists say they are now confident they have discovered a long-sought subatomic particle known as a Higgs boson. The European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, says a look at all the data from 2012 shows that what they found last year was a version of what is popularly referred to as the 'God particle'. CERN physicist Joe Incandela said today that 'it is clear that we are dealing with a Higgs boson though we still have a long way to go to know what kind of Higgs boson it is.' CERN, the world's largest particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, where experts today confrimed they had found the Higgs boson or 'god particle' The long-theorized subatomic particle would explain why matter has mass. It is considered a missing cornerstone of physics. Last July scientists with the world's largest atom-smasher announced finding a particle they described as Higgs-like. Earlier this week researchers ruled out the finding being a 'super higgs' that some cosmologists had hoped might open up more exotic secrets of the universe. 'It does look like the SM (Standard Model) Higgs boson,' said physicist Brian Petersen of Atlas, one of two research teams working in parallel on the Higgs project at CERN in Switzerland. His assertion, on a slide presentation to a conference at CERN and posted on the Internet, was echoed by the other group. 'So far, it is looking like an SM Higgs boson,' said slides from Colin Bernet of CMS. The two groups work separately and without comparing findings to ensure their conclusions are reached independently. It has been assumed since the triumphant announcement last June that a new particle spotted at CERNS's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was the Higgs, named after British theoretical physicist Peter Higgs, that, theories say, gave mass to matter after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. One of the proton-proton collisions measured in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experience in the search for the Higgs boson . A confirmed discovery of the Higgs boson, which could happen this year, would likely win a Nobel prize. Meeting at CERN, near Geneva, the scientists said on Wednesday that the particle looked very much like it fit into the 30-year-old Standard Model of the makeup of the universe. The existence of the Higgs boson was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. Theory has it that as the universe cooled after the Big Bang, an invisible force known as the Higgs field formed. This field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles – or Higgs bosons. As other particles pass through it, they pick up mass. Any benefits in the wider world from the discovery of the Higgs . boson will be long term, but they could be in fields as diverse as . medicine, computing and manufacturing. Experts compare the search for the Higgs boson to the discovery of the electron. The idea of the electron – a subatomic particle – was first floated . in 1838, but its presence was not confirmed for another 60 years. A century on, the electron’s existence underpins modern science. Our understanding of it is critical to the development of technology . from television and CDs to radiotherapy for cancer patient . If confirmed, it would mean LHC scientists will have to wait until late in this decade for any sign of 'new worlds of physics'. Until the last few days there had been some faint signs that the discovery might prove to be something more than the particle that would fill the last gap in the Standard Model, a comprehensive explanation of the basic composition of the universe. Rumours flew of a 'super-Higgs' that might - as recently predicted by U.S. physicist Sean Carroll in a book on the particle - 'be the link between our world and most of the matter in the universe.' British physicist Peter Higgs, who developed the theory of the Higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. Many scientists and cosmologists will be disappointed that the LHC's preliminary 3-year run from March 2010 to last month has not produced evidence of the two grails of 'new physics' - dark matter and supersymmetry. Dark matter is the mysterious substance that makes up some 25 percent of the stuff of the universe, against the tiny 4 percent - galaxies, stars and planets - which is visible. The remainder is a still unexplained 'dark energy.' The theory of supersymmetry predicts that all elementary particles have heavier counterparts, also yet to be seen. It links in with more exotica like string theory, extra dimensions, and even parallel universes. 'I think everyone had hoped for something that would take us beyond the Standard Model, but that was probably not realistic at this stage,' said one researcher, who asked not to be named. The LHC closed down last month for two years of work that will double its power, and, it is hoped, the reach of its detectors.","Finding comes after three years of data from the CERN supercollider .

"Cate Blanchett is hotly tipped to take home a Best Actress Oscar on Sunday night for her performance in Blue Jasmine, so looking red-carpet ready is top of her list of priorities this weekend. FEMAIL caught up with the A-lister ahead of the event to find out how she's preparing for one of the biggest nights of her career. While she may be one of the most famous actresses in Hollywood - she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, three Screen Actors Guild Awards and three Golden Globe Awards - Cate is modest and down to earth. Hollywood's leading lady: Cate Blanchett is tipped to pick up an Oscar on Sunday for her role in Blue Jasmine, so FEMAIL caught up with her ahead of her red carpet moment . So how is she beautifying herself ahead of Sunday? 'Well, you have to be nominated before you start to think about that,' she says. 'It’s got to be spontaneous, it’s got to be how you feel on the day.' The 44-year-old describes her signature look as 'minimal' and maintains that life is too 'interesting' to spend too much time in front of the mirror. 'I don’t have a . lot of time and I have three sons so they have no tolerance at all for . mummy spending five minutes in front of the mirror,' she says. 'I go for a pale . lip, and a bit of mascara. I think if you’re going to wear a red lip you . don’t want it wearing you so it’s about finding the right colour. Natural beauty: Cate describes her signature beauty look as 'minimal' and admits she doesn't wear very much make-up, focusing more on skincare . 'I . love a good frock so if I’m going out it comes from that and the make-up . goes accordingly. You probably have to wear less and less as you get a . bit older, because I feel more confident now in the quality of my skin . then I did ten years ago.' Speaking about her Oscar-nominated role as Jamine, she said: 'For Blue Jasmine I made a decision not to wear . any make up in the last shot of the film as I felt like she had such a . mask on - I thought it would be a good idea to leave her with nothing . and become completely transparent.' Cate reveals that priming her skin is essential and one of the best tips she's picked up from make-up artists. 'I used to just put foundation on but I think it’s about how you prime your skin. SK-II have this wonderful luminising product and I put that on before I go out.' It's no surprise that Cate uses SK-II, she has been a loyal supporter of the brand for twelve years and has recently became its ambassador. Speaking about her preoccupation with her skin and decision to join forces with the brand, she said: 'I was pregnant with our son Dashall who is about to turn 12 and it was the first time I noticed my age. 'I think I had taken the fact that my skin was quite resilient for granted, and then being pregnant I started getting melisma, my skin was different. Cate Blanchett, pictured celebrating winning Best Actress for Blue Jasmine at this month's BAFTAs, has been a loyal supporter of SK-II for twelve years and has recently been unveiled as their ambassador . 'In terms of my regime every morning it’s so simple I don’t even have to think about it. It’s literally the Essence, the Serum and then I would put the LXP moisturiser on every night. 'I put the Essence in a beautiful spray bottle so then even after I've had my makeup done I’ll nip to the bathroom and spray it on the top. You don’t go out feeling powdery or like you’ve caked makeup on.' As well as keeping her beauty regime to a minimum, slender Cate hasn't been hitting the gym in preparation for her red carpet moment. 'I don’t really [work out]. I have three boys so they keep me active. We walk a lot and run around a kick the ball and things like that. 'In the morning I’ve been taking . chlorophyll with my son, so that’s been fantastic. I also love . grapefruit juice and I don’t eat a lot of red meat. Hot water and lemon . as well,' she said. To keep her blonde hair in check, Cate swears by Viviscal supplements and, rather curiously, cling film. 'I got introduced by a French hairdresser who said it was really good for your skin, your nails and your hair. I’ve been on it for five weeks so I won’t notice the difference yet. They say five months, it’s all about consistency. 'I use the Philip Kingsley range of shampoos and they’ve got a great elasticiser which is fantastic. I wrap my hair in cling film and put that on,' she explained. While she is often touted as one of the most beautiful women in the world, Cate said there as 'so many' women she looks up to and cites her ultimate style icon as Iris Apfel. 'I remember the first time I saw Gong Li in Farewell my Concubine - she’s the most unbelievably luminous beauty. She’s an amazing amazing beauty. But also Liv Ullman is amazing. And also Judi Dench. So so beautiful,' she said. Cate Blanchett as Jasmine and Peter Sarsgaard as Dwight in Blue Jasmine, 2013 . It's safe to say that Cate is a modern icon who has embraced her pale skin, but she wasn't always so comfortable with it. 'In . 4th form at school my mother pulled me off the tin roof (I was trying . to get a tan with baby oil) and she said this is not going to happen for . you, come inside and put some sunscreen on. 'So I went the other way and went sort of goth.' With a reported net worth of £27m, Hollywood's leading lady has experienced hotels, restaurants and holidays that the rest of us could only dream of but materialism isn't what makes her happy.

"Apology: Shop girl Elisha Ram, 23, was suspended from her work at Bentalls department store and forced to apologise after she called Chelsea star John Terry 'a pig' A shop assistant was suspended from work and forced to apologise after she reportedly called Chelsea star John Terry 'a pig'. Elisha Ram, 23, was working at a department store concession when the footballer and his wife Toni walked in - and overheard her telling a colleague 'he is quite good looking in real life - but he's a pig.' Miss Ram said she was sorry, but then snapped at the defender - who asked to see her manager at Bentalls in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, to complain about her conduct. Miss Ram was then suspended from her job at the store's All Saints concession, pending an investigation by her bosses at the high street chain. Miss Ram said she had greeted Terry, 33, as he walked into the concession on Monday, before turning to her workmate and told them her feelings on the footballer, describing him as a pig. The worried colleague told Miss Ram to be quiet, and she then realised the conversation had been overheard by Mrs Terry, who married the footballer in 2007 after the pair started dating as teenagers. The footballer, who lives in nearby Oxshott, then reportedly approached Miss Ram, and told her she should not have called him a pig while his wife was present. 'I said I was really really sorry. Then I just snapped, got defensive and retaliated, saying, 'you're a disgrace,' Miss Ram's friend told The Sun's Andy Crick. Terry then asked to see her the . manager, reportedly telling Miss Ram's boss that he wouldn't have commented on Miss . Ram as he did not know her, adding: 'And she doesn't know me to call . her a pig.' According to The Sun, . Miss Ram told a friend that she had made the pig remark after reading . reports which alleged Terry had cheated on his wife, who is mother to . his twin children Georgie John and Summer Rose - who turn eight on . Sunday. Couple: John Terry and his wife Toni overheard Miss Ram saying 'he is quite good looking in real life - but he's a pig' It was claimed . Terry had an affair with the former girlfriend of his then Chelsea . teammate Wayne Bridge, French model Vanessa Perroncel. She . denied having an affair with Terry, who was stripped of the England . captaincy following reports about their relationship in 2010, saying . that the pair were 'friends'. A spokesman from clothing company All Saints said it was not the brand's policy to comment on matters relating to individual staff members. It is understood that senior shop staff sent a formal written apology to Terry, who last week signed a new 12 month deal with Chelsea, taking him to 20 years with the west London club. A Bentalls spokesman told MailOnline that the store was unable to comment as Miss Ram was employed by All Saints and any decision as to her future would be made by the fashion chain. A spokesman for Terry told MailOnline the star would not be commenting on the matter. Speaking at Miss Ram's home in Feltham, Middlesex, a woman believed to beher mother said today that she had not spoken to her daughter about the incident with Terry, and did not know what had happened at the store. Action: Miss Ram was then suspended from her job at the Bentalls All Saints concession, pending an investigation by her bosses . September 2001: The day after the September 11 terrorist attacks Terry, along with his then teammates Frank Lampard, Eidur Gudjohnsen and Jody Morris were accused of mocking American tourists during a drinking session at Heathrow Airport. They were each fined two weeks wages. January 2002: Terry was suspended from England duty after he was charged with assault and affray after an alleged confrontation with a nightclub doorman. He was cleared of all charges. February 2002: CCTV footage from an Essex nightclub appeared to show the footballer urinating into a glass before dropping it on the floor. He did not comment on the claims. March 2008: Terry was fined £60 for parking his car in a disabled bay. January 2010: It was alleged that Terry had an affair with French model  Vanessa Perroncel, the former girlfriend of his ex-teammate Wayne Bridge. She denied the claims. Terry was stripped of the England captaincy by manager Fabio Capello, who gave the armband to fellow defender Rio Ferdinand. He was re-instated as captain the following year. October 2011: It is claimed Terry made a racist slur against Anton Ferdinand during Chelsea's defeat at QPR. He was later stripped of the England captaincy for a second time by the FA board - who did not consult Capello, prompting the manager's resignation in February 2012. Terry was cleared at Westminster Magistrates' Court of making a racist insult to Ferdinand in July 2012. July 2012: Despite being cleared by magistrates, Terry is charged by the FA with using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards QPR defender Ferdinand. It is further alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Ferdinand. Terry denies the charge and requests a personal hearing. That September, after announcing his retirement from international football he was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by an FA independent regulatory commission. Terry is Chelsea's most successful captain - leading the club to three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups and the Uefa Champions League. During his career he has also worked with charities including Great Ormond Street Hospital and Make-A-Wish foundation.","Footballer and his wife Toni overheard comment made by Elisha Ram, 23 .

"A Washington state grandmother could lose an eye after she bravely rescued her grandson who was being viciously attacked by an otter as he swam in a river on Thursday. Roxane Leilani Grove's grandmotherly instinct kicked in as soon as she heard the screams of her 8-year-old grandson, Bryce Moser, and then saw the horrible sight of an otter biting him aggressively in a swimming hole in the Pilchuck River - about 30 miles northeast of Seattle. 'I could see that it was biting into his head and it had its claws around him,' Grove told KOMO News. Scroll down for video . Attacked: Roxane Leilani Grove and her grandson Bryce Moser, left, with their injuries from an otter attack at Pilchuck River, Washington . 'I just . swam out there and I grabbed the claws to pull it off of him. 'I just remember trying to hold it as tight as I can and yelling ""Get . him out of the water! Get him out of the water!""' Grove managed to get young Bryce out of the water but not before suffering her own injuries. 'It just started biting on me and biting on me and it felt like little knives just going in,' Grove told the TV station. The . pair were taken to a hospital where Grove reportedly received hundreds . of stitches to her face and head as well as the eye injury and Bryce . received nine staples in his head. State . and federal wildlife agents in Washington are trying to trap the otter . and it will likely be killed unless it is a female with pups, because it . has pounced on people, said Capt. Alan Myers of the Washington . Department of Fish and Wildlife. 'We're doing everything possible to capture than animal as soon as possible,' Myers said Friday. 'This is an extremely rare incident. Otters are not known to be aggressive toward people.' The boy's mother, Tabitha Moser, saw the four-foot otter attack her son and her mother saved him. A state worker was unable to find the otter, so expert trappers were called in from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services, Myers said. They'll try to trap it with a foot snare or tranquilize it. 'We're not sure if it's a hyper-aggressive male protecting territory or a female protecting its young,' Myers said. An eight-year-old boy and his grandmother were attacked by an otter in Washington's Pilchuck River . 'There's a lot of liability in trying to relocate an animal that's been hyper-aggressive, and it would likely be euthanized. If it's a female with pups, there's another possible outcome if we can find a good location.' But the otter would have to be killed in any case so its brain could be tested for rabies, if that's a concern for doctors treating the boy and his grandmother, he said. 'There are no known cases of otter rabies in Washington,; he said. 'That's an extremely remote possibility.' The grandmother was treated at Harborview . Medical Center in Seattle and the boy at Providence Medical Center in . Everett, the boy's mother, Tabitha Moser told KING. The attack took place in Washington's Pilchuck River - about 30 miles northeast of Seattle (pictured) 'All of a sudden I just heard him scream for his life. He was just bobbing up and down in the water and as he came up there was something all the way on top of his head,' she told KING. The otter continued to attack as they left the water. 'Even after it got into the river and out of our way it stood on its hind legs looking at us like, 'Don't do it again; don't come in here,'' she told KING. Myers said he has not heard of any other otter attacks in Washington but there have been some around the country. Lake Conner Park has been closed, and signs have been posted along the Pilchuck River warning people to beware of the otter, Myers said.","Roxane Leilani Grove is seen with bloody scratches covering her face in a picture taken after the attack .

"President . Barack Obama last night took his victory lap marking the first anniversary of the . killing of Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan, landing in Kabul amid . elaborate secrecy to deliver a live televised address. Speaking . in front of a line of military vehicles at Bagram air base, Obama . declared: ‘One year ago from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops . launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. 'The goal that I set to defeat Al Qaeda and deny it a chance to rebuild is now within our reach.' The President also used his speech to indicate that there would be a U.S. presence in the country until 2024. His previous public position has always been that troops would be out of the country by a 2014. President Obama addressed the nation after arriving on a secret unannounced visit to Afghanistan marking the first anniversary of the death of Osama bin Laden . Insisting that ‘we have a . clear path to fulfill our mission in Afghanistan’, he said that Afghans . would be responsible for their own security after 2014 but ‘two narrow . security missions’ of ‘counterterrorism and continued training’ would . still be carried out by Americans troops. His . six-hour visit to Afghanistan under cover of darkness came as . Republicans lambasted Obama for politicising the operation to take out . the al Qaeda leader and serving and former US Navy SEALs blasted him for . using their comrades as ‘ammunition’ in his election campaign against . Mitt Romney. ‘We've . seen recently that President Obama has visited college campuses in an . attempt to win back the support of that age group since he has lost it . over the last three years,"" Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma said in a . statement.

White . House aides said that the visit was to sign a strategic partnership . agreement with Afghanistan meant to mark the beginning of the end of a . war that has lasted for more than a decade. Rival: Mr Obama's campaign team has questioned whether Mitt Romney would have acted in the same manner as he did in ordering the special forces mission which culminated in the death of Osama bin Laden . But the political nature of the trip was obvious. The situation in Afghanistan was judged to be so dangerous that Obama was not permitted to be on the ground in daylight. Air .

Unannounced visit: President Obama shakes hands with U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Ryan Crocker after arriving at Bagram Air Base in Kabul, Afghanistan . Obama then met troops before delivering a speech aimed almost exclusively at the American domestic audience. To . some degree, Obama was insulated from the charge of playing petty . politics by the fact that his trip took place on the ninth anniversary . of President George W. Bush’s notorious ‘mission accomplished’ event on . board to USS Abraham Lincoln after the Iraq invasion in 2003. Before . Obama landed, Republicans had heaped criticism on Obama. Michael . Mukasey, attorney general under Bush, slammed Obama for his “plans . during the coming campaign to exploit the bragging rights to the . achievement” in an article in the Wall Street Journal.

U.S. President Barack Obama (L) and Afghan President Hamid Karzai speak before signing the Strategic Partnership Agreement at the Presidential Palace in Kabul, May 2, 2012 . The memo said: ‘The timing, operational decision making and control are in Admiral McRaven's hands. The . approval is provided on the risk profile presented to the President. Any additional risks are to be brought back to the President for his . consideration. The direction is to go in and get bin Laden and if he is . not there, to get out.’ Mukasey . highlghted ‘the way [Obama] emphasised his own role in the hazardous . mission accomplished by SEAL Team 6’ and contrasted with Bush’s praise . of American troops when Saddam Hussein was captured in 2003. Donald . Rumseld, Bush's Pentagon chief from 2001 to 2006, said via twitter that . the professionalism of the SEALs over the bin Laden raid was in . contrast to Obama's approach: 'The special operators who have every . right to ""spike the football"" are too professional to do so.

"Cover: No Easy Day is scheduled for release on September 4 . The Navy SEAL turned author who was there as Osama bin Laden was killed and promised to 'set the record straight' about the mission that led to his demise has been identified as a soldier who has since retired from service. The book's publisher announced on Wednesday that Mark Owen's 'No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden' would tell the real story about the raid in Abottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011. The book, to be published under the pseudonym 'Mark Owen,' is scheduled to be released on September 11 - the 11th anniversary of the devastating terror attacks in New York and Washington, DC. But the former serviceman's attempts to remain anonymous were foiled on Thursday, when FoxNews.com identified him as Matt Bissonnette, 36, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, who retired shortly after the bin Laden mission. Publisher Dutton, an imprint of Penguin Group, asked news organizations on Thursday to withhold his name. But that didn’t stop the Associated Press, which later confirmed the the FoxNews.com report through their own sources, and circulated the information through its subscribers. The revelation had alarm bells ringing in military circles. Pentagon spokesman Lt Col James Gregory told MailOnline that the release of a former special ops soldier’s identity can be worrisome. He said: ‘We protect the names of our special ops personnel for security reasons. Any time names are revealed, it’s a concern.' Commando: A photo purported to be of Matt Bissonnette was published by Business Insider on Thursday . In the dark: The Pentagon said that it has not seen a copy of the book, despite regulations designed to keep former and current military personnel from spilling military secrets . Lt Col Gregory also joined a chorus of U.S. agencies who claim they had no knowledge of the book before Wednesday, a possible violation of regulations that bar current and former troops from spilling military matters and national security issues. Other departments, including the CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and even the White House, were also caught off-guard. That could spell trouble for Bissonnette, who may be subject to federal charges if sensitive information appears in the book. Lt Col Gregory said that since he is now a private citizen, the military could refer the investigation to the Department of Justice. Target: A member of Seal Team Six shot and killed Osama bin Laden during the elite squad's daring raid of his compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan . Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the Situation Room of the White House . But any judicial action would hinge on the content of No Easy Day. 'We . don't know what kind of details [are in the book], so we can't make a . determination over whether it's classified or not,' Lt Col Gregory said. But the publisher maintains that . Bissonnette's writings were properly vetted by a former special . operations attorney, and will not let any military cats out of the bag. Christine Ball, a spokeswoman for the Dutton, the publisher, told Reuters: 'He vetted it for tactical, technical, and procedural information as well as information that could be considered classified by compilation and found it to be without risk to national security.' Terror house: Bin Laden's compound has since been torn down . No Easy Day is co-authored by journalist Kevin . Maurer, has worked on four previous books - including two in the last . year and a half about soldiers in Afghanistan. Maurer . spent the last several years embedded with troops in Iraq and . Afghanistan as a military correspondent for the Fayetteville Observer. The New York Times's Media Decoder blog reported on Wednesday that the book also goes into detail about Bissonnette's incredible training that led him to become a Navy SEAL. The blog added that the book will . culminate with a 'blow by blow' account of the dramatic raid in the . terror leader's Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound. No Easy Day's listing on Amazon.com . says that among Owen's hundreds of missions around the world as a SEAL Team . Six commando was the rescue of Capt Richard Phillips from Somali pirates . in 2009. Watching: In this undated image from video seized from bin Laden's compound, the Al-Qaeda chief watches a TV programme showing an image of President Obama . Owen's book comes on the heels of . another account of the bin Laden takedown that claims the raid was nixed . three times by Obama, but finally went ahead at the urging of Hillary . Clinton. That explosive allegation is . contained in an expose by journalist Rich Miniter, who argues that the . White House’s carefully-crafted narrative of Obama as a decisive leader . who took out the al-Qaeda leader despite the doubts of advisers is a . myth. Leading from Behind: The Reluctant President and the Advisors Who Decide for Him was published on Tuesday. A . film about the bin Laden raid, Zero Dark Thirty - from Hurt Locker . director Kathryn Bigelow - is due to be released December 19. Republicans chided the White House earlier this year amid reports that Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal - who both won Academy Awards for The Hurt Locker - were given unprecedented access to classified information.

"Reality star Honey Boo Boo is set to take over the world as the beauty pageant queen and her colorful family have their show broadcast internationally, it was announced today.

In the next few months, Honey Boo Boo will appear on screens in Australia, the Netherlands, Italy and Latin America. Luis Silberwasser, executive VP at Discovery Networks International, told the New York Post: 'In Poland, where it just started airing, it’s already No. 3 in terms of viewers.

"An internet 'troll' who sent a threatening email to a Conservative MP was banned today from contacting a host of celebrities - including Lord Sugar. Frank Zimmerman avoided jail by a whisker when a district judge suspended a 26-week prison sentence for two years after he sent an offensive email to Corby MP Louise Mensch. The bearded 60-year-old, who was taken to court by police today after being arrested for failing to attend his sentencing last week, was given the suspended sentence, ordered to pay costs and made subject of a restraining order. Agoraphobic Frank Zimmerman was today spared jail as he was sentenced for 'trolling' Louise Mensch . The order - until further notice - bans the agoraphobic from contacting a string of well-known people. The list includes Mrs Mensch, her businessman husband Peter, and Mrs Mensch's ex-husband, property developer Anthony LoCicero. Lord Sugar, the Amstrad businessman and star of hit TV Show The Apprentice, was named on the restraining order, as was Terence Blacker, a columnist with the Independent newspaper and Zimmerman's former neighbour in London. Also listed was General Sir Mike Jackson - once head of the British Army - and David Petraeus, former US Army commander in Iraq and Afghanistan and now director of the CIA. Tory MP Louise Mensch tweeted to her followers: 'Had some morons threaten my children by email. To those who sent it; get stuffed losers' A previous hearing heard how Zimmerman had last year targeted the outspoken Mrs Mensch, telling her to stop using the social networking site Twitter or face the consequences. The white-haired defendant, who lives in a run down house in Gloucester, told Mrs Mensch she faced a 'Sophie's Choice' - a reference to a novel in which heroine Sophie has to choose between the life of her son or daughter at a Nazi concentration camp. The email, which was dated August 22, 2011, said: 'Subject: You have been HACKED :D . 'Louise Mensch, nee Bagshawe, the slut of Twitter. 'We are Anonymous and we don't like rude c**** like you and your nouveau riche husband Peter Mensch. You have been hacked! 'We are inside your computer and all your phones, everywhere ... and inside your homes. 'So get off Twitter. 'We see you are still on Twitter. We have sent a camera crew to photograph you and your kids and will post it all over the net, including Twitter. C***face. 'You now have a Sophie's Choice. Which kid is to go? One will, count on it c***. 'Have a nice day . 'From all of us at MIT 617-253-1000.' The Northamptonshire MP, 40, who has a Twitter following of 50,000, immediately called in the police and arranged security for her family. Unbowed, she went on to tweet to followers: 'Had some morons threaten my children by email. To those who sent it; get stuffed losers.' But in her victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs Mensch revealed the fear that the email had caused her. 'I was terrified on behalf of my children. I was in New York with my husband recovering from an operation and my children were with their father and to receive a threat like this made me very upset,' she said. 'I was 3,000 miles away from my children and I was worried for their safety and the safety of my ex-husband. I felt powerless to do anything.' 'He made reference to the contents of the email and that one of my children would die and it made me believe he was responsible,' she said. The offensive email was later traced to the IP address of Zimmerman's home computer. He was charged with an offence of sending by public communication network an offensive, indecent, obscene, menacing message or matter. The case against Zimmerman, from Barnwood, Gloucester, had been proven in his absence after he failed to attend court - blaming his agoraphobia and depression. He was supposed to have been sentenced at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court last week but failed to attend. Police arrested him this morning for breach of bail, an offence he admitted once he was brought to court. Some of the horrific emails sent to Louise Mensch by Frank Zimmerman . Zimmerman, who is extremely well spoken, wore a dark blue coat and glasses for today's short hearing. The last time he had faced District Judge Martin Brown he had appeared via video link from a side room but today he was in the dock of court room one surrounded by two guards, having been brought up in handcuffs from the cells. Zimmerman does not accept his guilt and blamed hackers for sending the email from his IP address. At a previous hearing he said he had received correspondence from broadband supplier Virgin Media stating his computer had been hacked but has, so far, failed to produce the letter to the court. Zimmerman has been told not to contact Ms Mensch and other high-profile people as part of his sentence . Kirsty Gordon-Cleaver, defending, said her client was maintaining his innocence. 'Mr Zimmerman wants the court to know that he is considering an appeal,' she said. 'He never will contact the people on the restraining order and it does not cause him any problems. He does, however, uphold his innocence in respect of this.' Passing sentence, the district judge told Zimmerman that he had committed a very serious crime. 'I have heard about the allegations and in my view they went beyond mere mischief,' he said. 'These were ugly, unpleasant and serious remarks to the complainant by email. Quite understandably they caused her great concern. 'They cross the custody threshold because of the seriousness. 'Because of your age and because of your conditions and I accept that you have certain problems, although I do not accept they are as severe as you make out, I am prepared to suspend the sentence.' As part of the suspended sentence, Zimmerman is banned from contacting Mrs Mensch. On hearing that, the defendant replied: 'There are no problems with that happening. You have my word.' The district judge continued: 'If you do, you will be in breach of that suspended sentence and you will give the court no alternative but to implement it. 'If you commit any further offences, that will also trigger the activation of that suspended sentence.' District Judge Brown told Zimmerman that if he breached the restraining order, he could be jailed for up to five years. The defendant was also given a four-week sentence for the bail offence, which runs concurrently to the 26-week sentence, and ordered to pay £300 prosecution costs. The district judge said he had decided against banning Zimmerman from using a computer. 'It had been my intention to prohibit him from using a computer and I accept the human rights angle and I accept the problems of policing that,' he said. Louise Mensch made her followers aware of what was happening when Zimmerman started sending the vile messages . Mrs Mensch took to Twitter to praise the police and the House of Commons authorities.'Now finally free to talk about this,' she wrote. 'I want to thank Det Sgt Iggy Azad & all at House of Commons & Northants Police. 'Other women besides myself were targeted by this man; and police forces (not knowing who was behind threats) were forced to devote resources. 'Sentence seems proportionate and just. I hope it will deter others from this kind of abuse and bullying.' Before Zimmerman was released, he asked the judge: 'May I ask how I am able to get home? I have no money.' The judge said he did not have any duty to get him home and added: 'You have had plenty of time to organise your finances.' As he left the dock, Zimmerman said: 'I thank you for your time.' Previously, Zimmerman told the court that he does not have enough money to even eat. 'I have no means of getting home,' he said. 'I am not physically capable of walking and I have no money. I have no money. I simply cannot afford to eat. 'I still have a vestige of pride. I do not have enough money to eat continually for four weeks every month, so every month I don't eat for seven days. 'It is 11 days since I had anything to eat. 'There is no way that I can afford a taxi to Cheltenham and back.'","Frank Zimmerman contacted Tory MP telling her to choose one of her children .

"Footage has surfaced of an Australian news reporter speaking to the man believed to be an Islamic State (IS) militant back in 2011. 9News foreign correspondent Peter Stefanovic came face-to-face with former British rapper Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary one evening when tensions were high on the streets of London during the 2011 riots. Previously, Bary has been thought to be 'Jihadi John' - an extremist who has been linked to the execution of five Western aid workers in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Nine News reporter Peter Stefanovic (right) spoke to the now infamous Jihadi John (left) back in 2011 . Jihadi John (right), real name Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, is said to have beheaded five Western hostages who were being held by Islamic State . In footage aired on Monday night's 9News bulletin, Stefanovic is seen interviewing another man before Bary commands control of the microphone. 'Let me tell you something', Bary said. 'The police are protecting the police station, they're not protecting the people. 'A policeman said it out of his own words when I asked him ""why are you here"". 'He said I'm here to protect the police.' Stefanovic told 9News he met Bary on the first night of the riots on the streets of Tottenham in North London. 'There were hundreds of young people loitering near a burning building that police and firefighters were trying to control,' he said. 'There was a lot of friction and tension simmering on the streets and this group of young men crowded around me as I was filming a piece-to-camera.' Most recently he has been linked to the beheading of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig who was killed along with a group of Syrian soldiers in a chilling video released on Sunday night . Bary took over when Stefanovic was interviewing another man on the first night of riots in Tottenham three years ago . He is believed to be responsible for the beheading of American journalist James Foley (left) This comes following the news that Jihadi John was injured in a US airstrike at the weekend . While the Australian broadcaster is reporting Bary is Jihadi John, it emerged in September British intelligence official did not believe he was the notorious terrorist. But they did know Bary had travelled to Syria last year, and is linked to Jihadi John and the beheading videos. This comes following the news that Jihadi John was injured in a US airstrike which killed at least 10 other IS fighters. The masked ‘executioner’ with a London accent - who has beheaded two British and three American hostages - is believed to have narrowly escaped death on Saturday. He was attending a summit of the group’s leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border. Jihadi John rose to international notoriety when he appeared in videos where he beheaded British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning as well as U.S. journalists James Foley and Steve Sotloff. Most recently he has been linked to the beheading of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig who was killed along with a group of Syrian soldiers in a chilling video released on Sunday night. Stefanovic told 9News he met Bary on the first night of the riots on the streets of Tottenham, North London . The masked ‘executioner’ with a London accent is believed to have narrowly escaped death on Saturday . Unlike most western Muslim recruits who are normally foot soldiers or guards, the extremist has risen in the IS ranks to become a senior figure from the role of prison guard. He has been appointed as a member of a governing body of an IS 'wilayat' or province. A Daily Mail source adds Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa - the Syrian hub of the terror group - but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq. Jihadi John is believed to be between the ages of 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, which is used in the Koran. He first joined IS in Iraq when he left the U.K., but then moved to Syria.","Peter Stefanovic spoke to Jihadi John during the London riots in 2011 .

"The US delivered a stunning snub to Britain yesterday, lavishing praise on its ‘oldest ally’ France as the two countries prepared to launch missile strikes on Syria as early as this weekend. Secretary of State John Kerry paid tribute to the French for standing ready to join the US in confronting the ‘thug and murderer’ President Bashar Assad. In a White House address last night, Mr Kerry pointedly made no mention of Britain – despite the historic ‘special relationship’ between the two nations. Instead America was ‘confident and gratified’ it was ‘not alone’ in its will to act, he said, praising France, Australia and even Turkey for their support.

'History will judge us harshly': He said the . West's 'fatigue' with war 'does not absolve us of our . responsibility' to intervene in Syria, accusing its president, Bashar . Assad, of 'wanton use of weapons of mass destruction' He called France ‘our oldest ally’, apparently forgetting the anger a decade ago at its refusal to support the Iraq War, which led to the French being satirised in US media as ‘cheese-eating surrender monkeys’. In a further snub, Barack Obama later said he would prefer to take multilateral action rather than acting alone but added: ‘Ultimately we don’t want the world to be paralysed.’ In a coded swipe at the UK, the President said: ‘A lot of people think something should be done but nobody wants to do it.’ Insisting that the use of chemical weapons is the ‘kind of offence that is a challenge to the world,’ he confirmed the US was considering a ‘limited, narrow act’ intended to deter their use. 'We don't want to be paralysed': U.S. Barack . Obama took a coded swipe at the UK's reluctance as he spoke on the build up to . Western attacks on Syria .

He said the West’s ‘fatigue’ with conflict ‘does not absolve us of our responsibility’, insisting: ‘History will judge us all extraordinarily harshly, if we turn a blind eye to a dictator’s wanton use of weapons of mass destruction.’ Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said last night it would be deeply ‘uncomfortable’ to see the Americans and French working together ‘while we stand and watch’. ‘I am disappointed and I am slightly apprehensive,’ he said. ‘We have a very close working relationship with the Americans. 'It is a difficult time for our armed forces, having prepared to go into this action, to then be stood down and have to watch while the US acts alone or perhaps the US acts with France.’ 'Hit Assad down': Protesters in Kafranbel, in .

Amid bitter recriminations in Westminster over Parliament’s refusal to back potential British involvement in military action, David Cameron accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of ‘siding with’ Russia and ‘letting down America’. Anger grew as, despite ordering his MPs to vote against action, Mr Miliband insisted Britain could not ‘wash its hands’ of the Syrian people. As one Tory rebel said the vote had ‘relieved Britain of its imperial pretension’, Chancellor George Osborne called for a period of soul searching over Britain’s place in the world . Cabinet ministers are in despair at the self-inflicted wound delivered by the Prime Minister’s rush to recall Parliament and his doomed attempt to persuade MPs to back his judgment. Thirty Tory rebels joined Labour MPs in rejecting even the ‘principle’ of Britain joining military action against Syria and another 32, including ten members of the Government, were absent.

Foreign Secretary William Hague, who last night faced a call from UKIP to resign over the fiasco, was said to be ‘deeply depressed’ about the outcome, the first time since the 18th century that a prime minister had lost a vote on military intervention. Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown said: ‘In more than 50 years of trying to serve my country in one form or another, I don’t think I’ve ever felt more depressed this morning or, indeed, more ashamed.’","John Kerry praises 'oldest ally' France for supporting attacks on Syria .

"Neanderthals have been extinct for 33,000 years, but George Church, a genetics professor at Harvard Medical School, believes he can bring them back with the help of a surrogate human mother. They're usually thought of as a brutish, primitive species. So what woman would want to give birth to a Neanderthal baby? Yet this incredible scenario is the plan of one of the world’s leading geneticists, who is seeking a volunteer to help bring man’s long-extinct close relative back to life. Professor George Church of Harvard Medical School believes he can reconstruct Neanderthal DNA and resurrect the species which became extinct 33,000 years ago. His scheme is reminiscent of Jurassic Park but, while in the film dinosaurs were created in a laboratory, Professor Church’s ambitious plan requires a human volunteer. He said his analysis of Neanderthal genetic code using samples from bones is complete enough to reconstruct their DNA. He said: ‘Now I need an adventurous female human. ‘It depends on a hell of a lot of things, but I think it can be done.’ Professor Church’s plan would begin by artificially creating Neanderthal DNA based on genetic code found in fossil remains. He would put this DNA into stem cells. These would be injected into cells from a human embryo in the early stages of life. It is thought that the stem cells would steer the development of the hybrid embryo on Neanderthal lines, rather than human ones. After growing in the lab for a few days, the ‘neo-Neanderthal’ embryo would be implanted in the womb of a surrogate mother – the volunteer. Professor Church, 58, is a pioneer in synthetic biology who helped initiate the Human Genome Project that mapped our DNA. Big ideas: Contrary to belief, Neanderthals had a larger brain size and may have been more intelligent than humans . Bringing the past alive: A scene from the film Jurassic Park, which suggested dinosaurs could be recreated through DNA trapped in amber . He says Neanderthals were not the lumbering brutes of the  stereotype, but highly intelligent. Their brains were roughly the same size as man’s, and they made primitive tools. Cloning the caveman: Geneticist Professor George Church . He believes his project could  benefit mankind. He told German magazine Der Spiegel: ‘Neanderthals might think differently than we do. They could even be more intelligent than us. ‘When the time comes to deal with an epidemic or getting off the planet, it’s conceivable that their way of thinking could be beneficial.’ Scientists say that his plan is theoretically possible, although in Britain, like most countries, human reproductive cloning is a criminal offence. But Professor Church’s proposal is so cutting-edge that it may not be covered by existing laws. However, experts worry that neo-Neanderthals might lack the immunity to modern diseases to survive, and some fear that the process might lead to deformity. There is also uncertainty over how they would fit into today’s world. Bioethicist Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University said: ‘I don’t think it’s fair to put people... into a circumstance where they are going to be mocked and possibly feared.’ In a scathing reaction, Philippa Taylor of the Christian Medical Fellowship said: ‘It is hard to know where to begin with the ethical and safety concerns.’","Professor George Church of Harvard Medical School believes he can reconstruct Neanderthal DNA .

"A new chemical could make human teeth 'cavity proof' - and do away with the need for visits to the dentists forever . A new chemical could make human teeth 'cavity proof' - and do away with the need for visits to the dentists forever. The molecule has been called 'Keep 32' - after the 32 teeth in a human mouth. The chemical was designed by dentists in Chile, and wipes out all the bacteria that cause cavities in just 60 seconds in tests. The chemical could be added to any current dental care product, turning toothpaste, mouthwash and chewing gum into 'super cleansers' that could get rid of the underlying cause of tooth decay. The chemical targets 'streptococcus mutans', the bacteria that turns the sugar in your mouth into lactic acid which erodes tooth enamel. By exterminating the bacteria, 'Keep 32' prevents the damage to teeth before it happens. Using a product containing the chemical keeps your teeth 'cavity proof' for several hours. The product has been under test for seven years, and is now going into human trials. It could be on the market in 14 to 18 months, say researchers José Córdoba from Yale University and Erich Astudillo from the University of Chile. The chemical could even be added to foods to stop bacteria damaging teeth as you eat. The researchers hope to licence the patent to chemical giants such as Procter and Gamble. 'We are currently in talks with five interested in investing in our project or buy our patent,' say the researchers.","Chemical could be added to toothpastes in year's time .

"A woman was today ordered to stand trial in Australia, accused of breaking into a man’s home and raping him. Rebecca Helen Elder, 39, pleaded not guilty to one count of aggravated serious criminal trespass at the man’s home, and one count of rape. She appeared in Adelaide’s District Court this morning. Accused: Rebecca Elder leaves court after denying accusations that she broke into a man's house and performed oral sex on him without his consent . Prosecution documents, filed with the court, allege both offences took place at a suburban location between September 20 and September 23 last year. At trial, prosecutors will allege Elder, of Parkside, broke into a house while its male occupant - who cannot be named - was lawfully on the premises. They will also say she broke in with the intention of committing a further offence of rape. Finally, prosecutors will accuse Elder of raping the man by performing an act of oral sex without his consent. Judge Wayne Chivell remanded Elder on continuing bail until a directions hearing next month.

"Shrink me: Ultimo's new Boobs Minus cream claims to lift, firm, reshape and shrink breasts . She has made millions helping women enhance their cleavage with her Ultimo bra range. Now entrepreneur Michelle Mone wants to cash in on those feeling the burden of a bigger bosom. The 40-year-old is launching a new USculpt range of creams which claim to offer the first 'breast reduction in a bottle'. The product, entitled Boobs Minus, will cost £39.50 for 150ml and will be on sale in Boots. Its launch comes at a time when British women’s breast size is rapidly increasing – in the fifties the average cup size was a B, but now it’s risen to a C. In the past three years, the number of D-cups and above sold by Marks & Spencer has doubled, accounting for a quarter of all bra sales. The biggest strapped bra on the market comes in a size 48N, created by Rigby & Peller, the Queen’s underwear retailer. Model's own: Miss Mone modelling Ultimo in 2010 . Last year 5,291 breast reductions . were performed in the UK – an increase of 6.2 per cent on 2010 - and it . is estimated hundreds more women opted to have the procedure abroad. Speaking to MailOnline, Miss . Mone said: 'I'm so excited about the new USculpt product range. 'We have been developing this for three years and spent £1million in order to get to our launch today. 'I wanted to put Boobs Minus to the test myself and have seen incredible results. 'I used it twice a day for just four weeks and I’m amazed to say I’ve dropped half a cup size already! 'I've spoken to many women in my career about their boobs and many have said they want to tone and firm them without going under the knife. 'I'm so pleased to give them another option with Boobs Minus and I'm sure other women will achieve great results as well.' She added: 'I always listen to the needs of my customers, and many . women I have spoken to would love to reduce their bust size. 'A breast . reduction is a major operation and I believe this [cream] is a great . alternative. 'When I was . developing the product I gave samples to friends to try and the results . have been incredible with reports of a dramatic one-cup size decrease . after using it over an eight-week period.' She added that product had taken over three years to develop and an investment of £1 million pounds. There will also be a Boobs Plus cream that claims to enhance the bust and is designed to plump, lift and firm the breasts, and a B.L.T. product which targets the bottom, legs and tummy. Miss Mone claims that the Boobs- product contains 'firming ingredients' such as extracts of rainforest fruits such as Acai, Cupuaçu, and Maracuja, to minimise the signs of ageing. But the main ingredient is Wild Indigo, a herb which switches the cells that activate the breakdown of fat in the body. The cream also features Golden . Chamomile which is a flavonoid – a type of anti-oxidant which tests . suggest helps inhibit the storage of fat and boosts breakdown of fat . cells. But the company was unable to provide any figures showing if consumers have found the product effective. It has been a difficult year for Miss . Mone, who has split from Michael, her husband of 20 years. He left her . for her former colleague and designer Samantha Bunn at Christmas.

"A police officer has kept his job despite getting so drunk while on duty that he fell off his desk and had to be put to bed by an inmate he was supposed to be supervising. PC Danny Dance, a custody officer at Millgarth police station in Leeds, fell unconscious after drinking a bottle of whisky during a night shift. PC Dance was not punished for the incident which came to light during an investigation into the treatment of prolific burglar Karl Chapman. PC Danny Dance who was so drunk that he was put to bed in one of the Leeds police cells by the so-called supergrass Karl Chapman who he was minding . Chapman was a police informant who had been given alcohol, allowed to use cannabis and heroin, go to pubs and visit a brothel as part of a series of inducements. During an interview, PC Dance said: 'I got drunk. I was sat on the custody desk and I fell off. 'That . is the last I recall of the night. When I woke up I was in the holing . cell and it was the next day... I recall Chapman later saying words to . the effect: ""Fancy being put to bed by the prisoner"".' Police conduct towards Champan came under scrutiny after the publication of a report in 2011. Two men had their convictions quashed for the murder of an 85-year-old man in 1996. Chapman was being held in police custody while he gave evidence at a crown court trial against his criminal accomplice Gary Ford, with whom he had carried out a series of 'bogus official' robberies. PC Andrew Leonard found the custody suite in a terrible state the following morning. He said: 'The custody area was a mess, . it smelled of alcohol. 'There . were empty cans and bottles all over the place including whisky. I was . conscious of the visit by the review officer around 9am daily. I started . to clear up the empties into a holdall which I carried with me and . disposed of them outside. Joe Smales (left) who was beaten and later died after being attacked and robbed at his home in Wakefield 1996 . The incident involving PC Danny Dance happened at Millgarth police station in Leeds, West Yorkshire, in 1996 . 'I sprayed around with an air freshener and opened the window to let fresh air in. I remember checking to see where Chapman was and that he was in a suitable position for the impending visit. 'I do recall he was drunk and in a cell. 'I cannot recall who it was on the floor but I dragged him without him waking into the interview room and then locked him inside. 'I do recall that Karl Chapman when he woke up was laughing and joking about what had happened the previous night had been a ""heavy night"".' The scale of the drinking Chapman enjoyed when he was at Millgarth was emphasised in a letter from a girlfriend - who was in prison too. She said she looked forward to him returning to prison custody, adding: '...at least back at [prison] you won't be steaming drunk all the time.' It has now become clear that two men have launched claims for damages after spending a total of 20 years behind bars - on the basis of tainted evidence procured by officers who concealed the improper inducements to Chapman. Danny Mansell, whose conviction for the murder of pensioner Joe Smales was overturned, and Gary Ford, who had the majority of his convictions for robbery and burglary quashed, have both formally served civil claims on the force. And it can also be revealed that Mr Mansell's solicitor is to formally challenge the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) over its decision not to prosecute any police officers despite a Supreme Court judgment which stated officers had committed crimes. Matthew Gold said he was prepared to take the CPS to court if no adequate explanation was provided. The solicitors for both men were reluctant to comment on the potential level of damages but it is understood to be at least £250,000 for Mr Ford and potentially more for Mr Mansell. Mr Gold said he would be writing to the CPS to press for prosecutions against officers to be brought. He said: 'Upon receiving a decision from the CPS, if it' s negative with inadequate reasons it's likely that decision will be challenged by judicial review.' He confirmed a formal claim for damages had been lodged with West Yorkshire Police. The force is due to serve its defence this month. Mr Mansell spent 12 years in prison, including on remand, before his conviction for the murder of Mr Smales was quashed in 2009. He was originally convicted with his brother Paul Maxwell, whose conviction was also quashed before he pleaded guilty at a retrial. The Supreme Court ruling on whether Maxwell should face a retrial, published in July 2011, delivered devastating criticism of West Yorkshire Police and said the actions of officers amounted to perverting the course of justice, perjury and misconduct in public office.","PC Danny Dance was not punished for the incident on a night shift .

"A mother who was sent death threats by so-called internet ‘trolls’ has won a landmark legal case against Facebook. Nicola Brookes was tormented for months by anonymous internet bullies after she left an innocent message of support for an X Factor contestant on the social networking site. She went to police to make a complaint but claimed officers told her to go home. Months of torment: Nicola Brookes was targeted by internet trolls after she messaged her support for X Factor star Frankie Cocozza . Now she has won a legal order forcing Facebook to disclose the identities of the trolls. It is the first time an individual has won such an order and Miss Brookes, 45, hopes to pursue private prosecutions against those responsible for her months of ‘vicious and depraved’ abuse. Charities said the High Court ruling sent a message to the cyber bullies that their anonymity can be stripped away, leaving them open to prosecution. Campaigners warned that online bullying has become the ‘weapon of choice’ among children and teenagers, with police and prosecutors failing to keep pace with the changes in technology. Miss Brookes’s ordeal began last November when her daughter told her that an X Factor contestant, Frankie Cocozza, had received hate mail on Facebook. Stung by the cruelty, the mother left a message on his Facebook page, saying simply: ‘Keep your chin up, Frankie, they’ll move on to someone else soon.’ How it started: Nicola's support for X Factor's Frankie Cocozza led to a horrid hate-campaign against her . Within minutes bullies on the site turned on her, writing vile abuse including ‘Your [sic] a desperate pedo b****’ and ‘Ur [sic] a ****ing dog’. More than 100 cruel messages were left in just 24 hours. Miss Brookes said: ‘Facebook users began deliberately targeting me, writing under my comment that I was a paedophile and hoping that I would die.’ Worse followed when an online bully set up a fake Facebook profile in Miss Brookes’ name, with her photo and personal email address, and used it to send explicit messages to thousands of children, some as young as nine. Some messages falsely described her as a drug dealer, a prostitute and a paedophile and known child abuser, and others attempted to ‘befriend’ young girls. On Mother’s Day this year, trolls published the single mother’s home address in Brighton. Horrified, she reported the abuse to Facebook and the police, but said officers did nothing to help her. She said one officer told her she could leave a dossier of evidence ‘but we won’t read it’. Frustrated by their response Miss Brookes contacted lawyers and began legal action to force Facebook to reveal details about her anonymous tormentors. Last week the High Court granted an order compelling the site to disclose the bullies’ names, email addresses and their computers’ internet protocol (IP) addresses, which can be used to determine a computer’s location. Miss Brookes said: ‘These abusers are not just random people who have nothing better to do with their time. ‘These are organised people who have been operating on Facebook for years. ‘I’m going for the strongest possible prosecution against these people. I want them exposed.’ Last month, a survey found that just over half of all internet users have received abuse online or by text message. Only a minority report the abuse to police as many believe it will not be taken seriously. Jibes: Nicola Brookes has her picture posted on Facebook - and someone suggests she has been sending round pictures of child abuse . Offensive: Some more of the abuse that went on Facebook. This page formed part of the evidence that Nicola's solicitors presented to the High Court . Prosecutions under the Malicious Communications Act, which makes it illegal to send grossly offensive messages, have increased three-fold since 2004. There were almost 900 such prosecutions last year but prosecutors accept that only a minority of trolls are brought to justice. Miss Brookes has remained on Facebook despite the abuse and said she was determined not to be bullied into quitting the site. Her legal action would have cost her up to £5,000 but her solicitors Bains Cohen agreed to take the case for free because of her horrific treatment. Lawyer Rupinder Bains said Facebook had not contested the action and had agreed to hand over the information within six weeks. Four individuals were believed to have led the abuse against Miss Brookes and her lawyers will consider private prosecutions against them. If their Facebook accounts were set up using fake names and email addresses, lawyers will have to return to court and win similar orders against the trolls’ internet service providers, to get the bill-payers’ addresses. Rise of the sick internet trolls . Vile: Ms Brookes shows off print outs of some of the abuse she suffered online at the hands of tormenters . Abuse: A false Facebook page that was set-up for Nicola Brookes by the cyber bullies .

"Celebrities including Rihanna have come out in support of a children's charity facing a backlash over over a You Tube video targeting an African Warlord. Invisible Children posted a 30 minute documentary about the actions of brutal African warlord Joseph Kony, whose bloodthirsty Lord's . Resistance Army has terrorised parts of east and central Africa for 25 . years, on the website. But as accusations emerge that the non-profit organisation spent the vast majority of its donations on film production, staff salaries and transport in producing the You Tube viral, several celebrities have lent their name to the cause. Rihanna, pictured at this year's Grammy Awards, has called Invisible Children to discuss helping the charity while other celebs including rapper P Diddy, chat show queen Oprah Winfrey and Justin Bieber have also voiced interest in the campaign . The aim of the campaign is to raise awareness of Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda . Campaigners want to see an end to Kony's brutal rebellion in Uganda . In the YouTube video 'KNOY 2012', producers beg . for celebrity support to raise awareness and showed a picture of . Rihanna, in an effort to get her involved. And the plea seems to have worked, . with Rihanna contacting the charity this week expressing an interest in . creating another video to keep the momentum against Kony going, . according to American website TMZ. Other celebrities including rapper P . Diddy, chat show queen Oprah Winfrey and Justin Bieber have also voiced . interest in the campaign. The Twitter hashtags #stopkony and . #kony2012 were yesterday trending worldwide as campaigners sought to . increase international pressure for the killer to be caught with the . viral video that has now been viewed 26million times. But some experts are still questioning Invisible Children's . motives and charitable record. Joseph Kony launched his guerilla army in 1987 but the group has no political aim. He claims to be fighting under God's orders to establish a society based on the Bible's Ten Commandments. He has led a campaign of fear throughout northern Uganda and neighbouring countries. The organisation is believed to have murdered tens of thousands of people, abducted at least 30,000 children to work as sex slaves or soldiers and forced more than 1.5million people to flee their homes. The brutal campaign has forced millions to live in fear and sees families in some areas abandoning their rural homes at night to sleep in makeshift refugee camps. Kony and several of his leading lieutenants were indicted in 2005 by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. The group's founders, who support . military action against Kony, have also been criticised for offering . support to the armies of Sudan and Uganda despite claims both have been . involved in rape and looting. Despite the controversy, the KONY 2012 . video was this week appearing to achieve the group's stated aim of . raising awareness about the warlord. The 50-year-old Ugandan launched his . guerilla army in 1987 and claims to be fighting under God's orders to . establish a society based on the Bible's Ten Commandments.

The group operated for more than a . decade in northern Uganda but left in 2008 and have since committed . atrocities in Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central . African Republic. Uganda's army has theoretically hunted . the organisation's leaders but Kony has continually evaded capture - at . times arrogantly even emerging from the jungle to give interviews to . journalists before disappearing again. Last October American president Barack Obama announced he was sending troops to help the hunt for the LRA. Around 100 US soldiers have since been deployed in the region to help local officials trace the mass killer.","Motives and charitable record of Invisible Child called into question over cost of producing the You Tube video on warlord Joseph Kony .

"At least six people have been killed in an early morning suicide attack in the Afghan capital, hours after a surprise visit to Afghanistan by President Barack Obama, government officials said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was a response to Mr Obama's visit. A series of explosions and gunfire rang out in eastern Kabul at around 6am near a private armed compound that houses hundreds of international workers. Blaze: Afghan Firefighters extinguish a burning car at the site of the suicide bomb attack in Kabul. Smoke: Security personnel urge onlookers away after the attack. Shooting continued for hours and it . was not clear later whether the attack had ended, as another large . explosion sounded around 8am from inside the complex, known as Green . Village. An Afghan police official said two suicide attackers were still inside Green Village and were 'resisting'. One of the first blasts was a suicide . car bomb that exploded near Jalalabad Road, one of the main routes out . of the city, said Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi. A station wagon that was driving past was caught up in the explosion and four people inside were killed, Mr Sediqi said. Attacked: An explosion killed six people in Kabul today, just hours after President Obama visited Bagram Air Field in Afghanistan . Greetings: Mr Obama was there to mark the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death as well as meet with Afghan President Hamid Karza . A passer-by and a security guard for a nearby building also were killed. The explosions happened hours after Mr . Obama left Afghanistan after a quick visit to mark the first . anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death. He spoke to troops and signed a pact with Afghan President Hamid Karzai to govern the US presence in Afghanistan until 2024. 'I'm here to affirm the bond between . our two countries and to thank Americans and Afghans who have sacrificed . so much over these last ten years,' said Mr Obama. 'Neither Americans nor the Afghan people asked for this war yet for a decade we've stood together.' The agreement with Karzai covers how . the U.S. will be involved with security, economics and governance after . the unpopular war is brought to an end. Death Toll: At least six people were killed in the suicide car bomb attack . Wreckage: Afghan police stand beside wreckage of vehicles, securing the area in front of a guesthouse in Kabul after the suicide bombing. As he battles for re-election, Obama . is seeking to portray his foreign policy record, including the killing . of bin Laden, as a success - yet it has also come under scrutiny. Serving and former US Navy SEALs . slammed the president for taking the credit for killing bin Laden and . accused him of using Special Forces operators as ‘ammunition’ for his . re-election campaign. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid . claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was planned as a . response to Mr Obama's trip. Anniversary: The President's visit marked the first anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden . 'This is a reaction to Obama's visit . to Afghanistan,' Mr Mujahid said, without elaborating. He said the . target was a 'foreign military base'. Nato forces spokesman Captain Justin Brockhoff said there were no indications that any Nato bases were under attack. The Green Village complex, with its . towering blast walls and heavily armed security force, is similar . in appearance to Nato bases in the city. A reporter at the scene saw a group of . Afghan soldiers enter the Green Village compound, after which heavy . shooting could be heard coming from inside. Outside the complex, men could be seen . carrying a wounded man covered with blood, apparently pulled out of the . flames engulfing a nearby car. 'These people evacuated a man from the . burning car, two bodies are laying there now and three or four other . victims were evacuated from the school,' said Ahmad Zia, a resident who . saw the explosion. Green Village was also the target of . anti-foreigner protests following the burning of Korans at a US base in . February. At that time, violent protests raged outside, but the angry . crowds did not breach the compound's defences.","Taliban claim responsibility - and say it was response to President's visit .

"A police officer who visited a hospital after a dying patient made a 999 call begging for a drink told an inquest he witnessed nursing staff ignoring his requests for water. PC Matthew Oommen, who visited Kane Gorny after the emergency call at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, south London, said he heard the patient twice ask for a drink but no water was brought. Kane, 22, lost more than a third of his body fluid while recovering from a hip operation at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, southwest London. He needed vital medication to help his body retain fluid and resorted to phoning 999 to beg for a drink. Officers arrived at Kane Gorny's bedside, but were told by nurses that he was in a confused state and were sent away. Hospital: Kane Gorny, 22, pictured with his mother Rita, needed drugs to regulate his hormone levels after successfully beating brain cancer. However, during a hospital stay nurses forgot to give him his medication . The keen footballer and runner from Balham, died of dehydration a few hours later. He said Mr Gorny had stuck out his tongue and asked: ‘does this look like a dry mouth?’ before asking the nurses for a drink. He told Westminsters' Coroners Court: 'Kane shouted to the nursing staff ""Can I have some water?"" There was no water by his bedside and I asked him again to explain why he had called police. 'He stated that he kept asking for water but they wouldn't give it to him. He was complaining of a dry mouth.' The officer and his colleague left after doctors reassured him Mr Gorny had a history of erratic behaviour following a brain tumour he had suffered the year before. But the inquest has heard no evidence that Mr Gorny was given any water. The inquest heard earlier that specialist doctors at the hospital who . had been treating Kane for a year and knew of his rare medical needs . were not even told he was in the building until after he died. ‘The guidelines say if patients come . in, you call us - bleep and we are always available’, said Arshia . Panahloo, the consultant endocrinologist in charge of his treatment. ‘The best way is to call us because we know the patients. It would be very difficult not to find us.’ Mr Gorny had just been given the all-clear from a malignant brain tumour when he was admitted to St George’s on May 25, 2009. The inquest heard Mr Gorny’s hip had . been weakened by steroid’s during the tumour treatment, and he needed a . replacement operation. Dr Panahloo was on leave when Mr Gorny . was admitted but none of her colleagues in the endocrinology . department, who knew of his specialist medical needs, were told he was . there. Inquest: Rita Cronin, left, and Kane's father Peter Gorny arriving at their son's inquest. Rita told the court she had tried to convince the staff at the hospital her son needed urgent attention but they insisted he was alright . ‘I wanted him to have the operation at St George’s so I could be involved in his care’, said Dr Panahloo. ‘I would see him before the operation and daily afterwards. ‘He had a rare tumour and was on a . large amount of hormone replacements. In my opinion, there needed to be . looked after by an endocrinologist afterwards. ‘I expected to hear the date he was coming in.’ The medication would be taken at least once a day to ensure sodium levels stayed normal and his body could retain fluids. Mr Gorny, who worked in Waitrose and was training to be a locksmith and shoe repairer, was denied the medication and sodium . levels rocketed to an abnormally high 164. The normal range is between 135 and 145. Happier times: Mr Gorny, who worked in Waitrose and was training to be a locksmith and shoe repairer, was denied the medication and sodium levels rocketed to an abnormally high 164 . On the morning of his death, on May 28, 2009, he had lost nine litres of body fluid, the inquest was told. Dr Simon Bridle, the consultant in . charge of Mr Gorny’s care, said he was not told of the sodium reading . and would have acted if he had known. The inquest heard Mr Gorny's hip had been weakened by steroid¿s during the tumour treatment, and he needed a replacement operation . ‘I don’t think I’ve ever had a patient . with a sodium level of 164, I would have been very surprised and known . something was seriously wrong’, he said. ‘Particularly given Kane’s background, . I would have undoubtedly instructed the endocrinology team to be . involved as an emergency.’ A letter had been penned by Dr Bridle . detailing Mr Gorny’s rare condition, but doctors and nurses on the ward . did not see it when sedating him without ensuring he was being given . fluids. Deputy Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe . asked Dr Panahloo if nurses would have been told of the vital need to . maintain fluid levels if her team had been involved. ‘If there was any evidence of . excessive thirst or drinking too much, it is a very early sign that . there may have been a problem’, said Dr Panahloo. ‘It would have been clearly documented . on the notes and I would expect the nurses to read that and be aware . that the fluid balance was important. ‘I would expect them to call us.’ A nurse later admitted knowing little . about Mr Gorny’s rare medical condition when she left it off notes for . medical staff at the hospital where he died. Erlinda Edwards recommended Mr Gorny . for admission to hospital a day early so that doctors could be fully . prepared for his hip operation. But Ms Edwards, a sister at St George’s Hospital admitted that she ‘was not knowledgeable’ about his condition. She said she decided not to write . about the disease - diabetes insipidus - on forms for nurses because she . assumed they already knew about it. ‘I didn’t normally instruct nurses on the ward what to do, what to observe’, she said. ‘I can’t write everything, instructing nurses on the ward whether they should do this and do that. ‘I would expect nurses would know about the diabetes insipidus and know what to observe.’ Ms Edwards said a letter penned by Mr . Gorny’s consultant Dr Simon Bridle had already outlined the special . circumstances and the need to liaise with the hospital’s endocrinology . department, which had been giving Mr Gorny care since his treatment for a . brain tumour. Help: Police raced to St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London (pictured) but were turned away by staff . But Deputy Coroner Dr Shirley . Radcliffe criticised Dr Bridle’s letter for being vague and not spelling . out exactly how Mr Gorny needed to be treated. Dr Radcliffe pointed to places on Ms Edwards’ assessment form where the condition could have been documented. ‘It could have been, in my view, . exactly the sort of form that could have conveyed information of the . management of thirst and output of urine’, she said. A letter had been penned by Dr Bridle detailing Mr Gorny's rare condition, but doctors and nurses on the ward did not see it . But Ms Edwards said: ‘Because he was . already being treated and had brain surgery, and also he was a young . 22-year-old, there’s nothing that would alert me. ‘Although he had a medical problem, I didn’t think of writing all of that.’ Dr Radcliffe asked: ‘Did you have a . clear understanding of the disease when you saw him and the implications . for post operation management’. She replied: ‘At the time, I must admit, no’. Nurses who treated Mr Gorny are due . to give testify this week that they did not give him medication to help . his fluid retention because they did not know about the condition. Dr Bridle has told the inquest he . expected his nurses to know about the condition from his letter, but did . not do enough to check to treatment Mr Gorny was given. The inquest heard Mr Gorny became agitated the day before he died, pulling down the curtain next to his bed on the ward and lashing out at nurses. Professor Sebastian Lucas, who performed the post mortem on Mr Gorny, said as sodium levels rise in the body, irritability and aggression is a symptom that normally comes before seizures, the patient slipping into a coma, and ultimately dying. But nurses on the ward sedated him without ensuring he was given intravenous fluids, and still did not give him the vital medication. Last week his mother Rita Cronin, a . civil servant told Westminster Coroner's Court that staff tutted at her . and repeatedly refused to listen to her concerns that her son hadn't . been given vital medication. At one point he became so desperate . and upset that staff sedated and restrained him – and on the night . before his death, his mother said, he was not checked on by medical . staff, despite being in a room on his own. Following his death, a nurse . allegedly inquired whether the family, from Balham, South-West London, . was 'finished' and asked a matron in front of them whether she could . 'bag him up'. The inquest continues.","Kane Gorny, 22, lost more than a third of his body fluid while recovering from a hip operation at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, southwest London .

He said: 'The mayor said that there was a call to him personally, and that the Liberian president had mentioned apologies, and, in his words, a little bit of responsibility that this was even happening.' Another participant said that Rawlings had declined the apology, saying that it was a problem for the global community.

"Teachers are wasting valuable lesson time dealing with pupils playing with their mobile phones, a report has found. Children swinging on chairs, making silly comments to get attention and passing notes were other problems staff said they face.

He said the chances of pupils enjoying a well-ordered learning environment had become ‘something of a lottery’ – and that many teachers have come to believe bad behaviour is an inevitable part of life in the classroom.

"A controversial British scientist claims to have found 'proof' that aliens exist - after cracking open a lump of rock which he believes fell to earth in a meteorite shower. Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, formerly of Cardiff University, claims the two-inch wide lump of space rock is pitted with microscopic seaweed fossils similar to those found on Earth. 'These finds are crushing evidence that human life started from outside our Earth,' said the professor, who is notorious for his theories that life on this planet was 'seeded' from outer space. Claims: Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe with the fragment of space rock . Teeming with traces of life? A controversial scientist claims this two-inch meteor fragment is packed with the fossils of extraterrestrial life similar to algae found in Earth's oceans . 'We got it from the medical research institute in Sri Lanka,' Professor Wickramasinghe told MailOnline. 'They got hold of it on the 29th December, when a fireball was seen in the area. 'Thousands . of people spotted it, and minutes after there was a meteorite fall over . a rice field. 'Farmers who rushed to pick up these stones had . their hands burnt, and women fainted, so local medical staff and police . were summoned to cordon off the area to collect the stones. 'One of these was . sent to us by colleagues.' 'We . are all aliens - we share a cosmic ancestry,' he said. 'Each time a . new planetary system forms a few surviving microbes find their way into . comets. 'These then multiply and seed other planets. 'These latest finds are just more evidence to point to the overwhelming fact that life on Earth began on other worlds.' 'Our provisional assessment is that it was part of a comet', he told MailOnline. 'The stones look extremely unusual, and have a porous structure, with a lower density than anything we have on Earth.' Professor Wickramasinghe's claims are outlined in a . freely accessible paper on the website of the Journal of Cosmology. It says  'a few percent carbon as revealed by analysis confirms the status of a carbonaceous meteorite.' However, today he admitted key tests to prove it is an uncontaminated meteorite have not yet been carried out. 'This . was a rapid publication - we wanted to provoke interest, and we will be . publishing in a peer reviewed journal, but we are not sure which yet one. 'It is the facts that will prove this - and we hope to have conclusive proof within weeks.' However, a string of experts have already lined up to dismiss his claims as 'laughable' and argue that the apparent extra-terrestrial fossils are clearly present as the result of contamination here on Earth. Another points out that it has yet to be proven that the rock is actually from space at all. 'Describing it as laughable is a natural reaction, that is the traditional view, and until all of these tests are completed, these criticisms are out there,' he said. The research alleges that 'microscopic fossilized diatoms (a basic form of algae) were found in the . sample', which fell in Sri Lanka in December last year. The . finding, it suggests, is a 'strong evidence to support the theory of . cometary panspermia' - the idea that life across planets is spread on . rocks hurtling through space. The still-smoking meteorite fragments were picked up by villagers in central Sri Lanka after they crashed to Earth in a spectacular fireball, it is claimed. They were analysed in a British laboratory where fossils of algae were apparently found. It is claimed the finds are similar to micro-organisms found in fossil remains from the dinosaur age 55million years ago. Smoking gun? This scanning electron microscope image purports to show the tell-tale sign of a microscopic fossil . 'Crushing evidence': It is claimed the fossilised micro-organisms found in the fragment are similar to those found in fossil remains from the dinosaur age 55million years ago . From far, far away: The two-inch wide piece of meteorite was found near a village a few miles from the city of Polonnaruwa in Sri Lanka . A mathematician by training, . Professor Wickramasinghe believes that life on Earth was seeded by . comets and asteroids 3.8billion years ago. Chandra Wickramasinghe is notorious as the only scientist to argue against evolution during the 1981 Arkansas legal case against the teaching of creationism in schools. The 74-year-old Sri Lankan-born British mathematician obtained a PhD from Cambridge under the supervision of the late Sir Fred Hoyle. The pair went on to collaborate on a body of work some credit with providing the basis of the field of astrobiology. Their joint work on the infrared spectra of interstellar grains led to developing the hypothesis of panspermia, which proposes that cosmic dust in space and comets is partly organic - and may have 'seeded' life on Earth. They further contended that extraterrestrial life forms continue to enter the Earth's atmosphere, and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and the genetic novelty necessary for macroevolution. In 2003 he was joint signatory on a letter sent to The Lancet which suggested that the virus which causes SARS may not come from chickens, but could in fact be from outer space.

He also believes that pathogens like the SARS virus arrived here from deep space. He was head of Cardiff University's . Centre for Astrobiology until two years ago when funding for the . department was withdrawn and he was dismissed from his post. The . controversial professor, the only scientist to testify against . evolution in the famous 1981 creationist trial in Arkansas, has since . carried on the project as a private company and charity. He . said: 'The algae organisms are similar to ones found in Earth fossils . but the rock also has other organisms we have not identified.' Astronomer and lecturer Phil Plait wrote in his blog on Slate that the chemical analysis presented in Wickramasinghe's study 'doesn’t prove it’s a carbonaceous chondrite, let alone a meteorite,' and there is 'no reason to trust that what they have is a meteorite.' Plait also cited a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Patrick Kociolek as saying that there was no sign that the diatoms illustrated in the study were 'fossilized material', and that most of them were species that represented 'a clear case of contamination with freshwater'. Monica Grady, professor of Planetary Sciences at the Open University’s Faculty of Science, told MailOnline she finds the whole thing ‘laughable’. ‘There are serious inconsistencies with the data presented in the paper,' she said. ‘The most important is that the rock they have found is yet to be proven to be a meteorite. ‘Until that is done, no credence can be placed on the findings presented, especially when they are published in a non-mainstream journal.' Controversial: Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, left, says the still-smoking rocks were found after they fell in Sri Lanka, right, after a dramatic meteor shower . Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe is a leading proponent of panspermia, the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe and is spread by meteoroids, asteroids and planetoids. Panspermia proposes that life forms that can survive the effects of space, such as extremophiles, become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life. These life-forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks. If met with ideal conditions on a new planet's surfaces, the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins, it is believed. Professor . Wickramasinghe, 74, claims microbes from outer space arrived on our . planet from comets which then 'multiplied and seeded' to form our life. The two-inch wide piece of meteorite was found near a village a few miles from the city of Polonnaruwa in Sri Lanka. The fragments were said to be still smoking when they were found by woman villagers. They were sent to Cardiff University's School of Earth Sciences where they were examined under a scanning electron microscope. Professor . Wickramasinghe, who is originally from Sri Lanka, and his late . colleague Sir Fred Hoyle championed the 'life from outer space' theory . from the 1960s. He said: .

"Adverts for a 'miracle' spot cream, starring celebrities including Katy Perry and Justin Bieber, have been banned in the UK for being misleading. British watchdogs have banned the Proactiv commercials in Britain since the UK version of the product - which boasts celebrities including Elle Macpherson and Avril Lavigne among its celebrity endorsers - does not contain the same active ingredient used in the American brand. Banned: The TV advert for Proactiv spot cream starring Katy Perry has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority after it was branded misleading . The Proactiv ads, shown on a teleshopping channel, showed Perry endorsing Proactiv and telling viewers it had helped clear up her problem skin. A further series of ads on the Proactiv website showed other stars, including Justin Bieber, giving their support for the product. But a woman contacted the Advertising Standards Authority to complain that the promotional adverts were misleading. She said the celebrities . concerned were likely to have used Proactiv's American brand, which contains an active ingredient not present in the UK . version. Guthy-Renker .

"When foreign dignitaries spend private time with the Queen, protocol dictates they remain silent about their stay. Unfortunately that was not the case when New Zealand premier John Key and his family spent a weekend at Balmoral. No sooner had they left the Scottish retreat, than a picture was  released of Mr Key posing with a casual-looking Queen in her sitting room. The Duke, Prince William and Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine with their son, Prince George in the garden of the Middleton family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, England . Artworks: Hungarian artist Charles Brocky was commissioned to carry out these portraits of the young Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1841. The artist had arrived in London in 1838 and his chalk portraits were widely admired . He then risked further Royal  displeasure by lifting the lid on his time in the Scottish Highlands. Once, . such indiscretions might have caused a diplomatic row, but Buckingham . Palace was relaxed yesterday about Mr Key’s revelations. After all, the keen royalist did call Prince George ‘a very bonny baby’. The picture he released gives a fascinating insight into the personal tastes of the Royal Family. As . well as family photos, the Queen’s modest room includes a cheap . electric heater, a large collection of china dogs, dog beds and, in case . you had any remaining doubts about her interests, a stuffed corgi toy . similar to the ones found at the royal gift shops. Beloved pets: A corgi stuffed toy (left) and corgi dog baskets (right) show just how heavily the beloved breed features in the Queen's life at Balmoral . Balmoral Castle, located in Ballater, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, has been . one of the residences of the British Royal Family since 1852 . The room – complete with clashing carpet, rug and cushions – also  features a pot of silk flowers. Quick to reveal all about his visit, Mr Key said: ‘They were extremely generous hosts and we had a  fantastic weekend. ‘We were invited in as guests in their private family time.’ Prince . Philip rolled up his sleeves for a barbecue on Friday night, he said, . and the Queen gave him and his wife a tour in her Land Rover. ‘They . all pitched in. We helped lay the table. It must be the only bit of . informality they really have in their lives – it’s definitely an . informal gathering,’ he said. His son Max went grouse shooting with Prince William, while his daughter Stephanie hiked with the Duchess of Cambridge. Even the notoriously snappy royal pets behaved well. ‘The corgis were everywhere. They were very friendly,’ Mr Key said.","Photo of visit from New Zealand Prime Minister John key shows portrait of Queen's great-grandson .

"The grieving husband of Doctor Who actress Mary Tamm died while writing thank-you messages to well-wishers hours after  delivering a eulogy at her funeral. Marcus Ringrose, 60, collapsed while he was sitting at his computer at the home he had shared with  his wife. Miss Tamm, 62, was best known for playing Doctor Who’s companion Romana alongside Tom Baker in the 1978 series. She died last month after an 18-month battle with cancer. Tragic: Mary Tamm's husband Marcus Ringrose, pictured together in 1994, has also died . Last night the actress’s daughter Lauren Burlingham, 32, spoke of her devastation at losing her father so soon after her mother. ‘My father was an exceptional man in . his own right,’ she said. ‘He was a rare individual who brought a lot of . joy, humour and sound advice into people’s lives. ‘He was devoted to caring for my mother and he loved spending time with his grandson.’ Speaking from her parents’ home in . Battersea, south-west London, Mrs Burlingham added: ‘He was a . well-respected and influential man in the City where he worked as a . chief loss adjuster.’ Miss Tamm’s agent, Barry Langford, . said: ‘If you can die of a broken heart, then he did. Marcus looked . after her through her illness. He was desperately worried about her and . was devastated by her death.’ Yesterday the coroner told Mrs . Burlingham the exact cause of her father’s death on Tuesday could not be . established, but said there was nothing suspicious to it. The couple had been married for 34 . years and leave behind a seven-year-old grandson, Max, as well as their . daughter. They met when Mr Ringrose visited the BBC, saw Miss Tamm and . told a friend: ‘I’m going to marry that girl.’ He engineered a meeting by taking a hairbrush from her handbag and then, having obtained her number, rang her to say he had it. Strong star: Tamm recently starred in Wire In The Blood, Jonathan Creek and Paradise Heights . Mr Langford said Miss Tamm called him a ‘cheeky bugger’ but agreed to meet him. In a tribute to his wife – whose . parents came from Estonia – after her death on July 26, Mr Ringrose . said: ‘Mary was truly beautiful in every way. She was a very spiritual . lady who loved nature and adored all animals. Leading lady: Mary was the first incarnation of the Doctor's companion Romana . 'On set and off stage, her . earthy northern humour and self-deprecating wit brightened every . occasion. She was a consummate actress, and immensely popular in the . profession. ‘Mary was born in Bradford, the . daughter of impoverished refugees, and through sheer talent and hard . graft got herself to Rada, starred opposite Jon Voight in The Odessa . File, and found a form of immortality as the Time Lady Romana opposite . Tom Baker in Doctor Who. We will miss her every day.’ Although she left Doctor Who after one . season, Miss Tamm had recently reprised the part of Romana in a series . of audio episodes recorded with Baker. On television she was also in Brookside, EastEnders, Wire In The Blood, Paradise Heights and Jonathan Creek.","Marcus Ringrose apparently suffered a heart attack at their South London home on Tuesday .

"Related: Reunited siblings Barrie Prowse, 27, and Gemma Sanders, 23, both play for Penzance AFC . A footballer searching for his long-lost family found he had a sister playing for the same team. Barrie Prowse, 27, was adopted as a baby and wanted to trace his biological parents, managing to track down his mother and discovering he had a sister - Gemma Sanders, 23. But it turned out that they were players for the same football club. Father-of-two Barrie, 27, plays centre midfield for the men's team at Penzance AFC in Cornwall - while Miss Sanders plays for the women's XI. They played at the same ground, trained on the same pitch and regularly enjoyed a post-game pint at the same clubhouse - while unaware they were brother and sister. Mr Prowse, of Penzance, Cornwall, who is married, said he had often watched his sister, who is deaf, play matches for the South West Peninsula League Premier Division side. He said: ‘I would sometimes take my two girls down to the pitches to watch the woman's matches that Gemma was playing in. ‘Funnily enough, a friend of mine had once told me to watch out for a deaf girl playing in the team because she was such a fantastic player. I hate to say it but Gemma is a better footballer than me. ‘I was gutted because I've always been the best sportsman in my family.’ Support worker Miss Sanders lives 15 miles away from Mr Prowse in Redruth, Cornwall, and also plays for the Great Britain deaf women's football team. Siblings reunited: Miss Sanders and Mr Prowse played at the same ground, trained on the same pitch and regularly enjoyed a post-game pint at the same clubhouse - while unaware they were brother and sister . Keepy-uppies: Support worker Miss Sanders lives 15 miles away from Mr Prowse in Redruth, Cornwall . She said: ‘I got a Facebook message from Barrie saying he was my big brother and I was in shock, I just couldn't believe it. Coincidence: Mr Prowse, who is married, said he had often watched his sister - who is deaf - play matches for the football team . ‘I would play for the women's team on a Sunday and he would play for the men's team on a Saturday. After the game we would go to the bar at the ground and have a few drinks. ‘Obviously I didn't know about Barrie but now I know we would have been in the same bar and I always wonder if we have spoken before. We could have walked past each other. ‘I may have seen his two daughters and not known that I was their aunt. It is just such a weird story, we didn't even know each other but we might have said hello. ‘Thinking back, it is mad to think what could have happened, he could have held a door for me or anything. I am just really pleased that he found me.’ Mr Prowse used Facebook and the Genes Reunited website to track down mother Caroline Perry, 45, who had given him up aged 18. Following the reunion Mr Prowse was told he had four brothers from her side, sister Miss Sanders and a brother through his father, Anton Whitehead, who died in 1995. Mr Prowse said: ‘I kept typing Gemma's name into Google and it was coming up saying “Penzance football”. I couldn't figure out why it kept coming up. I was thinking: “Surely not, this can't be right”. ‘But then my wife Natalie sent me a link to Gemma's Facebook and we spoke on there and realised we were related - it was surreal.’ Mr Prowse, an IT recruiter, has now met with all his living biological relatives with the full blessing of adoptive parents, Keith Prowse, 66, and wife Elizabeth, 59. He has also introduced them to his own family - dance teacher wife Natalie, 28, and their two girls, Taylor-Grace, four, and one-year-old Kenza-Rae.","Barrie Prowse, 27, of Penzance, Cornwall, tried to trace biological parents .

"The world's first algae-powered building is being piloted in Hamburg. The building, which was designed by multinational firm Arup, features panel glass bioreactors on the facade which contain microalgae. These algae generate biomass and heat as a renewable energy source. The building, which was designed by Arup, features panel glass bioreactors on the facade which contain microalgae . The building features panel glass bioreactors on the facade. Each of the 129 bioreactors measures 2.5m by 0.7m. They contain algae that generate biomass and heat as a renewable energy source. They also insulate the building and keep out noise. The panels are controlled by an energy management centre in which solar thermal heat and algae are harvested and stored to be used to create hot water. At the same time, the systems provides insulation for the building and keeps out noise. Currently, 129 bioreactors - each measuring 2.5m by 0.7m - have been fitted to the southwest and southeast faces of the building. They are controlled by an energy management centre in which solar thermal heat and algae are harvested and stored to be used to create hot water. Jan Wurm, Arup’s Europe Research Leader, said: 'Using bio-chemical processes in the facade of a building to create shade and energy is a really innovative concept. 'It might well become a sustainable solution for energy production in urban areas, so it is great to see it being tested in a real-life scenario.' The news comes after Arup announced their vision for the future of skyscrapers which suggested that buildings would be 'living' buildings powered by algae that respond automatically to the weather and the changing needs of inhabitants. Research by engineering multinational Arup, the firm behind the Pompidou Centre, the Sydney Opera House and many of the stadia for the 2008 Olympics, imagined how urban buildings could look by 2050. These algae generate biomass and heat as a renewable energy source . Their predictions included ideas as outlandish as jet-powered maintenance robots, high-rise farms and photovoltaic paint - all of which, incredibly, are already in development. 'In 2050, the urban dweller and the . city are in a state of constant flux - changing and evolving in reaction . to emerging contexts and conditions,' the report said. 'The . urban building of the future fosters this innate quality, essentially . functioning as a living organism in its own right - reacting to the . local environment and engaging with the users within.' Skyscraper of the future: A new report . claims that by 2050 buildings will have modular designs maintained by . jet-powered drones, a digital 'nervous system' and be entirely fuel . efficient thanks to algae fuel cells . The study by Arup’s internal think tank predicted that structures would be fully integrated into the fabric of the city, responsive to changes in the external environment, and designed for continuous adaptability. Responding to estimates that in four decades 75 per cent of an estimated global population of nine billion will be living in cities, it foresaw a shift to increasingly dense urban environments. At the same time, it predicted, the rise of networked 'smart' devices could lead cities 'where everything can be manipulated in realtime and where all the components of the urban fabric are part of a single smart system and an internet of things'. The British company that built the Shard has landed a contract to build what will become the world's tallest building - and plans reveal the two look remarkably similar. London-based Mace won the £780million deal to build the Kingdom Tower, pictured right in an artist's impression, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which will stand more than 3,280ft (1km) high. The Shard is currently western Europe's tallest building at 1,003ft (306m) high. Mace will participate in a joint venture with fellow British firm EC Harris to create the huge building, which has been given a completion date of 2018. The Kingdom Tower, which will have a construction area of more than 5,381,955 square feet, will stand at four times the size of the Shard. It will overlook the Red Sea and is expected to take over from the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which stands at 2,717ft (828m), as the world's tallest skyscraper. It is not yet known how tall the skyscraper will be as developers keep exact details of the plan a secret. The most incredible prediction in the Arup report was that the buildings of the future would benefit from brain-like 'intelligent building systems' that enable them to automatically adjust to the needs of inhabitants. Using data about energy consumption, weather, and the whims of residents, they would be able to make 'calculated decisions' about how to best use resources. This could extend as far as using jet-powered maintenance arms to swap the 'modules' that form the building blocks of the skyscraper. Such modular components could be used for residential or commercial units, or even urban food production sites housing animal, fish or vegetable farms, depending on what is needed at the time. 'In this emerging age, with significant developments in construction, prefabricated and modular systems are moved and assembled by robots that work seamlessly together to install, detect, repair and upgrade components of the building system,' the report said. With human population set to mushroom, . the predictions took into account likely increased concern about the . pressure so many souls would put on our planet's already-strained . natural resources. The Arup . report promised buildings that would one day in fact produce more . resources than they consume thanks to external walls coated with . photovoltaic paint, wind turbines and even pods growing bio-fuel . producing algae. Green . spaces would be dispersed throughout the building to encourage urban . biodiversity, while water systems would be optimised for recycling and . reuse and filters would cut down on environmental pollutants, it said. The building's facades, as well as . having the potential to generate power from the sun, could also be . coated with nano-particle treatments that neutralise airborne pollutants . and capture waste carbon dioxide. Elements . such as vast organic LEDs could even allow for whole surfaces of the . structure to light up at night, creating a new form of street lighting. 'Coupled . with daylight absorbing abilities, the technology realises the . possibility of 'net zero energy' artificial lighting,' the report said. The Arup report, entitled It's Alive, was put together by Josef Hargrave, a consultant in the company's Foresight + Innovation team, an internal think tank which focuses on the future of the built environment. He concluded: 'By producing food and energy, and providing clean air and water, buildings evolve from being passive shells into adaptive and responsive organisms - living and breathing structures supporting the cities of tomorrow.'

"The parents of an 18-month-old boy with an aggressive brain tumour have accused the Federal Government of refusing to fund his much needed treatment because of Budget cuts. Edwin Ho and wife Rochelle Luk will fly their son Edric to the U.S. on Sunday for targeted proton beam therapy costing $200,000 and have been forced to remortgage their home in Brentwood, Perth so that they can afford it. 'I can't help questioning if our Government sacrificed an 18-month-old boy because of Budget cuts,' Ms Luk told the West Australian. Struggle: Edric needed treatment for an aggressive brain tumour and doctors say his best chance of survival is with special treatment in the US . Medical battle: Edric Ho is being flown to the US on Sunday to receive treatment for his aggressive brain tumour . Struggle: Edric has already had a tumour half the size of his brain removed in an operation . A Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital radiation oncologist and Edric's parents claim the therapy is the toddler's best chance of survival, but the government says he should have the more standard treatment that is already available in Australia. The family says pleas for funding from the Federal Health Department's Medical Treatment Overseas Program have been rejected. And that they have been forced to borrow from friends and family to get their son treated at the University of Florida. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health told MailOnline that the decision not to fund the overseas treatment came from a 'preliminary assessment which at this stage denies the treatment'. 'One of the main criteria for treatment overseas is that it can't be performed in Australia. Patients with the same condition are currently being treated in Australia,' she said. 'If doctors or the family can come back with further information before a final decision is made then it will be considered.' Battle: Edric's parents have been forced to borrow from friends and family to get their son treated at the University of Florida . However, the family claim the conformal photon radiotherapy treatment being offered to them in Australia has 'horrible side effects'. Little Edric, who has already had a tumour half the size of his brain removed in an operation, has also been recommended for the special treatment abroad by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists. He is suffering from an anaplastic ependymoma - a tumour that forms when cells in the central nervous system (in his case the brain) begin to multiple rapidly. 'It was devastating': Edric's mother Rochelle said finding out her son was sick was 'every parent's worst nightmare' Appeal: The hospitals who have been treating Edric in Australia have disagreed with the Federal Government's decision . Undecided: A Health Department spokeswoman said a final decision had not been made about funding the toddler's treatment . The experts said the best treatment for Edric was unavailable in Australia and other treatments delivered much bigger areas of low dose radiation to brain tissue that could be harmful. Describing the moment they found out Edric was seriously ill, his father Edwin told Seven News: 'He was normal one week and paralysed the next.' At 18-months, he stopped walking and lost the use of his right hand. 'It was devastating. It was the worst nightmare of a parent,' his mother Rochelle said. The hospitals who have been treating Edric in Australia so far - the Sir Charles Gairdner and Princess Margaret hospitals - said they would appeal against the decision not to fund his overseas treatment.

The tough talk comes as Snowden's employers, Booz Allen Hamilton, announced on Tuesday that it has terminated his contract 'for violations of the firm’s code of ethics and firm policy'. Leak: Edward Snowden, who worked as a contract employee at the National Security Agency, has fled to Hong Kong after leaking government surveillance secrets. The U.S. is preparing to charge him . Russia today hinted that Vladimir Putin would grant political asylum to Edward Snowden. 'We will take action based on what actually happens. If we receive such a request, it will be considered,' said the Russian president's official spokesman Dmitry Peskov. One Russian report stressed that the country has a consulate in Hong Kong where Snowden could make an asylum request. Russian MP Robert Schlegel urged the Kremlin to look at a the possibility of granting political asylum to Snowden. 'It would be a good idea,' he said. It's unknown where Snowden will actually go, but Snowden had mentioned Iceland, a tiny island nation of 360,000, as a possibility. It said that the claims he had leaked information were 'shocking' - and revealed that he was earning $122,000 rather than the $200,000 he told The Guardian he was paid. As for his future prospects - although Hong Kong has an extradition . treaty with the U.S., the document has some exceptions, including for . crimes deemed political. Any negotiations about his possible handover will involve Beijing, but some believe China is unlikely to want to jeopardize its relationship with the U.S. over someone of little political interest to them. Snowden also told The Guardian that he may seek asylum in Iceland, which has strong free-speech protections and a tradition of providing a haven for the outspoken and the outcast. The Justice Department is . investigating whether his disclosures were a criminal offense - a matter . that's not always clear-cut under U.S. federal law. A senior intelligence official . said Snowden would have had to have signed a non-disclosure agreement . to gain access to the top secret data. That suggests he could be prosecuted for violating that agreement. Penalties could range from a few years to life in prison. Hiding place: Snowden is in Hong Kong, pictured, but his exact whereabouts are unknown . Edward Snowden has fled to Hong Kong, which is a gamble, but the country's free speech laws mean he does have a slim chance of avoiding being swept back to America if the government demand he returns. Hong Kong signed an extradition treaty with the United States in 1997, just before Britain handed it back to China. In it both agreed to send fugitives back and forth in the majority of cases, but there were also political exemptions negotiated at the time. Hong Kong has the 'right of refusal when surrender implicates the ""defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy'' of the People's Republic of China'. China itself has no extradition treaty with America at all. Hong Kong officials also have the right to say no to extradition if they believe that the attempt is 'politically motivated'. This means that they will protect free speech if a person is being arrested just for their political opinions. The United States may have already approached Interpol or its consulate in Hong Kong to start proceedings. They will use the Espionage Act to gain warrants for his arrest. Hong Kong's authorities can hold Snowden for 60 days, following a U.S. request that includes probable cause, while Washington prepares a formal extradition request. 'I think it is really tragic that an American has to move to a place that has a reputation for less freedom,' he told The Guardian. Snowden's exact whereabouts were unknown on Monday. If Snowden is forced to return to the . United States to face charges, whistle-blower advocates said Monday that . they would raise money for his legal defense. 'All of the options, as he put it, . are bad options,' Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who first . reported the program and interviewed Snowden extensively, told The . Associated Press. He said Snowden decided to release . details of the programs out of shock and anger over the sheer scope of . the government's privacy invasions. 'It was his choice to publicly unveil himself,' Greenwald said. 'He recognized that even if he hadn't . publicly unveiled himself, it was only a matter of time before the U.S. government discovered that it was he who had been responsible for these . disclosures, and he made peace with that... He's very steadfast and . resolute about the fact that he did the right thing.' Greenwald told the AP that he had more documents from Snowden and expected 'more significant revelations' about NSA. As questions surround his future, global and U.S. outrage at the programs continues. In . Washington, members of Congress said they would take a new look at . potential ways to keep the U.S. safe from terror attacks without giving . up privacy protections that critics charge are at risk with the . government's current authority to broadly sweep up personal . communications. 'There's . very little trust in the government, and that's for good reason,' said . Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, who sits on the House Intelligence . Committee. 'We're our own worst enemy.' A . senior U.S. intelligence official on Monday said there were no plans to . scrap the programs that, despite the backlash, continue to receive . widespread if cautious support within Congress. The programs were revealed last week by The Guardian and The Washington Post newspapers. 'No options': Glenn Greenwald, a reporter for The Guardian, said Snowden has no great options . National Intelligence Director James . Clapper has taken the unusual step of declassifying some of the . previously top-secret details to help the administration mount a public . defense of the surveillance as a necessary step to protect Americans. One of the NSA programs gathers hundreds of millions of U.S. phone records to search for possible links to known terrorist targets abroad. The other allows the government to tap into nine U.S. Internet companies and gather all communications to detect suspicious behavior that begins overseas. Snowden is a former CIA employee who later worked as a contractor for the NSA on behalf of Booz Allen, where he gained access to the surveillance. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine said, it was 'absolutely shocking' that a 29-year-old with limited experience and no formal qualifications would have access to this material. FBI agents on Monday visited the home of Snowden's father, Lonnie Snowden, in Upper Macungie Township, Pennsylvania. The FBI in Philadelphia declined to comment. See below for video .

"The Football Association turned down the chance to interview Pep Guardiola for the England manager’s job last year, appointing Roy Hodgson instead having made a policy decision to hire an English manager. The revelation will stun many fans because Guardiola, 42, is viewed as one of the world’s best coaches, having overseen serial successes at Barcelona, including two Champions League wins, three La Liga titles and multiple cups. But an FA insider insists former chairman David Bernstein was right to ‘go English’, not least because it would send the right message concerning home talent. You could have had me: The FA turned down the chance to interview Pep Guardiola for the England job . Successful: The FA picked Roy Hodgson after deciding to appoint an English manager . Sources say Guardiola was interested in talking to the FA when Fabio Capello resigned in February last year and an intermediary contacted the governing body to let them know. He had decided to leave Barcelona at the end of the 2011-12 season but was not 100 per cent  certain he would take a sabbatical. It is understood a message was sent to Guardiola by the FA that the new man would need to be in place for Euro 2012, but the FA did not follow up further with him. The insider says the FA were contacted by representatives of multiple ‘top managers’ but only English candidates were considered seriously. Glittering: Guardiola won three La Ligas and two Champions Leagues at Barcelona . Change: Guardiola is now in charge of Bayern Munich and he began his reign by beating Chelsea in the Super Cup . Guardiola announced on April 27 last year that he would take the 2012-13 season off but he has subsequently returned to management this season with Bayern Munich. The FA appointed Hodgson, 66, as manager on May 1 last year. An FA spokesman said on Saturday: ‘This was a confidential process. We made it clear from the outset the preference was for an English manager and appointed the best man for the job, based on the outline set out by David Bernstein at the time.’","Guardiola expressed interest in managing England after leaving Barcelona .

"Ukraine's new leader is today to order a unilateral ceasefire in the separatist east as part of a broader plan to end the 10-week insurgency. His peace plan depends on a rapid response from pro-Moscow separatists and Russia, too, amid reports that the Kremlin is again swelling troop numbers close to its frontier. His ceasefire move comes hours after a telephone call with Vladimir Putin. Scroll down for video . Locals were recently forced to evacuate areas in Lugansk following a shelling by Ukranian government forces . 'The peace plan begins with my order for a unilateral ceasefire,' said Petro Poroshenko. 'Immediately after that, we must receive support for the presidential peace plan from all sides involved. This should happen very shortly.' Russia has long called for Kiev to halt its 'anti terrorism operation' claiming that it means military action against Ukraine's own citizens. Poroshenko will insist that as part of the ceasefire, the rebels - who want Donetsk and Lugansk regions to join Russia - must disarm. Previous attempts to secure such a result have failed. The two leaders discussed a long-term solution to the pro-Kremlin uprising gripping Ukraine's eastern industrial belt since early April. The Ukrainian leader's office said the two presidents 'discussed a series of priority measures that must be undertaken to implement a ceasefire, as well as the most efficient ways to monitor it.'

'There are about 900 people, and they are armed with heavy armoured vehicles.' His serious claim is the latest on pro-Russian separatists getting access to reinforcements and arms across a porous frontier controlled in key locations by rebels.

"Powerful CCTV cameras which can recognise and track faces from more than half a mile away could breach human rights laws, a top Government adviser has warned. The UK's first surveillance commissioner, Andrew Rennison, has issued a stark warning to the Government by saying that advances in CCTV technology risk turning Britain into a Big Brother society. He warned of a 'public backlash' unless . proper steps were taken to regulate the proliferation of 16-megapixel HD . cameras with the potential to pick out a face and then match it against . a database of images of wanted people. Watched: The new CCTV cameras could breach human right's laws due to their advanced technology . Futuristic: This graphic shows how the advanced CCTV technology works . Mr Rennison said the cameras are being rolled out up and down UK cities without members of the public being consulted. ‘The technology has overtaken our ability to regulate it,’ he told the Independent. ‘I'm convinced that if we don't regulate it properly - ie the technological ability to use millions of images we capture - there will be a huge public backlash. ‘It is the Big Brother scenario playing out large. It's the ability to pick out your face in a crowd from a camera which is probably half a mile away.’ Research being carried out into automatic . facial recognition technology by the Home Office has achieved a 90 per . cent success rate and is still improving, Mr Rennison said. Big brother: Mr Rennison warns that the high definition cameras' ability to perform facial recognition is an intrusion into the public's privacy. This is a file picture of a Metropolitan Police operations room . He is expected to report back to Parliament with any concerns over how CCTV and automatic number plate recognition systems are being used. His concerns were today echoed by civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch. However, the organisation claimed Mr Rennison needed to be given more power from the Government to clampdown on CCTV. Nick Pickles, director of privacy and civil liberties at the campaign group said: 'The Commissioner is absolutely right to warn . about the risks of new CCTV technology. 'However, the Home Office has . undermined the Commissioner from the start by giving him absolutely no . powers to do anything. 'Proper regulation of CCTV needs someone to have the power to inspect . cameras and punish those breaking the law. If the Home Office is serious . about this issue then the surveillance camera commissioner needs proper . powers to protect our privacy.' Support: Civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch also echoed Mr Rennison's concerns.  But the organisation claimed he needed to be given more power from the Government to clampdown on CCTV . Concerns: Research being carried out into automatic facial recognition technology by the Home Office has achieved a 90 per cent success rate and is still improving, Mr Rennison said . Mr Rennison called on lawyers to help . ensure surveillance techniques remained in line with Article 8 of the . Human Rights Act, which protects private and family life. He told the Independent: ‘I don't want the state to carry on and start pushing the boundaries. Let's have a debate - if the public support it, then fine. ‘ . 'If the public don't support it, and we need to increase the regulation, then that's what we need to do.' A Home Office spokesperson said: 'Used properly, CCTV can be a valuable tool in the fight against crime. But for too long the system has grown and developed in the absence of any proper framework or oversight. 'That is why we’ve appointed Andrew Rennison as the Surveillance Camera Commissioner to drive the adoption of a new code of practice. He will empower the public to shine a light on those who operate camera systems in public places, challenging them to show the use of these systems is justified, proportionate and effective.'","Surveillance commissioner says advances in CCTV technology are turning Britain into Big Brother society .

"A small fragment of ancient pottery found in modern Israel has shed light on its Biblical inhabitants and could prove that the reigns of King Solomon and King David actually occurred. The 10th century BC 'Ophel Inscription' was unearthed last year, and scientists were initially baffled by the bizarre language that was inscribed on the remains of a jug. But leading expert Dr Douglas Petrovich believe the language is a primitive form of Hebrew which suggests the ancient Israelites were accurately recording history much earlier than previously thought. Scroll down for video . The 3000-year-old Ophel Inscription was unearthed last year and scientists were initially baffled by the bizarre language that was inscribed on the remains of what was once a jug . When the inscription was originally discovered in December 2012, experts immediately presumed it was an example of Canaanite language. The Canaanites were a Biblical people who lived in what is now modern Israel. But ancient Near Eastern history and biblical studies expert Dr Petrovich has said that this is incorrect and that the mysterious language is in fact the original and oldest form of Hebrew – placing the ancient Israelites in Jerusalem far earlier that previously thought. The inscription was found in Ophel, near near Temple Mount in Jerusalem (pictured) in December last year . The inscription was found among a pile of pottery (pictured). Leading expert Douglas Petrovich believes the language is a primitive form of Hebrew which suggests the ancient Israelites were recording history much earlier than previously thought . ‘Hebrew speakers were controlling . Jerusalem in the 10th century [BC], which biblical chronology points to as . the time of David and Solomon,' he told FoxNews.com. ‘Whoever they were, they were writing in Hebrew like they owned the place,’ he added. If . the Dr Petrovich’s claim is correct, it could provide evidence of the . accuracy of the Old Testament, and that the ancient Israelites were . writing their history as things happened as opposed to writing it . down hundreds of years later. If expert Douglas Petrovich is correct, it could mean the Bible stories of King David and King Solomon were not just passed down orally and recorded hundreds of years later but written down at the time and are true . This would make the Old Testament an historical account of real-life events. As expected, Dr Petrovich’s claims are stirring up controversy among the archaeological community. Tel Aviv University archaeologist Israel Finkelstein told FoxNews.com that the Ophel Inscription is critical to the early history of Israel but that romantic notions of the Bible shouldn't cloud scientific methods. In 2008, when a similar inscription was found at a site many now believe is one of King David's palaces, he warned against the 'revival in the belief that what's written in the Bible is accurate like a newspaper.'","Archaeologists discovered small piece of pottery with writing on it last year .

"The Duchess of Cornwall made history today when she became the first female chancellor of Aberdeen University - and the only Royal to ever hold the post. Camilla, known as the Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland, was honoured by the university with a formal ceremony as she officially accepted the position which dates back to 1860. The Duchess said she was 'touched' and . 'honoured' by the appointment, and joked about being made chancellor of . one of Britain's great universities, having left school at the age of . 16. Applause: The Duchess of Cornwall, pictured centre after being made Chancellor of Aberdeen University, is applauded by Principle Ian Diamond, left, and Secretary Steve Cannon, right, during the ceremony today . Formal: The Duchess of Cornwall was presented with a formal robe to wear over her dark navy dress and mark her role as Chancellor after she swore fealty to Aberdeen University during the service . Camilla was greeted by glorious sunshine and nursery children waving the Union flag as she arrived at the university’s College Bounds. Wearing a dark navy blue dress and pearls, she joined a procession of university dignitaries, including vice lord-lieutenant of Aberdeen Alison Skene and university principal and vice-chancellor professor Sir Ian Diamond. Led by a piper, the procession wound through the grounds of King’s College to the university’s Elphinstone Hall where an audience of university alumni, staff and students gathered. The Duchess, who follows two prime ministers into the historic chancellorship, was first awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by Principle and Vice Chancellor Ian Diamond. An installation speech was made by Colin Duncan, convener of the business committee of the university’s General Council. Honour: The Duchess of Rothesay is capped by Principle and Vice Chancellor Ian Diamond as she is given an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws at the beginning of the ceremony at Aberdeen University . Formal dress: The Duchess of Cornwall has her Chancellor robes put on by Sacrest Stan Jack during the ceremony in Elphinstone Hall at Aberdeen University . Addressing the Duchess, he said: 'We know of your great interest in the life of the university already from the many visits you have undertaken here, and the time you have spent with our staff and students. 'We know also of your many links to the north-east of Scotland that this university is proud to serve and of your great love for the landscapes that border the River Dee which joins the sea in this city. 'Today with your installation as chancellor, those links are further cemented and we wish that you will derive great joy and fulfilment from the role for a great many years to come.' The Duchess made a declaration of fealty to the university in Latin and was robed before presiding over the rest of the ceremony. She paid tribute to the 'outstanding' service of her predecessor Lord Wilson of Tillyorn, who stepped down at the end of December having served as chancellor since 1997. She revealed her husband the Prince of Wales had 'patiently coached' her in the recital of Latin required for the role. The Duchess also spoke of her connection to the local area. Prestigious: Camilla, known as the Duchess of Rothesay while in Scotland,  has become Aberdeen University's eleventh Chancellor . Tradition: The University's role of Chancellor dates back to the merging in 1860 of King's and Marischal College to create the University of Aberdeen . 'My father’s family, the Shands, hail from north-east Scotland, from Banff in fact,' she said. 'So this city is central to my Scottish heritage and has taken on an even greater importance now, because whenever I come to Scotland which, I’m happy to say, is frequently, it is in Aberdeen that my visit always begins. It is what I like to call my home port.' She praised the university’s standing as a world class institution and hailed the new £60 million library, of which Prince Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland, was campaign patron. 'I hope very much to be able to encourage work done by the university to reduce illiteracy, an unimaginable handicap to those of us who take our ability to read and write for granted,' she said. She added: 'I have talked of the university’s great past and I hope that, together, we may be part of what will be its equally great future.' During the ceremony, the university’s King’s College chapel choir performed Blessing, a piece specially written for the occasion by composer Paul Mealor, who also wrote Ubi Caritas for the royal wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Homecoming: The Duchess of Cornwall told the assembled guests that Aberdeen is her 'home port' as her father's family hail from the north-east of Scotland . Special occasion: The Duchess of Cornwall in her new role as Chancellor gives an Honorary Degree to Francis Mulholland at Aberdeen University . In her first duty as chancellor, the Duchess presented six honorary degrees to representatives of the arts, law, medicine and sport. Those honoured included Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, Scottish Paralympic gold medalist Neil Fachie and Oscar-winning screenwriter Sir Ronald Harwood. Honorary degrees were also bestowed upon former provost of Eton College Sir Eric Anderson; nutrition expert Professor William James and a retired physician and university lecturer Dr Audrey Dawson. After the ceremony Camilla attended a reception in a marquee in the university’s grounds where she met staff, students and honorary graduates. Fachie, the first Scot on the Paralympic team to win gold at London 2012 and a former graduate of the university, said he was overwhelmed by the honour. 'It’s the university where I studied in the city I grew up in so to be honoured here is very special.

Honoured: Honorary Graduate Sir Ronald Harwood kisses the Duchess of Cornwall's hand as fellow Honorary Graduate Neil Fachie looks on . 'It’s very nerve-wracking, it’s more stressful than doing any race as it’s something you’re not used to, but it’s something I’ll never forget.' He said he had shared his nerves with the Duchess after the ceremony. 'She asked what was next for me and asked me if I was nervous, because she was,' he said. Mr Mulholland, also a graduate of the university, said it was a thrill and an honour to receive his degree from the Duchess. He said: 'She spoke very well. It is obvious that she is very pleased to be appointed as chancellor. I am sure it will be very good for the university.' The Duchess, who is the university’s 11th chancellor, was elected by the university’s graduate body, the General Council, in February. The life-long role comprises ceremonial duties including awarding degrees to graduates at the end of each year.

"Move aside Gordon Ramsay, there's a new head chef in town. But Justin Bieber lookalike Luke Thomas isn't any old head chef. At just 19 years old, he is the UK's youngest and already has a cookery CV to rival that of Jamie Oliver. The floppy-haired youngster from North Wales has trained alongside the likes of Heston Blumenthal and Gary . Rhodes and worked at fine-dining celebrity hotspots such as The Fat Duck and . the 7* Burj Al Arab in Dubai. Watch out Jamie Oliver! Luke Thomas is the UK's youngest head chef at just 19-years-old . Luke, who is likely to become quite a hit with the ladies, began cooking at the tender age of 12 and now cooks up a storm every single day in his own restaurant between 7am and midnight. And there's no stopping the ambitious chef, who is about to open the doors to a new pop-up restaurant. Opening next month, Luke's new haunt will be set above Embassy in plush Mayfair, where Prince Harry regularly parties. The pop-up restaurant, which will open its doors for just . six months, is in conjunction with famed hotelier Mark . Fuller. Head chef: Luke already runs Luke's Fine Dining at Sanctum on the Green, near Marlow in Berkshire, which will be the subject of a new TV documentary . Dishes likely to feature on the menu include his delicious signature dish: a curry with scallops, crispy mussels and mango. Fuller is so confident about Luke's skills that he has dubbed him the new Marco Pierre White. But Luke's true hero is popular TV chef Jamie Oliver. Speaking to Hello! magazine he said: 'I'm a big fan of his. 'He gives people . what they want, he cooks food that people can go away and cook at home, . his restaurants are accessible. Fresh-faced Luke, left, has been called the Justin Bieber of the kitchen . 'I need to follow this model because what he's done is create this empire which is so successful.'

"When she bought 14 of Princess Diana's dresses at Christie's in June 1997, Maureen Rorech Dunkel had no idea that in just three months, they would become virtually priceless. After Diana's death in a Paris car crash, the Florida businesswoman set up a charitable foundation which was supposed to display the gowns around the world and continue the princess's legacy. But instead Ms Dunkel racked up at least $2.5million in debt through failed exhibitions, and tomorrow faces the embarrassment of auctioning off all 14 dresses to pay off her creditors. It's a sad end for the historic dresses, which include the stunning midnight-blue Victor Edelstein gown the princess wore when she danced with John Travolta at the White House in 1985, and two used in her iconic Vanity Fair photoshoots with Mario Testino. Sad end: Tampa businesswoman Maureen Dunkel poses with one of the dresses on display at Toronto's Design Exchange ahead of the auction. The proceeds will help pay off Ms Dunkel's debts . Although they went on display across the world, including at Kensington Palace in London, they also wound up at less-than-glamorous locations including Downtown Disney and an old furniture shop in Hyde Park Village, Tampa. Ms Dunkel, 50, hopes to make around $4million from tomorrow's auction in Toronto, which comes ahead of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's official visit to the country next week. Auctioneers Waddington's say some of the proceeds will go to the National Ballet School of Canada, but much of it will be used to pay off Ms Dunkel's debts. She filed for bankruptcy in 2010, after using the dresses as collateral to secure a $1.5million loan for a housing project which ended in failure. Iconic: Princess Diana wore this stunning midnight-blue Victor Edelstein gown when she famously danced with John Travolta at a White House dance hosted by Ronald Reagan in 1985 . Glamour: The dresses up for auction include this Catherine Walker black halter-neck, left, worn by Diana at Versailles in 1994, and right, another Walker gown, worn by the princess during a 1991 visit to Brazil . Her attorney, Jeffrey Warren, told the St Petersburg Times: 'A lot of her money was spent on that real estate development that went . sour. But she worked out a . plan to pay all her creditors in full. 'After these dresses are sold, her . creditors will be paid first. And the dresses are far more valuable . than what she owes.' She bought the gowns at Christie's in New York in June 1997, when Princess Diana auctioned off 79 of her dresses, raising $3.25million for her favourite charities. At that time they cost Ms Dunkel $670,000. Tomorrow, many will go for that sum each, with the iconic Edelstein expected to fetch around $1million. All but one of the dresses were made especially for Diana, and half were designed by Catherine Walker. They include a black halterneck dress she wore at Versailles, which is expected to fetch up to $275,000, and an elegant red dress and coat in which she attended the 1990 première of Steel Magnolias. Enduring: This grey crepe gown, covered in pearls, which Diana wore for this famous Mario Testino photo shoot for Vanity Fair in 1997, was in the Toronto auction . Red carpet frocks: The sale includes this crushed velvet gown, worn to the 1985 première of Back to the Future, left, and a black Bruce Oldfield dress, right, worn to the Les Misérables première the same year . There is also a Bruce Oldfield . gown, in dramatic black velvet, which she wore to the première of Les . Misérables in London in 1995 and is listed at $175,000-225,000. Shortly after Diana's death in September . 1997, Ms Dunkel announced her plan to take the dresses around the . world, hoping to inspire young girls and make millions for charity in an . exhibition entitled Dresses For Humanity. She . set up the People's Princess Charitable Foundation, which intended to . 'perpetuate the charitable objectives supported by the late Diana, . Princess of Wales', according to an IRS form at the time. By 2001, the dresses had toured Canada, the UK and New Zealand, netting more than $1.5million for the foundation, which gave the money to Metropolitan Ministries and the Boys and Girls Club, the St Petersburg Times reports. But the foundation was already running into trouble as expenses began to mount. In the first year alone, Ms Dunkel spent more than $1milion on legal fees, public relations consultancy and building the exhibits, and she had to loan it $1million of her own money just to keep it going. Up for auction: Princess Diana wore this Catherine Walker tartan dress at a ball in aid of the Royal Marsden Cancer Hospital in 1991, left. She wore the red dress and coat, right, to the 1990 Steel Magnolias premiere . By 2001, the foundation was beginning to . flounder, according to its tax filing for that year. It read: . 'Insurance on the dresses during transportation was very high, and . attendance and retail sales at each venue were well below projections.' 'The exhibit was shown at three venues, however none provided a profit.' She . loaned the exhibition to Kensington Palace for a short time in 2002, . but her attempts to hold a glamorous charity fundraiser at Diana's . former home failed miserably when sponsors failed to materialise. The foundation lost $115,878 in preparing for the event, and had to refund $47,250 in ticket sales. In . a 2004 tax filing seen by the St Petersburg Times, the foundation . borrowed $38,000 from the Bank of Tampa, and another $50,000 from . Patricia Sullivan, whose former husband founded Outback Steakhouse. Two . years later she decided to turn to real estate development, and . borrowed $1.5million from HRH Ventures - using the dresses as collateral . - to fund a housing project. Sold! A Christie's auctioneer celebrates in 1997 when the iconic blue velvet dress Princess Diana wore when she danced with John Travolta is sold in New York . But that, too, failed to go ahead, and in 2009 HRH Ventures sued Ms Dunkel and the foundation, asking for five of the dresses. By the time she filed for bankruptcy in January the following year, Ms Dunkel owed around $3.5million, including $1million to Sumter Homes, . Bank of Florida, Holland & Knight, Bank of America and Northstar Bank. With auctioneers estimating the 14 gowns could make as much as $4.15million, Ms Dunkel will at last be hoping the dresses can bring her financial help rather than woe. In the auction catalogue, she wrote: 'It is time to close the ""Diana Dress"" chapter of my life and focus on my greatest love, my desire to use my time, talents and treasure to serve God.'

"Violent: Canadian preacher Todd Bentley with a follower at one of his 'healing' shows in which he kicks people in the face, claiming it will cure them of cancer . An evangelist who kicks followers in the face, claiming his violence will cure them of cancer, is to tour Britain this month – but his proposed visit has provoked outrage and demands that he be banned from entering the country. Tattooed preacher Todd Bentley,  who as a 15-year-old was convicted of a sex attack on a boy aged seven, claims God uses him as an instrument to heal the sick, and is urging the frail to attend his shows. The former drug user, who is Canadian but based in the United States, even laughs about his ‘healing’  techniques. In one show he treated a man claiming to be suffering from colon cancer by planting his knee hard into the victim’s stomach. The man fell to the floor in agony. On another occasion, a man was pushed over so forcefully that he lost a tooth. Burly Mr Bentley, 36, said in one YouTube clip: ‘And I’m thinking  why is the power of God not moving? And He said, “Because you haven’t kicked that woman in the face.” ‘And there is this older lady worshipping right in front of the platform and the Holy Spirit spoke to me. The gift of faith comes on me. He said, “Kick her in the face with your biker boot.” I inched closer  and I went bam! And just as my boot made contact with her nose, she fell under the power of God.’ Labour MP for Croydon North Malcolm Wicks has urged Home Secretary Theresa May to ban Mr Bentley from the UK. He told her: ‘His visit can do nothing but harm and I would be grateful for any measures you can take.’ Mr Bentley launches his tour at the 400-capacity Croydon Conference Centre in South London with three shows from August 30, before visiting Liverpool, Cwmbran and  Co Armagh in September. Dr Michael Nazir-Ali, the former Bishop of Rochester who now runs a church education charity, said: ‘I think the Home Secretary should make enquiries and see if there is any threat to public order. If the police have any indication that violence will be used against people who may be ill or vulnerable, it will be for her to decide if police should attend.’ Peter May, a prominent Christian GP who served for 25 years on the Church of England’s ruling General Synod, and has investigated spurious faith healers for more than 20 years, said: ‘I’m concerned by Todd Bentley’s methods because a physical injury on any sick person could be very serious. 'Nothing, but harm': Labour MP for Croydon North Malcolm Wicks (left) has urged Home Secretary Theresa May (right) to ban Mr Bentley from the UK . 'I’ve looked at the video clips on his forum and it requires significant impact for someone to lose a tooth. There may be people who are Christians who believe their health has been transformed, but I believe Todd Bentley should produce the medical evidence. I would urge people to keep away from him.’ The preacher came to prominence four years ago through his church, Fresh Fire Ministries, which launched a Christian ‘revival’ in Lakeland, Florida. The event, which attracted 400,000 people, was also on international channel God TV. Mr Bentley claims he cured viewers at home. Shanee Lemos, who is organising the UK tour, denied the preacher used violence. He said: ‘I’ve worked with Todd for a long time and I’ve never seen him kick someone.’ He added: ‘Even the terminally ill or people with a few days left to live are encouraged to come along and Todd will attempt to cure them.’ A Croydon Conference Centre  spokesman would not be drawn on Mr Bentley’s methods. Mr Bentley said: ‘Kicking people in the face is not a practice of our ministry and I do not see this happening in the UK.’",Canadian Todd Bentley launches UK tour in Croydon later this month .
"Disgraced hand surgeon Michael Brown has died just two weeks after he was found incoherent in his closet following a suicide attempt. Doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach, Florida switched off Brown's life support on Friday morning after declaring him brain dead. The once-successful Houston doctor, whose fall from grace included assault charges and a well-documented dependency on prescription and illicit drugs, had gone into cardiac arrest after trying to take his life on October 24. His girlfriend told police he was suicidal because he was stressed over his ongoing divorce and financial problems. He was also due to start a 30-day prison sentence the following day. Fall from grace: Michael Brown, who suffered a heart attack after trying to commit suicide, died today after doctors switched off his life support. The former hand surgeon was due to serve 30 days in jail the day after he tried to take his life . Emergency responders went to his mansion in Miami Beach and found the 56-year-old incoherent and intoxicated inside the closet in the master bedroom alongside $16,000. A police report said he had left a suicide note on a night stand. Authorities did not say how he had tried to kill himself. After he was taken to hospital, a court filing stated: 'Dr Brown remains hospitalized and is incapacitated. The extent of the damage he has suffered is unknown, however . it appears to be severe and, at this time, counsel has no ability to . communicate with him.' Former life: He was once a renowned hand surgeon with a number of clinics across the country . Brown was put on life support but on Wednesday, doctors found he had no remaining brain wave activity. At 8.15am on Friday, the devices were switched off. But David Brown, a Houston attorney . representing Michael Brown's wife in the couple's divorce case - and no . relation to the late doctor - expressed anger that the life support had . been removed. 'It's . pretty outrageous to me that it would happen without notifying the . family,' David Brown told the Houston Chronicle on Friday. Michael . Brown had appointed a former employee as a medical surrogate and they . had not been contacted be the life support was removed either, David . Brown said. A spokesman at Mt. Sinai Medical Center said he couldn't confirm that Brown had been there due to patient confidentiality rules. The former physician, who lost his medical license . in 2006 after he tested positive for cocaine, had been a fixture in . Texas courts for years. Before . his fall from grace, he was an award-winning and renowned hand surgeon . with a number of carpel tunnel clinics across the country. But in 2001, his third wife, Darlina . Brown, sued him for allegedly beating her with a bedpost when she was . seven months pregnant. Troubled: At the time of his suicide attempt, he was in a divorce battle with his fourth wife, Rachel Brown, pictured with her new boyfriend, former baseball player, Jeff Bagwell. She accused Brown of assault . It made him a punchline as Brown and his family had previously starred in television commercials advertising the clinics with the tagline, 'We treat you like family.' In . 2011, Brown went to trial on charges he threw a humanitarian award and . two heavy vases at his fourth wife, Rachel Brown. He was later acquitted. It was not the first time Rachel Brown accused her husband of assault. According to the Houston Press, Rachel made prior complaints against Brown at least three times: in 2003, 2006, and 2009. She filed for divorce on January 7, 2011. In . January, he was accused of choking a flight attendant and threatening . to strip naked on a flight from London to Miami and in September, he was . sentenced to a 30-day prison sentence he had yet to serve. The flight attendant told . authorities that she was able to pull away from Brown's grasp but . alleged that his behavior continued after she returned to serve him . some food. Scene: He was found intoxicated in a closet at his Florida mansion, pictured, on October 24 . In court: Brown had appeared in court multiple times over the years for assault and lost his license in 2006 after failing a cocaine test. Most recently, he pleaded guilty to choking a flight attendant in January . A criminal complaint said that Brown knocked over the meal as he wrapped . his hands around her neck, began to squeeze, and asked her 'are you a . strong woman?' The Chronicle reported that Brown . then said he was going to 'get naked' and remarked about the 'sexual' things he wanted to do to the women. Eventually, . the flight crew was able to get Brown calm, and he soon fell asleep for . the remainder of the flight. When the plane landed, he was taken into . custody and pleaded guilty to related charges. As he became embroiled in court cases, his dependency on prescription drugs also became evident and he spent time at an addiction rehab center. In July, a judge ordered he be . arrested for contempt of court for the second time after once again . skipping a hearing related to their divorce. It is not clear how the divorce will now be resolved.","Michael Brown, a formerly renowned hand surgeon, went into cardiac arrest after the suicide attempt and was declared brain dead this week .

"A father is pleading with Google to remove a satellite image of the body of his 14-year-old son who was murdered in 2009. Jose Barrera said the picture on Google Earth shows his son Kevin, who was found battered and shot to death beside train tracks in Richmond, California four years ago. 'When I see this image, that's still like . that happened yesterday,' the distraught father told KTVU. 'And that brings me back to a . lot of memories.' Grisly reminder: The body of 14-year-old Kevin Barrera can be seen on this Google Earth image. His body, which has been blurred by MailOnline, is at the bottom of the image as officers gather above . Mr Barrera learned of the grisly image, which shows his son lying on the ground with a police car parked nearby and officers standing close to his body, earlier this week. He is now asking the internet giant to take down the image out of respect and said he plans to lodge a complaint if they fail to do so. Google has yet to respond to MailOnline's request for a comment. Technology analyst Rob Enderle told KTVU that it is unlikely Google will pull the image. 'When they remove it for one person . for one thing, then how do they not do it for others?' he asked. 'And so . they've found it easier just to say no.' Distraught: Jose Barrera is pleading with Google to remove the image, saying it brings back terrible memories . Victim: His son Kevin was beaten and shot to death. No one has been arrested for the killing . Kevin Barrera was found shot dead just off the railroad tracks in August 2009 - in the area which was known for trouble. Six people were killed there between February and October of that year. The teenager, who was known to police, had spent the evening of August 14 with his family but left alone on foot after getting some phone calls. His body was found at 7am the next morning by a passerby. No arrests have been made in his death. 'I don't know the right words to say how I feel,"" his father told the Contra Costa Times after the murder. 'My heart is really broke.' Scene: His body was found on August 15, 2009 in a notoriously troubled area of Richmond, California . His step-mother, Leticia Marquez, told a crowd after the death: 'All you kids who are Kevin's age, please help us. Please help your brothers and sisters, because they are looking for kids your age. They are taking our kids. This age is the right time for bad people to take our sons from us.' His death was the 33rd homicide victim in Richmond in 2009. By the end of the year, 47 people had been killed there, placing it as the second deadliest city after New Orleans.","Dead body of Kevin Barrera can be seen on Google Earth image .

"Three astronauts successfully reached the International Space Station this morning, where their six-month mission will include taking the Olympic torch on its first spacewalk. The arrival of American Michael Hopkins and Russians Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky after a six-hour journey returns the station to its full, six-member live-aboard crew. Cosmonauts Kotov and Ryazansky will next month carry the Olympic torch into open space as part of the relay of the Olympic flame ahead of February's Winter Games in the Russian resort of Sochi. Scroll down for video . Mike Hopkins, Sergey Ryazanskiy and Oleg Kotov (foreground, left to right) were welcomed aboard the orbiter by Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin, rear centre, and Flight Engineers Karen Nyberg, left, and Luca Parmitano . The Soyuz capsule, upper right, carrying three astronauts is shown in its final approach to the International Space Station this morning, after it blasted off from a launchpad in Kazakhstan late last night . The torch will be carried up to the . space station with another mission next month. But safety concerns mean . they will not be able to light it when they carry it into the void. The Olympic torch travels through routes that symbolise human achievement. One . previously flew aboard NASA's now-retired space shuttle Atlantis prior . to the 1996 Olympics, but it has never before been carried outside a . spacecraft. Before that passing milestone however, Hopkins, Kotov and Ryazanskiy face more immediate problems. The skeleton crew they are reinforcing was to have overseen the arrival of a commercial cargo ship carrying vital food supplies to the station this week. But a software problem left the unmanned Cygnus freighter unable to receive navigation data properly from the station, delaying the arrival of its 1,300lbs of food and clothes until no earlier than Saturday. Russia's Soyuz TMA-10M spacecraft blasts off . from the Russian-leased Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan early this . morning, carrying the astronauts to their six-month mission aboard the . space station . The hold up was necessary to avoid a . clash with the arrival of the Soyuz capsule carrying the three new crew . members. Typically, at least 48 hours are needed between spacecraft . dockings. The Cygnus cargo . ship, built and launched by Orbital Sciences with backing from NASA, . blasted off aboard an Antares rocket on September 18 from a new launch . pad on the Virginia coast. Orbital . Sciences said the two orbiting vessels established direct contact early . on Sunday, but the Cygnus rejected some of the data, which interrupted . the entire rendezvous. The problem was traced to a difference in data format in the navigation systems of the two spacecraft, the company said. Hopkins, Kotov and Ryazanskiy blasted in a Soyuz capsule off from a launchpad in Kazakhstan last . night, reaching the space station's Russian Poisk research module at . 2.45am GMT. They were . welcomed by Russia's Fyodor Yurchikhin, NASA's Karen Nyberg and Italy's . Luca Parmitano, who have been on the orbiting lab since May. Hopkins, pictured left before the launch, told his mother after arriving at the space station that the journey there 'was a pretty good ride'. Left, the intrepid trio wave as they climb the steps into the Soyuz module . Despite the restocking problems, new arrival Hopkins was upbeat about his mission. During a prelaunch press conference on Tuesday he said: 'As a crew we're very excited to be up there when Cygnus rendezvous and docks and (we're) looking forward to opening that hatch.' He and Ryazanskiy are space rookies making their first flights. Kotov, who will take over command of the station when his compatriot Yurchikhin leaves in November, has made two previous long-duration missions on the station. During their five-month stay, Kotov and Ryazanskiy are scheduled to make three spacewalks, the first of which will include taking the unlit Olympic torch outside the airlock. 'Our goal here is to make it look spectacular,' Kotov, speaking through a translator, told reporters. Kotov added: 'We'd like to showcase our Olympic torch in space. We will try to do it in a beautiful manner. Millions of people will see it live on TV and they will see the station and see how we work.' The torch is scheduled to be delivered to the station on Nov. 6 by the next crew launching to the outpost. Yurchikhin, Nyberg and Parmitano will then bring it back to Earth when they return home four days later so the traditional torch relay can continue. 'Unfortunately we cannot light it in space so we will simply take it to space and take pictures and some video with the station and the Earth in the background,' Ryazanskiy said in a prelaunch NASA interview.

Shortly after entering the station today, Hopkins, Kotov and Ryazansky had a chat via a video-link with their families back at the Baikonur launch pad where they had seen them off more than eight hours before. Radiant but visibly tired, the astronauts were yawning as they were talking to their families. They had been up for about 20 hours. Hopkins' mother described the launch as a 'heart-stopping experience.' 'It was a pretty good ride, mom.

"A 17-year-old boy due to return to boarding school plunged to his death in front of a train a decade after his father was found hanged. Jake Pirie was found dead on the tracks at Northallerton Station in North Yorkshire after being hit by a train on Sunday. His death was described by police as ‘non-suspicious’. The public schoolboy had been driven to the railway station by his mother after spending the weekend at home in the Yorkshire Dales. Suicide: Jake Pirie killed himself on the way back to boarding school in February this year at the age of 17 . Star pupil: Jake was a top student at Uppingham School and was set to continue to university this year . He had been due to catch a train and then meet friends at the other end to share a taxi to the elite Uppingham School in Rutland. As the upper sixth former waited on the platform he telephoned his friends to tell them he would be late and to go on ahead without him. He was then found dead after he was hit by the 16.01 Edinburgh to London Kings Cross train as it went through the station. Shocked: Those who knew the teenager said there was no indication that he was feeling suicidal at the time of his death . Last night his mother Sarah, 50, and sister Emily, 15, told of their ‘heartbreak’ at their loss. In a statement they said: ‘We are all overcome with grief following the death of Jake. He was a wonderful boy who had so much to live for. ‘He was so popular and enjoyed the company of many friends. We are heartbroken and it will take a long time for us to start coming to terms with this tragedy.’ Jake had been a star pupil at £30,000-a-year Uppingham School where he was on the rugby team. Richard Harman, headmaster of the 400-year-old school, said that staff and pupils were ‘shocked’ by the sudden death. He said: ‘It was with huge sadness and deep shock that we learned of the sudden death of one of our pupils, Jake Pirie, at the weekend. ‘The thoughts and prayers of all the staff and the pupils go out immediately to Jake’s family, especially his mother and his sister, and his friends. ‘Jake was a very popular boy at Uppingham, and he participated fully in school life, both academically and on the sports field. ‘It is so tragic that Jake’s life has been lost at this young age when he had so much more to look forward to in life. ‘Jake’s friends are understandably very upset - so all the school staff are pulling together to offer all possible support to them and other pupils within our community, to help them through this most distressing time.’ A short service of quiet and reflection was conducted in the School Chapel on Monday evening for pupils and staff. The death is a devastating second tragedy for Jake’s family who live in a substantial detached house in the Yorkshire Dales hamlet of Thornton Steward. His father James Pirie, who was a chiropractor and is a descendent of William the Conqueror, died in July 1999 aged 39 at their previous home in Rainton, North Yorkshire, when Jake was only four-years-old. He hanged himself and the inquest verdict was suicide. Grieving: Jake's friends took to Facebook to pay tribute to him in the aftermath of the tragedy . The family had only recently moved to . the area after relocating from Chelsea in London following the birth of . their two young children. Jake, who was studying for his . A-levels won a scholarship to Uppingham in 2008 after attending Aysgarth . Preparatory School in Bedale, North Yorkshire.

"Residents of an historic Kent market town fear a tourism backlash after allowing a thriller about a serial killer to be filmed there. Channel 4 filmed their new four-part drama Southcliffe in the town of Faversham. But when the local people gave their permission they believed it was a murder mystery not an account of a loner that embarks on a killing spree. The people of Faversham fear a tourism backlash after Channel 4 filmed their knew thriller in the town . Residents of Faversham allowed film crews into their home, but claim they thought it was a murder mystery . The show is inspired by the Hungerford massacre in 1987 and the Whitehaven shootings, reported The Independent. Southcliffe focusses on a loner ex-soldier who begins to kill after being persecuted by oppressive neighbours. The Faversham Enterprise Partnership claimed that the show, which is produced by Warp Films, would generate £500,000 for the local economy. Southcliffe features Stephen (played by Sean Harris), who embarks on a killing spree in the town . David Simmons, Mayor of Faversham said: ‘The impression I got was that they were making a crime series like Midsomer Murders. We had no idea of the storyline.’ Residents opened their doors and allowed crews to film inside their homes for the show. ITV’s Broadchurch encouraged a tourism boom in West Bay, Dorset, something that the town wanted to emulate. Mayor Simmons added: ‘We hoped that the filming would be of economic benefit to the town. The crew stayed locally and people let them use their houses.’ The producres say that Southcliffe is not about the murderer, but the community and how they react to a tragic event . David Simmons, Mayor of Faversham said that he thought they were filming a murder mystery similar to Midsomer Murders . But, the creators of Southcliffe said that it is not the story of a killer, but how the town reacts to a tragic incident and the community spirit of the place. Director Sean Durkin said: ‘It was about spending time in the area where we were shooting to see what it felt like to sit in a pub there, what it felt like to walk down the street. There was a palpable atmosphere.’ Bryan Mulhearn, councillor for Swale, said that he thinks there should be a screening in the town, with the chance for the producers to explain why they picked Faversham for the programme.","Channel 4 filmed their new four-part drama Southcliffe in Faversham, Kent .

"The release of the iPhone 6 was eagerly anticipated all around the world. But one Apple fan went to great lengths to ensure he was the first to get his hands on one, by changing time zones and flying down to Australia for the launch... just so he could drop the first iPhone 6 in a pitcher of beer. Canadian based musician Michael Mooney spent 22 hours on a plane so he could be the first to buy an iPhone in Brisbane, even paying the first people in the queue of 2,000 to hand over their handset. But it was no accident that the first iPhone 6 met such a sticky ending, Mr Mooney dropped it into his beer on purpose. As part of a clever marketing ploy, the musician was working to promote a product that claims to revive phones even when they have been completely saturated. Reviveaphone tasked Mr Mooney with acquiring the first iPhone 6 on the market, so he could test out the product with a fun video. So he headed to Australia, which was the first country to welcome the release date of September 19, due to time zone differences. Beer time: Mr Mooney pours the beer into his pitcher as he prepares to drop his iPhone 6 into the liquid . Expensive drop: Mr Mooney then drops the world's first iPhone 6 into his pitcher of beer . Mr Mooney is the lead signer of a Montreal Band called Le Trouble and a good friend of the production company that filmed the Reviveaphone video. The video was shot from September 16 to September 19 and it involved flying Mr Mooney and two-man crew to Brisbane. Mr Mooney said, 'When the guys approached me with this crazy and beautiful idea, I had to go with it. What's funny is that nothing was guaranteed. Would we get to the store on time? Would we get the first phone? Of course, we were confident Reviveaphone would bring the iPhone back to life, but it was all a big gamble... Those four days were totally hectic, and boy did we have fun!' Dying: The iPhone 6 is placed in the pitcher where it quickly dies and the lights fade out . Second chance: Moments later Mr Mooney takes the phone out of the pitcher and introduces Revivaphone . On the day of the iPhone 6 release Mr Mooney is taken aback by the length of the queue and he says, 'O wow, that line keeps going, you just can't see the end of that line from here.' During the entertaining video Mr Mooney comes to an agreement with the first two people in line for the iPhone 6 and he agrees to give his new friends thousands of dollars in return for the world's first iPhone 6. The video then cuts to the morning of the iPhone 6 release and an excited Mr Mooney. He says, 'Our friends are being interviewed because they were the first in line but what they don't know is the first phone is mine.' When Mr Mooney finally gets his hands on the iPhone 6 he kisses it and says, 'Thank you very much everybody, that one's mine. We came a long way for that b*****d.' Drying: After he takes it out of the Revivaphone pouch he  leaves it outside to dry for 24 hours . Minutes later the musician can be seen in a hotel with a large jug of beer and his actions would undoubtedly shock most iPhone enthusiasts. Mr Mooney says, 'Ladies and gentlemen I'm now going to drop the world's first iPhone 6 into a full pitcher of beer. As he drops the electronic device he says, 'Two thousand people lined up for this thing just then and we've just dropped it in beer? Although the phone looks doomed as the display lights are extinguished as the beer infiltrates the device Mr Mooney then introduces the Riviveaphone. Test: After the drying period Mr Mooney then takes it back inside and attempts to switch it on . Success: The apple logo lights up and following the Reviveaphone intervention the phone is working again . He says, 'When you drop your phone in water or beer or whatever it's not the liquid that makes the thing die, it's the minerals in the liquid and somehow this stuff treats the minerals and works on the minerals. I don't know I'm not a scientist.' Mr Mooney continues: 'You pour the liquid into the pouch and then stick the phone in and seal it. You leave this thing in for seven minutes and then you take it out and leave it to dry for 24 hours and you're good to go. The video then cuts to Mr Mooney 24 hours later as he checks if the phone has been revived. 'This thing has been sitting outside for 24 hours drying and it is dry so I guess I'll turn it on.' The lead singer is delighted to see the phone lights up. He adds, 'Please look at that, please, look at the apple and please see that that works.'","Man flew 22 hours from Canada to Australia to claim world's first iPhone 6 .

"Lengthy tenure: Sir Bruce Forsyth has hosted Strictly Come Dancing for 10 years since its inception . The show is a Saturday night must-see for millions of children. But as far as Sir Bruce Forsyth is concerned, they should remain watching Britain’s Got Talent rather than taking part in it. The 85-year-old TV veteran attacked Simon Cowell for allowing youngsters to take part in his ITV show claiming it is an ‘ordeal’ for many of them and results in many of them crying. ‘I don’t think that’s entertainment,’ he said. ‘I don’t think they should put children on that are too young.’ Sir Bruce, who plans to return as presenter of Strictly Come Dancing – the BBC’s rival to another Cowell show, The X Factor – in the autumn, added: ‘If you’re going to do that, have a separate show. Have a children’s show, British Children Have Talent.’ Yesterday Safer Media, a charity that campaigns for family-friendly media, backed Sir Bruce and called for a ban on children under 16 taking part in TV talent shows. The criticisms emerged as Saturday night’s instalment of the show saw several acts made up of children – some as young as five. Many were in tears at the end as the pressure of being judged became too much. One young girl in dance troupe Pre-Skool, comprising 13 five to eight-year-olds, started to cry as she waited for the judges to decide whether they would go through to the next round. Youth Creation, 33 children aged between seven and 14 from Essex also took part, with many of them becoming emotional at the end. Irish teenagers Jack Duff, 13, and Cormac Connell, 14, gave an impressive rendition of Of Monsters and Men’s hit Little Talks but also appeared on the verge of breaking down as they waited for the panel’s verdict. Even Cowell acknowledged their . performance was good but not great because nerves had got the better of . them on the show, which topped Saturday night’s ratings, attracting more . than ten million viewers –three million more than BBC rival The . Voice. Scroll down for video . Distressing: Natalie Okri cries during the semi-final of Britain's Got Talent in 2009 after Simon Cowell chooses dance troupe Diversity over her . Not child's play: Singer Hollie Steel breaks down crying half way through her song during Britain's Got Talent in 2009 . Miranda Suit from Safer Media said: . ‘Shows like this are emotionally intense and you are best to have a . minimum age and one that is suitable would probably be 16. We tend to . put entertainment on a pedestal in this culture. ‘People are so careful about using . animals in entertainment and we want to be even more careful about what . we expose children to.’ Scenes of children breaking down in . tears have become all too common on BGT, with Sir Bruce recalling how . one girl of 11 was left in tears. A spokesman for the show said: 'The . welfare of all contestants is our number one priority and we have . stringent procedures in place relating to children who appear in our . programmes. 'Children are accompanied by a member . of their family or a guardian at all times and a psychologist is on . hand at all auditions. 'We also employ registered chaperones at our judges’ audition days and live shows to monitor the children’s welfare. 'As there are a limited number of performances Britain’s Got Talent does not have an age limit.' All too much: A young contestant in tears on Saturday night's show . Feeling the pressure: Dance troupe Pre-Skool looked nervous . Hundreds of viewers complained in . 2009 when two child singers, Hollie Steel and Natalie Okri, cried due to . the pressure of performing live. And last year Britain’s Got Talent . had to defend its lack of an age limit when nine-year-old Malaki Paul . broke down in tears after struggling to finish his song because of . nerves. Last month child welfare campaigners . questioned whether five-year-old Jordan Nash should have been put . through to the next round. While the youngster, from London, received . positive comments from the judges, there were concerns that he is too . young to cope with fame, should he progress to the final stages of the . competition. Jordan, dressed in a black baseball . cap and a T-shirt with his name on it, performed an impressive dance . routine and was given a ‘Yes’ by all four judges. Questionable taste: Simon Cowell (right) kissing Amanda Holden during this weekend's show . But viewers called the decision ‘inappropriate’ and called on ITV to bring in new rules to ‘stop this happening’. Saturday’s BGT also provoked outrage over sexual references on the pre-watershed show. Kelly Fox, a 71-year-old grandmother, . performed a song called Kiss My A** containing the lyrics: ‘‘I came . home a little early, I couldn’t believe my eyes, you were lying there . butt naked with a woman between your thighs.’ TV watchdog Mediawatch-UK attacked . Ofcom and ITV for screening  the performance following criticism of a . lap dancer earlier in the series. Mediawatch-UK director Viviene . Pattison has asked the Government’s child protection tsar Claire Perry . to investigate sexualised content on shows aired before the 9pm . watershed. She said: ‘The ratings are falling . and ITV is just pulling out the stops. First we had the lap dancer Keri . Graham and now this granny. ‘It is inappropriate.

"Previous Eurovision winners for the country have included the Queen of soft ballads Celine Dion. But this year Switzerland is putting its faith in the Salvation Army, whose guitarist is 94-years-old, to win the contest. Swiss television viewers chose the Christian missionary group's rock tune You and Me from among five national finalists to represent the country late on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Switzerland is putting its faith in the Salvation Army, whose guitarist is 94 years old, to win the Eurovision Song Contest . The versatile musician also plays the double bass in the band's video . Swiss television viewers chose the Christian missionary group's rock tune You and Me from among five national finalists to represent the country . The Eurovision Song Contest, which next year will be held in Malmo, Sweden, is a kitschy fixture on the European cultural calendar and is watched by more than 100 million people across the world. Viewers and juries pick the winner from an eclectic mix of bubblegum pop and rock acts representing each European country. And the Heilsarmee group - made up of 94 year old Emil Ramsauer accompanied on lead guitar by  22 year old Jonas Gygax, trombone player Michael Sterckx, 47, backing singer Katharina Hauri, 46, and lead singers Christoph Jakob, 31,  and Sarah Breiter, 20 - is certainly eclectic. But the band are already causing stir. Political songs are forbidden and Swiss media have speculated that the Salvation Army's Christian aims might still fall foul of the rules. In an interview published on the Salvation Army website Ramsauer - who has been playing since he was 10 - describes himself as an 'old crock'. He said: 'I’m an old crock, but otherwise fine – thanks to my dear wife! We still live at home and even have a garden, there’s still a lot I can do. 'I’m in the Salvation Army Thun brass band now. I’ve been making music with the Salvation Army ever since I was ten, played with the Salvation Army in England during the war, then spent 35 years conducting the band in Thun.

But the band are already causing a stir. Political songs are forbidden by Eurovision and Swiss media have speculated that the Salvation Army's Christian aims might still fall foul of the rules . 'Someone asked me (to join the band), and I was interested. I thought I’d give it a try. I always liked making music, and got to play a lot of different instruments. And I like helping to make the Salvation Army better known. But I was a bit worried it might not be the right thing for me – and the video shooting was a bit much!'We’re all good friends – I always say that is the most important thing. Playing music and doing something together puts you closer, in better contact with each other. 'I want the Salvation Army to be better known again. Over the last few years you don’t see us as much as you did when we used to sing in the pubs and restaurants, and all we can do mostly is just pass the collecting box around. So it’s a wonderful idea to put the Salvation Army in the public eye like this.When asked what he would do if they won the chance to represent Switzerland, he said: 'Oooooh – then I’ll have to go through with it, won’t I – but I’ve done a lot of travelling, so it won’t be that bad. 'So let’s go to Sweden! Why not, if I can still do it and I’m fit enough?' Switzerland hasn't won the contest since Canadian singer Celine Dion represented the country in 1988. Salvation Army project manager Martin Künzi: 'Everything started with what sounded like a crazy idea. But then we all got enthusiastic about it, and after managing to get Hitmill as producer, we clearly had to give it a try. 'Because even without winning, it would still be worth doing. 'Firstly to show that we love challenges, secondly to get a new song in our Christmas repertoire.'

"After being on the market for almost a year, Al Capone's former mansion on Palm Island, Florida has finally sold. The home went on the market last July with a $9.95million asking price, but was recently sold for $7.43million. No word yet on who purchased the home. Sold: Al Capone's former mansion was recently sold for $7.43million . Final home: The Palm Island estate was Capone's last home, and where he died in 1947 . Peter Corsell, founder of energy solutions conglomerate Grid Point, was the previous owner and bought the house as a fixer-upper for $5.56million, then put it back on the market a year later. Capone himself bought the home for $40,000 in 1928 from Clarence Busch of the Anheuser-Busch family. Of course, he paid in cold, hard cash. The Mediterranean revival compound sits on waterfront property the size of a football field on Biscayne Bay. 'Two Versace South Beach villas could fit on this property,' broker Jorge Alonso told the New York Daily News. 'You step up to this huge pool. It's so glamorous.' The size of the property was originally worrisome for the sellers since a buyer could knock down the building to take advantage of the large lot. 'We hope that doesn't happen. It's such an important piece of Americana,' Alonso said. Massive: The 1928 home is located on a lot the size of a football field, right on the waterfront of Biscayne Bay . A steal: Capone bought the home with $40,000 cash from a member of the Anheuser-Busch family . Fixer-upper: The home's previous owner, Peter Corsell, bought the home to restore it and put it back on the market a year later . American treasure: Originally, the sellers were worried someone would purchase the home to tear it down and make use of the massive waterfront property . After purchasing the property, Corsell went about updating the mansion to it's original gangster grandeur. Features of the seven-bedroom property include a two-story cabana pool house, a private dock, a front gatehouse built by Capone for his guards, and an Art Deco powder room. And in case the new owners are paranoid, the whole property is encircled by a tall masonry wall. Party house: Capone used the home to hold wild Prohibition-era fetes . Room for friends: The house has seven bedrooms as well as detached guest houses . Security: Capone himself added on a front gatehouse especially for his guards . Restored: One of the house's powder rooms is still in it's original Art Deco style . Haunting: Capone died in one of the upstairs bedrooms, but the broker insists that it is not at all creepy . Safe: The house is encircled by a tall masonry wall, perhaps, to keep rival gangsters at bay . Paranoid: Capone would sleep in the front room of the house so he could be aware of everyone coming and going . Al Capone, the notorious Prohibition-era gangster is probably most well known for planning the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre - which resulted in the murder of seven mobsters in Chicago. The Palm Island home is supposedly where he planned the massacre, and his alibi - since he was at the Florida home when the incident happened. Though Capone was eventually arrested and imprisoned on a nearly decade-long sentence, he held onto the property. When he was released from Alcatraz in 1939, he returned to the Palm Island home and spent the rest of his years there. Planning site: The home is where Capone supposedly planned the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929 . Final years: Capone returned to the home after being released from Alcatraz in 1939 and stayed there until his death in 1947 . Capone died in the home in 1947, suffering the last years of his life from syphilis. The disease degraded his mind to that of a child's and apparently he slept in the front room, paranoid about who was coming and going from the house. According to Alonso, Capone died in a room on the upstairs of the home, but it's not at all spooky. 'It used to be creepy, but after the renovation it's this charming little room. Everyone loves it up there.'","The Palm Island, Florida compound has been on the market since last July .

"Foreign Secretary William Hague told MPs said he wanted to increase support to 'moderates' fighting to bring down President Assad . William Hague issued an ultimatum to Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad yesterday, warning Britain will arm the rebels seeking to oust him unless he comes to the negotiating table. The Foreign Secretary said there’s a ‘compelling case’ for changing the European Union arms embargo on Syria next week to allow weapons to go to moderate rebel groups. He said ‘no option’ would be off limits if the Assad regime refuses to co-operate with plans for a peace conference in Geneva. Mr Hague said no decision has been made yet. But he argued the West has a ‘moral’ duty to help those friendly to the outside world while Russia and Iran arm the regime and Arab states funnel weapons to Al Qaeda supporters. Mr Hague said: ‘People who are maybe described as rebels but are actually men, women and children sitting in their communities suffering virtually every kind of weapon that man has ever created being dropped on them while the world denies them the means to defend themselves.’ Mr Hague will join the French in an attempt  to loosen the embargo at a meeting in Brussels next Monday, but if other EU countries don’t agree it will lapse at the end of the month. He said changing the embargo is ‘essential’ to force the Syrian regime to negotiate. ‘The United Kingdom and France are strongly of the view that changes to the embargo are not separate from the diplomatic work but essential to it,’ Mr Hague said. He repeated claims that between 70 and 100 British jihadis are fighting alongside Al Qaeda elements in Syria. Parliament would debate any decision to arm the rebels, he said. In a move that confirms the Government is close to a decision, Mr Hague spelt out three conditions applicable to any weapons offer. He told MPs: ‘If we were to pursue this, it would be under the following conditions – in  co-ordination with other nations, in carefully controlled circumstances and in accordance with our obligations under national and international law.’ Tory and Labour MPs have warned the changes could drag Britain into a civil war that’s already cost 70,000 lives. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander told Mr Hague: ‘I believe that the risks of what could be a decade-long sectarian war in Syria, fuelled in part by weapons supplied by the United Kingdom, should give you serious pause for thought.’ Former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw said: ‘If the embargo is lifted, is there not a risk that this could lead to an escalation of an arms race between the West and Russia and Iran.’ Rebels: Free Syrian Army fighters prepare to launch a rocket in Deir al-Zor in the eastern part of the country . Mr Hague added: 'With every week that . passes we are coming closer to the collapse of Syria and a regional . catastrophe, with the lives of tens of thousands more Syrians at stake. 'We are determined to make every . effort to end the carnage, to minimise the risks to the region, and to . protect the security of the United Kingdom.' The death toll from the conflict has doubled in the first five months of 2013 and now stands at 80,000 people. More than 4million Syrians have been . 'displaced' and some 6.8million are in 'desparate need', including . 3million children, Mr Hague added. Battle: A Kurdish female fighter who is a sniper takes aim for her vantage point in Aleppo . Fall out: Syrians inspecting the rubble of damaged buildings due to government airstrikes in Qusair . Last month the European Union’s security chief Gilles de Kerchove warned hundreds of young men from across . Europe are fighting with rebel forces in Syria. Gilles . de Kerchove said those fighting to bring down President Assad, including . many Britons, will be ‘radicalised’ before returning home where they . will pose a ‘serious threat’ to national security. It is feared some will become members of groups with links to al-Qaeda before launching terror attacks at home. Mr de Kerchove, the EU’s counter-terrorism coordinator, said: ‘We are concerned, of course.’ He said most of the Europeans agreeing to fight with the rebels were being converted by radicals in Syria. ‘Not all of them are radical one day when they leave but most likely many of them will be radicalised there, they will be trained,’ he told the BBC. ‘And as we have seen in previous situations this might create a serious threat when they get back.’","Foreign Secretary says no option is off the table in attempt to end conflict .

"A father collapsed in a toy shop after he was bitten ten times by the UK’s most dangerous spider. Chris Galton had been shopping at children’s store Toys R Us with wife, Zoe, and one-year-old daughter, Imogen, when he suddenly became unwell and dropped to the floor. Bitten: Chris Galton, pictured with his daughter Imogen, received several nasty bites from a fake widow spider . The 31-year-old was rushed to hospital where doctors discovered as many as ten 50 pence-sized red . welts on his neck and back. Watch out: The false widow spider came over from the Canary Islands a hundred years ago . Mr Galton, from Southampton, Hampshire, had been aware of several stings during the day and had assumed they had come from a bee. He was horrified to discover the bites had come from the false widow spider, which is closely related to the black widow spider. Thankfully he suffered no further reaction and was given painkillers before being released the same day. The spider, whose body is bigger than a . five pence coin, is thought to have dropped into Mr Galton’s hooded top . from foliage growing close to Mr Galton’s home. He said: 'I had been stung earlier in the day but had assumed it was a bee and took some anti-histamine pills. 'I didn’t think any more of it until I was shopping in Toys R Us for my daughter’s first birthday later and felt more stings. 'The next thing I knew I was feeling hot, queasy and light headed and collapsed on the floor.' Mrs Galton, a nurse, kept her husband comfortable with the help of shop staff while the spider was caught and an ambulance was called. Paramedics gave him oxygen and he was taken to Southampton General . Hospital where doctors identified the spider as a false widow. It has now been sent for formal identification. The false widow is one of only around . a dozen UK spiders that can deliver a nasty bite, and is thought to be . the country’s most venomous arachnid. The species came from the Canary and Madeiran Islands more than  100 years ago. It has been established for a long time in Devon but in recent years has  spread south and east. The spiders can be found on walls and fences and in trees. They are brown with a rotund body and pale markings. Only the female bites as a method of self-defence. Bite victims describe a burning pain, which travels along the body from the bite, and swelling. Some suffer fever and a general sick feeling. Mr Galton said: 'I’ve been stung by wasps before. This was a like really a sharp pin prick and very painful. I’m just thankful it never jumped out and got on to my daughter.' Only a handful of cases of bites from the false widow are confirmed each year. It delivers enough poison to cause severe pain and inflammation. Insect experts at the Natural History Museum said one particular variety, called the Steatoda Nobilis, arrived in Britain with a cargo of bananas from the Canary Islands more than a century ago. A spokesman for Toys R Us confirmed the incident, which happened onSaturday afternoon. One store worker said: 'It was a very scary big spider. I’ve never see one like it before.' Insect exterminators at Wessex Pest Control Southampton said increasingly mild climates were helping exotic species like the fake widow to spread and establish colonies.","False widow spider is thought to have dropped into Mr Galton's hooded top from foliage near his home .

"An elderly homeless man has been reunited with his long lost daughter over Skype, after 24 years apart. The touching moment brought Jimmy Francis, 74, and Natalie Caler to tears as he told her: 'I love you, it's been a long time.' The emotional reunion was made possible by a kind-hearted Las Vegas realtor, Jim Snyder, and his wife Maria, who are now raising money to get Francis and California-based Caler together in person. Emotional: The touching reunion on Skype brought Natalie Caler, pictured, to tears . Mr Snyder discovered Francis hungry and shivering outside a Las Vegas sandwich shop earlier this week. He bought the man something to eat and left. But Snyder couldn't get the image of Francis hunched over in the cold out of his head, so he drove back, picked him up and took him home. 'When I took him that sandwich and I handed it to him and how cold he was, it broke my heart,' he told KTNV.com. After giving Francis some coffee and a hot shower and washing his clothes, the pair chatted and Mr Snyder learned that the man had been living on the streets for 10 months after his wife left him and he lost everything. Homeless: Jimmy Francis, pictured, was overwhelmed after finding his daughter . Emotional: Francis, 74, pictured, wiped his eyes as he told his daughter: 'I love you, it's been a long time' He also learned Francis had battled cancer and nearly died and was trying to reconnect with his six children. Surviving the illness made finding his family more important than ever, Francis told him. Overcome by the story, the Snyders decided to do everything they could to help. Francis told Ms Snyder the names of his children, and she searched for them on Facebook. It didn't take long before she discovered Caler, who fitted Francis' description of the daughter he'd lost touch with years ago when her mother cut off contact. Ms Snyder sent her a message and soon received one back. 'She was shocked, crying, amazed. The first thing she wanted to know (was) is this is my dad? Is he doing okay?' Mr Snyder told KTNV.com. Kind-hearted: Las Vegas realtor Jim Snyder, right, and his wife Maria, left, searched for Francis' children on Facebook after inviting him into their home . The woman told the Snyders she has been searching for her father for many years but didn't have any luck. 'She was so happy to know he was ok but saddened that he was homeless,' Ms Snyder said. 'We were able to re-unite them over the phone for several hours over multiple emotional conversations.' During those conversations, Francis learned that he had five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren in California, where Caler works as a truck driver. The Snyders then reconnected the father and daughter on Skype, allowing them to see each other's faces for the first time in a quarter-century. Happy: After multiple phone conversations, Francis, pictured right, learned he has at least five great-grandchildren in California . Search: Natalie Caler, pictured with one of her grandchildren, said she had been searching for her father for years . Both were moved to tears to see each other again after such a long time apart. But after the crying, there were a lot of laughs. 'There is no way I could ever repay them for what they've done. Not even knowing me,' Francis told KTNV.com of the loving family that helped him rebuild his own. Ms Snyder said she was proud of her husband for taking the needy man in and thrilled they could help him reconnect with his daughter. 'We could not believe what was unfolding in front of us,' she said. 'I believe my husband Jim was meant to be there to help this man and quite literally save his life. We are so overjoyed to be a part of this and be able to re-unite them.' The Snyders are now trying to raise enough money to get Francis to California to be with Caler, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, because neither can afford the plane fare. They are also hoping to find Francis' other children in the process. If you would like to help, you can donate to their campaign on website FundRazr here. 'With all the bad news in this world, it is nice to have a story that makes you feel good,' Ms Snyder said. 'Jimmy is a great man.'","The touching reunion brought Jimmy Francis, 74, and his daughter, Natalie Caler, to tears .

"Russia is again increasing its troop numbers and air force patrols in border areas close to Ukraine, it was claimed today. The move - certain to worry the West - comes amid fresh tension on the frontier with both sides accusing the other of tank incursions between the two ex-Soviet states, and NATO alleging Moscow has provided military equipment to separatists. Russia this week shut down gas supplies to Ukraine, while new president Petro Poroshenko vowed to retake control this week of porous border posts in Donetsk and Lugansk regions now in the hands of rebels. Ukrainian troops patrol an area near the border of Ukraine with Russia outside Kharkiv . The move - certain to worry the West - comes amid fresh tension on the frontier with both sides accusing the other of tank incursions between the two ex-Soviet states, and NATO alleging Moscow has provided military equipment to separatists . Kiev analyst Dmitry Tymchuk warned today: 'We are getting back the former threat of a massive invasion of the Russian army.' Russian troops - which had left the area several weeks ago on Vladimir Putin's orders following strong Western pressure - were now 'closer to the border to the North from Dolzhansky checkpoint' while the 'flow of mercenaries and weapons' had increased, he said. At least three tanks plus other heavy equipment are said to be in the hands of separatists who at the weekend shot down a Ukrainian military transport plane, killing 50. A Ukrainian soldier aims his rifle as Ukrainian troops patrol in an armoured vehicle an area near the border of Ukraine with Russia outside Kharkiv . Ukraine's national security chief Andriy Parubiy backed up Tymchuk's claim, warning the Russian forces 'are ready at any time to switch to taking more active and aggressive actions'. A total of 41,500 Russian troops remain on Ukraine's borders in the east, in Crimea and in the breakaway region on Transnistria in Moldova, he alleged. Before Putin ordered troops back to barracks, Western sources believed there were 45,000 troops on Ukraine's eastern border alone. He put the current figure here at 16,000. 'Despite President Vladimir Putin saying there had been a withdrawal of Russian troops from our eastern border, we have the information that on June 15 the Russian armed forces redeployed close to the borders of Ukraine some subdivisions of the 76th Pskov Guards Air Assault Division,' saidParubiy.

"When former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano takes over as president of the University of California later this month, she will live in leased accommodations that the college system is renting for nearly $10,000 a month. While the price tag is several thousand dollars less than what the university spent leasing her predecessor's home, some university officials say it might be more cost-effective in the long run to fix up a vacant mansion that housed previous university presidents. A committee of the University of California's governing board agreed Tuesday to spend $620,000 toward the multi-million cost of renovating the historic Blake House, which is located not far from UC Berkeley and has been unoccupied since 2008. The full Board of Regents must review the request, which it is scheduled to do on Wednesday. University of California prepares to repair and renovate this 13,269-square-foot mansion, the Blake House, that for decades housed past University presidents. Located in East Bay hills not far from the Berkeley campus, house has been vacant since 2008 and declared uninhabitable following years of neglect . The money will be used to repair the roof and to study if the three-bedroom, seven-bath house and its 10 acres of gardens should again be used as the president's official residence, reconfigured for some other purpose or sold off. Napolitano succeeds outgoing president Mark Yudof, who saw the system through one of the most difficult financial periods in its 145-year history, which led to sharp cutbacks in state support for public higher education. In the last five years nearly $1 billion was cut from the university's state funding. 'We should focus on what is the best use of this piece of property, is it sale, renovations, divisions, or rezoning it,' Regent Hadi Makarechian said. 'We shouldn't just spend money to fix the roof and then do nothing about it for another three or four years.' An aerial shot of the University of California at Berkeley. Decaying Blake House in Kensington, a 1924 mansion, is located nearly the Berkeley campus . The house has been unoccupied for the last five years, a period in which the university spent more than $100,000 a year renting houses for the president Napolitano is replacing. It will cost an estimated $3.5 million to $6 million to completely renovate the stately, but run-down abode, where the university's president is expected to entertain and hold meetings, as well as live. Money for both the repairs and the rent for an alternative presidential residence come from a private endowment. The house, built in 1924 and located in the hills not far from UC Berkeley, was bequeathed to the university by wealthy alumni and became home to President Charles Hitch in 1968. According to the San Francisco Gate, $97,636 in private funds has been spent to maintain the home. Foundation problems and roof problems are among the many repairs the . home is in need of. Due to the recession, plans were put on hold. Former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano is the first female UC president in its 145-year history. She will live in leased house that UC system is renting for nearly $10,000 a month while mansion is repaired for her possible use . The university has leased Napolitano a 3,500-square-foot residence in Oakland as she begins her new job on September 30, Montiel said. At $9,950 a month, the rent is $2,250 less than the home where Yudof and his wife have spent the past three years and $3,400 less than the house they rented for two years before that. Yudof is now among the officials arguing that it would be more cost-effective to fix up Blake House and have future presidents live and host university-related functions there. A report prepared for the Regents' Committee on Grounds and Buildings states the officials considered buying another house for that purpose this year, but were unable to locate one under $5 million. What's more, selling Blake House is . complicated because its gardens were donated to the Berkeley campus to . train future landscape architects. To get the house into shape, . officials are thinking about strengthening its ability to withstand . earthquakes, repairing the plumbing and electrical systems, enlarging . one of the first-floor kitchens to better accommodate large functions, . and improving overall security by adding gates, barriers and . surveillance cameras connected to the UC Berkeley police. Blake House in Kensington, Calif. will be renovated as new university president, Janet Napolitano prepares to take over for Mark Yudof. The mansion has been vacant since 1968 whenPresident Charles Hitch lived there . Plans also call for adding a laundry, kitchen and upgraded bathrooms to the 4,300-square-foot private living quarters. Although money for the project would come . from the private endowment, which as of July was valued at $188 million . with annual earnings estimated at $6.5 million, UC officials . historically have been reluctant to spend money on routine maintenance . at Blake House, much less a complete renovation.

"A group of Harvard students were recently asked by their tutor to sit the 1964 Louisiana Literacy Test - a notorious document with confusing questions that was used to stop black citizens from voting. Just 50 years ago, states in the South asked voters who couldn't provide proof of a fifth grade education to pass the test in order to be eligible to cast a ballot. The test was intended to disenfranchise African-Americans, who in order to pass had to correctly answer all 30 questions in 10 minutes. Despite their Ivy League pedigree, none of the students managed to pass the test and their reactions as they struggled to make sense of the obtuse questions was filmed. Scroll down for video and to take the test yourself . A group of Harvard students were recently asked by their tutor to sit the notorious 1964 Louisiana Literacy Test, a document once used to test the eligibility of certain people to vote . All of the students failed to pass the test which was intended to disenfranchise African-Americans some 50 years ago. A group of African-American voters stand in line to vote in Baltimore in 1964, left . The vague questions included requests to 'spell backwards, forwards,' and 'print the word vote upside down, but in the right order.' According to Carl Miller, a resident tutor at Harvard and a fellow at the law school, the purpose of sitting the test was to learn about how unjustly rigged the electoral process was at that time. 'Exactly 50 years ago, states in the American South issued this exact test to any voter who could not ""prove a fifth grade education,'"" said Miller.

Despite their Ivy League pedigree, none of the students managed to pass the test and their reactions as they struggled to make sense of the obtuse questions was filmed . 'Unsurprisingly, the only people who ever saw this test were blacks and, to a lesser extent, poor whites trying to vote in the South.' With his video experiment, Miller thought it would be interesting to see if some of the 'brightest young minds in the world' could pass a literacy exam meant to prove that a person had at least a fifth-grade education. Miller said not a single one of his student passed the exam, because it was designed in such a way that each question could be interpreted as wrong by the registrar official looking over the answers. 'Louisiana’s literacy test was designed to be failed. Just like all the other literacy tests issued in the South at the time, this test was not about testing literacy at all. It was a legitimate sounding, but devious measure that the State of Louisiana used to disenfranchise people that had the wrong skin tone or belonged to the wrong social class,' he said. 'And just like that, countless black and poor white voters in the South were disenfranchised.' He hopes his students will now appreciate the importance of exercising their constitutional right to vote.

"A man who cannot put on weight yet suffers with type 2 diabetes has finally discovered what is wrong with him. Scientists have diagnosed Tom Staniford, one of Britain's leading para-athletes, with MDP syndrome - a condition caused by a single genetic mutation but is responsible for a variety of seemingly unrelated problems. Tom, 23, was born at normal weight, but throughout his childhood and teenage years lost all the fat around his face and limbs. His . condition means he has no natural cushioning on his body, suffers from . sore feet, and is at an increased risk of breaking bones in a fall. Scroll down for video . Tom's rare condition is triggered by a single genetic mutation which causes a variety of symptoms including weight loss, type 2 diabetes, fused bones and hearing loss . Because . of the disorder, Tom has unusually high fat levels in his blood, as if . he was obese. It is this that has led to him developing diabetes. His hearing also deteriorated during childhood, and he now wears hearing aids. Tom hopes the new diagnosis will allow . him to be more accurately classified for events and help his chances of . success. He is bidding to participate in the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games. MDP syndrome is an extremely rare and complex condition and is only known to affect eight people in the world. He and other patients were found to . have an abnormality in the POLD1 gene that gives rise to a defective . enzyme crucial to DNA replication. He said: 'In some ways, identifying the syndrome . behind my symptoms shouldn't be important - a name is just a name, after . all - but it is reassuring to know that there are other people with the . condition and that we can lead relatively normal lives,' he said. 'What . could prove crucial, though, is enabling me to be properly classified . in competitions so that I am not competing at an unfair disadvantage . against others. 'I . hope to be able to compete for Great Britain in the 2016 Paralympics and . this finding could make a real difference to my chances.' Scientists describe the research that led to Tom's diagnosis in the journal Nature Genetics. Researchers at the University of . Exeter, where Tom studied law, compared the cyclist's entire genetic . code with that of three other patients with the same symptoms. The DNA . of their family members was also analysed. Professor . Andrew Hattersley, a Wellcome Trust senior investigator at the . university's medical school, said: 'Tom's condition has been a puzzle to . us for many years. We could see the symptoms, including the very . unusual case of type 2 diabetes in someone with no obvious body fat, but . did not know what was causing them. Tom, a paralympic cyclist, hopes that the new diagnosis will help him be more accurately  assessed for his place in the 2016 Rio Paralympics . 'We had to look at 30 million base pairs (chemical components of DNA) in Tom's DNA, and similar numbers in his family members and other patients, to identify the single mutation. This would not have been feasible even a couple of years ago.' In 2011, Tom became the youngest solo cyclist to be British National Paracycling Circuit Race Champion. Michael Dunn, head of genetic and molecular sciences at the Wellcome Trust, said: 'This is a great example of genome sequencing coming of age. 'Where previously sequencing a patient's entire genome was prohibitively expensive, it is now far more cost effective. 'As we've seen here, it is no longer just about identifying genes implicated in common diseases, but is about informing diagnoses and prognoses of rare diseases - and, in Tom's case, helping inform his sporting performance.'","British cyclist Tom Staniford, 23, has been diagnosed with MDP syndrome, a disease thought to affect just eight people in the world .

"A prominent Muslim leader living in Britain was today sentenced to death by hanging by a Bangladesh war crimes tribunal. Chowdury Mueen-Uddin, 63, was found guilty of murdering 18 people including nine university professors, six journalists and three physicians in December 1971 with an accomplice, now living in New York. The atrocities took place during Bangladesh's war for independence from Pakistan when an estimated 3million people were killed and 200,000 women were raped. Convicted: Chowdury Mueen-Uddin, 63 (left), a founder of the Muslim Council of Britain, has been sentenced to death by hanging for killing 18 people during Bangladesh's war for independence. Here he is pictured showing Prince Charles around the Markfield Islamic Foundation in Leicestershire in 2003 . Mr Uddin, former director of Muslim Spiritual Care in the NHS, and co-convicted Ashrafuzzaman Khan were tried in absentia after they refused to return to Bangladesh to face the trial. There is now a warrant for their capture. Senior judge Obaidul Hassan told a crowded court in Dhaka: ‘Justice will not be done if they are not awarded capital punishment.’ Among the activities he has been involved . in since arriving in Britain was joining the protests against Salman . Rushdie’s controversial book, The Satanic Verses, and he entertained . Prince Charles when the heir visited an Islamic centre in Leicester in . 2003. Absent: Mr Uddin, currently living in Britain, refused to attend the trial - as did his co-accused Mr Khan . He has previously denied the . charges of being involved in the abduction and murder of intellectuals and reporters - including a BBC journalist. Bangladesh, formerly a province of . eastern Pakistan, won independence after the nine-month conflict. Mr Uddin is . accused of working with an Islamic militia called Al-Badr to violently sabotage the nation's attempts to win independence. Current prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, formed the nation's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in 2010 to try war crimes suspects. In April, the ICT made an appeal to Britain to send him to Bangaldesh to be tried alongside Mr Khan. Sanaul Huq, the Inspector-General of Bangladesh's national police force, who is co-ordinating the ICT investigation, told The Mail on Sunday: 'They abducted an eye doctor, and then gouged his eyes out before killing him and dumping his body. 'They abducted a cardiologist and cut out his heart before killing him and dumping his body. 'They kidnapped a woman journalist, and cut her breasts off before killing her. Her decomposing body was later found with her breasts cut off. 'These victims were chosen because they were leading figures in the independence movement. Mueen-Uddin was a leading figure when it comes to killing activists. This is why we want to try him in court. 'As soon as charges are made – which I can guarantee will happen in days – we will request the British Government to hand him back to Bangladesh, and we will ask Interpol for his arrest. We will use all means, diplomatic and legal, to bring him back. If we fail, we will try him in absentia.' Today's verdict brings the total number of war convicts up to 10 - with seven already awaiting hanging, and eight more on trial. The evidence presented against Mr Uddin at the tribunal includes a claim by a widow, Dolly Chaudhury, who said that he was one of three men who abducted her scholar husband on December 14, 1971. Another member of the abduction group who was caught was said to have named Mr Uddin in his confession. Mr Uddin was working as a newspaper reporter when the war broke out. Appeal: The International Crimes Tribunal said there cannot be justice without capital punishment for Mr Uddin who was supposedly a member of Al-Badr terrorist group which killed intellectuals for the Pakistani military . But he was also said to have secretly abducted and killed leading figures of the independence movement for the Pakistani military. Mr Huq says Mr Mueen-Uddin fled Bangladesh shortly after independence, and went to Britain via India, Nepal and then Pakistan, from where he caught a flight to London in the early Seventies. Over the decades, he became one of Britain's most influential Muslim leaders and is now one of the trustees of the UK's leading Islamic charity, Muslim Aid. He was one of the chief Islamic leaders who mobilised thousands of British Muslims to protest against the publication of Salman Rushdie's controversial book, The Satanic Verses, in 1989. Mr Mueen-Uddin has also met Prince Charles, including one occasion when the heir to the throne visited the East London Mosque in 2010. Devastation: An estimated three million people were killed and 200,000 women were raped during the war . He has previously insisted that the war crimes charges against him were entirely politically motivated by Prime Minister Hasina's party as he was a member of the opposition. The Bangladesh government has said, however, that the trials are needed to heal the wounds of the 42-year-old conflict, which lasted for nine months. Towards its end, the bodies of intellectuals who were rounded up were found dumped in marshes and flood plains outside Dhaka with their hands bound. Mr Khan, a Dhaka University student leader during the conflict, was described by prosecutors as being the ‘chief executor’ for the Al-Badr militia. Mr Uddin did not want to comment on the sentencing today. When contacted on his mobile telephone, he hung up after saying: 'I'm not taking any calls.'","Chowdury Mueen-Uddin, 63, found guilty of murdering nine university professors, three physicians and six journalists - including a BBC reporter .

"For anyone with a fear of spiders, having one crawl into your bed and bite you is truly the stuff of nightmares. But for Catherine Coombs, the nightmare is still continuing almost two months later, as a bite – believed to have been from the UK’s most venomous species of spider – nearly caused her to lose her left hand. The 48-year-old woke up in excruciating pain one night in February, and her hand began to swell dramatically. Recovering: Catherine Coombs woke up in excruciating pain when she rolled over and was bitten by the false widow on the back of the left hand . Deadly bite: Catherine Coombs from near Poole, Dorset, spent six weeks in hospital recovering from the venomous bite of the false widow . She was taken to hospital, where . surgeons operated on her three times to remove the poison and decaying . flesh and to try to prevent the venom from spreading up her arm. At one point her condition was so bad doctors feared they would have to amputate her hand. Her body temperature plummeted as the . skin infection cellulitis set in and an inflamed patch on one of her . legs even sparked concerns it had spread via her bloodstream. Mrs Coombs has spent six weeks in . hospital and is now at home waiting for the infection to  leave her body . before she can have her tendons, which were left paralysed, rebuilt. From the nature of the marks on her . hand and her symptoms, doctors believe the culprit is likely to have . been a noble false widow spider, named after its similarity in . appearance to the black widow spider. Mrs Coombs, a former medical photographer who lives near Poole, Dorset, said: ‘I have been terrified of spiders all my life. Race against the clock: Surgeons operated on her three times to remove the poison and decaying flesh to prevent the venom from spreading up her arm . ‘People tell you it’s such a silly phobia and they can’t hurt you, but now I know that they can.’ She added: ‘For a while the doctors . were worried that I may even lose the hand completely and I had to sign . for amputation every time I went under anaesthetic. ‘Every time the surgeons operated they . found more and more decay. They just kept taking away the dead flesh.

"Tragic: L/Cpl Christopher Roney was described as the 'ultimate warrior' by military colleagues . A US helicopter gunship killed a British soldier in Afghanistan after being ordered to attack by officers who had misinterpreted grainy images from a drone aircraft. Yesterday, coroner Derek Winter condemned ‘mistakes and failures’ by ‘unprofessional’ commanders that led to the friendly fire strike on the British patrol’s base – and questioned why officers had not understood the information and aborted the attack. Troops from the 3rd Battalion The Rifles were in a firefight with insurgents in Sangin in December 2009. Unknown to them, senior British officers were watching the drone’s grainy images from the safety of Camp Bastion, about 30 miles from the battle at Patrol Base Almas. The officers, however, had mistaken the soldiers’ mud-walled compound for the enemy’s lair. Lance Corporal Christopher Roney, 23, a married father of one, suffered fatal head injuries when the US Apache gunship swooped in and opened fire with its 30mm chain guns, firing about 200 rounds of ammunition. The soldier, from Sunderland, was flown to Camp Bastion but died the next day. Eleven of his comrades were also wounded. After a five-day hearing in the soldier’s home town, the coroner condemned a string of errors that led to the death of Lance Corporal Roney. Mr Winter said: ‘The deployment and use by friendly forces of attack helicopters was done in circumstances that ought to have been assessed by them to conclude sooner than they did that their target was not an enemy force and that the attack should  be aborted.’ He also blamed the fact that Patrol Base Almas was not marked on military maps and that British commanders insisted there were no friendly forces in the vicinity. Criticism: Roney's widow Lorna (left) watches as his surviving brother Staff Sgt William Roney address the waiting media outside the coroner's court . Case to answer: L/Cpl Roney's widow Lorna and brother William said the Ministry of Defence should be 'held accountable for their actions' He concluded: ‘Lance Corporal . Christopher Roney died as a consequence of assumptions made, mistaken . beliefs and cumulative failures by friendly forces. ‘They had misinterpreted the imagery, . and rather than observing what they interpreted as an insurgent location . they were in fact viewing Patrol Base Almas, and used this information . to guide the helicopter crews. ‘Misplaced assumptions and beliefs became fact, and opportunities to reflect and change a course of events were not taken.’ Drone aircraft are unmanned . reconnaissance planes that remain in the air for many hours relaying . images to frontline commanders. They are piloted by remote control using . video screens, sometimes from as far away as a US military base in . Nevada. Mr Winter said the conduct of soldiers at Patrol Base Almas had been ‘extremely courageous and exemplary’. He added: ‘They were professional and . remained true to their training and procedures, factors that undoubtedly . saved the loss of further lives in the face of adversity. Lance Corporal Christopher Roney, 23, left behind his baby son William when he was shot by a US helicopter . Devastated: Lorna Roney arrives at the inquest . in Sunderland earlier this week into the death of her husband  Lance . Corporal Christopher Roney . ‘Unfortunately, the same could not be said of some others who were not at Patrol Base Almas when they came under pressure.’ In a statement to the inquest, Lance . Corporal Roney’s family accused the Army and  Ministry of Defence of . negligence and trying to cover up the severity of the incident. It said: ‘The “fog of war” were the . words used by the MoD, instead of saying what should have been said: . negligence, plain and simple. Sargeant Major John Pepper arrives to give evidence to the inquest in Sunderland earlier this week . Pepper was the man in charge in the British control room when the helicopter fired on friendly soldiers . Sargeant Major Adam Hogg was overruled by an officer when he raised his concerns that British troops were being attacked . Lance Corporal Jonathan Cassell was on the roof . of the compound firing a machinegun at the enemy when he realised the . friendly apache was firing at him . Corporal Ben Hall describes himself as L/C Roney's 'best mate' Major Timothy Harris also gave evidence at the inquest earlier this week . ‘This has upset the family . considerably and has given the impression that Christopher and his . injured comrades meant very little to the MoD.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘This tragic . incident occurred in a highly challenging and fast-moving environment.

"There are buses and then there is the AutoTram Extra Grand which debuted in Germany this week as the longest of its breed in the world. Developed by the boffins of the Fraunhofer Institute for Traffic and Infrastructure Systems, the bus is nearly 101 feet long, has four steering axles and can carry 256 passengers. The big bendy bus premiered in the eastern city of Dresden this week where it will soon roll into service with the local transportation authority on trial runs as Beijing and Shanghai placed their orders for the vehicle which costs $1.25 million (almost £778,000) per bus. World's longest bus: Debuted in Germany, the megabus AutoTram Extra Grand is nearly 101ft long and can carry 256 passengers . Unsafe and unreliable: Bendy buses on several routes in London were banned in 2009 amid claims they were unsafe, unreliable and encourage fare-dodgers . The total development is costing $10 million and the good news for environmentalists is that it can run for long stretches on electric power. Matthias Klingner, the institute's director said: 'There is a lot of know-how invested in it. It's computer is highly efficient. 'The innovation of the AutoTram lies not . only in its length, but most of all in its ability to be manoeuvred . like a conventional 12 metre (39ft) city bus. 'There's no problem with the manoeuvrability and stability, but we have to see how such a long bus affects normal city traffic.' Already orders: Made in Germany, the new bendy bus has already been ordered by Chinese cities Shanghai and Beijing . German trial: This week the vehicle debuted in Dresden and will be part of the local transport on a trial basis . It combines the passenger capacity of a . small train with the manouverability of a bus and runs on a hybrid . engine that kicks in when the electric batteries run down, charging them . as it propels the vehicle. Bus drivers will not require a special licence to drive the long, bendy bus thanks to a unique computer steering system which keeps the length of the bus precisely in line with the front carriage. The system is less expensive to run . and cheaper to put into operation than a rail commuter system, prompting . other cities to inquire about the super-sized buses. Dr Klinger said: 'The AutoTram has a considerable advantage compared to light rail systems.' While it is the longest bus in the . world, the bus with the largest capacity is China's New Liner Series . which has 300 seats on a 82ft bus. Combines transport: The bus combines the passenger capacity of a small train and the maneouverability of a bus . Bendy buses in London were banned on several routes in 2009 after they were found to be responsible for many accidents. London's mayor Boris Johnson struggled to sell the 31 vehicles amid claims they were unsafe, unreliable and encourage fare-dodgers. They were taken out of service temporarily in 2005 after three caught on fire. Many were eventually sold to Malta in 2011. According to The Guardian Mr Johnson said at the time: 'These bulky and ungainly monstrosities were always more suitable for the wide open vistas of a Scandinavian airport than for London. 'I am glad to see the back of them.'","The AutoTram Extra Grand is being trialled in Dresden, Germany .

"Your 3 p.m. walk to the office vending machine may soon get a lot happier. At least three companies are currently developing vending machines for marijuana after Colorado and Washington State recently legalized it's recreational use. Retail sale is expected to start in Colorado by January 2014 with Washington State following shortly after. Only one company has an actual model in use, and that's California-based Medbox Inc. - run by chiropractor Bruce Bedrick, 'the Steve Jobs of medical marijuana dispensing.' C5 or D2?: Medbox's machine, right, is the only patented marijuana . vending machine and can currently be used at medical dispensaries in . California. A newer option from Endexx Corp., left, was developed with . the recreational user in mind . 'We're the only patented game in town,' Bedrick told The Huffington Post. 'I'm not concerned necessarily about the competition, generally speaking.' Medbox made $1.75 million last quarter. But there are other companies creeping up on his business model - and tailoring to the two states that have already legalized recreational marijuana. Phoenix-based Endexx Corp. has already bought up two smaller firms, CannCan and Dispense Labs and aims to distribute machines in legalized states. Customers of Endexx's machines wouldn't be medical patients like Medbox's users. They would be recreational users just wanting to pick up weed, and not deal with the hassle of the middle man. Users would be able to order an amount of marijuana from the machine's app on their iPhone, and then go to a retail center to pick it up. At the machine,  they would also be able to add rolling papers or a cigarette lighter to their order. The machines could also be used to sell pre-packaged cannabis goodies, such as brownies or cookies. Cannabis confections: In addition to marijuana, Davis envisions his machines being able to sell rolling papers, lighters, and even sweets spiked with pot such as pre-packaged brownies and cookies . 'The way we see it, when you walk into a shop, you don't need the expert or aficionado to help with your selection,' said Endexx's CEO Todd Davis. 'The people who are using this in the recreational space - they know what they want, and they don't want to hear the whole spiel every time.' Davis has high hopes for this burgeoning industry: 'It's like a gold rush. Once significant investment capital comes to the market who knows?' But Bedrick thinks that's still a ways off - even in legalized states where selling weed in vending machines would need to get approval. 'I think that's still a couple of years down the road.' Slow and steady is how he sees the marijuana vending industry going: 'Some people want to see this free-flowing marijuana. They want to go from federal and state ban to marijuana for everybody,' Bedrick said. 'We don't believe that can happen. In order to gain respect and trust, it's better to go through gradual, medical adoption.' Another company, Tranzbyte Corp., announced in April that they would be entering the marijuana vending business as well. David Levine, who sold CannCan to Endexx, has been in the vending machine industry for almost a 10 years and has seen how quickly the industry has changed when it's come to weed vending. 'Back in 2009, you'd go to these conventions and you'd see people trying to unload 80 pounds of weed,' Levine said. 'Now, you'll see people buttoned up and trying to figure out solutions for what's a real industry.' Not yet: Bedrick believes it's going to take longer for vending machines to get approved - even in legalized states .","Entrepreneurs are looking to cash in on the marijuana vending machine market in Colorado and Washington State, where marijuana was recently legalized .
There are already a few machines on the market in California medical dispensaries, but new machines will focus on the recreational user ."
"Earlier this week, the son of fallen Chinese politician Bo Xilai has been fighting claims of his playboy lifestyle and denied that he ever drove a Ferrari. But an official with the Massachusetts  Department of Transportation said the current Harvard graduate student received three traffic tickets over the course of two years while driving a black Porsche. According to state records, Bo received two citations for running a stop sign, and another for speeding – he was caught going 58 in a 30mph zone.

Bo painted himself as a sympathetic character in a letter to the Harvard Crimson student newspaper published Tuesday. In it, he said he attended social events as an Oxford University undergraduate to broaden his perspective. His father, Bo Xilai, is believed to . have been a leading candidate for one of the nine seats on the ruling .

He fell out of favour with some in . the leadership over his flashy personal style, suspected corruption, and . the excesses of a dual campaign to fight gangsters and promote Mao . Zedong-era Communist culture in the southwestern mega-city of Chongqing. Bo, Jr hit out at claims that he had cashed in on his parents’ wealth and influence by spending more partying than studying while he was at Oxford University. He became renowned for hosting champagne and shisha parties in his room at Balliol College, where he read Politics, Philosophy and Economics. Prestigious: Mr Bo had been studying for a masters degree as Harvard Kennedy School of Government, above . Claims: Former Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun, fled the city in February, is said to have revealed to American diplomats that Mrs Gu confessed 'I did it' three times . It was also claimed that his performance fell short of what was expected and he was made to sit ‘penal’ exams. But in an extraordinary twist – and in an astonishing example the influence of his parents before their spectacular fall from grace – Chinese officials tried to intervene to prevent tutors from disciplining him over his lack of work, it is understood. However, Mr Bo – the son of former . Chongqing party boss Bo Xilai and his lawyer wife Gu Kailai – did not . refer to all these allegations. In a statement published by the Harvard Crimson student newspaper, he: .

"A waxworks which has been described as Britain’s worst museum is facing closure because its elderly owners cannot find anyone else to run it. The Louis Tussauds House of Wax in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, has cult status on the internet because so many of its models look nothing like the people they are supposed to represent. Thousands of visitors still pay £5 each to visit the seaside attraction so they can mock the far from lifelike models of celebrities, sports stars and royalty. Dud ringers: David and Victoria Beckham look very little like they do in real life . Jane Hayes, 82, and her husband Peter, . 85, who have run the museum since 1955 fear they will have to close the . business if nobody wants to take it over. Mrs Hayes said: 'In June this year my . husband was taken seriously ill with pneumonia. We don’t want to retire . but when your health starts to decline you have to think. 'It will be a shame as we’ve been here . 57 years, and it would be nice to make 60, but we’ve no family . interested in taking it on. Worst in Britain: The Queen and Prince Charles feature in the exhibition - but these waxworks aren't flattering . Terrible: Princess Diana's beauty is lost in this waxwork and, right, Prince William has a deathly palour . Odd looking: Royals Princess Anne and the Queen Mother, right, are barely recognisable . 'It’s softly, softly and we hope we will be able to continue as it’s also our home.' The couple are now seeking planning permission to change the use of the museum from a waxworks to residential use. But Mrs Hayes said they were also . seeking a reduction in rates payable to Great Yarmouth Borough Council . to make it a more viable business. Going down (under): Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan are showcased in the exhibition which is facing closure . TV fame: Presenter Michael Barrymore and Rowan Atkinson are just about recognisable . The museum has more than 150 models, . mostly dating back to the 1970s and 1980s, including an . unflattering Prince Charles, a dusky skinned Sean Connery and model . Samantha Fox. A model of Prince William has him in a casual sweater with a full head of hair while a model of the Queen looks less than regal. The museum which employs three staff also includes a chamber of horrors and a collection of antique amusement machines. Well known: Sarah Ferguson and Pope John Paul II are among the museum's 150 waxworks . Resemblance? Model Samantha Fox and Gary Lineker. Most of the stars date back to the 1970s and 1980s . Mocked: Eddie the Eagle Edwards and Michael Jackson are among the stars mocked by punters . Many of the models have been widely mocked on the internet, particularly by visitors on the review website TripAdvisor. Some have even admitted travelling more than 120 miles to visit the waxworks so they can laugh at the models. CatVonK,  who visited the museum in . September, wrote on the site: 'This is well worth the £5 entry fee as . its sooooo bad it's good. Loved: War-time Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and right, Hitler. Some fans of the museum have even admitted travelling more than 120 miles to visit the waxworks so they can laugh at the models . Help: Name plates help visitors identify waxworks like footballer Gazza and right cricket star Ian Botham . 'Some of the waxworks are . unrecognisable and thankfully you are helped out with nameplates. The . setting of the building is very dark and moody which really adds to the . creepiness of waxworks. 'The torture chamber section was a bit . unnerving as it was so dark and not helped that when you leave, you . exit via a very spooky derelict arcade. If you love freaky things, this . is superb. I'm so glad we went, it was brilliant fun :)' Kelly M of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, . who also visited in September, wrote: 'Well worth the 2 hour drive and . entry fee for the laugh alone. Ice stars: Jayne Torville and Christopher Dean are among the waxworks which have drawn crowds . Value? Snooker star Steve Davis and former footballer Kevin Keegan feature at the attraction which costs £5 . 'One or two are spot on (Mr Blobby) (The dead person in the dungeon) but without the nameplates etc you . wouldn't have a chance of knowing who they were. 'I'm sure a lot of love and work has . gone into the making of the waxworks but to know exactly who they are . makes it a lot of fun.' Another reviewer from Chelmsford, . Essex, who gave it an ‘excellent’ rating said: 'What can i say,after . reading all the reviews, my girlfriend and i visited last saturday, i . have to agree with all the reviews, the smell, the dust , cobwebs what a . joy. Fame: Terry Wogan's face is a funny shade of pink and and right motorcycle road racer Barry Sheene . Sports: Decathlete Daley Thompson has a huge moustache and footballer Michael Owen is right . 'The waxworks were a giggle all the . way through, not sure what Micheal Jackson was supposed to be, and had a . finger missing, Its a place you must visit, I proposed to my girlfriend . in front of the royal family, she said yes through the fits of . giggles'. Mr Hayes described the museum as . ‘unfailingly popular’ in 2008 when he revealed that he was auctioning . off 75 heads of models which had been taken off display. But he cancelled the auction after newspaper articles poked fun at the models he was trying to sell for around £80 each. Politics: Margaret Thatcher, left, and John Major is recognisable from his black rimmed spectacles . Giggles: Former tennis player Virginia Wade and former Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock . Mr Hayes admitted at the time that some of his models were no longer recognisable. He said: 'Some of them are too old and . they do not resemble their subjects any more and obviously some . visitors are far too young to remember them.' In an interview in 2004, Mr Hayes . said: 'We have never had any complaints and a lot of people give us the . thumbs up and say they enjoyed it on the way out. Stars: The Beatles and right Elvis Presley are among the music legends which feature in the display . Enduring: Noel Edmonds and Boy George. In the resort's heyday visitors had to queue to get in . 'Yarmouth needs attractions and exhibitions and we are about the only good exhibition left here.' Mr Hayes insisted that people's . impressions of waxworks were always subjective and someone might . consider a figure a good likeness while others might say it was not . lifelike. He added: 'Some are very good whereas . some are a bit dated - but as they cost £1,000 each they have to . have a good life and can't be replaced every year.' In the resort's heyday in the 1960s, . visitors had to queue to get in and went round the exhibition in lines . of up to four abreast, he added. The museum is closed for the winter season from tomorrow. Popular: Louis Tussauds House of Wax in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk faces closure but has developed cult status . Attraction: House of Wax has been run by a husband and wife team for 57 years, and both are in their eighties .

"Queen of the Tardis: Helen Mirren has be rumoured to be up for the role of a lifetime. The actress said she would like the part of the Time Lord: 'I don't just want to be his sidekick' Television’s best-loved hero has survived volcanoes, nuclear blasts, black holes and his own death — ten times — in his struggle against cosmic evil. But after Matt Smith announced he intends to quit Doctor Who at Christmas, the character faces his greatest ever threat. It comes not from the Daleks or sinister Weeping Angels, but from the man entrusted with the show’s future. Steven Moffat, the show’s 51-year-old chief writer and executive producer, is threatening to fulfil an ambition that began as a joke more than a decade ago — and regenerate the Doctor as a woman. Actresses linked to the role include Helen Mirren, who has admitted she would leap at the chance. ‘I would like to play the new female Doctor Who. 'I don’t just want to be his sidekick,’ she has said. Other names put forward are Olivia Colman, who scored a double Bafta success last month following her sensational performance in crime thriller Broadchurch, and comedienne Miranda Hart. The notion of Miranda galumphing around the Tardis is enough to dismay any Whovian — as fans call themselves. Other female Whos in the frame are thought to include Ruth Jones, star and co-writer of Gavin And Stacey, and the Doctor’s former companion Billie Piper. She hinted heavily, after leaving in 2006, that she would love to return in the title role. Her character, Rose, is expected to feature in the 50th anniversary special scheduled for November. Great British Bake-Off host Sue Perkins said she was ‘beyond flattered’ earlier this year when a sci-fi website proposed her as a future Doctor. But a woman Doctor would be more than a disappointment to the show’s legion of fans — it would betray a British tradition. The character has been a role model for three generations of boys. Unlike conventional muscle-bound superheroes, the Doctor relies on intellect and ingenuity to triumph over violence. There is no one else quite like him on television. He’s proof that the sonic screwdriver is mightier than the sword. And in a Britain bristling with casual violence, that example is desperately needed. Why must the Doctor fall victim to a politically correct trend for ‘gender neutral’ childhoods? It may come as a surprise to many in these liberated times, but most little boys still grow up wanting to be men. And what finer example of a man — brave, reflective, with a keen sense of heroic duty — is there than Doctor Who? Departing: Matt Smith (pictured) is leaving the show after three series. He has been critically acclaimed for his portrayal of the Doctor and is the first actor to be nominated for a Bafta for the role . Tipped for the role: Great British Bake Off presenter Sue Perkins (left) writer and actress Ruth Jones (right) are both believed to be in line to be an unconventional Doctor . Potential Doctors: Actress of the moment, Olivia Colman (left) has been mentioned as a good fit for the role, while Miranda Hart (right) would give the part a comedic edge . Lady Who: Former companion Billie Piper (left) has hinted that she would love to return in the title role after she left the hit show in 2006. Actress Joanna Lumley (right) starred as the Doctor in a Comic Relief skit . Stephen Moffat, a childhood fan of the show, has done much that is praiseworthy since he took it over in 2009. He has brought it new emotional depth and given the Doctor a love interest for the first time. Moffat has revived a franchise that some had complained had grown too clever for its own good, others that it had become bogged down and boring. But now he seems intent on destroying all he has achieved. Last year, Moffat told an audience at the Edinburgh Television Festival that he had slipped a clue into an episode 12 months ago, an offhand line revealing that when a Time Lord regenerates, he could be reborn as a woman — a Time Lady. ‘It can happen,’ Moffat insisted. ‘The more often it is talked about, the more likely it is to happen some day.’ Warming to his theme, he asked for a show of hands at one convention in Cardiff to see how many would accept a woman Doctor. About a quarter said they would stop watching, but Moffat was undeterred. In fact, Moffat has already attempted it once, in a spoof starring Rowan Atkinson and Joanna Lumley, for the BBC’s Comic Relief night in 2009. Broadcast in four five-minute episodes throughout the charity telethon, ‘The Curse Of Fatal Death’ was a send-up that paid homage to the show. When the Doctor is killed by Daleks, he regenerates as a string of A-listers — Richard E. Grant, then Jim Broadbent, then Hugh Grant, before finally appearing as Lumley in a low-cut tunic and greatcoat. Doctor Lumley exits with her arch-enemy — played by Jonathan Pryce — on her arm. Companions: The show has gone through its fair share of female side kicks. The current companion is played by Jenna-Louise Coleman (left) who has signed up for the next series in 2014. Actress Karen Gillian (right) also starred alongside Matt Smith . It was a marvellous joke. But to take . it any further would be to swindle countless fans. The essence of the . character — as an archetypal hero, not heroine — would be lost. The . Doctor’s strength is that he always wins through by thinking rather . than fighting — an antidote to mainstream comic book and action movie . heroes Batman, Spiderman, Conan the Barbarian, Tarzan, Rambo and . Wolverine. The Doctor was specifically created to counter that trend. In . 1963, post-war Britain was outstripped by technological advances in . Germany, Japan and America. The country was experiencing a ‘brain drain’ as our most brilliant scientists and researchers emigrated to find . better paid work. So the BBC set out to invent a hero who could make the scientific seem heroic. The first Doctor Who team working under then director-general Hugh Carleton Greene succeeded far beyond their hopes. As the Doctor saved the galaxy, science became as cool as The Beatles. Greene urged his team to focus on thought-provoking story-lines with lots of history, chemistry and physics lessons woven into the scripts. Favourites: David Tennant's time in the role, alongside companion Billie Piper is favoured by many of the show's loyal fans . Classic: Jon Pertwee's boundless energy as the Doctor has left a lasting impression on many viewers . For a generation of boys, this was eye-opening. They had a new figure to emulate: not just brave, but brainy. Using . only his brilliant scientific mind and his encyclopaedic knowledge, he . tackled aliens armed with death-rays, and came out on top. The . first Doctor, played by William Hartnell, was irritable and impossible — . softened only by his affection for his grand-daughter Susan, the . earliest of his intergalactic companions. The second, portrayed by Patrick Troughton, was a superman striving alone to hold back vast tides of evil. But Jon Pertwee personifies the Doctor for me. With his silver curls and ruffs, he exuded a boundless energy. For many, though, it was Tom Baker’s . fourth Doctor who perfected the character with his charisma, . eccentricities, humour, brilliance and lurking ruthlessness. His performance strongly influenced David Tennant as the tenth Doctor. After . five decades, the Doctor remains unique in the pantheon of boys’ own . heroes. There are other intellectuals, of course, but in the sports-mad . hurly-burly of the schoolyard, they offer little to emulate. Hercule Poirot is a pompous dandy. Sherlock Holmes is a drug-abusing loner. With boys lagging ever further behind girls in school league tables and as the pressure intensifies on young males to reject education, we need the Time Lord as never before. The greatest detective in Victorian London is Sherlock, not Shirley. Generations of grubby schoolboys have found much to admire in Just William, not Just Wilhemina. Agent 007 is James, not Jemima Bond. Why can’t Steven Moffat see this distinction? When I was six years old, peeping around the sofa at the Doctor outwitting cardboard monsters on a black-and-white TV, I was in awe of this towering hero and his adventures. The Doctor taught me some of the most valuable lessons of my childhood. Years later, it has been a joy to share his adventures with my own son. These tales enthral and educate, passing on crucial lessons about morality and the importance of learning. They will continue to do so for generations unless the BBC kills off the Doctor by casting a woman in the role and depriving small boys of his example for ever.","Current Doctor Who Matt Smith to quit role this Christmas after three series .

"In Jane Austen's time, manners maketh the man and being able to hold a captive and witty conversation was a virtue. So just what would the literary legend have made of today's society where the art of face-to-face communication is being lost to texting and Tweeting? No doubt she may have been as irked as Alex Haigh, 23, from Melbourne, Australia, who has set up 'A Stop Phubbing' campaign group to shame people who snub friends and family they are with in favour of checking their mobile phone. How rude! But many Brits have admitted they will talk on their phone during dinner and whilst in company . It's a social faux pas that a third of Britons polled admitted to in a recent survey, with more than a quarter (27 per cent) saying they would answer their phone in the middle of a face-to-face conversation. A third confessed that they would answer the phone in a restaurant and 19 per cent said they would while being served in a shop. Now Glamour magazine have imagined just how Austen would have satirised those in need of social etiquette when it comes to using their smartphone. Or, to paraphrase the novelist, how it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man (or woman) in possession of a good smart phone must be in want of manners. So here's 'what Jane would do' when it comes to using your mobile with good manners... One does not approve: Jane Austen was a stickler for social etiquette . One must avoid reading emails at mealtimes/social occasions. It is Phubbing of the highest degree . Or, as Jane might say: 'To sit in the shade on a fine day, and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment. But it is lost if one is more engrossed in that email Rebecca sent you of a cat falling into a bathtub.' One must not leave a missed call without an answerphone message or text . Or, as Jane might say: 'One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other. So how in Darcy's name do you expect us to know what you were calling about if there is but no intimation of your purpose?' One must use Whatsapp with great care - instead of sharing every waking thought or decision with a group . Or, as Jane might say: 'You have delighted us long enough.' One must not put non-verbal things on the phone - like a cat or newborn baby. Especially when you are calling them long distance. ('Hi Mr Snuffles. Our conversation is costing me 43p per minute') Or, as Jane might say: 'My idea of good company is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company.' One must always say goodbye when hanging up . Or as Jane might say: 'You hung up on me? Badly done, Emma!'","Art of conversation being lost .

"The Archbishop of Canterbury has turned down an invitation to be a patron of the RSPCA. The Most Rev Justin Welby declined the invitation from the animal charity as he has 'reluctantly decided to restrict his patronage', a spokesman for Lambeth Palace said. Dr Welby's predecessors Rowan Williams, George Carey, Robert Runcle and Donald Coggan all accepted honorary positions within the charity which was founded in 1824 by an Anglican Priest. Though he has 'great admiration' for the RSPCA, the Archbishop has 'reluctantly decided to restrict his patronage' a spokesman said . Lambeth Palace said: 'Since taking office in March this year, the Archbishop has received many kind invitations to patron a large variety of charities and good causes. 'Each invitation has been an honour, and in an ideal world he would like to accept them all. 'However, in light of the sheer volume of . the requests the Archbishop receives, and the many pressures on his . time and resources, he has reluctantly decided to restrict his patronage . to a manageable number of organisations based on where he feels his . support could be most beneficial.' Breaking with tradition: Dr Welby's predecessors, including Rowan Williams (left) and George Carey (right), accepted the position at the top of the charity. She added: 'The Archbishop has enormous admiration for the RSPCA and hopes to see its work thrive long into the future.' Last year the animal charity came under scrutiny after spending £326,000 on legal action against a fox hunt. Critics claimed the 'staggering' expense of bringing prosecution against the Heythrop Hunt in the Cotswolds was a waste of money donated by members of the public.

"Ronan Farrow, the biological son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, distinguishing him as one of the country's brightest thinkers. But given their estranged relationship, it is unlikely that Woody will be celebrating along with him. Ronan, 23, and Woody, 75, had a very public falling out when Woody began a romantic relationship with Mia's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, 34 years his junior. Young leader: Ronan Farrow has worked as a UNICEF spokesman and as a special appointment in the State Department . 'He's my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression,' Ronan has said. 'I cannot see him. I cannot have a relationship with my father and be morally consistent... I lived with all these adopted children, so they are my family. To say Soon-Yi was not my sister is an insult to all adopted children,' Ronan said of the relationship. Ronan has not seen much of Woody since his romantic relationship with Soon-Yi began in 1992 when Ronan was only five years old. Earlier bonds: Woody Allen and Mia Farrow walk as Mia carries their son Satchel, who later changed his name to Ronan . Together: Woody and Mia were a couple for 12 years before it ended in 1992 when Farrow found naked pictures of her adopted daughter in Woody's home . Following the discovery of naked photos of Soon-Yi in Woody's possession, Mia split from Woody and launched a messy custody battle over their three children. Prodigy: Ronan graduated from Bard College at 15 and Yale Law School at 21 . During the proceedings, which were closely followed, Mia claimed that Woody had sexually abused Ronan's sister Dylan, though the judge dismissed the claims because they were not substantiated. Mia was awarded full custody, and Woody was only allowed to have supervised visits with Ronan, originally named Satchel Ronan O'Sullivan Farrow. Woody was denied visits with Dylan, who later changed her name to Malone, and the couple's other adopted child Moshe, who changed his name to Moses, chose not to see Woody at all. In a PBS documentary titled American Masters, Woody is profiled in detail about his work and Soon-Yi is seen in clips. He never mentions Ronan in the entire three-and-a-half hour series, the second portion of which airs tonight. In a 2005 interview, Woody confirmed that he no longer has relationships with his three children from his relationship with Mia. 'Well, I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair. The strained relationship with his father doesn't seem to have held Ronan back, and he has been deemed a child prodigy. Controversial: Woody and Soon-Yi have been married since 1997 and have two adopted children together . He enrolled in Bard College at the age of 11, graduating at 15, and moving on to the prestigious Yale Law School and graduating by the age of 21- a year younger than most students finish their undergraduate degree. Since leaving school, Ronan has worked as a special advisor to the State Department, specifically focusing on the youth issues in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He has lent his face and name to charitable causes for years, serving as a UNICEF spokesperson from 2001 to 2009. After working under Hillary Clinton in the State Department, Ronan is now moves into the ranks of her husband, former president Bill Clinton, with Monday's Rhodes scholarship nomination. This year, 32 Americans have been nominated for the scholarship that will pay for the expenses of a year of study at Oxford University. Family outing: Ronan seen here with his mother and half-brother Fletcher Farrow Previn, was raised by his mother after she won full custody in 1992 . For a man known for his many neuroses, Woody Allen hasn't let that stop him from enjoying his love life. The famous New Yorker has been married three times, in addition to a number of multi-year relationships with actresses Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow. Ronan is his only biological son, but he has four adopted children- two that he adopted with Mia and two with his current wife Soon-Yi. He first married at age 19 to a 16-year-old girl named Harlene Rosen, and that marriage lasted for five years. Undeterred, Woody married actress Louise Lasser, and though they divorced three years later, she continued to work with him and was featured in three films after they ended their romantic relationship. The recent release of Diane Keaton's autobiography gives a glimpse into their partnership, and while it only lasted a year, their professional one lasted much longer with Ms Keaton serving as his muse for such films as Annie Hall. 'He was even better-looking in real life. He had a great body, and he was physically very graceful,' Keaton writes in her book. Keaton was not his first relationship that played out on the big screen, as Woody was rumored to have dated a 17-year-old student Stacey Nelkin in the 1970s and she was said to be the inspiration for his 1979 film Manhattan. Woody's relationship with Mia Farrow, which began in 1980, was quite the Hollywood pairing, ending in explosive Hollywood fashion. Mia had previously been married to Frank Sinatra and was nominated for a Golden Globe for her work in Rosemary's Baby, so she was famous in her own right when she and Woody started their relationship. The couple never married but were together for 12 years. Mia had three biological children and three adopted children from a previous relationship, one of which was Soon-Yi Previn who Mia adopted from Korea at the age of 8 years old. When she and Woody were together, the couple adopted two more children and she gave birth to their son Ronan. In 1982, Mia found naked photos of Soon-Yi, who was 21 at the time, on Woody's mantelpiece. This discovery prompted a torrid legal battle between Mia and Woody over the custody of their children. Woody was denied access to their daughter Dylan, allowed only supervised visits with Ronan, and their eldest son Moses was given the choice- and decided not to see his father. In a 2005 interview, Woody confirmed that he no longer has relationships with his three children with from his relationship with Mia. 'Well, I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair. In spite of the drama, Soon-Yi and Woody stayed together, eventually marrying in 1997. The couple have since adopted two children named Bechet and Manzie Tio, their names paying homage to two jazz musicians. 'The heart wants what it wants. There's no logic to those things,' Woody has said.","Ronan Farrow started college at 11, graduated Yale Law School by 21 and was an advisor to Hillary Clinton ."
"A U.S. naval drone has been found floating off the coast of the Philippines - hundreds of miles away from the nearest American military base. The fishermen who found the 10ft orange device originally reported that it could have been a bomb, prompting local officials to send munitions experts out into the sea. But when it was determined to be safe, the unmanned aerial vehicle was taken into the care of the Filipino navy. Found: This U.S. naval drone has been discovered floating in the waters off Masbate in the Philippines . Mystery: It is unclear how the military device ended up so far from any American base . The BQM-74E drone, marked 'Navy', was found by a diver and fishermen on Sunday off the coast of Masbate Island, towards the centre of the island chain. A Filipino naval officer said officials did not know how the UAV ended up near the island, more than 200 miles from the capital Manila. The drones are frequently used by the U.S. military as targets during training exercises and weapons testing. Recovery: Filipino fishermen bringing in the unmanned aerial vehicle on a boat on Sunday . Target: This type of drone is used in military drills and weapons testing rather than for combat or surveillance . Location: Masbate is in the middle of the island chain and has been plagued with communist guerrillas . A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Manila said officials were trying to work out whether the one which was found near Masbate had in fact been used by the Navy. She added that the drone was not armed and had not been used for surveillance. While the Philippines used to host multiple U.S. military bases, the American naval facility in the country was shut down more than two decades ago. The nearest U.S. Navy base to Masbate is the facility in the Japanese province of Okinawa, around 1,000 miles away. Taken: The device is now being looked after by the Filipino navy . Far off: The nearest U.S. naval base is in Okinawa in Japan, around 1,000 miles away . Masbate is in a region which has frequently been plagued by communist guerillas. U.S. counterterrorism troops are banned from operating on the ground in the country, but have used surveillance drones to help Filipino forces track down jihadists with links to Al Qaeda.

"Two members of Greece's Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn were slain and another wounded tonight in a drive-by shooting thought to be a revenge attack by anti-fascists.

Golden Dawn, whose senior members have expressed admiration for Hitler although they deny being neo-Nazi, rose from obscurity during Greece's financial crisis to win 18 out of 300 seats in Parliament in last year elections. It is now polling as the recession-plagued nation's third most popular political party with the support of around 12 per cent of the electorate. Party members and supporters, often clearly identifiable in black T-shirts and combat pants, have been suspected of beatings and stabbings across the country, usually of dark-skinned migrants. They are violently opposed by Greece's active far-left and anarchist extremist groups that have claimed a string of shootings and bombings that killed two policemen and a journalist. However, as yet there has been no no claim of responsibility for tonight's shootings and police said no arrests were made. The counter-terrorism squad has taken over the investigation. 'We are examining every possibility, but the indications are that it is a terrorist attack,' a police official said on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorised to be quoted publicly.

"Former German under-17 international Burak Karan has been killed while fighting for al-Qaeda in northern Syria . A former rising star of German football who played for the under-17 national squad has been killed after he abandoned his career to fight for al-Qaeda in the Syrian civil war against the Assad regime. Burak Karan played alongside famous names such as Sami Khedira, Kevin-Prince Boateng and Dennis Aogo. But five years ago he quit the game he loved and his country to become a radicalised Jihadist. On October 11, aged just 26, he was . blown to smithereens by a bomb dropped by an Assad air force jet on the . village of Azaz, near the Turkish border. An image of him clutching a Kalashnikov assault rifle appeared in tribute to him at the weekend on social networking sites. The . Turkish-German player-turned-rebel 'fought like a lion', according to . his commanders, who said: 'It was a pleasure to fight alongside him.' Karan . made his debut in the under-17 team in 2003 and trained with giants of . the Bundesliga including Leverkusen, Herthas BSC Berlin, Hamburger SV . and Hanover. He was described as a 'talent with great perspective' and was a close personal pal of Boateng. Thomas Hengen, Karan’s last coach at Alemannia Aachen said: 'He could have lived safely doing the job of a soccer player.' Karan made five appearances for the German under-16 team and played twice for the under-17 team. But on July 1, 2008, he ended his career aged just 20. His brother Mustafa said: 'Burak said money and career were not important things to him. Instead he searched the internet constantly for videos of war zones. He was desperate, full of compassion for the victims.' This image of Karan clutching a Kalashnikov assault rifle appeared as tribute on social networking sites. His commanders said he 'fought like a lion'. Karan is pictured playing for the German under-16 side against England at Sunderland's Stadium Of Light in 2002. He made five international appearances at that level and two for the under-17 team . In his hunt for a cause to fight for he . came on the radar of national intelligence agents for his contacts with a . known Islamist called Emrah Erdogan. Erdogan is currently facing trial . in Germany for his al-Qaeda links. Burak was radicalised in an al-Qaeda training camp in the Waziristan region of Pakistan. 'He spoke only of Jihad after that,' said his sister Zuhal. Germany’s . attorney general launched a criminal probe against him for supporting a . foreign terrorist organisation but he was never charged. With the outbreak of the civil war in Syria 2011 Karan found his destiny. After collecting relief donations and sending food and drugs he . travelled with his 23-year-old wife and two children to the Syrian . border in Turkey. Karan's brother Mustafa said he watched hours of footage of war zones and was 'full of compassion for the victims.' Pictured: Children walk past damage caused by shelling by Assad's forces in Damascus . A Free Syrian Army fighter aims his weapon Salaheddine neighbourhood. Karan is said to have fought for the rebels alongside al-Qaeda . His family believed he armed himself to protect aid convoys and his brother Mustafa has travelled there to find out 'the truth' about his brother - whether he was an al-Qaeda fanatic, or a man who died trying to make a difference as a humanitarian worker. The number of Germans travelling to Syria to fight in the civil war has increased sharply, Germany's domestic intelligence said this month. Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the Bundesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz since 2012 (BfV), said they knew of 220 German citizens fighting in Syria, but the actual number could be much higher, and had risen sharply this year.","Burak Karan killed in a bomb attack by Assad forces in Syria .

"A celebrity psychic who was a confidante of Michael Jackson has died after apparently predicting her own death. Jillian Lane moved from Wales to Los Angeles to become a clairvoyant to the stars, most famously holding consultations with Jackson when he was the world's biggest pop star. But she has now died from liver disease, after telling friends she knew that her death was imminent when she was first taken ill. Psychic: Jillian Lane, a clairvoyant used by Michael Jackson, has died of liver disease aged 53 . Ominous: Ms Lane apparently predicted that she would die after falling ill earlier this year . Ms Lane, 53, met Jackson when he was performing in London in 1997 and phoned a psychic helpline looking for insight into his future. She gained the trust of the singer, and he began flying her from Britain to Beverly Hills for private consultations. After the psychic settled in Los Angeles permanently, she claimed to be the number one celebrity clairvoyant in the star-studded city. Earlier this year she fell ill with liver disease - and she claimed to know that she would not survive the illness. After six weeks in an LA hospital, she asked to be flown home to Britain, and died at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Close: Ms Lane met Jackson when he was performing in London and called a psychic hotline . Mystic: Ms Lane claimed to have a number of spirit guides who gave her mysterious powers . 'It is tragic,' said close friend Suzanne Yessayan. 'She had predicted her own passing and on this occasion, I hoped her prediction was wrong. 'She was a very giving, caring person. She kept her mind open and her heart open. She had style, grace and charm. 'Working with Michael Jackson was her crowning glory.' In an interview shortly after Jackson's death, Ms Lane revealed details of her sessions with the star.'He'd just sit there telling me just how stressed out he was,' she said. 'Michael was a very sensitive guy and would hate what was usually written about him, especially around the time of his trial for child abuse in 2005. Glamorous: Ms Lane lived in Los Angeles where she claimed to be the number one celebrity psychic . 'The last time we met was sitting in my white Mercedes pouring his heart out, it was very sad. I really felt for him. 'The one thing he seemed to lack was the one thing money couldn't buy - genuine friendship. 'There are a lot of people out there who constantly tried to extort money off Michael, so much so he had to watch whose company he kept. 'I was never financially reimbursed for providing him with any of my services. He'd buy me plenty of gifts though - one time it was a beautiful diamond ring, the next time he'd send a huge bunch of flowers.' Ms Lane claimed to have a number of spirit guides, including a Scottish medic called Dr Mackintosh who apparently gave her healing powers. Her funeral is taking place today in her hometown of Barry, South Wales, with Dr Yessayan reading the eulogy.","Jillian Lane moved from Wales to LA after becoming close to Jackson .

All five previous killings which involved James Peters, of Scottsdale, Arizona, were ruled justifiable by prosecutors, as was a shooting in which the victim survived - and one even earned him a medal. Now, after the latest killing, which saw John Loxas, 50, cut down by a single rifle shot to the head on Tuesday while holding the baby, authorities are again scrutinising the 12-year police veteran. Investigation: James Peters, left, of Scottsdale, Arizona, cut down John Loxas, right, with a single rifle shot to the head on Tuesday while he was holding his nine-month old grandchild . ‘It's not a normal amount of officer-involved shootings. It's an anomaly in our department and in most departments,’ said Sergeant Mark Clark, a spokesman for the 435-officer force in Scottsdale. With its year-round sunshine, the Phoenix suburb has become a magnet for professionals, retirees and winter tourists, and is known for its fine resorts, golf courses and expensive second homes. The city of almost 220,000 people is considered one of the safest cities in metropolitan Phoenix. But it also has a grittier side, and the latest shooting happened in the working-class south end of the city. Officer Peters, whom police would not allow to be interviewed, was among six officers called to Mr Loxas’s home after a neighbour told 911 he was holding the baby and threatening them with a gun. Shooting: Officer Peters fired his scope-equipped police rifle as John Loxas leaned over and reached back into his Scottsdale house, authorities said. The grandchild was not hurt and police said he was trying to save its life . The policemen were getting ready to go . into the run-down, trash-strewn home and get the baby when Mr Loxas . opened the front door, still holding the child, and refused to come out, . police said. 'It's not a normal amount of officer-involved shootings. It's an anomaly in our department and in most departments' Sergeant Mark Clark, Scottsdale Police . Officer Peters fired his scope-equipped police rifle as Mr Loxas leaned over and reached back into the house, . authorities said. The baby was not hurt and police said Officer Peters was trying to . save its life. Mr Loxas wasn’t armed when shot, but the loaded handgun he was allegedly brandishing earlier was found tucked into a couch feet away and a loaded shotgun was also discovered nearby, police said. An Arizona Republic list confirmed by police said Officer Peters's first shooting was in 2002, when he was one of three SWAT officers who wounded a man during a standoff in a domestic violence case. Between 2003 and 2010, he was involved . in five fatal shootings. In some, he acted alone. In others, fellow . officers also fired. The Maricopa County Attorney's Office ruled them . all justifiable . Probe: Sergeant Mark Clark, a spokesman for the 435-officer force in Scottsdale, admitted that the number of fatal shootings by Officer Peters is 'an anomaly in our department and in most departments' Officer Peters even received the . department's medal of valour for killing a man who was holding a grocery . store worker hostage at gunpoint. But police did a review of all of the . shootings in 2010. 'Seven shootings is a hell of a lot' Mike Rains, California lawyer . ‘Nothing indicated there was any sort . of issue with his training or assignments that would be causing this,’ Sergeant Clark said. ‘You take each individual case. His reaction was . within policy.’ This time, the department will . examine the same questions again, in an investigation the chief said . will probably take weeks. The findings will then be turned over to the . county attorney. Mike Rains, of San Francisco, California is a lawyer who represented officers involved in hundreds of shootings in the past 30 years. He said any officer with so many shootings deserves extra scrutiny. ‘Seven shootings is a hell of a lot,’ Mr . Rains said, arguing that Officer Peters is either very aggressive in . taking calls that end up requiring him to shoot or he is quicker on the . trigger than he should be. Movie: The story of Officer Peters has been compared to the 1971 film Dirty Harry, starring Clint Eastwood as police inspector Harry Callahan, left. He is pictured with Reni Santoni, who played Chico Gonzalez . Maria Haberfeld, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, New York, said the four shootings he was in as a member of the SWAT team should be taken out of the equation. 'Because of his background in SWAT, he would have a predisposition maybe, maybe, to use his gun in a more assertive manner than his colleagues' Maria Haberfeld, criminal justice expert . This is because SWAT officers are the ones most likely to use deadly force. But the three remaining shootings are still higher than the average of a couple of times, Dr Haberfeld said. ‘Because of his background in SWAT, he would have a predisposition maybe, maybe, to use his gun in a more assertive manner than his colleagues,’ Dr Haberfeld added. But she noted the shootings were ruled justified, suggesting he is ‘a true professional’. She added: ‘So I don't see so much the concern that the public should have or the department should have.’ The story of Officer Peters has been compared to the 1971 film Dirty Harry, starring Clint Eastwood as police inspector Harry Callahan - a San Francisco cop who has little regard for the rules. Not everyone agrees that Officer Peters always acts appropriately. Jason Leonard, a lawyer in Fort Myers, Florida, represented the family of a man killed in 2006 by him and another officer. He is worried the city backs Officer Peters even when his actions are questionable. ‘My concern is that he seems to shoot first and ask questions later and has been supported in this policy,’ he said. 'My concern is that he seems to shoot first and ask questions later and has been supported in this policy' Jason Leonard, lawyer . ‘I don't think he's going after innocent citizens,’ Mr Leonard added. ‘However, if you find yourself in a precarious situation, he seems to err on the side of escalating the violence.’ Kevin Hutchings got into a fight with a friend in August 2006, then left and drove to his house in nearby Mesa. Officers had the friend call Mr Hutchings at his house, and police went there, Mr Leonard said. While Mr Hutchings was talking on the phone, police cut the power to flush him out. Mr Hutchings came outside with a gun to investigate. Police said he shot at officers and they shot back. Mr Leonard said cops never announced their arrival. The family accepted a $75,000 city payout.","All previous shootings by Arizona officer James Peters ruled justifiable .

"Zoe Bottrill was just 27 when her mother first noticed she was becoming forgetful and kept losing things. By the time she was 29, the mother-of-two had been diagnosed with dementia and was unable to look after her young daughters. She has now been in the final stages of the disease for five years and spends her days lying in the foetal position in a specially adapted chair. Zoe Bottrill (pictured before she developed dementia) started to become forgetful and to lose things when she was 27 and had just had her second baby. She was diagnosed with dementia when she was just 29 . At just 42, she is unable to move her limbs, can only consume liquids, is unaware of what is going on around her and has not spoken for four years. She is also profoundly deaf. Her mother, Julie Talbot, 63, told MailOnline: ‘When she was diagnosed I felt utter devastation. I still do. ‘It is very difficult to understand – when someone gets ill and you know it is terminal usually it does not usually go on so long. You have the right to grieve. ‘I grieve for the person she was but we still have a person who isn’t my Zoe. ‘Her life is just one long nightmare.’ Ms Bottrill, who now lives in a care home in Ashford, has two children - Gemma, 20, and Louise, 16. Ms Bottrill is now 42 and cannot move her limbs, is profoundly deaf, exists on a liquid diet and has not spoken for four years . She started to develop symptoms of dementia when Louise was a baby. Her mother says the first signs were that she was forgetful, kept losing things, was putting things in the wrong place as was ‘not really with it’. However, as her daughter was only 27, dementia was the last thing on her mind. Mrs Talbot said: ‘You associate dementia with older people. It wasn’t something that crossed my mind. ‘She had just had her second child so I thought she was just struggling to get into a routine. ‘I thought she might have had postnatal depression – you try to come up with answers as you just don’t know.’ In 1999, Ms Bottrill had an argument with her partner and tried to throw a ladder at him. As a result, she was committed and spent time in hospital while doctors tried to establish what was wrong with her. She was eventually released but her family soon realised she could not cope. Mrs Talbot said: ‘The three generations of daughters were all supposed to be going on holiday together, but Zoe decided she did not want to go, so she stayed with my mum, Ruby. ‘Me and the two kids went away, but Zoe forgot where they were. ‘She kept wandering off saying she was looking for them and couldn’t find them.’ As a result, she was taken to the Abraham Cowley Hospital in Wimbledon, a specialist neurological hospital. There, doctors carried out numerous tests and eventually diagnosed her with dementia. Mrs Talbot said: ‘We were just told that’s how it is - no one could really answer my questions. Ms Bottrill's mother, Julie Talbot (right), says at first she thought her daughter had postnatal depression because she had just had her second baby, Louise (left). Louise is now 16 and has never known her mother without dementia . ‘I . have felt all the emotions sadness, anger, frustration but most of all I . feel sad, it’s a living nightmare, I visit what looks like my daughter . but it’s not her, not the person she was.’ As . a result, Ms Bottrill’s young daughters went to live with their great . grandmother, Ruby, who was already in her 70s, and Ms Bottrill was moved . to a rehabilitation home in Guildford. She spent 18 months at the home before the Alzheimer’s Society helped her family to find her a place in an early-onset dementia unit in Ashford. She has been there since May 2005. Ms Bottrill’s daughter, Louise, who now lives with her older sister, Gemma, said: ‘As I was only around two years old at the time it’s just something I have simply grown up with, for as long as I can remember my mum has had dementia, I don’t really know anything different. People diagnosed with dementia before they are 65 are said to have early-onset dementia. There are more than 17,000 people in the UK who are known to have early-onset dementia, but there are thought be a lot more who have not yet been diagnosed. Young people with dementia often struggle to get a diagnosis because of a lack of awareness of the condition in young people. They are often misdiagnosed as having depression or as being stressed. Symptoms include memory problems, poor judgement, mood changes, disorientation and speech and language problems. Source: Alzheimer's Society . ‘It is still difficult at times but as I have no recollection of living with my mum I just get on with life.’ She added: ‘She is in the late stages now, she sleeps a lot of the time and cannot really move the lower half of her body. She doesn’t know who I am but I still go and see her.’ Director of Research and Development at the Alzheimer’s Society Dr Doug Brown said: ‘It is estimated around 17,000 people in the UK are living with dementia under the age of 65, but to be diagnosed at such a young age is incredibly rare. ‘If you are worried about any problems with memory or thinking, at any age, you should always go to your GP.’ Last month, Louise and a friend took part in a 10km Memory Walk in Dorking to raise money for the Alzheimer’s Society. She is hoping to raise money - to help pay for research - and awareness about the condition. She said: ‘Raising awareness is so important, people are always surprised to find out my mum has dementia as she is so young, I want to show people that it can happen to anyone, it’s not just something that affects older people.’ To donate, visit www.justgiving.com/louises-memory-walk10 .

"Aged just 12, maths genius Xavier Gordon-Brown is almost certainly the youngest university student in Britain. Although he is still too young for Facebook and is only allowed a mobile phone for emergencies, he’s just embarked on a maths degree with the Open University. He is already studying weighty and complex concepts such as abstract structures, vector calculus and  Newtonian mechanics in his spare time – when he’s not either at school, practising his musical instruments or playing football. Whizz kid: Xavier Gordon-Brown, aged 12, is the youngest university student in Britain after taking up a degree in maths . Xavier, who celebrated his 12th . birthday last month, knew his times tables before he was four and could . do double-digit mental arithmetic before starting school. He achieved an A* in his maths GCSE when he was eight. By the age of ten he had his A-level and could recite and memorise the first 2,000 digits of  the mathematical ratio Pi. Young prodigy: Although he is still too young for Facebook and is only allowed a mobile phone for emergencies, brainy Xavier has already started a maths degree . He manages to fit his degree into the . free hours between practising for grade eight on the clarinet, piano . and violin, learning three languages and playing football with his . friends every Sunday. Busy boy: Xavier is teaching himself Latin at home outside of full-time school, university lectures and playing sports . Despite his intellect, Xavier has to be accompanied to his lectures on Monday evenings by his mother because of his age. But even in a room full of students twice his age he is still top of the class. His mother Erica, of Haywards Heath, . West Sussex said: ‘He absolutely loves it. 'It’s one of those things we . thought about for a while, but seeing how much he enjoys it has made it . all worthwhile. ‘People make a lot out of keeping . children in their age group, but it is good for him to be among his . intellectual equals too. 'When he’s with kids his own age he’s fine, but . when it comes to maths he needs to be with people on his intellectual . level.’ Mrs Gordon-Brown added: ‘He’s at . school full time and then goes to Open University lectures in East . Grinstead two to three times a month. 'When he goes to his lectures he . has to have an adult with him because of his age. ‘When I go I absolutely don’t understand a word of what’s going on. ‘But he’s not falling behind.

"Viva Forever! The Musical set to open at the Piccadilly Theatre on December 11 . It's been four years since they reunited for their Return Of The Spice Girls tour. And following months of speculation whether or not they would join forces again, all five members of the Spice Girls got together in London today to announce details of a West End musical based on their songs. Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm, Melanie Brown and Geri Halliwell went back to where it all began - the St Pancras Hotel in London, where they filmed their Wannabe video in 1996. Scroll down for video . Reunited! (L-R) Melanie Brown, Melanie Chisholm, . Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton and Victoria Beckham reunite for the Viva . Forever! launch at St Pancras Renaissance Hotel in London . Just like the hotel, which has since been restored and is looking a lot better these days, few would disagree the girl group are also looking much improved from their '90s heyday. The musical, entitled Viva Forever!, will tell the story of 'a beautiful, talented girl and her best friends who get swept up in the obsession of today's TV celebrity culture'. The musical 'charts her journey into the world of overnight fame and its impact on her relationships with her mother and the friends she thought she'd have forever'. Victoria, arguably the most successful financially since leaving the group, flew in specially from Los Angeles. Write caption here . Not a tracksuit or platform trainer in sight: The five-piece are fortunately a lot more sophisticated these days . Will you see the Spice Girls musical? Will you see the Spice Girls musical? Now share your opinion . Looking more military than 'Posh', the mother-of-four, 38, wore a black dress and peep-toe knee-high boots. However, while her former bandmates had wide smiles, Victoria kept her usual stony-faced demeanour. Mel B, 37, who looked far from 'Scary' in . a grey shift dress and spiked Christian Louboutin heels, had flown in . from her new home in Australia via LA. Geri, 39, . and Emma, 36, were going for girlie looks in short dress and killer heels, . with the ex-Ginger Spice appearing to be wearing the same Jimmy Choo . strappy sandals worn by the Duchess of Cambridge recently, albeit in . gold instead of silver. Back to where it all began: The group famously filmed the video for their debut single Wannabe at the same hotel in 1996 . On a budget: The Spice Girls in their Wannabe video when the hotel was out of use in 1996 . Mel C, 38, appeared to have left her Sporty Spice persona firmly in the past with a floaty white Ane maxi dress, which has also been worn by Karen Gillan and Kylie Minogue. The five women had joined forces to announce details of Viva Forever, a musical based on their songs and written by comedienne Jennifer Saunders and producer by Judy Craymer, the theatrical impresario behind the success of Mamma Mia! Speaking at the press conference, Craymer hailed the group: 'I loved what the Spice Girls did for women's confidence. There's something very empowering about them.' Saunders, who cameoed in their film Spice World, said: 'The second I knew this project was up for grabs I rang my agent and said I had to be involved.'

Fighting for attention: The press conference saw the five bandmembers jostling to speak . Very serious: Victoria looked miserable in comparison to smiling Emma and Geri . On Saturday, Victoria hinted: 'Big event next week, what should I wear?? 'Excited to be travelling to London tomorrow!!! packing!!!!'

Time has been good to them: Mel C, Emma and Mel B all look gorgeous in their demure ensembles . Over the past few years, Mel B has often hinted of a possible reunion for the girl group, but it is yet to come to fruition. However, Victoria was said to be against the idea because she is focused on her career as a fashion designer. In March, Mel C dismissed speculation they would reunite for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert: 'Not true. It was an honour to be asked (for the Jubilee concert), but not everyone is comfortable about doing it so we have to respect each other’s feelings about that.' Chatterbox: Mel B distracted the group as they pose up a storm .

"Claims: A Muslim member of staff from Al-Madinah School. Some other members of staff are claiming they have been asked to wear headscarves . Teachers at an Islamic school have complained that they are being ordered to wear the hijab – even if they are not Muslim. Employees at the Al-Madinah free school say they are ‘concerned’ by its practices, which include banning non-halal food and forcing female pupils as young as four to sit at the back of the class away from boys. Female members of staff, some of whom are not Muslims, say they have been told to sign new contracts which force them to wear the hijab. These also ban them from wearing jewellery or bringing non-halal food on to the school’s premises in Derby. One woman, who had been interviewed for a position, claimed she was told she was not allowed to shake hands with male teachers to avoid ‘insult’. Another staff member, speaking anonymously to the Mail, said the school was ‘like being in Pakistan’. She said: ‘Girls are treated very separately from boys, the girls sit at the back of the classroom. ‘Boys go and eat first at lunchtime and then the girls are allowed to go. ‘It is like being in any school in Pakistan. That is why it was founded, that is the idea.’ The decision to make all female members of staff, regardless of religious beliefs, wear the Islamic headscarf – which covers the head but not the face – was apparently introduced over the summer. But some female members of staff have been spotted removing the headwear immediately after stepping out of the school building during their lunch hour. And around half a dozen teachers at the free school, who could face losing their jobs if they refuse to comply with the rules, are now seeking legal advice from the National Union of Teachers. Regional NUT officer Nick Raine said: ‘We are very worried about the school and the education of the 200 children there. ‘There are worries over practices . concerning the discrimination between male and female pupils in the . school, with the girls being told to sit at the back of the class . regardless of whether they can see the board properly.' He added: ‘It’s one thing to have a dress code which we can challenge and quite another to build it into a contract. Banned: Non-Halal food is thought to have also been banned at the school, some of which is based in Norman House in Derby, pictured. ‘The school is publicly accountable so there needs to be a greater level of transparency.’ As . a free school, Al-Madinah operates outside local authority control but . still qualifies for government funding. It was set up in September last . year. Allegations: The National Union of Teachers have said they are concerned about the school, the Midland House campus of which is shown above . A hijab is typically worn by a Muslim . female beyond the age of puberty in the presence of adult males - it . covers the head and chest, but not the face. It . not only refers to the physical body covering, but also a state of . mind, where al-hijab refers to ‘the veil which separates man or the . world from God’. Hijab can also be used to refer to the seclusion of women from men in public. Most . often, it is worn by Muslim women as a symbol of modesty, privacy and . morality. If differs from a burqa, a veil that covers the entire body . head and face, and the niqab which covers the entire head and face . except for the eyes. Sue Arguile, branch secretary of the Derby National Union of Teachers, said the new demands stem from the Al-Madinah’s free school status. She said: ‘We have always had a number of concerns about this school ever since it was first set up, as essentially they can do what they like. ‘There is no buffer between them and the state and no protection for staff and pupils. ‘Free schools set their own rules, curriculums and dress codes, and so long as pupils and staff are aware of them before joining, then there is no upset. ‘But forcing people to agree to contractual changes or face being out of work could breach employment law.’ Former head teacher Andrew Cutts-McKay, who left after less than a year in the post, previously said the school would ‘honour all faiths’. However he admitted that he thought at least half of the school’s pupils would be Muslims. The school’s acting principal Stuart Wilson said: ‘I have been told not to speak about the school’s policy.’ But he added: ‘I have not received any complaints from members of staff.’","Female staff at Al-Madinah School, Derby, say they have been told to sign new contracts which force them to wear the hijab .

"A multimillionaire romance novelist has testified at the trial of a con-artist psychic who allegedly defrauded her of $17million. Jude Deveraux, who has had 30 books on the New York Times bestseller list, was in court in West Palm Beach, Florida on Tuesday at the criminal trial of her long-time clairvoyant Rose Marks. Ms Deveraux first sought the help of Marks in the 1990s following the death of her eight-year-old son in a motorcycle accident and in the midst of a painful divorce. Scammed: Multimillionaire author Jude Deveraux testified in Florida last September that a clairvoyant she trusted stole millions from her . Fraudster: Nancy Marks, who operated under the name of Joyce Michaels, allegedly preyed on people's weaknesses to make money from them . The 65-year-old author said at the time she met Marks, whom she knew as Joyce Michaels, she was suicidal and trying to get out of a 'horrible, terrible' marriage, according to the Sun-Sentinel. Ms Deveraux told the court that she did not believe in psychic powers but was really looking for someone to listen to her problems. She met Marks for the first time in a studio in midtown Manhattan where the psychic claimed to work from a 'special room' in St Patrick's Cathedral on 5th Avenue. After several meetings, Marks told the writer that she would help her achieve a 'peaceful divorce' - for a fee of $1,200. Although the author did not believe in Marks' psychic powers, she came to trust her after several of her prophecies appeared to come true. Marks managed to accurately predict that Ms Deveraux's husband would file for divorce - down to the hour that he would do so. Dubious: The clairvoyant told Ms Deveraux that her $1million 'deposit' for psychic work would be kept for safety at St Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan . Bestsellers: Deveraux has sold more than 60 million copies of her romance novels to amass a multimillion-dollar fortune . The clairvoyant also told the author to leave her apartment for a few days and change her locks because her estranged husband would show up. Ms Deveraux told the Florida court today that this turned out to be the case and 'staff at her apartment building told her that her husband unexpectedly showed up and was angrier than anyone they'd ever seen', according to the Sun-Sentinel. Marks later asked the author to hand over $1million which she would need to carry out her meditations - but that it would be returned to her. The psychic told Ms Deveraux that the money would be kept in drawers in the cathedral room of St Patrick's. The author was told that 'money was evil' by the psychic and would attract evil if kept in her bank account. Marks, 62, along with other family . members has been charged with defrauding $25million from clients through . a network of psychic stores in Fort Lauderdale and Manhattan. Swindle: One of the Florida storefronts allegedly used by the psychic fraudsters - they also had locations in Manhattan . Most of that money - $17million  - is believed to have come from Ms Deveraux who amassed the vast fortune by selling 60 millions copies of her romance tales, which have titles such as Moonlight In The Morning, The Scent Of Jasmine and Scarlet Nights. She is expected to be on the stand for several days. At the time of Marks' arrest in 2011, prosecutors said ten 'psychic readers' from Fort Lauderdale allegedly conned customers out of a . total of $40million, telling them that unless they handed over cash and . valuables, they would be haunted. At the time, prosecutors refused to identify the author who they said lost her eight-year-old son in a motorcycle accident, but several sources with knowledge of the case has named Ms Deveraux. The author, whose real name is Jude Gilliam Montassir, wrote on her MySpace page that she 'adopted a son, Sam Alexander Montassir… My son died at age 8 in a motorcycle accident.' Police swooped on the soothsayers, who are all related by blood or marriage in August 2011 after a huge cross-state investigation dubbed 'Operation Crystal Ball'. More than 400 rings, 100 watches and 200 necklaces – many of them from Cartier, Tiffany & Co and Gucci – were seized. They all billed themselves as fortune tellers, clairvoyants and spiritual advisers and operated from shops in Fort Lauderdale. The authorities said that many customers came to them as a desperate last resort, for instance hoping that they could be cured of a disease or put in touch with a deceased loved one. It's alleged, however, that they were . then warned that only by parting with money and possessions could they . avoid being haunted or befalling terrible bad luck. Customers were promised that their money would be returned once it was cleansed of evil spirits, but according to the indictment it was kept for personal used by the fortune tellers. Victims included a woman with a brain tumour who was told she would receive 'positive energy'. She was reportedly left  unemployed and in danger of losing her apartment. A person in Japan handed over $496,000 to the psychic readers and a man from Denmark sent about $186,000. Mr Bardfield told the court that many of the victims were vulnerable. 'If you understood the severity of what these victims were going through, it makes more sense,' he said. The defendants are facing 47 counts of wire fraud and face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.","Jude Deveraux, who has had 30 books on the New York Times bestseller list, testified at the criminal trial of Rose Marks ."
"Gardener Richard Hope with his dog Button in front of his British record 26ft sunflower grown in his garden in Wigan . It has been one of the wettest and most miserable summers on record. Yet gardener Richard Hope has still managed to grow Britain’s tallest ever sunflower. It appears the plant’s love of . sunshine and hot, tropical conditions hasn’t stopped it thriving despite . the poor weather - or maybe it was just striving to get a little closer . to some elusive sunshine. Now the giant specimen is agonisingly short of scooping the world record for the tallest sunflower. Standing 26ft tall, it is currently just . four inches off the world record of 26 ft 4in, set by German Hans-Peter . Schiffer in 2009. But Mr Hope, 67, of Wigan, who has been growing giant sunflowers for 30 years, is still optimistic of stealing the crown. He said: ‘This sunflower has been 30 . years in the making. For as long as I can remember I’ve grown a taller . one each year. It has got to the stage now where I’ve got this super . strain generating giant ones.’ Mr Hope has battled driving rain, . overcast skies and early frosts to grow the giant flower - which stands . at over two storeys high - on the side of his terraced home. And even as winter begins to set in and temperatures fall away, the towering sunflower is still growing. He said: ‘I’ve not given up hope of it . breaking the world record, but with the nights drawing in and the . weather changing, the sunflower will begin to shut up shop soon. ‘It is frustrating as we are only a day or two of sunshine away from it growing the five inches needed. All we can do is hope.’ Mr . Hope, a retired railway worker, claims his secret weapon is using Grow . Organic manure, shovelling 15 bags of the stuff on the roots. And spending hours each day tending to them, Mr Hope has become a force to be reckoned with in giant vegetable competitions. Mr Hope has battled driving rain and early frosts to grow the giant flower - which stands at over two storeys high on the side of his terraced home . The giant flower is an agonising four inches off the world record (26 ft 4in), set by German Hans-Peter Schiffer in 2009 . He has previously held a host of world records - including the biggest swede, heaviest leek and longest parsnip. And while still in the hunt for the sunflower record, he has already smashed the British one. Mr Hope added: ‘It is a personal best . even if I don’t make the world record. The old British record is only . 23ft, so it is miles higher than that.’ The retired railway worker claims his secret weapon is using Grow Organic manure, shovelling 15 bags on the roots . Mr Hope has previously held world records for the biggest swede, heaviest leek and longest parsnip . He first began growing sunflowers 30 years ago when a friend gave him some seeds and he cross pollinated the seeds to achieve this gigantic strain of the flower. He said the secret to growing the monstrous sunflowers was starting them off in a greenhouse and caring for the plants on a daily basis throughout the summer, ensuring they don’t dry out.","Richard Hope has smashed the record for Britain's tallest ever sunflower .

"Maxim magazine has provoked outrage after it named ex-murder suspect Amanda Knox one of 2012’s sexiest women. The popular men's magazine included the American student in its 'Hot 100' countdown alongside the most beautiful celebrities in the world, including pop star Katy Perry and actress Megan Fox. Knox, 24, spent four years in jail after being found guilty of killing British student Meredith Kercher in November 2007, but she was cleared last October. Appropriate? The attractive American was voted one of the most beautiful women of 2012 after drawing huge levels of attention for her looks during her  incarceration . Popular imagination: The men's magazine draws attention to its controversial choice with an an introduction that refers to 'sexy movie stars and murder suspects' Her high-profile trial and time behind bars was characterised by glamorous photos of the pretty ex student and endless comment on her appearance as well as her case. A light-hearted caption under the picture of her reads: 'Foxy Knoxy's murder rap was overturned after she spent four years in a hardcore Italian prison. 'We're guessing she hasn't hit the Olive Garden [a popular Italian food chain] since coming back.' The list was introduced with the flippant words: 'From movie stars to murder suspects to a cartoon, here are the sexy results.' Twitter users attacked the controversial move, with one tweeting: 'AMANDA KNOX Y'ALL ... Maxim Hot 100 list is once again criminally foolish.' Famous faces: Israeli model Bar Rafaeli topped Maxim's 'Hot 100' while Katy Perry came in at number four . Another added: 'Yeah...nothing sexier than being accused of killing your roommate while studying abroad!' The furore has eclipsed arguments over rival magazine FHM's 'sexiest women' list, which caused heated debate when X-Factor judge Tulisa was named number one shortly after her sex-tape scandal. Israeli model Bar Rafaeli, Leonardo Di Caprio's ex, topped Maxim's list, while Knox came in at 92, in between West Wing star Claire Coffee and U.S. TV personality La La Anthony. The list in the U.S. edition of Maxim was compiled from readers' votes, with the magazine writing: 'Our fellow Americans: As we're reminded every four years, democracy is the cornerstone upon which our great land is built. British beauties: Model and actress Rosie Huntington-Whitely, left, and Harry Potter star Emma Watson came high on the list . 'That's why this year, for the first time in Hot 100 history, we let you, the readers of Maxim, weigh in on who should comprise the definitive list of the world's most beautiful women. 'From movie stars to murder suspects to a cartoon, here are the sexy results. God bless America!' Model and Transformers star Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Underworld actress Kate Beckinsale made 11 and 12. Pippa Middleton also made the list at 81, coming in well behind Harry Potter star Emma Watson at 21. Comedian Stephen Colbert was ranked at 69, becoming the first man to make the list. Family Guy cartoon character Lois Griffin came 85th.",Outraged Twitter users label 24-year-old's inclusion 'criminally foolish'
"Julian Assange has been confined to the Ecuadorean embassy in London for more than a year - and it appears that he may be going slightly stir crazy. The fugitive WikiLeaks founder has appeared a bizarre music video combining rap and soft rock to humorously push his party's candidates in the forthcoming Australian election. The clip shows Assange dressed up as an 80s rocker and shot in soft-focus black and white as he delivers his political message to the tune of one of the country's biggest hits. Scroll down to watch the video . Surreal: Julian Assange dressed up in stereotypical Australian clothing for an online music video . 80s style: The WikiLeaks boss performs a parody cover version of You're the Voice by John Farnham . WikiLeaks hit the headlines once again last week, when Bradley Manning - now known as Chelsea - was jailed for 35 years for leaking U.S. government secrets to Assange. But the website boss, who is wanted on rape claims in Sweden, showed a light-hearted demeanour in the music video which was posted on YouTube yesterday. The clip was produced by Juice Rap News, an Australian duo who produce regular videos in which they comment on the news using comic rap lyrics. Their latest offering deals with Australia's federal election, which takes place next week, comparing the poll battle to the medieval-themed TV show Game of Thrones. Candidate: The video was made to promote the WikiLeaks Party which was founded by Assange . The first few minutes of the video feature a merciless parody of the two principal election candidates, Labor's Kevin Rudd and the Liberal Tony Abbott, as well as former prime minister Julia Gillard. The video's presenter seems unimpressed with the mainstream candidates - but at that point, the camera cuts to the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge, West London, where Assange has been staying since the Supreme Court ruled that he should be deported to Sweden to stand trial in June 2012. The co-presenter refers to Assange's bid for the Australian senate, where he hopes to represent his own WikiLeaks Party, but suggests that the eccentric-looking fugitive 'needs a makeover' to appeal to 'all the Sheilas and blokes back home in Oz'. The clip then skips to show Assange, dressed in an Australia sports top with a tie around his head decorated with the national flag. He throws out stereotypical Aussie phrases such as 'Good on ya!' and 'Bloody oath!' Interview: The segment of the video featuring Assange was filmed at the Ecuadorean embassy in London . Rivals: Assange croons out his tune in front of actors playing election candidates Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott . Then the video becomes even more surreal, as it segues into a parody of 1986 soft rock hit You're the Voice by John Farnham, one of Australia's best-known songs. Assange is filmed from side-on in black and white as he croons while wearing a long blonde wig, while in the background there are clips from videos released in the past by WikiLeaks. The political lyrics include: 'We've got to make things leak, so we can get much bolder - oh we're all wire-tapped now, we're all being fed lies.' He sings, 'Not long till we get all the rats out,' as the actors playing Rudd, Abbott and Gillard appear behind him. When he reaches the chorus, 'You're the light that the world's demanding,' Assange spins around and appears in a line with multiple versions of himself. Highlights: The fugitive performs in front of images from videos released by WikiLeaks . Plea: The founder is campaigning for greater openness in government as well as peace . In the credits of the video, he is listed as 'Julian Assange as Julian Assange (really)' - but the 42-year-old runaway did not actually record his own vocals. The WikiLeaks party is fielding just six candidates in the election on September 7, including Assange himself who is running for the senate in Victoria. If elected, he would probably be unable to take his seat, as he cannot leave the embassy without being arrested by British police and deported to Sweden. He has been on the run since two Swedish women accused him of sexually assaulting him in August 2010.","Assange teams up with online comedians for election rap video .

"A flesh-eating drug that is popular in Russia and more deadly than heroin has reached St. Louis, with doctors confirming a case in the American Journal of Medicine. Doctors at St Mary's Heath Center have come forward with the story of a patient they treated in December 2012. The 30-year-old man's finger had rotted, turned black and fallen off. He also had severe ulcers across both thighs. The drug addict told doctors that eight months earlier he started using a substance called Krokodil - the Russian name for crocodile - that got its name from turning users skin green and scaly. America's first known case of Krokodil: Doctors in St Louis have written an article for the American Journal of Medicine about treating a man in December 2012 who said he had been using the drug for eight months. One of his fingers had fallen off and he had severe open sores on his thighs (pictured) which is Krokodil's leading sympton . The 30-year-old drug addict arrived here, at the SSM St. Mary's Heath Center in Richmond, St. Louis, for assistance. If left untreated he would have contracted gangrene and died . According to STL Today the man said he had turned to the drug because he could no longer afford his $300-a-day heroin habit. Desomorphine, the drug’s official name, is made by cooking prescription painkillers with contaminants such as gasoline, alcohol, paint thinner or lighter fluid. The drug produces a high similar to heroin but is much cheaper to make and more addictive. It has become a public health threat in Russia, where it originated, with an estimated 100,000 users. The federal Drug Enforcement Administration has not confirmed any cases in the U.S. since two were reported in 2004 but did put out an information sheet in October for doctors and law enforcement officers to watch for potential signs of Krokodil abuse. Dr. Dany Thekkemuriyil and Dr. Unnikrishnan Pillai treated the drug addict that was using Krokodil . Dr. Dany Thekkemuriyil and Dr. Unnikrishnan Pillai, who treated the St. Louis man, said they started researching the drug in order to warn the public. They then a wrote an articale the respected American Journal of Medicine, which is expected to be released next month. 'Our case if the first to be published in a recognized medical journral,' Thekkemuriyil said. 'It eats people from the inside. 'It kills you from the inside.' 'We wanted people to be aware of this very deadly poisonous drug and we want people to stay away from this.' There have been other reported case around the United States, including a poison control center in Pheonix and a hospital in Joliet, Illinois, but none were known as early as this case. Other victim: The drug was first found in Russia where many- including blind victim Margarita Schelkunova, pictured- came forward after receiving treatment for the drug in Siberia after using it for seven years . In Russia around 30,000 people die from the affects of the drug every year yet it is thought about a quarter of a million people in the country are now hooked on the poison. Addiction is spreading among young people and even those who manage to quit come away disfigured for life. Margarita Schelkunova, 28, and her husband became hooked on the drug seven years ago. Even though Miss Schelkunova is now clean, she has lost her sight and has been diagnosed with cancer and HIV with only weeks to live. Drug addict Tanya started using Krokodil after a boyfriend got her hooked on heroin . Devastating: Margarita Schelkunova is now clean but she has been left blind and has cancer and HIV . However, one British doctor believes he may have came across a case in the UK. Dr Allan Harris, a GP in Gloucester, wrote in an article for The Independent that the man was homeless and in his 30s. 'There was essentially a crater in his arm and you could see the bone and tendons,' he wrote. 'It is hugely addictive and potent and can be cooked up in 30 minutes. It's only a matter of time before we start seeing it in Britain. It is not a case of 'if' but 'when'. Norman Baker, minister for crime prevention, told The Sun: 'Desomorphine - krokodil - is controlled as a Class A drug in the UK because it is dangerous. 'We are determined to tackle the illicit drug trade which can have such a destructive impact on the lives of so many.' Krokodil's medical name is desomorphine and is created by mixing a raft of ingredients, including codeine and gasoline. There are millions of users in Russia and the epidemic began in Siberia and the Russian Far East. The drug causes flesh to rot from the inside out and the addict's skin becomes scaly, like a crocodile's, hence the name. Blood vessels burst and the surrounding tissue dies. Gangrene and amputations are a common result and sometimes bone can be exposed. The high lasts for about an hour and a half and the drug can be up to 10 times cheaper than heroin.","Krokodil is a homemade concoction that originated in Russia and is 10 times cheaper than heroin .

"Legal battle: Adriana Ferreyr, who is suing billionaire George Soros, is herself being sued for falsely accusing a man of rape . The former lover of billionaire George Soros, who is suing the mogul for not buying her an apartment, will be named in a lawsuit for falsely accusing a man of rape. Actress Adriana Ferreyr, 31, filed a $50million lawsuit against the 82-year-old mogul in August 2011 after he allegedly broke a promise to buy her a $1.9m home, and is now to be sued herself. The $5million lawsuit alleges Ms Ferreyr falsely accused a fellow Columbia University student of raping her in her New York home on New Year’s Eve. Kyle Dubensky claims he had consensual sex with Ms Ferreyr in her apartment in Harlem on December 31, 2012. When the drama student attempted to leave, . Ferreyr allegedly blocked the exit and physically apprehended him, drawing blood . when digging her nails into his arm. Dubensky . supposedly fled and was chased into an elevator by a naked Ms Ferreyr, who started . to strangle him, a source told the New York Post. When . the pair arrived at the ground floor, Ms Ferreyr, also a student at . Columbia, told a University guard she had been sexually assaulted, after . which police was called to the scene. Mr Dubensky was arrested and held for 18 hours, but the District Attorney’s Office did not press charges against him. A . source close to Ms Ferreyr told the Post that Mr Dubensky had tried to have . unprotected sex with her and that he also ‘strangled and tried to hit . her' as she pursued him after the attack. According . to the source, Ms Ferreyr ‘blacked out’ when police arrived, but asked . the prosecutor to release Mr Dubensky when she regained consciousness in . hospital. Mr Dubensky’s attorney rubbished these claims, brushing them off as ‘fiction’. ‘This is not a case of ""he said, she said"",’ Mr Dubensky’s attorney Michael J. Roberts told the New York Post. ‘The . District Attorney was presented with the case and refused to file a . complaint. In addition, Columbia University declined to pursue the case . and saw no reason to investigate further. More suits: Adriana Ferreyr filed a $50million lawsuit against her former boyfriend, 82-year-old billionaire George Soros, in August 2011 after he allegedly broke a promise to buy her a $1.9m home . Representatives from Ms Ferreyr’s legal team have declined to comment. Ms Ferryr, a former child actress and star of a Brazilian soap opera had a five-year-relationship with George Soros, a . financier known as the Man Who Broke the Bank of England after making . millions during the 1992 UK currency crisis. Despite . their 53-year age gap, the pair dated for five years before the alleged assault in 2010 during an argument about an apartment he had 'promised' to buy her in Manhattan. Last week it was reported that Ms Ferreyr is also facing legal action from Mr Soros. The Hungarian born magnate is countersuing the aspiring actress for defamation and assault after she accused him of torture, harassment and abuse. Headache: Mr Soros has denied that he physically abused Miss Ferreyr and promised to buy her an apartment . She alleged that the elderly billionaire assaulted her with a lamp after he told her he had given the $1.9million apartment to her love rival - his now-fiancée Tamiko Bolton. Mr Soros’ lawyers filed their response to her lawsuit, claiming that she assaulted him with the glass lamp. Soros’ lawyer William Zabel told the .

"The makers of blockbuster movie Cloud Atlas have been criticised for using 'poorly-done' eye make-up to make white actors look Asian. The use of 'eye prosthetics' to alter the appearance of the actors' eyes in the film, has been labelled 'disturbing' by an Asian American media watchdog. Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) said the film's makers had also missed a 'great opportunity' to break racial stereotypes by using a white actor to play an Asian man in one of the lead 'action hero' roles. Scroll down for video: . Complaint: An Asian American media watchdog has called the use of heavily made-up white actors to play Asian characters in Cloud Atlas is 'disturbing' Make-up: Jim Sturgess was one of the white actors made up to look Asian. Here he is shown playing character Hae-Joo Im in the film . Decision: Hugo Weaving (pictured) also played an Asian role in the film  which featured a series of racial transformations - including Halle Berry playing a white woman . 'In the modern age of movie make up, it is disturbing to see poorly done Asian eye prosthetics to make Caucasian men look Asian,' Guk Aoki, MANAA's founding president told the Hollywood Reporter. 'Cloud Atlas missed a great opportunity. The Korea story’s protagonist is an Asian man--an action hero who . defies the odds and holds off armies of attackers,' he told the website. 'It would . have been a great, stereotype-busting role for an Asian American actor . to play, as Asian American men aren’t allowed to be dynamic or heroic . very often.' IInstead it is white actor Jim Sturgess who plays that role in the film - which is thought to be one of the most expensive of its kind ever made and features an impressive all-star cast. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Susan Sarandon were among the big names from the film who turned out for its premiere in Hollywood on Wednesday.

Race: White actors Jim Sturgess (left) and Hugo Weaving played Asian characters in Cloud Atlas . Fellow white actors Hugo Weaving and James D'Arcy also played Asian characters in Cloud Atlas, while black actor Keith David was made up to look Asian in the film too. Mr Aoki complained about the apparent assumption that white actors could be made to look Asian just by changing their eyes and 'not their facial structure and complexion' - according to the Hollywood Reporter. He was also critical of scenes in which Asian women were made to look white - which he accused the film's makers of taking greater trouble to get right - and said that in part of the film about black slaves, the slaves were played by black actors. Other actors in the film to play different races included Ms Berry, who plays a white woman, and Mr Hanks who plays a British man of southern European heritage.

Dream team: Sibling directors of Cloud Atlas, Andy and Lana Wachowski (left and centre) of Matrix fame, with fellow director Tom Tykwer . The purpose of these changes was intended by the film's makers to portray the 'continuity of souls,' according to the Reporter. Mr Aoki said the film showed that using 'badly done yellowface' in films 'is still OK.' The film’s directors Lana and Andy Wochowski attended the film's premiere.

"A woman has revealed how she had unprotected sex with notorious porn star James Deen after  responding to an open casting call on his website. Jenn Tisdale, 33, a stand-up comedian and writer from Washington DC, who had no experience in the X-rated industry, filmed two scenes with Mr Deen one afternoon in a New York hotel room last month. The pretty blonde told MailOnline that she got paid 'handsomely' for her stint in front of the camera, and there were no awkward moments as she writhed around completely naked in bed with her co-star. Branching out: Jenn Tisdale, a stand-up comedian and writer from Washington DC, has told how she decided to make a sex tape with X-rated Lothario James Deen after he launched an 'open casting call' on his website . Indeed, she told XOJane.com that she felt so . comfortable with lothario Mr Deen, that 'by the time we got down to the . get-down, it was as if I slept with a pal.' Despite the friendly ambiance, Ms Tisdale still managed to produce a convincing performance. 'I . surprised myself by really going for it. I hardly noticed the . larger-than-life camera, and I decided long ago never to bang in . anyone's shadow. In other words, I gave it my all.' She said afterwards she felt 'really good', 'empowered' and even started telling strangers about what she'd done. 'I went to the gym for obvious reasons, got a manicure/pedicure and showered and shaved everything' 'I ended up telling the woman at the Verizon store . everything. She made me promise to come back and let her know when it . was available because, and I quote: ""My husband and I love watching porn."" 'I filed her away as my first fan.' As per the original agreement between Ms . Tisdale and Mr Deen, an edited one-minute-six-second-long version of . their sex tape was uploaded to jamesdeen.com last Friday. Ms Tisdale told MailOnline that she responded to Mr Deen's advert because she wanted to know what shooting an adult film was like. While her boyfriend . - who she is in an 'open relationship' with - was upset at first, she says he has since become her 'biggest supporter.' Further explaining why she wanted to 'do a porno', she tells Mr Deen before they get to their bedroom scene: 'I was interested in the experience but only because it was with you.

Indeed, . 27-year-old Mr Deen - whose real name is Bryan Matthew Sevilla - has . attracted thousands of female followers thanks to his 'approachable' boy-next-door looks. The California native's most famous . co-stars to date include Teen Mom star, Farrah Abraham and Lindsay . Lohan, who he 'slept with' in the non-pornographic 2013 movie, The . Canyons. Miss Tisdale told XOJane.com . that when she first met up with Mr Deen - after being accepted to do a . sex scene with him and getting her mother's approval - it felt like 'two . people going on their first online date.' 'I surprised myself by really going for it. I hardly noticed the larger-than-life camera, and I decided long ago never to bang in anyone's shadow' 'We had exchanged a bunch of emails.

After . taking a walk around New York, getting coffee and talking they decided . to head back to the hotel room and get on with the task in hand. To . prepare for her unconventional screen debut, Miss Tisdale reveals in an . essay for Brightest Young Things that she treated 'the whole affair as . if I were going to prom.' 'I went to the gym for obvious reasons . . .  I got a manicure/pedicure. I showered and shaved everything.'

As . she sat waiting in the hotel room for Mr Deen to arrive, Miss Tisdale's . nerves sky-rocketed as she thought more about what was going to happen. Recalling . her 'fidgety' demeanor, she wrote: 'Maybe I should put my laptop away. I . don't want the whole world to see what my laptop looks like. 'It didn't occur to me that the whole world was about to see what my lap looked like, my naked lap. 'Porn is not the wizard behind the . curtain it once was. Most of us have sex.

After signing various release forms, Miss Tisdale filmed two scenes with Mr Deen.

"The Chinese boom town of Suzhou is about to be put on the map as its iconic new skyscraper is set to be completed after years of construction. The 'Gate of the Orient' towers 300m above the city, and many hope it will give Suzhou a reputation as a leading global hub. However, others are less enthusiastic about the project - because they point out that it bears a striking resemblance to a giant pair of trousers. Iconic? The Gate of the Orient towers over the Chinese city of Suzhou, near Shanghai . Transformation: The skyscraper is set to make Suzhou one of China's leading cities . The building, designed by British architects RMJM, consists of two towers next to each other which join at the top. It is intended to resemble an arch, making a symbolic gateway into the centre of the city, which is near Shanghai in Jiangsu province. According to RMJM, 'The project introduces a dramatic iconic ""gateway"" to the city of Suzhou and represents the significance of the China in the world today.' Attraction: But Chinese web users have mocked the building for resembling a pair of skyscrapers . Anger: Some suggest that China has become a playground for Western architects with wacky ideas . But Chinese commentators have repeatedly mocked the skyscraper, laughing at it because they think it looks like a pair of trousers. Last year newspaper Shanghai Daily asked in a headline, 'Is it an arch or just plain pants?' And hundreds of users of micro-blog Weibo have been quick to ridicule the building, with one writing: 'This should be called the Pants of the East, not the Gate of the East.' Artist's impression: When it is completed, the Gate of the Orient will certainly be striking . Others had more serious criticisms - one said the Gate of the Orient showed that China had become 'the playground of foreign designers with laughable architecture ideas'. Ever since the construction of skyscrapers such as the Shanghai World Financial Centre and Beijing's 'Bird's Nest' stadium, dozens of smaller cities in China have attempted to match the metropolises. However, many have become laughing stocks for their overly ambitious plans, while the country's economic slowdown could leave many supposedly iconic buildings standing empty for years.","'Gate of the Orient' in Suzhou will stand 300m high when it is finished .

"The latest space tourism venture aims to send paying customers to the edge of space and give them the same awe-inspiring view that adventurer Felix Baumgartner stared down upon last year - all for $75,000 a ticket. Depending more on hot air than rocket science Arizona start-up, World View, has unveiled plans for a balloon ride to the stratosphere, offering passengers about two hours of space-like views from 19 miles above Earth. While it's not quite space — that starts at 62 miles — the plan requires approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees commercial space. Scroll down for video . To the edge of space: World View Enterprises announced plans Tuesday to send people up in a capsule, lifted 19 miles by a high-altitude balloon. Jane Poynter, CEO of the Tucson, Ariz.-based company, said the price for the four-hour ride would be $75,000 . The company expects to begin flight tests of a demonstration vehicle this year in Arizona and plans to start selling tickets at $75,000 per person within a few months, said Chairwoman and President Jane Poynter - with commercial flights by 2016. 'There are balloons this size that have already flown up many, many times for decades,' Poynter said. 'From a technical point of view this is incredibly doable, low risk.' The selling point is the view of the Earth and seeing its curve, she said. The venture isn't designed for passengers to experience weightlessness. Indeed, the flight will be more like that of Red Bull daredevil Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian adventurer who leapt from a balloon 24 miles above the Earth, smashing the sound barrier during his descent and landing safely. Dream flight: The selling point is the view of the Earth and seeing its curve, she said. The venture isn't designed for passengers to experience weightlessness . Lift-off: Initially, six passengers and two pilots would be aboard a pressurized capsule that is still under development . 'We promise we won’t open the door and have you jump back to Earth,' Poynter joked. The flight would take 90 minutes to go up at about 1,000 feet a minute, set sail up high for 2 hours with an emphasis on smooth riding, hit an altitude of 19 miles and then come back down in 40 minutes, Poynter said. The capsule's interior will be roomy enough for its eight passengers to walk around and even get a drink at an on-board bar - but unfortunately there will be experiencing of weightlessness. 'Seeing the Earth hanging in the ink-black void of space will help people realize our connection to our home planet and to the universe around us, and will surely offer a transformative experience to our customers,' Jane Poynter, World View's chief executive officer, said in a statement. The flight would take 90 minutes to go up at about 1,000 feet a minute, set sail up high for 2 hours with an emphasis on smooth riding, and then come back down in 40 minutes . Pilot Felix Baumgartner of Austria jumps out of the capsule during the final manned flight for Red Bull Stratos on October 14, 2012 in space . 'We look forward to pioneering this new, accessible and affordable spaceflight regime, and to sharing the breathtaking, once-in-a-lifetime experience with people from around the globe.' By comparison, rides aboard SpaceShipTwo – a suborbital six-passenger, two-pilot vehicle owned by Virgin Galactic, an offshoot of Richard Branson’s London-based Virgin Group – is expected to reach about 68 miles. At that altitude, passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness in addition to seeing the curvature of the Earth set against the black sky of space. World View capsules would be propelled by a 40 million cubic-foot (1.1 million cubic-meter) helium balloon and a steerable parafoil, an inflatable wing-shaped parachute - which would steer them gently to the ground once they disconnected from the giant helium balloon. Outside magazine space expert Scott Pace, a former NASA associate administrator now space policy director at George Washington University, agreed that this is technically feasible. Pole position: Virgin Galactic's SpaceShip Two flies over the Mojave Desert in California as it continues its test flights ahead of its first commercial flight next year . Entrepreneur Richard Branson takes a press conference on his decade-old Virgin Galactic space project in 2012 . He said the issue is whether there's enough of a market for it to be financially doable, calling it 'an interesting market test.' Pace said the while there are many space tourism ventures, it is not quite right to call the field growing. It is still embryonic. A few people have paid tens of millions of dollars to fly to the International Space Station and others have paid to fly in high altitude jets. But how many people will pay for near space experiences, he asked. Poynter said she has no doubt that there's a market with other firms like Virgin Galactic selling so many tickets for yet-to-fly rides. 'Space tourism is here to stay,' said Poynter, who also runs the space firm Paragon Space Development Corporation. Virgin Galactic: . Headed by the charismatic British billionaire and adventurer Richard Branson, Virgin Galactic and their Space Ship 2 became the highest commercial winged vehicle in September . The spacecraft shot to 69,000 feet above the Earth's surface and the company claims it is on track to put paying customer's into space in 2014 . The SS2 is launched from a large aeroplane, giving the spacecraft more initial speed and altitude than if it were launched from the ground. Sir Richard Branson first unveiled the rocket plane on December 7, 2009 and 18 months later took selected people on short-hop trips just above the atmosphere. The SS2 is 18 metres long and has two pilots and room for six passengers. Tickets cost $250,000 per person and 600 have been sold up to June this year. Celebrities who have snapped up tickets, include Stephen Hawking, Tom Hanks, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Katy Perry. Passengers will experience approximately six minutes of weightlessness during the two-hour flight.XCOR Aerospace: . The California based firm are in developmental stages of a jet which will take its passengers from New York to Shanghai in 2 hours. XCOR Aerospace claims its Lynx spacecraft can travel at a speed of more than 2,500 mph - and dozens of miles above the earth - before safely landing at an airport. The Lynx's main engines run with the help of flight weight rocket piston pump hardware and liquid oxygen. XCOR COO Andrew Nelson has said that flights between Tokyo and New York are likely to be available within the next 20 years . While the view may not be as expansive as what SpaceShipTwo can offer, it will last longer. Project developers expect the capsule to linger in the middle of the stratosphere for about two hours before returning to the ground. The descent should take 25 to 40 minutes. A World View ride would cost less than one-third of the $250,000 it will cost to fly on SpaceShipTwo. So far, about 650 people have put down deposits or paid for rides on the latter, which is undergoing testing at manufacturer Scaled Composites’ facility in Mojave, California. Virgin Galactic aims to begin passenger service next summer, Branson said last month. Virgin Galactic and others have shown that the luxury market has shifted from high-end goods to high-end experiences, Paragon co-founder and Chief Executive Taber MacCallum told Reuters. 'We found we could put together a business plan that closed in a ticket price that is not too different from other luxury experiences, like a high-end safari and things like that,' MacCallum said. The FAA letter describes World View’s initial launches as taking place from New Mexico’s Spaceport America, a commercial port whose anchor tenant is Virgin Galactic. Poynter said the firm is looking at several U.S. launch sites. For added safety and for landing, a steerable parafoil will remain deployed and attached to the capsule throughout the ride, Poynter and MacCallum said. 'The balloon you’re under is the thickness of a dry cleaner bag. It’s very thin material by necessity to get you so high. That’s where the technical risk lies. The risks of decompression of the spacecraft or life-support systems failures are really pretty small. We’ve got lots of redundant systems and we can return to lower altitudes pretty quickly,' MacCallum said. 'There is a chance – and every once in a while you see in scientific ballooning – of a balloon failure. That’s really what took us to having this para-wing, or parafoil always open so that from just about any altitude the vehicle could safely glide back,' he added. She and her husband earlier this year proposed a private venture to send a married couple to Mars in 2018. In the early 1990s she and her husband Taber MacCallum, who serves as World View's chief technology officer, spent two years as 'bionauts,' sealed inside Biosphere II, a huge, greenhouse-like structure built in the Arizona desert.","World View Enterprises announced plans Tuesday to send people up in a capsule, lifted 19 miles by a high-altitude balloon .

"The next mayor of New York City will be chosen at the polls today and it is Bill de Blasio's race to lose as the Democratic candidate is beating his Republican rival by more than 40 points in the latest polls. Even though experts predict that turnout will not be particularly high, de Blasio's lead is so great that there is little to stop him from becoming Michael Bloomberg's successor. De Blasio got another boost of moral support from his daughter Chiara who surprised him Tuesday morning by flying to New York from her college in California in order to go to the polls with him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Surprise! Bill de Blasio got an election day present with his daughter Chiara making a surprise visit from her college in California to spend the day with her father and vote in his favor . Leading the way: Democratic candidate- and likely Mayor-elect- Bill de Blasio follows his daughter Chiara, wife Chirlane McCray and their son Dante out of their house in Park Slope as they head to the polls . New look: Ditching her trademark flower headband, Chiara opted for a more tribal print and a Bindi today . A Marist poll released on Monday had de Blasio leading Joe Lhota 65 per cent to 24 per cent among likely voters. ‘There's only one poll that counts and it's the one that closes at 9pm,’ Lhota said at a Monday campaign appearance. The campaign has been as much about the policies of Bloomberg, who leaves office at the end of the year after three terms, as the candidates' vision for the future. De Blasio frequently talks about the ‘two New Yorks’ - one rich, one poor - and how the city has left less fortunate New Yorkers behind as the contrast between the have's and have-not's has grown increasingly stark. De Blasio, who as the city's elected public advocate acts as an official watchdog, has positioned himself as a clean break with the Bloomberg years, promoting a sweeping liberal agenda that includes a tax increase on the wealthy to pay for universal pre-kindergarten and improved police-community relations. He has especially criticized the controversial police tactic of stop-and-frisk, which critics say unfairly targets poor blacks and Latinos. Who are you voting for? The proud father peers over at his daughter as she casts her vote . something to look forward to: The candidate's son Dante, 15, is too young to vote but accompanied his father and the rest of his family to their polling station in Park Slope . Bloomberg has called the approach . central to the city's anti-crime fight, while de Blasio has blasted it . as destructive to police and community relations. Those . campaign tactics, and a pledge to reach out to New Yorkers who feel . left behind by what they believed were Bloomberg's Manhattan-centric . policies, have been rewarded in the polls. Lhota, who has struggled to shake de Blasio's formidable lead, has launched an assault of negative ads. But that strategy has mostly backfired with an increasing number of voters saying they have a negative view of the Republican, Marist has found. Though registered Democrats outnumber their Republican counterparts 6 to 1 across the city, the last Democrat to become mayor was David Dinkins in 1989. Last looks: Republican candidate Joe Lhota reviewed election documents with his wife in a Brooklyn station . Hoping for a comeback: Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani (left) campaigned with Joe Lhota (right) on the final day before the polls opened, as Lhota used to work for Giuliani . However, the GOP victories were tied to some extraordinary events that scrambled the political landscape. Mayor . Rudy Giuliani defeated Dinkins in 1993 amid fears about the city's . soaring crime rates, and Bloomberg won in 2001 largely thanks to his . fortune and the fallout from the September 11 attacks. Opponents have been counting down the days until Bloomberg's third term comes to a close, but for many months of the ensuing campaign, De Blasio did not seem like his likely successor. He was a distant fourth for much of the summer in the crowded Democratic primary, only to surge past former front-runners including City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner, and is now on the verge of ending an improbable Republican winning streak in the mayor's office.

"A New York delivery man was been awarded almost $1 million in damages by a jury after detailing the anti-Semitic torment he suffered by three supervisors in the workplace. Adam Weircinski, who is in his fifties and lives in Washington Heights, won $900,000 and a 'moral victory' following years of abuse at Midtown Manhattan restaurant Mangia 57. The Brooklyn federal court was told how other employees would call him a 'dirty Jew'. Nightshift manager Artur Zbozien was named in the lawsuit as someone who would 'pass gas' in front of Wiercinski and 'joke' that is was Zyklon B, the poison used in Nazi gas chambers during the Holocaust. 'My father had six siblings — only two of them survived in what is now the Ukraine,' he told Fox News. 'I had to explain to the members of the jury what is Zyklon B.

His lawyer, Matthew Blit, said he stayed despite the abuse because of his age. 'Who else is going to hire a 50-year-old delivery man? He was afraid,' Mr Blit said. 'He's in shock (at the result). Adam Wiercinski was a delivery man for Mangia, in Midtown, Manhattan, from 1992 until 2008 . 'He was so happy. 'It's a moral victory for him.' Jurors heard the testimony over three days last week. Wiercinski's accounts were supported by other co-workers. Most of the testimony was in Polish. The jury made a decision in just four hours. Employees at the restaurant and caterer, which has three Manhattan locations, have denied the harassment took place.

Michael Phelps takes in the final moment of his career after victory in the Men's 4 x 100m Medley Relay at the London 2012 Olympic Games . Goodbye and goodluck: Michael Phelps leaves the Olympic pool for the last time . The Baltimore Bullet was joined in victory by Matthew Grevers, Brendan Hansen and Nathan Adrian. Aided by Phelps, the U.S. team comfortably won edging out Japan and Australia in an event the United States has never lost in the history of the modern Olympic games, excluding the boycotted 1980 Moscow games. In the final swimming event of the eight-day meet, the Americans clocked 3 minutes, 29.35 seconds. Matt Grevers led off in the backstroke leg, Brendan Hansen swam the breaststroke, Phelps did his usual butterfly leg and Nathan Adrian was the anchor in freestyle. The Americans trailed when Phelps dove in, but he pushed them in front. Japan touched in 3:31.26 to take the silver medal and Australia finished in 3:31.58 to take bronze. Bouncing back from a disappointing first race in London, a fourth-place finish in the 400 individual medley, Phelps wound up with more medals than any other swimmer at the games: four golds and two silvers. Grevers had the Americans in front on the opening backstroke leg of the relay, but Kosuke Kitajima put Japan slightly ahead going against Hansen in the breaststroke. Not to worry, not with Phelps going next. He surged through the water, handing off a lead of about a quarter of a second to Adrian for the freesytle anchor. The Americans won going away in 3 minutes, 29.35 seconds, just off their own Olympic record from Beijing. Japan held on for silver in 3:31.26, with Australia taking the bronze in 3:31.68.

"Secret plans to airlift penniless Britons stranded in Cyprus back home have been drawn up by the Government. Senior Whitehall sources say that if the crisis spirals out of control, British citizens who want to come back will be offered airline tickets. If necessary, they will also be given transport to get to airports, probably by the British Army. There are an estimated 60,000 British expatriates in Cyprus and 3,000 British soldiers based there. The military may rescue up to 60,000 expats as the island faces financial meltdown . News of plans to rescue Brits from the island comes as Cyprus’s government reached a deal with EU authorities on a financial bail-out essential to avoid the country sliding further into chaos. The latest proposal will see  people with more than €100,000 (about £85,000) in the Bank of Cyprus lose 20 per cent of their money. Savers with more than €100,000 in any other bank will pay four per cent. Last weekend’s proposal to raid all bank accounts on the island – as revealed by The Mail on Sunday last week – was dropped amid public and international outrage. The new scheme has been approved by the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, known jointly as the Troika. The levy is needed to raise €5.8billion (£4.9bn) as Cyprus’s contribution to the bail-out. The EU is expected to provide a further €10billion (£8.5bn) to rescue Cyprus’s struggling banks. The European Central Bank had said it would pull the plug on Cyprus banks on Tuesday morning without a deal. With limits placed on withdrawals from cash machines, many residents ¿ including some Britons on the island ¿ are running dangerously short of cash . As part of its bail-out plan, the Cyprus Parliament passed laws on Friday to stop significant amounts of money being removed from the country . Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades is expected to travel to Brussels today to finalise the agreement. Whitehall officials refused to discuss details of the contingency plan for ex-pats, but a well-placed source said: ‘We are confident we will not need to put this plan into action. But clearly, we have to be ready to help British citizens in all circumstances, wherever they are in the world.’ The Mail on Sunday understands there have been detailed talks between Downing Street, the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office on the plan to airlift Britons. ‘This is something we have been looking at for a considerable period of time,’ said one insider. ‘We have been aware for many months that there was a possibility of something like this happening in Cyprus and we have taken the appropriate and prudent measures to prepare for it. ‘If British people cannot get their own money and want to come home, we have to help.’ The introduction of so-called ¿capital controls¿ was seen as essential to stop cash flooding out of the country when banks re-open on Tuesday . Cyprus banks have been closed since last weekend and are not due to re-open until Tuesday morning. With limits placed on withdrawals from cash machines, many residents – including some Britons on the island – are running dangerously short of cash. Whitehall’s secret airlift plan includes arranging extra commercial flights and paying for airline tickets for Britons who wish to return home but who cannot get hold of cash or use their credit cards to pay for them. It is not known whether they will be expected to repay the Government when they reach the UK. The detailed plans even cover the possibility that British subjects won’t be able to get to the airport if they cannot pay for transport or petrol for their cars. It is thought the British Army will lay on transport. As part of its bail-out plan, the Cyprus Parliament passed laws on Friday to stop significant amounts of money being removed from the country. The introduction of so-called ‘capital controls’ was seen as essential to stop cash flooding out of the country when banks re-open on Tuesday. The levy and the block on taking money off the island will hit all residents, including British citizens, and thousands of Russians in Cyprus and in Russia who have billions of euros deposited in Cyprus banks. The island has become a haven for wealthy Russians amid allegations that much of the Russian money is illegal. The threat of a raid on its citizens’ cash prompted Russia last week to consider helping Cyprus bail out its banks in exchange for access to gas reserves off the Cyprus coast. Cyprus’ finance minister Michalis Sarris held talks in Russia late last week but returned empty-handed. Without the backing of the Troika for the new bail-out plan, the ECB had warned it would cut off emergency support for Cyprus’s banks, which would have left the banks bust, plunged the island into further chaos and driven Cyprus out of the euro. Fears: Lesly Sutton and her rescued pets . In her ‘old life’ back in Britain, Lesley Sutton was a designer-clad interior designer who enjoyed all the accoutrements of success. She gave it up – the parties, the exotic holidays, the 4x4 and her luxury home – for a more humble existence in Cyprus. Now, 12 years on, there can be few expats on the blighted island who are suffering more because of the banking crisis. Lesley, who runs an animal sanctuary in the mountains above Limassol, is down to her last 64 euros. Before the crisis, many of her 15 dogs and 20 cats were sponsored – 20 euros a month each – and that, supplemented by cleaning work, was her chief source of income. ‘It’s drying up because people haven’t now got the money to sponsor animals. Who can blame them? At the moment I’ve got 50 euros in my purse and just 14 in the bank and that, sadly, is it,’ she said. ‘I am worried about feeding the animals. As it is, some of the dogs are, like me, living on pasta.’ Whatever the outcome of rescue talks, the crisis has already dealt an irreparable blow to Lesley’s livelihood – and that of many other Britons in Cyprus. Some expressed fears yesterday that they are days away from closing their businesses. And growing numbers are said to be preparing to return to Britain. The past 48 hours has seen a vicious circle develop. Banks are running out of cash, yet small business suppliers, supermarkets and petrol stations are refusing to accept credit cards. For many, this has overtaken the ever-growing limits on ATM withdrawals as their biggest concern. ‘It’s cash or nothing now,’ explained Briton Angela Rose, who runs a pet grooming business in Larnaca. ‘Like lots of others I know who own small businesses, suppliers are demanding cash rather than post-dated cheques, which they have always been happy with in the past. ‘It is this more than anything that is stifling business and making it hard to get by. I’ll have to close down in a couple of days; I can’t go on like this.’ Others spoke of angry scenes as customers try to pay with credit cards. ‘There have been plenty of tears, screaming and shouting and, I’m told, even scuffles breaking out. It’s mayhem,’ said builder Peter Scrimgeour who moved to Cyprus from Exeter nine years ago. ‘People fill up their cars, go to pay with a credit card and then find that they aren’t accepted.’ With time running out for Cyprus, the island’s 60,000 expatriates face a nerve-racking few days. Some Britons with foresight switched their savings to UK accounts several months ago and now those with the means to do so, many retired, are making plans to sell their properties and return home. However, the vast majority, particularly those without financial interests in Britain, simply cannot afford to go. ‘Things have got increasingly desperate over the last 48 hours and I am fearful of what will happen next,’ said Ms Rose, 39. ‘My business has come to a standstill, no one is coming through the door and I am having to tell my staff not to come in. I can’t see how I am going to pay them. And I certainly don’t have the money to move back to the UK.’ Neither does Lesley Sutton, whose husband Terry, a builder, died last year. Lesley, from Essex, was diagnosed with thyroid cancer last year. But she is more concerned about her animals’ ailments and paying her vet’s bill. ‘I am having some treatment soon, paid for by a friend. We shall have to see what happens,’ she said. UKIP leader Nigel Farage yesterday called for Cyprus to leave the euro.  ‘The human suffering caused by the euro-thugs has shown that for Cyprus, like the other indebted countries, the best thing to do is leave the single currency. ‘The perceived benefits of joining have long since passed and there is no trust left,’ he said.","Estimated 60,000 British expatriates in Cyprus and 3,000 British soldiers based there .

"A Native American tribe in Oklahoma has been awarded custody this week of a four-month-old baby who was adopted by a South Carolina couple. The case has drawn comparisons to the long-running adoption dispute over three-year-old Cherokee girl Veronica and led to criticisms of 'human trafficking' from tribes. In the latest case, an Oklahoma County District Court judge awarded custody of baby Desaray, who had been adopted by a couple from outside the state, to the Absentee Shawnee Tribe. Inquiry: Tribe attorney Charles Tripp says adoption lawyers should be investigated . Custody: Raymond Godwin is representing the South Carolina couple . The case echoes that of . three-year-old Veronica, who was also put up for adoption by her birth . mother, only for the biological father to later object. A . federal law called the Indian Child Welfare Act mandates strict . procedures for guardianship and custody of Native American children. The . unnamed couple who adopted Desaray were present at her birth in May. They returned with her to South Carolina in June so the father could . return to work. But the . baby's biological father, Jeremy Simmons, who is not Native American, is . seeking custody. Because Desaray's biological mother is a tribal . member, the Absentee Shawnee Tribe stepped in and was awarded custody . this week. The Indian Child . Welfare Act mandates that Native American children enrolled in a tribe . must first be placed with an extended family member, another tribal . member who is not a family member or another Native American from a . different tribe. This . summer, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Dusten Brown, a Cherokee . Nation member who is seeking custody of his daughter, Veronica, could . not use the law to press his claims for custody. Veronica's . biological mother is not Native American. Courts in South Carolina and . Oklahoma have ordered Mr Brown to hand over the girl to Matt and Melanie . Capobianco, but Mr Brown has refused. Custody battle: Veronica, pictured above with biological father Dusten Brown has been at the center of a custody tug-of-war for her entire life . A . lawyer representing the Absentee Shawnee Tribe in the Desaray case said . he fears the tribe could have trouble in its effort to bring Desaray . back to Oklahoma. Charles Tripp said he believes the South Carolina-based adoption lawyer, Ray Godwin, who helped set up adoption cases involving Veronica and Desaray, and other adoption lawyers should be investigated by the Department of Justice. He told Indian Country Today Media Network last month that tribal attorneys were caught off guard in May when they heard that Desaray had been moved to Oklahoma. 'She was already gone and out of the state before we even received notice,' he claimed. 'The adoptive couple paid their money and took off with the kid without the required approval of either the State of Oklahoma or the Absentee Shawnee.' Mr Tripp had called for an investigation to end the 'human trafficking of our tribal children in South Carolina'. 'Part of the reason for an investigation is the fact that I think we've got women, primarily, who are in bad situations financially, maybe emotionally, maybe societal issues – whether that's drug and alcohol issues or criminal issues – who are being selected, preyed upon, by these agencies,' he said. 'I think they prey upon people in dire straits.' In a statement, Mr Godwin said the Absentee Shawnee Tribe were aware of the plan for adoption before the birth and did not voice any objections. He acknowledged that the couple did leave Oklahoma without obtaining an interstate compact agreement, which governs the placement of children from one state to another. 'But they only did so under dire circumstances,' Mr Godwin said in the statement. 'Any statements by the birth father or the Absentee Shawnee Indian Tribe that the child was whisked out of Oklahoma a couple of days after birth are patently false.' Mr Godwin said the couple went to family court in South Carolina where a temporary custody order was put in place. It's unclear if the adoptive couple plan to appeal the Oklahoma order, though Mr Godwin did write that the couple are trying to obtain an interstate compact agreement.","Law on Native American adoptions says child must be placed with tribe first .

"Investigators sifting through the wreckage of a Boeing 747-400 cargo plane that crashed in Afghanistan on April 29 have found that several of the straps used to tie down the 16-ton MRAP fighting vehicles broke after takeoff. This has led to speculation that the massive armored vehicles shifted shortly after the civilian cargo plane took off from Bagram air base, sending it careering out of control. Seven American crew members, all civilian employees of National Air Cargo, were killed in the crash. A passing motorist captured dramatic video of the plane plummeting to Earth on a dashboard camera. Scroll down for video . Secured: A Boeing 747-400 like the model that crashed on April 29 in Afghanistan can carry five 16-ton MRAP armored vehicles tied down with chains and heavy nylon straps . Something's wrong: The plane, described as a cargo flight, then starts to twist and quickly . Crash: The Taliban claimed that it shot down the aircraft, a claim NATO denies . ABC News reports that crash investigators believe that some of the heavy-duty nylon straps holding the Oshkosh M-ATV MRAP vehicles in place aboard the plane snapped shortly after it took off. If the heavy cargo shifted dramatically as the pilots tried to climb, the crew would have been helpless to control the aircraft, aviation experts told ABC. The last words the pilots radioed out was 'weight.' It is unknown how many of the vehicles the 747-400 was carrying, though the maximum load that model airliner can carry is five. The Aviation Herald reported that the crew of the plane reported that a load shift caused the plane to stall moments before the crash. The crewmen killed were: Pilots Brad Hasler of Trenton, Michigan, and Jeremy Lipka of Brooklyn, Michigan; first officers Jamie Brokaw of Monroe, Michigan, and . Rinku Summan of Canton, Michigan; maintenance crewmen Gary Stockdale of . Romulus, Michigan, and Timothy Garrett of Louisville, Kentucky; and loadmaster Michael Sheets of Ypsilanti, Michigan. Casualties: All seven crewmembers aboard the cargo plane were killed in the crash . Explosion: The terrifying crash sent flames shooting into the sky . Hasler married his longtime . girlfriend just two weeks before his death. The couple had a 2-year-old . child and another on the way, his . brother said. The brother, Bill Hasler, told WDIV-TV: 'If I could trade places with him so that he could be with his family, I would in a heartbeat.' In a statement to NBC News, . Bill Hasler added: 'Brad was a wonderful father to two young children, a . beloved husband to a wife who is expecting another child, a loving son, . and the most loyal and supportive brother I could have ever asked for. 'His influence in the lives of all of us who loved him is immeasurable, and our grief is indescribable.' The station reported that fellow crewmember Sheets was engaged, and was to get married later this year. In . a statement to WDIV, Mr Sheets' family said: 'While there were inherent . risks involved in his position, Michael assumed these risks to provide . for his family. 'Michael was a loving and devoted son and brother.' It . was revealed last night that Stockdale had predicted he would die in . ball of flames, and believed that flying was a huge risk, his older . brother said. Heavy truck: The Oshkosh M-ATV MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) vehicle was designed to offer troops more armor than Humvees . Tragic: Plane crash victim Michael Sheets was engaged to be married . Stockdale, 55, said: 'He always said it was dangerous,' NBC reported. 'He would always say, ""You either will die in a car crash or a ball of flame in a plane"".' A horrifying dashcam video captured the Boeing 747-400 appearing to take off normally as it gained altitude. But suddenly, the plane appears to stall, twisting and dropping rapidly before crashing to the ground in a fireball. In a statement, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the crash, but NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said there were no reports of insurgent activity in or around the base, which is one of the largest in the country and located about 25 miles north of Kabul. National Airlines president, Glen . Joerger, said in a statement: 'Safety is always our top priority at . National Airlines. This is a devastating loss for our family and we'll . work diligently with authorities to find the cause. Mourned: First Officer Jaime Brokaw, left, and load master Michael Sheets, both of Michigan, are two of the seven Americans killed when the private cargo plane went down in Afghanistan . Navigator: Rinku Summan was one of the two first officers on the flight. According to reports, the plane went down after the cargo load shifted on takeoff . Just married: Brad Hasler, a pilot who was killed in the tragic plane crash in Afghanistan, is pictured with his new wife Robin in this wedding photo from two weeks ago . 'Most importantly, our thoughts and prayers are with our crewmembers and their families.' The . Afghanistan Ministry of Transportation and Commercial Aviation is . leading the investigation. The NTSB has also sent officials to assist in . the probe. One of Brokaw's friends described him as a skilled navigator with significant flight experience. 'He . was a very good person and very smart person,' Chris Connerton told The . Associated Press Tuesday by telephone from Rochester, Minnesota. Connerton credited Brokaw with helping . get him through flight school, as well as a harrowing flight two years . ago from Toledo, Ohio, to an international flight expo in Lakeland, . Florida, Connerton said ice had built up on the plane to the point that . he could no longer get it to climb. 'If it wasn't for Jamie's navigation . and know-how ... we wouldn't have made it,' Connerton said. 'I don't . know that I would have had the capacity to handle the situation on my . own.' Brokaw leaves behind a wife and young step-daughter. Gary Stockdale, 51, from Romulus, Michigan, was a member of the maintenance crew . Jeremy . Lipka's stepfather Dave Buttman said that his stepson had toured Iraq . and Afghanistan and escaped near-fatal incidents, but continued to serve . his country. He said: . 'Basically, you're taking your chances flying in there and he was just . happy to be one of the pilots to do it,' NBC reported. Hasler was a high school hockey star who lived in a tidy neighborhood in the suburbs outside Detroit. The . district governor for Bagram, Abdul Shukor, described the plane as . having reached an altitude of about 1,312 feet before suddenly 'falling . out of the sky,' he said, citing witness accounts. Coalition forces said that the official cause of the crash is under investigation, but it is believed that the plane's cargo - which included mostly military vehicles - moved as the flight took off, causing it to spin out of control. Bad weather is also being weighed as a possible cause.","Six crew members identified as Michigan residents - Jamie Brokaw, Rinku Summan, Gary Stockdale, Michael Sheets, Brad Hasler and Jeremy Lipka .

"An innocent family has been left stunned after heavily armed police raided their home looking for a previous tenant that they suspected of committing drug offences. Jeremy and Becky Handley, and their two children Aurora, eight, and Brenden, seven, were convinced they were about to be robbed when the gun-wielding group burst into their home in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Officers ransacked drawers and cabinets in the property and forced Mr Handley to lay on the ground with his hands behind his back, before eventually realising that the man they were looking for - a suspected drug dealer known as 'Chum' - had not lived at the address for more than a year. Terror: The Handley family were convinced they were about to be robbed when the gun-wielding group burst into their home in Kalamazoo, Michigan (pictured) Traumatised: Brenden Handley (left) and his sister Aurora (right) have had nightmares since the ordeal.

Jeremy Handley and his wife Becky (pictured) were handcuffed and forced to lay on the ground while Kalamazoo police officers conducted a three-hour search of their home, hunting for cocaine and drug money . Kalamazoo police sent a SWAT team to the family home to search for cocaine, drug money and weapons last Thursday afternoon, but instead found only the terrified Handley family. Aurora and her younger brother Brenden ran to hide in a wardrobe in their bedroom as the police smashed down the front door of the property. She told WWMT that the ordeal made her 'sad and scared'. 'We were staying quiet because we thought they were bad guys coming in,' Brenden added. When officers eventually found the children, they were forced to sit on a bed while their parents were handcuffed in front of them. Wrong: During the search Jeremy Handley (left) was told that officers were looking for 'a man named Chum'. After realising the suspected drug dealer moved out last year, the police apologised to Becky Handley (right) Fear: Aurora and her younger brother Brenden (pictured) ran to hide in this wardrobe in their bedroom as the police smashed down the front door of the property . The investigators then conducted a three-hour search of the property but, unsurprisingly, found nothing untoward. They later handed the family a report confirming nothing had been discovered. During the search Mr Handley was told by officers that they were looking for 'a man named Chum', before adding that he would 'never recognize him if I were to see him in the street'. After realising the man they were looking for had moved out last year, the police apologised to Mrs Handley and gave the children cuddly toys as gifts.

"A British national is wanted by Italian police in connection with a fraud of more than a billion pounds, allegedly used to finance terrorist groups. Imran Yakub Ahmed, from Preston, is accused of defrauding the Italian state out of €1.15 billion - (£1.17 billion) in VAT, which he allegedly laundered through slush funds and investments in Dubai. Prosecutors in Milan believe the funds were reinvested in the Middle East as a mask for the financing of Islamic terrorist organisations. Imran Yakub Ahmed, who is wanted over a fraud of more than a billion euros, came to the attention of Italian authorities when they raided a jihadis' den in the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan, near to where Osama Bin Laden was killed in 2011, seen above . A spokesman for the prosecutor confirmed their investigation involved a number of European passport holders - including one Briton from an immigrant community - and was 'almost complete'. Police are investigating 38 people and 11 of those are still wanted for questioning, including 40-year-old businessman Ahmed. Ahmed, who is of Pakistani origin, came to the attention of the Italian authorities in 2010 when his name and the name of his company were found on papers picked up by UK and US secret services as they raided a Taliban base. The documents were discovered in a jihadis' den in the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan, near where terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden was killed in 2011. Italian authorities claim Ahmed worked with another company and used stolen identities and fake corporations, to buy and sell carbon credits at marked up prices . Ahmed administered the SF Energy Trading company in Milan, working with another Italy-based company to buy and sell carbon credits. The credits are traded between firms and states to meet their international environmental commitments, under the Kyoto Protocol. The two companies allegedly used stolen identities and links to fake corporations in China to run the scam, in which carbon certificates were bought in France, Germany, Holland and the UK, then sold on to unsuspecting customers with an added cost of 20 per cent VAT. The tax was never paid to Italian authorities, but was allegedly transferred to bank accounts in Cyprus and Hong Kong, before ending up in Dubai. Investigators discovered that the funds had been reinvested into diamonds and property development in Dubai as well as in two luxury watches bought in Rome for €50,000 (£39,000) each.

"A six-year-old girl was left alone in Bali after her parents were arrested over an alleged £1.6million cocaine smuggling operation on the Indonesian island. Kitty Ponder has been looked after by their maid and gardener since Julian Ponder and Rachel Dougall were detained the day after her birthday. Mr Ponder, 49, and Miss Dougall, 38, face death by firing squad if they are convicted of being part of the alleged drugs ring. Scroll down for video . Torn apart: Rachel Dougall and her husband Julian Ponder have been separated from their daughter Kitty, who remains at their luxury holiday villa . Their daughter may never see them . again if they are taken to the notorious Kerobokan jail to be put on . death row, as happened to two Australians who were part of the infamous . 'Bali Nine' smuggling ring in 2005. The couple are among four Brits accused of being part of an 'international network' attempting to smuggle 4.7 kilograms (11 pounds) of the narcotic on to the holiday island. They are suspected of being the buyers of the cocaine allegedly carried in the suitcase of mother-of-two Lindsay Sandiford, 55. Kitty is now being looked after at Mr . Ponder and Miss Dougall's luxury villa by Dayu Ariani, 33, wife Ketut . Suranchana and their young son, according to The Sun. Terrifying prospect: The couple are likely to be put on death row at Bali's notorious Kerobokan prison, pictured, if found guilty of smuggling cocaine on to the island . Detained: Miss Dougall (left) was arrested after the sting operation Lindsay Sandiford (right) agreed to carry out . Mr Ariani said: 'We were shocked when the police came. 'They came with Mr Julian and . collected a lot of bags and left with the mother and father. We have . been looking after Kitty, who is a sweet girl. 'She thinks her parents are coming . home. We cannot tell her the truth. Nobody from the authorities has . taken any steps to look after the girl.' As the first pictures emerged of the couple on Monday, their friends on the island dismissed the allegations as a 'joke', according to the Daily Telegraph. They said Miss Dougall, from Brighton, was a 'party girl' who had been innocently caught up in a 'bigger game'. Distraught relatives had been calling Bali from Britain worried about the well-being of her daughter. Housewife Mrs Sandiford was initially . the focus of the investigation after she was arrested at Denpasar  airport last . week and used in a police sting. She was forced to pose for pictures on . Monday next to packages containing the Class A drug. The . attention has now shifted to Mr Ponder and Miss Dougall, however, who . used to restore antiques together from fashionable homes in Brighton and . west London. Looking strained, Miss Dougall was yesterday pictured wearing an orange prison-issue shirt and shorts outside a police station in Bali. Harsh conditions: Both women are being held at a jail in the Balinese capital . As she was led away at Bali police headquarters, she shouted: ‘It’s a fit-up, get us a decent lawyer. I’m being treated badly.’ Her husband, next to her, shouted: ‘Get us an international lawyer.’ Until . 2008, Mr Ponder ran an antiques restoration business, Pen Productions . Ltd. Their home was a £500,000 apartment overlooking the seafront in . Brighton. He was previously director of a London-based caterers and party organisers, which collapsed with debts of £500,000 in 2004, according to The Times. The pair, who now live in Bali, were arrested after Indonesian police apparently persuaded Mrs Sandiford to take part in a sting operation following the discovery of the drugs inside the lining of her suitcase. Mrs Sandiford, a former legal secretary from Redcar in Cleveland, was arrested at Ngurah Rai airport after she arrived on a flight from Bangkok on May 19. After being interrogated for days, she apparently confessed she had been due to meet Miss Dougall, who had asked her to stay at a hotel in Kuta, southern Bali. 'The reason she co-operated was, we pointed out that if she stayed silent, the whole illegal drug importation attempt would be on her shoulders,' said customs official Made Wijaya. 'Singing like a bird': Lindsay Sandiford being escorted by police for interrogation at Bali police HQ . Distressed: Alleged drug trafficker identified as Lindsay Sandiford in front of the huge pile of cocaine at the Customs Office in Denpasar, Bali . 'Neighbour from hell': Sandiford lived at this £275,000 property which she had rented in Cheltenham . Last Friday police arrested Mr Ponder . moments after Mrs Sandiford had allegedly handed him the drugs disguised as a present in pink wrapping paper. Officers . then arrested Miss Dougall at his apartment in Tabanan, central Bali, which has a swimming pool, playhouse and beautiful views of the mountains. They allegedly found 49kg of cocaine in a bag, along with a Marlboro cigarette packet containing 23kg of the drug, according to The Times. But a friend of the couple described the police's suggestion that they were part of an 'international network' of drug traffickers as 'a joke', adding: 'She [Miss Dougall] is a party girl and I believe that she has been caught up in this somehow. 'I think she has been coerced and wrapped up in a bigger game than she really understood.' Another expat said: 'She always had these fabulous designer clothes on. You'd see her dancing on the tables. She was the life of the party.' Another . Briton, Paul Beales, was arrested a day later at a villa in Kuta, where police allegedly found 3.36g of hash, and an Indian man was also detained. In an interview with The Times, he protested his innocence. 'This is a nightmare. I've got two little girls of four and nine and I have no idea what they are thinking about why their dad hasn't come home. I'm not involved with drugs. I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm scared, of course I am.' 'Conspirators': A younger British woman, centre, and three others suspected of being on hand to receive the drugs were arrested and dressed in prison uniforms with their faces covered by black balaclavas . All the suspects face the prospect of being executed by a firing squad if they are convicted. It emerged that Mrs Sandiford is ‘singing like a bird’ about the drugs syndicate she was allegedly involved with. Police sources said she has spent several days being interrogated by narcotics squad officers. Her nights are spent in a mosquito-plagued cell 10ft long and 8ft wide. A senior officer said: ‘We don’t expect to be making any announcements until at least next week. There is a great deal of work to be done but fortunately the information is  flowing from one area very well.’ Paraded: Three Britons and an Indian national were seen dressed in ill-fitting orange outfits and flip-flops after their arrests . On show: The suspect accused of hiding 4.7kg (11lbs) of cocaine in her luggage is led through a custom office in Denpasar, Bali . It is understood Bali police have been in . touch with British officers about Mrs Sandiford’s background after she . claimed she was forced to carry the drugs because her two sons, Lewis, . 23, and Elliot, 21, were threatened. Her elder son was jailed for six . years in 2009 for a series of robberies in London. Last night Miss Dougall’s father Barry, 64, a retired antiques dealer, said: ‘It looks like she is in a lot of trouble out there.’ He was jailed soon after the birth of his daughter and served three-and-a-half years for fraud. He last saw her in Brighton when she was 18. Speaking from his one-bedroom flat in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, he added: ‘I have led a chequered life. But if Rachel ever needed anything I would be there for her.’ Arrests: Sandiford was detained at Denpasar Airport on the paradise island of Bali, Indonesia . Island paradise: Bali was once a haven for drugs but in the past ten years the authorities have cracked down on the importation of narcotics and anyone found with more than a few grams of Class A drugs faces death . Mr Ponder’s ex-wife, Kotkanoke Bradburn, said she was shocked to learn of his arrest. Speaking from her home in Stafford, she said: ‘He was never aggressive and never harmed me in any way.’ She married Mr Ponder in 1989 after she came to England from her native Thailand to study English. They separated after three years. Do you know any of the Bali drug suspects? Contact MailOnline by calling 020 7938 6000.

"A 93-year-old Central Texas woman was fatally shot at her home by a police officer - who has a history of fatal shootings - when after she allegedly brandished a gun, the Hearne Police Department said Wednesday. Pearlie Golden, a longtime resident of Hearne who was affectionately known to her neighbors as Ms. Sully, was shot Tuesday night by Officer Steven Stem, Robertson County District Attorney Coty Siegert said. Stem was responding to a 911 call about a disturbance involving a woman with a gun. Loved: Members of Pearlie Gold's (right) community have nothing but good things to say about their longtime neighbor . Hearne, Texas, police officer Stephen Stem fatally shot a man in 2012 but was later cleared of any wrongdoing by a grand jury . According to KBTX, Golden was shot five times after raising her weapon. The station also reports that it was Golden's nephew who called police about the dispute. According to the station, Golden's nephew called police after he took the elderly woman's car keys because she is no longer allowed to drive. Golden then reportedly grabbed her gun and began threatening her nephew. When police arrived at about 6:30 p.m., Golden was standing in front of her home waving the gun in the air. A one-paragraph press release issued by the department Wednesday said officers responded to a 911 call involving ""a female with a gun."" The Hearne Police Department said in a written statement that Golden 'brandished a firearm' when Stem encountered her. He then shot her multiple times. A revolver believed to be the weapon Golden had at the time of the shooting was found at the scene by officers, the statement said. She was taken to a hospital in nearby Bryan where she died from the injuries. The investigation is being handled by the Texas Rangers. Home: Golden, whose home is pictured here, was well-liked in her community of Hearne, where she has lived for at least 50 years . 'She did have a gun. ... Now, what she was doing with it, that is the ultimate question,' said Siegert. City attorney Bryan Russ Jr. said the officer has been put on paid administrative leave as is standard protocol when an officer is involved in a shooting. 'What we believe is that she was instructed to drop the weapon, that is my understanding,' Russ said. in 2012, Stem fatally shot a man named Tederalle Satchell while responding to a report of a vehicle with three passengers that had fired weapons at 'a large group of people in the parking lot' of a local apartment complex, according to a 2013 report from The Eagle. Outraged: Waymon Webster's cousin was also killed by Stem during a dispute at an apartment complex . Stem ultimately was cleared of any wrongdoing by a grand jury. Stachell's cousin, Waymon Webster, says Stem is a danger to the community. 'What are they going to do, let him go, so he can smile and hold another . pistol? You know what I mean? It's not right,' Webster told KBTX.com.","Authorities say 93-year-old Pearlie Golden 'brandished a firearm' before she was shot by the officer .

"Private eyes: Simon Cowell is on the list drawn up by Soca . Simon Cowell is on an explosive list of blue-chip firms and individuals who used rogue private detectives, it emerged last night. The music mogul is among the 102 names on the list drawn up by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) that the Commons Home Affairs Committee is threatening to publish on Monday. The list is dominated by big law and finance firms and high street solicitors, but also contains two individuals – one of whom is multi-millionaire Cowell. Soca has stressed that the presence of a name on the list does not amount to evidence of wrongdoing. Officials say many clients of rogue investigators did not commission information-gathering activities or will not have been aware that the private eyes broke the law to obtain information. Following a threat last week by Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, to publish the list, senior MPs lined up with Establishment figures yesterday to demand that it remain secret. In what appeared to be a co-ordinated campaign, other Commons committee chairmen backed Britain’s most senior anti-terror officer, the Information Commissioner and Cabinet Minister Andrew Lansley to insist the plan to publish the list be shelved. It has raised the stakes even higher in a long-running row over whether the list drawn up by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) should be made public. Mr Vaz has given Soca an ultimatum to publish the dossier by Monday – or see MPs do it themselves. He said it gave an appearance of ‘injustice’ for law firms, insurers and other big businesses on the list to remain secret while journalists have been relentlessly pursued for links to phone hacking and other illegal practices. But yesterday, Soca director general Trevor Pearce rejected this request and, in a strongly worded letter, called on Mr Vaz to think again. The committee was bombarded with letters from senior figures saying it would do great harm to publish the list of 102 law firms, insurers, financial companies, banks and individuals who were clients of corrupt investigators. They included warnings from Mr Lansley, who is Leader of the Commons, the Information Commissioner Sir Christopher Graham, and Sir Alan Beith and James Arbuthnot, the chairmen of Westminster’s Justice and Defence Select Committees, respectively. Secrecy: Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz, left, and Cabinet Minister Andrew Lansley, right . Mr Pearce also said that he had the support of Met Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, who is in charge of terrorism. The onslaught alarmed MPs, with one senior committee source commenting: ‘This is very suspicious. It seems there is some sort of co-ordinated operation going on to prevent us from publishing what could be very embarrassing information.’ MPs were given two reasons for secrecy. Mr Pearce and the Information Commissioner claimed publication might compromise inquiries into whether those on the list could be prosecuted. Sir Christopher said: ‘It’s not clever to start a criminal investigation by publishing the names of everyone and everything you’re investigating. Mr Lansley and the two committee chairmen took a different line, pointing out that when Mr Vaz received the list from Soca in July he gave an undertaking it would be kept confidential. Mr Lansley said that, if Mr Vaz broke his word, future inquiries by MPs could be refused access to confidential documents. Mr Vaz now faces tense talks with fellow committee members. They have so far insisted it is vital the public know the truth about relations between big firms and corrupt detectives. Mr Vaz told Mr Pearce last week: ‘We’ve taken legal advice and we believe it’s important that this should be done.’ Tory member Michael Ellis said: ‘There don’t seem to me to be any issues of national security or other issues pertaining to the wider national interest.’","Serious Organised Crime Agency says 102 firms and individuals who hired 'hackers'

"The father arrested at a school board meeting after complaining about a sexually explicit novel on his daughter’s reading list said that his family was ‘violated’, describing the book as 'graphic and violent' and featuring a scene that was 'arguably an instance of date rape'. William Baer lost his temper during the meeting between parents and school officials from New Hampshire's Gilford High School. The meeting was convened to give parents the chance to discuss the appropriateness of ninth-grade students being given Jodi Picoult's Nineteen Minutes - a novel about a school shooting that contains themes of bullying and sexual violence. Scroll down for video . Willaim Baer is led out of the school board meeting by a police officer on Monday after he complained about his 14-year-old daughter being given a sexually-explicit book as an English assignment . Mr Baer, an attorney, raised his voice at the meeting and said that he didn't believe that the school showed his daughter respect by giving her a book with sexually-explicit themes . Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult deals with a school shooting and has themes of bullying and sexual content . A two-minute time limit for speaking . was imposed on those attending the meeting and when Mr Baer exceeded . this, during a strident outburst, he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. Immediately after his arrest his . daughter, Marina, 14, railed against the school authorities. She told . them: ‘This just shows that you resort to force at the first turn of . conflict. And I'm appalled. I don't trust you and I honestly don't feel . safe around you people.’ Footage of the drama was quickly uploaded to the internet. Speaking to Fox News after his . arrest, Mr Baer said: ‘The problem is that there was no notice from the . school that this would be the assigned reading. 'I'm 50 and I'm not prude and I've . never read anything like that in my life. It is graphic. It is violent, . it is arguably an instance of date rape. I feel like my family has been . violated.' The book contains a description of . rough sex between two teenagers including the words: 'She could feel his . erection, hot against her stomach'. Mr Baer expressed his outrage that his . daughter had been assigned the reading material and when he asked to . read the concerning passage aloud, the school board refused. 'Sir, would you please be respectful of the other people?' a school board member asked. He replied: 'Like you’re respectful of my daughter, right? And my children?' Mr Baer, an attorney, was seen on . camera arguing heatedly with school authorities and a parent who . supported the book for several minutes before a police officer . approached him in the audience. The officer appeared to ask Mr Baer to . leave. He responded: 'Because I violated the two-minute rule?', . referring to his allotted speaking time at the meeting. 'I guess you're going to have to . arrest me,' Mr Baer told the police officer, who then ordered him to . stand up and led him by the arm out of the library meeting. The father was then placed in handcuffs and charged with disorderly conduct. Mr Baer told EAGNews: 'I was shocked when I read the passage, and not much shocks me anymore. 'My wife was stunned by the increasingly graphic nature of the sexual content of the scene and the imagery it evoked.' The lines which caused parents' concern in the class-assigned text: . 'Relax,’ Matt murmured, and then he sank his teeth into her shoulder. He pinned her hands over her head and ground his hips against hers. She could feel his erection, hot against her stomach.

'You are also cheating the kids out of being exposed to real literature . in front of them. This is garbage.' Jodi Picoult also weighed in on the debate over her book. She wrote: 'Another parent is . challenging #19Minutes bc it contains a sex scene far more vague than . anything on TV. Sad to focus on that & not bullying.' Nineteen Minutes was published in 2007 and debuted at number one on the New York Times Best Seller list. Picoult's fans jumped to her defense over criticism of the novel.

"Two Portland police officers investigating a fight at a youth club came to the home of a 9-year-old Portland girl, handcuffed her as she stood in a bathing suit, and led her away to be processed downtown on an assault charge. The girl's mother and some in the juvenile justice system call the handcuffing and arrest a year ago excessive. Now, a citizen panel that investigates police misconduct plans to look into it. Critics of the incident are calling for the Portland Police Department to sharply restrict officers from taking a child younger than 10 into custody. Scroll down for video . Law enforcers: Officer Matthew Huspek, left, and Officer David McCarthy, pictured at an event last year handing out police stickers, arrested and handcuffed a 9-year-oild girl over a fight . 'When they put handcuffs on, I thought, ""Wait a minute, this has got to be a joke,""' Latoya Harris told The Oregonian. 'The look on my daughter's face went from humiliation and fear, to a look of sheer panic.' Joseph Hagedon, chief supervising attorney for the Metropolitan Public Defender's juvenile unit, said it's a concern that the fight had occurred a week earlier, and the girl was at home with a parent. 'It was way over the top for them to do that,' Hagedon said. Police spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson said officers use handcuffs as a safeguard, and they acted according to bureau policy. Furious mother: Latoya Harris said the experience of being arrested and processed has left her daughter traumatized, and she is now planning to sue police . Police rules require juveniles taken into custody for any felony or serious misdemeanor charge such as the one police alleged to be fingerprinted and photographed at the forensics division, he said. It makes no age distinctions. 'We really don't think there's circumstances where children under 10 should be taken into custody,' said Mark McKenchie, executive director of Youth, Rights & Justice, a not-for-profit law firm that serves vulnerable children. He and Hagedon are calling for changes in city law and police rules to require a juvenile court judge's order before police can take a child younger than 10 into custody. Children 10 and 11 could be taken into custody without a judge's approval only for serious felonies. The 9-year-old girl was held for an hour in a cell used for adult detainees and released. Prosecutors didn't take the case to trial. The action has been reviewed by the Independent Police Review Division, overseen by Portland's independent auditor. It found officers violated no Police Bureau policies and forwarded the complaint to the officers' supervisors. Last month, Harris took her story to the Citizen Review Committee, an advisory and monitoring panel that hears complaints of alleged officer misconduct against Portland police, and it agreed to hear testimony. The weekly Portland Mercury first reported Harris' account. According to a report by The Oregonian, the incident that led to the nine-year-old’s arrest unfolded April 26, 2013, outside the Boys & Girls Club on North Trenton Street. Witnesses told police that Harris' daughter got involved in a fight between two girls who had been arguing because one of them tattled on the other in school for drawing on a desk. A police report stated that after a staff member at the youth center broke up the young brawlers, Harris' daughter continued trying to kick and punch her rival. The girls eventually apologized to one another and the 9-year-old was suspended from the club for a week. Kids' kerfuffle: On April 26, 2013, a fight broke out between a group of girls outside this Boys & Girls Club on North Trenton Street in Portland . But later that day, the mother of one of the girls involved in the altercation called police and demanded that Harris' daughter be arrested for slamming her child's head against a wall and leaving a contusion on her face. Six days later, officers David McCarthy and Matthew Huspek came by the Harris' home in North Portland to question her 9-year-old daughter. The officers wrote in their report that the grade-schooler gave 'vague answers' that were inconsistent with eyewitness accounts of the kids' confrontation a week earlier, and that the child appeared to get angry when pressed for answers. Eventually, the two officers decided to take the girl into custody on a fourth-degree assault charge. The school girl wearing a wet blue-and-white bathing suit was then handcuffed and placed in the back of a squad car, which took her to police headquarters to be fingerprinted and photographed. Latoya Harris said before arresting her child, the two cops acted very aggressively in their questioning and then refused to let her come along with her daughter in the patrol car. After being processed, the 9-year-old dressed only in a swimsuit and a towel was placed in a holding area to await the arrival of her mother, who came by bus more than an hour later. Ms Harris said the experience has fundamentally changed her little girl - a one-time gifted student who had to switch schools because of teasing. The girl, who is now 10 years old, has been going to counseling since last June. ‘I didn't get the same girl back,’ Harris said. Ms Harris says officer McCarthy and Huspek (pictured) aggressively questioned her daughter and then placed her in the back of the patrol car that took her to police headquarters for processing . The Independent Police Review Division has found that officers McCarthy and Huspek did not break any departmental rules when they arrested the 9-year-old. ‘In my opinion, they were trying to scare and humiliate her,’ Harris said. ‘All they had to do was give her a talking to. We're talking about two grown men in uniform with guns.' The mother has been publicly speaking out about her daughter's plight, and she now plans to sue the Portland Police Department. On Wednesday, police spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson told The Oregonian that in light of ‘public interest’ in the May 2013 incident, the bureau has formed a work group to review its juvenile custody directives. Simpson's statement came hours before a citizen panel was set to review police policy on the handcuffing, arrest and booking of children.","Latoya Harris' 9-year-old daughter got into a fight April 26, 2013, with two other girls outside Boys & Girls club in Portland .

"Sir John - who is survived by his wife Maryanna and three children - was knighted for Services to Music in the Millennium Honours list . The classical composer Sir John Tavener has died aged 69. Prince Charles led tributes last night to the musician whose haunting Song For Athene was played at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. Clarence House said the Prince of Wales was saddened to hear of the death of Sir John, his favourite British composer. He died peacefully at his home in Child Okeford, Dorset, yesterday. Sir John first came to public attention when he joined the Beatles’ Apple record label in the 1960s as a classical musician among rock and pop acts. Knighted for services to music in the millennium honours list, he achieved commercial and critical success with compositions that drew on his rich spiritual beliefs. Born in Wembley Park, North London, in 1944, he became the organist at St John’s Presbyterian Church in Kensington at the age of 15, and played there until the 1970s. While he had a Presbyterian upbringing, he joined the Russian Orthodox Church in 1977. After completing studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he premiered his avant-garde oratorio The Whale at the London Sinfonietta’s first concert in 1968 before it was released by Apple. He established himself as a leading composer with his choral masterpieces The Lamb and Ikon Of Light in the early 1980s. In the late 1960s he was famously signed to The Beatles' record label Apple and his music was notably performed at the funeral of Diana, Princess Of Wales, in 1997 . He was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1992 for The Protecting Veil, which topped the classical charts for several months, and in 1997 for Svyati, a collaboration with the cellist Steven Isserlis. Sir John, who was 6ft 6in tall, suffered a stroke in 1979 and was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome – a disorder of the body’s connective tissues – 11 years later. He said his fear of death left him once he was diagnosed. ‘Before my illness I’d always had a morbid fear of death,’ he said. ‘But death has become one’s spouse. It’s not terrifying any more.’ He suffered a series of heart attacks in 2007, had bypass surgery and was in a coma for six months. During his illness, Sir John’s wife . Maryanna played Mozart to him. ‘I apparently, in my unconscious state, . began conducting. So that brought me round again,’ he said. In the last years of his life, he was in constant pain and suffered from shortness of breath. Sir John and his wife Maryanna, who played Mozart to him while he was unconscious following surgery which 'helped bring him round' Sir John - pictured with Prince Charles - had suffered health problems for a number of years . Last night James Rushton, the managing director of Sir John’s publisher Chester Music, said he ‘was one of the unique and most inspired voices in music of the last 50 years’. He added: ‘His large body of work – dramatic, immediate, haunting, remaining long in the memory of all who have heard it, and always identifiably his – is one of the most significant contributions to classical music in our times. ‘For all of those fortunate enough to have known him, John was a man of strong beliefs, huge personal warmth, loyalty and humour. He will be much missed.’ The leading composer and conductor Sir Peter Maxwell Davies said: ‘John’s contribution to spiritual music was immense and his death is a great loss to the world of spiritual music.’ Sir John is survived by his wife and their three children Theodora, Sofia and Orlando.","In the late 1960s he was famously signed to The Beatles' record label Apple .

"Daltrey said he was angry at politicians who had mismanaged mass immigration . Roger Daltrey, the frontman of The Who, has said he will ‘never, ever’ forgive Labour for their policies on immigration. The singer accused the Labour Party of ‘destroying the jobs of my mates’ by not controlling mass immigration when in power. Mr Daltrey, 69, said the reason he no longer supports the Labour Party is because of ‘stupid thinking on Europe’ that allowed large numbers of EU nationals to work in England. The musician said blame does not lie with immigrants, but with the politicians who mismanaged them. ‘I’ve got nothing against the Poles at all, but that was a political mistake and it made me very angry. 'And the people who get it in the neck are the immigrants, and it’s not their fault,’ he told the Sunday Times magazine. He said the influx of thousands of immigrant workers during Labour’s 13-year reign left the indigenous working-classes unemployed. ‘I will never, ever forgive the Labour party for allowing this mass immigration with no demands put on what people should be paid when they come to this country. ‘I will never forgive them for destroying the jobs of my mates, because they allowed their jobs to be undercut with stupid thinking on Europe, letting them all in, so they can live 10 to a room, working for Polish wages.’ He said the influx of thousands of immigrant workers during Labour's 13-year reign left the indigenous working-classes unemployed . Mr Daltrey refused to rule out voting for UKIP in the next election. He said: ‘I’ve met Nigel (Farage) but I don’t know who I’ll vote for. I’m agnostic at the moment.’ It is not the first time that the outspoken musician has waded into the debate on immigration. In 2011, he said the last government left ‘the British working man screwed like he’d never been screwed before’. The singer criticised politicians who use social networking sites, saying they are not serving the public properly. ‘I find it really worrying that politicians tweet. That really worries the f*** out of me,’ he said. ‘They should be sitting there thinking about doing a good job rather than telling us what they had for breakfast or what colour suit they’re wearing.’ Daltry is a patron of the Teenage Cancer Trust and was a member of the Countryside Alliance until he left over their support of fox hunting.","Singer accused Labour of not controlling mass immigration when in power .

"Not something to snirtle about: Author Safia Shah is campaigning to preserve endangered words before they are lost from the English language forever . A children's author has launched a campaign to save old-fashioned words like begrumpled, ninnyhammer and slubberdegullion before they disappear from the English language for good. Former journalist Safia Shah has published a book called Around The World In 80 Years which she hopes will breathe new life into obscure phrases and adjectives. Many of the words - which also include terms like snirtle, fratchy and jargogle - were compiled after she invited people to come up with suggestions for the book. She told The Times: 'Some are old-fashioned and have gone out of usage, others are family words that had been handed down from generation to generation and people weren't sure if they were proper words.' Mrs Shah, who has worked with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, said some wonderfully colourful words are in danger of being lost forever. Around The World In 80 Years aims to help children move away from texting and tweets and instead explore the spoken word. In the introduction, she says: 'Let's snatch begrumpled from the brink of obscurity... We want to open our wink-a-peeps and champion their cause.' She also commissioned 20 women to make her a woollen 'cosy' for the old London taxi that she drives featuring some of her favourite words. The project took four months and 20kg of wool. Colourful campaign: Mrs Shah has published Around The World In 80 Years which features a number of endangered words including blatteroon, slubberdegullion and jargogle . Begrumpled - sad . Blatteroon - a senseless boaster . Fratchy - irritable . Jargogle - to confuse or jumble . Kedge-belly - a bulging stomach . Ninnyhammer - a fool . Ramfeezled - exhausted . Snirtle - to laugh in snorts . Slubberdegullion - a scoundrel . Wink-a-peeps - eyes . The English Language passed the one-million word mark in 2009, according to the Global Language Monitor. But Mrs Shah says most people only need around 7,000 to get through everyday life. Conversely, researchers earlier this year ranked 2,500 of our most commonly used words and compared them with the same list from 50 years ago. Linguists at the University of Lancaster used computers to trawl through millions of books, speeches, studies and newspaper articles currently in circulation. They found 'marriage', ‘childhood’, ‘God’ and ‘religion’ all fell in popularity but ‘Christmas’ was on the up. And although ‘modesty,’ ‘conscience’ and ‘gentleman’ are no longer in vogue, ‘sex’ and ‘celebrity’ are far more common.","Safia Shah features endangered words in Around The World In 80 Years .

"It's a turkey. It's a menorah. It's Thanksgivukkah! An extremely rare convergence this year of Thanksgiving and the start of Hanukkah has created a frenzy of Talmudic proportions. There's the number crunching: The last time it happened was 1888, or at least the last time since Thanksgiving was declared a federal holiday by President Lincoln, and the next time may have Jews lighting their candles from spaceships 79,043 years from now, by one calculation. Rare: American Jews are commemorating this once in an eon event with specially created cards posters. On November 28, Thanksgiving and the first day of Hanukkah coincide for the last time for more than 70,000 years . Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: Nine-year-old Asher Weintraub, inventor and rising fourth-grader designed the ultimate Thanksgivukkah accessory: the Menurkey . There's the commerce: A 9-year-old New York boy invented the 'Menurkey' and raised more than $48,000 on Kickstarter for his already trademarked, Turkey-shaped menorah. Woodstock-inspired T-shirts have a turkey perched on the neck of a guitar and implore '8 Days of Light, Liberty & Latkes.' The creators nabbed the trademark to 'Thanksgivukkah.' Songs have popped up with lyrics like these from 'The Ballad of Thanksgivukkah': 'Imagine Judah Maccabee, sitting down to roast turkey and passing the potatoes to Squanto ...' Rabbi David Paskin, the song's co-writer and co-head of the Kehillah Schechter Academy in Norwood, Massachusetts., proudly declares his the Jewish day school nearest Plymouth Rock. Let's not forget the food mash-ups commemorating the staying power of the Pilgrims and the fighting prowess of the Jews, along with the miracle of one night's oil lasting eight days. Pumpkin latkes, apple-cranberry sauce and deep-fried turkey, anyone? The perfect blendship? Hanukkah and Thanksgiving means there'll be lots of candles and awesome food! The best of both: Thanksgiving is normally a convergence of certain friends or family members, and Hanukkah is normally celebrated with other loved ones, this dual holiday will bring new people together . Thanksgiving is set as the fourth Thursday in November, meaning the latest it can be is 11/28. 11/28 is also the earliest Hanukkah can be. The Jewish calendar repeats on a 19 year cycle, and Thanksgiving repeats on a 7 year cycle. You would therefore expect them to coincide roughly every 19x7 = 133 years. Looking back, this is approximately correct – the last time it would have happened is 1861. However, Thanksgiving was only formally established by President Lincoln in 1863. So, it has never happened before. Why won't it ever happen again? The reason is because the Jewish calendar is very slowly getting out of sync with the solar calendar, at a rate of 4 days per 1000 years (not bad for a many centuries old calendar!) This means that while presently Hanukkah can be as early as 11/28, over the years the calendar will drift forward, such that the earliest Hanukkah can be is 11/29. The last time Hanukkah falls on 11/28 is 2146 (which happens to be a Monday). Therefore, 2013 is the only time Hanukkah will ever overlap with Thanksgiving. You can see the start date of Hanukkah as a function of time in the attached plots. In the long timescale plot, the drift forward is clear.Of course, if the Jewish calendar is never modified in any way, then it will slowly move forward through the Gregorian calendar, until it loops all the way back to where it is now. So, Hanukkah will again fall on Thursday, 11/28...in the year 79,811. 'It's pretty amazing to me that in this country we can have rich secular and rich religious celebrations and that those of us who live in both worlds can find moments when they meet and can really celebrate that convergence. There are a lot of places in the world where we would not be able to do that,' Paskin said. The lunisolar nature of the Jewish calendar makes Hanukkah and other religious observances appear to drift slightly from year to year when compared to the U.S., or Gregorian, calendar. But much of the intrigue over Hanukkah this year is buried deep in the history of Thanksgiving itself, which hasn't always been fixed in the same spot. That caused some initial confusion over Thanksgivukkah, aka Turkukkah. In 1863, Lincoln declared Thanksgiving as the last Thursday in November (the month sometimes has five of those) and the holiday remained there until President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a joint resolution of Congress fixing it as the fourth Thursday, starting in 1942. Since 1863, Thanksgiving and the first full day of Hanukkah on the Gregorian calendar have not overlapped. Jewish practice calls for the first candle of eight-day Hanukkah to be lit the night before Thanksgiving Day this year, so technically Thanksgivukkah falls on the 'second candle' night. And then there's Texas. Before 1863, each state decided on its own date for Thanksgiving. As late as 1956, Texans were still chowing down on turkey and stuffing a week later than everyone else, according to a history put together by Chabad.org of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement of Hasidic Jews. That means Jews in that state might have also been lighting their first Hanukkah candle in 1945 and 1956. There's more early Thanksgiving lore and 2,000 years of calendar tinkering involving the Jewish calendar, but we'll spare you. i have a little dreidel: Some have noticed that the event also creates a retail opportunity and a way for people to express their excitement for the phenomenon . Mark your calendars: It won't happen again for millennia . Jonathan Mizrahi, a quantum physicist at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, puzzled on the convergence last January, in a blog post with buzzed-about line graphs picked up by others online. More than 100,000 people have visited the blog since then, he said, including some who questioned his calculations and prompted him to post a couple of clarifications. He hadn't made it clear that he was referring to the 'second candle' night of Hanukkah, and he hadn't realized Thanksgiving had shifted from the last to the fourth Thursday of November. The interest, Mizrahi said, 'has truly blown me away. I've just been totally flabbergasted at the number of responses.' While the whole thing is lots of fun, is there anything truly cosmic happening here? Well, there's Comet ISON, which is scheduled to pass close by the sun on Thanksgiving this year and may provide a nice show — possibly even during daylight. Or not, since comets can't always be counted on. Mom-of-two Dana Gitell, who lives outside Boston, partnered with an artist and the Jewish gift site Moderntribe to create and sell souvenir T-shirts, cards and a poster. She sees a happy and meaningful coincidence and 10 percent of proceeds will go to Mazon, a Jewish hunger relief organization. 'Cosmic? It's just a day when Jews and the rest of America are celebrating on the same day,' she said. 'It's an opportunity for us to really celebrate the Jewish American experience, and to give thanks in America for the religious freedom we enjoy here, and for making the Jewish American experience possible.'","Eight Days of Light, Liberty & Latkes .

"The resignation of David Petraeus, sparked by the revelation that the former general was having an affair with his biographer, is the biggest sex scandal to hit Washington since Bill Clinton was revealed to have had 'sexual relations' with Monica Lewinsky. And the parallels between the two events are growing stronger as it has been revealed that both Petraeus' mistress and the whistleblower who exposed them have hired legal advisers who previously worked with the former White House intern. Jill Kelley, the Florida housewife who was dragged in to the scandal when she started receiving abusive emails from an anonymous source, has hired Lewinsky's crisis manager to help her deal with the publicity she is facing after the resignation of the former CIA director. And Paula Broadwell, who carried out an affair with Petraeus over several months after writing his biography, is being represented by an attorney from the firm which once represented Lewinsky. Scroll down for video . Stepping out: Jill Kelley, the woman who kicked off an FBI probe into David Petraeus, leaves her home . Affair: David Petraeus is pictured with Paula Broadwell, his biographer and alleged mistress . Kelley has hired Abbe Lowell, the . attorney who defended John Edwards earlier this year, and Judy Smith, . the crisis manager who represented Lewinsky after her trysts with . President Clinton. Broadwell's lawyer is the Washington-based Robert F. Muse, according to ABC News, a partner at Stein, Mitchell, Muse & Cipollone, which specialises in white-collar crime. Another of the firm's partners is Jacob A. Stein, who was counsel to Lewinsky during Clinton's impeachment hearings in 1998. The 37-year-old Kelley, who became friends with Petraeus after working alongside him as a liaison officer at MacDill Air Force Base, was seen strutting outside her Florida mansion on Monday but refused to speak openly about the furore surrounding her. Help: Kelley has hired Judy Smith, right, who served as a spokesman for Monica Lewinsky . Kelley was dressed in an eye-catching canary yellow suit as . she swooped past reporters swarming the $1.3million home she shares with her husband and their three children. She . climbed into her Mercedes which carries a license plate reading . 'Honorary Consul' - a nod to her unpaid work with the forces, and a sign . she's not shy about making her high-profile contacts known. She is said to be upset at the claim that she might have had any sort of inappropriate contact with Petraeus - 'She would say he was kind of like a grandpa to her girls,' one friend told the Daily Telegraph. Uncharacteristically quiet: Kelley, known for her socializing skills, stayed silent as she left the home . Not so humble: Her license plate reads 'Honorary Consul' - a nod to her work with the coalition forces . 'Jill's husband Scott is very . protective of her, and I'm sure he was the one who said go to the FBI,' a . close friend told MailOnline about the scandal. 'They are a very close couple who are . devoted to each other and their children. If his family was being . threatened he would not hesitate to go to the police. 'Jill is a very strong woman, but I . guess she must have known who these emails were coming from. She would . have seen this Paula and seen how close she was to the General. She is . very worldly wise and would have guessed.' Kelley . has insisted there was no reason for jealousy as she is nothing more . than friends with Petraeus, whom she met when he was serving at the . Tampa base between 2008 and 2010. Close: Mrs Kelly (second right) poses with (from left to right) her twin sister Natalia Khawam, David Petraeus, her husband Scott and Holly Petraeus at a garden party at her Tampa home in January 2010 . Connected: Jill and Scott Kelley pose with Holly Petraeus at their home during the Gasparilla parade . She worked as an unpaid, unofficial . social liaison for U.S. Central Command, which Petraeus led, and was . reportedly a fixture at parties, along with her husband Scott, a . prominent cancer surgeon. The official said the coalition . countries represented at Central Command gave Mrs Kelley an appreciation . certificate on which she was referred to as an 'honorary ambassador' to . the coalition, but she has no official status and is not employed by . the U.S. government. The . official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't . authorized to discuss the case publicly, said Kelley is known to drop . the 'honorary' part and refer to herself as an ambassador. In . recognition of her work with officials at CENTCOM, she was recently . named as a honorary consulate general to South Korea - explaining her . license plate. Kelley, . whom neighbours described as a 'skilled networker', has even boasted . about serving dinner to Petraeus and his wife Holly in 2007. Tip: Kelley, pictured leaving her home on Monday, contacted the FBI after receiving threatening messages from Petraeus' mistress, warning her to stay away. Kelley maintains she is just friends with Petraeus . Heading out: Kelley leaves her home, three days after Petraeus resigned over the affair . She is also pictured with her . husband, her twin sister, Natalie Khawam, and the Petraeuses in photos . from a garden party at her home to celebrate the Gasparilla Festival in . 2010. General Petraeus . arrived with a 28 motorcycle escort and mingled with more than 200 . guests who dined on crab cakes and lamb chops. Mrs . Kelley, who said she has known Petraeus and Holly for five years, has . even visited them in Washington DC. She is also reported to have been . invited to a breakfast at the White House. And she is said to regard Petraeus as being like a grandfather to her children, aged nine, seven and and six. Neighbours called her a 'devoted mother' who enjoyed entertaining at her 5,000 sq ft home. Another added: 'Jill would not be seen out and about in anything other than a designer dress. 'At weekends while most women dress . down and wear sweat pants and the like she will be fully made up and . dressed as if she were going to a dinner.' Off: Kelley remained grim faced as she drove away from the home she shares with her husband and children . One neighbor said: 'Jill is very proud of her work with the military and she does all she can for them. 'She is a great morale booster and . uses her social position as the wife of a prominent surgeon to make sure . she makes a difference.' At . this year's Gasparilla festival, where pirate themed floats are driven . through Tampa, the Kelley's hosted military officers from 60 nations to a . coalition appreciation party. Tight security surrounded the Kelley's home during the event. One . neighbour complained that it resulted in the street running alongside . the Kelley's red and white painted mansion being closed off to traffic . for the day. 'You soon know . when Jill is having a party It's like having the president come to town . as everything shuts down. There is security everywhere and you cannot . move,' said one neighour. Visit: She left her lavish home after a visit from a police officer on Monday morning . Luxurious: Residents walk past the house belonging to Jill Kelley on Bayshore Boulevard in Tampa . On . Sunday, as news of her involved in the scandal made her a national . figure, she did not postpone an expensive garden party that was thrown . for her daughter's birthday. The gathering featured a professional DJ, an inflatable bouncy castle and catered meals and more than 100 adult guests. It came after she found herself in the midst of the sex scandal, after Petraeus dramatically resigned on Friday as it emerged he had cheated on Holly, his wife of 38 years. Broadwell, the married mother of two revealed to be Petraeus' mistress, reportedly sent harassing emails to Kelley saying: 'I know what you did,' 'back off' and 'stay away from my guy'. The official, speaking to the New York Post, added: '[Broadwell] clearly thought something was going on' and thought she was in a 'lovers triangle.' Insult: A photograph in June 2011 shows Broadwell watching as Petraeus and his wife Holly arrive for a Senate Select Intelligence Committee hearing on Petraeus' nomination to be director of the CIA . Mrs Kelley responded by calling the FBI, . which stumbled on Broadwell's affair when agents examined her email . account and found steamy exchanges with Petraeus. But as she found herself at the centre of the sex scandal, friends and family were forced to maintain her own relationship with the four-star general was never anything more than friendship. 'We and our family have been friends with Gen Petraeus and his family for over five years. We respect his and his family's privacy and want the same for us and our three children,' the Kelleys said in statement on Sunday. Dr Kelley is head of Esophageal Oncology and Surgery at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer and Research Institute in Tampa. Deception: Paula Broadwell is married to a radiologist, Scott Broadwell (left), and they have two young sons together, while Petraeus has been married to Holly for 38 years. They have two grown children . He pioneered minimally-invasive, hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery of the esophagus and other gastrointestinal malignancies. Mrs Kelley has a twin sister Natalie, who is a Tampa lawyer who represents corporate whistle blowers. She is in her own legal dispute with her former employer after being accused of sexual harassment. The sisters, who are from Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia, took part in 'Food Fight,' a culinary showdown for the Food Network channel in 2003. Their Lebanese-American parents still reportedly own a restaurant in Philadelphia.

"The Liberal Democrats have chosen a former radical Islamist to fight for a marginal parliamentary seat. Maajid Nawaz spent 13 years inside Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT), the global Islamist organisation that first spawned al-Muhajiroun, the banned Islamist terrorist organisation founded by Omar Bakri Mohammed and Anjem Choudary. But he renounced his past and called for a 'secular Islam' six years ago, after serving time in an Egyptian prison. Maajid Nawaz: The quid pro quo  is that when everyone else in society is expected to identify themselves,  a Muslim woman wearing a niqab should not be exempted . Nawaz, who was convicted of 'membership of a banned organisation' and sentenced to serve five years in Mazra Tora prison, in Egypt, has now set up the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think-tank. And clearly he has won over the coalition party, who have selected him to contest the north London constituency of Hampstead and Kilburn. It is a three-way marginal currently held by Labour's Glenda Jackson - who has a slight majority of just 42. Nawaz, who gained a law and Arabic . degree from The School of African and Oriental Studies and a Masters in . political theory from the London School of Economics, told The . Independent: 'I am looking forward to running for public office. The north London seat is currently held by Labour's Glenda Jackson - who has a slight majority of just 42 . 'Quilliam will remain a priority for me because its values shape my . beliefs and outlook.' He wants to run for Parliament so he can 'practise what he preaches' The Times reported. 'I though the time was right to continue the journey and become a manifestation of exactly what Quillam is arguing - that you can find people who are angry, who oppose many things in the world, but here is no substitute for democratic engagement,' he said to the newspaper. The law graduate was raised in Essex in what he described as 'an educated, middle-class and well integrated family'. But after experiencing severe and violent racism  as a teenager and feeling cut off from mainstream society, the think-tank founder says he was sold Islamism in the name of Islam by a HT preacher, and sucked into a group that encouraged him to 'spout hate'. After reflecting on his membership during his imprisonment, the 35-year-old renounced the group. He says that: 'Islamism uses political grievances to alienate and then provide an alternative sense of belonging to vulnerable young Muslims'. In a recent interview he said: 'Preying on the grievances of disaffected young men is the bedrock of Islamism.' Since renouncing the extreme group, he says the only way to try and prevent radicalisation is to give angry young Muslims another outlet. He founded a youth movement called Khudi, in Pakistan, which tries to counter extremist ideology through discussion and debate. He has called for a similar operation to be set up in Britain, to try and pull disaffected Muslims from being sucked into extreme organisations. A spokesman for Mr Nawaz said: My client was imprisoned in Egypt for a political offence under the former Mubarak government, having been tried by an exceptional court, established under Emergency Law that suspended the constitution. 'Moreover, Mubarak’s regime and his treatment of political prisoners have since been indisputably condemned by all Western governments and press. 'Because of the circumstances under which he was imprisoned, Mr Nawaz was adopted by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience. 'Finally, Mr Nawaz is now one of the fiercest critics of Islamism in general, and of his former group Hizb ut-Tahrir in particular.'","Nawaz was convicted by 'the now disgraced Mubarak regime'

"A 28-year-old medical school student who had planned to auctioning off her virginity on the internet and had received a high bid of $801,000 now says she won't go ahead with her part of the bargain. In a blog post today, the student, who goes buy the name 'Elizabeth Raine,' writes that she won't fulfill the terms of the auction as she wants to focus on her medical studies instead. 'With the blessings of my management and the high bidders, I have decided to put a stop to this kerfuffle (to describe it nicely) and return my focus to my medical training,' Raine wrote, according to Gawker. 'I still do possess some spitefully strong beliefs about virginity, prostitution, and a woman's right to do as she damned pleases, but school is my first priority (as it has been for my entire life). Auction: Kern offered up her virginity on a website, where she used the name Elizabeth Raine . 'At this point, I no longer care about the auction, at all. This was a very easy decision.' While . Raine initially said she was selling her virginity for the money, in . recent days, her tone had changed and become more political. 'It . is no longer about the money,' she wrote recently. 'Instead, very . broadly, it is about how society continues to exercise control over . female sexuality by chaining it tightly to female morality. 'It . is about the fact that we have not left patriarchy in the past (we all . know male morality is not judged by the same standard), and that a woman . still cannot chose to do with her body what she pleases without . eliciting condemnation and hate from those (or some of those) around . her.' Raine . launched her online auction on March 31 and initially hid her face to . conceal her identity before later deciding it would help convince . skeptical customers. Initially, she said she wanted to do the auction as she is also attracted by the adventure, eroticism, scandal and the chance to challenge norms about virginity. At the time, she added that she's been planning the auction for a year and it's transformed her, making her more educated about prostitution, virginity and 'slut-shaming.' Raine told the Huffington Post she was born in the southwest but spent much of her childhood in Saudi Arabia because of her dad's job in the oil industry. He mom died when she was 10, which was tragic but the trauma is not the reason she is choosing this path to riches. She told news website that she's still a virgin because sex and relationships came second to school work and other commitments. Cold feet: Kern pulled out of her online auction on Wednesday, saying she wanted to focus on her studies . 'I have a busy life. I am picky and guys were never a priority,' she said. Raine claims to have bachelor's degrees in both biology and engineering and is currently completing a combined MD/PhD program, but was concerned her 'business venture' might get her thrown out of college if officials learned she's the 'Med School Virgin.' 'Lawyers have different opinions on whether I'd get kicked out, but one lawyer I trust believes it won't happen,' she said. If she had gone through with the deal, the sex would have taken place in Australia because prostitution is illegal in the U.S. Auction: Despite attracting a bid of $801,000, a source claims those making the offers went quiet when asked to prove their credentials .","The student, who is using the alias 'Elizabeth Raine,' said she wants to focus on her medical studies instead .

"A grandmother has been dubbed 'Rambo' after pulling out a gun to fight off two alleged armed robbers who attacked her in her Detroit driveway. Paris Ainsworth, 51, was shot four times in the late-night attack, but was able to return fire with eight bullets from her licensed .45 caliber handgun. The health worker said her weapon saved her life. 'If I wouldn't have had my gun I would be dead today,' the grandmother-of-four told WDIV. 'This is ludicrous, the way that they are just robbing and trying to take stuff from people, and killing people.' Survivor: Grandmother-of-four Paris Ainsworth, 51, said she fired at two robbers who shot her four times outside her Detroit home on the weekend . Tough: Paris Ainsworth, 51 (pictured left and right) said she had just returned to her Detroit home when two men threatened her with guns . Ainsworth said she was returning home to the 15400 block of Beaverland from a double shift on the weekend, when she saw two men approaching her. She said she slipped her handgun into her pocket before she got out of the car. She said one of the men then shot her four times - three in the side and once in the hand. 'He said, 'Don't pull it,' and he shot immediately',' Ainsworth said. Ainsworth then pulled out her gun and fired. 'I said, 'You mother (expletive),' and pulled out (my gun) and started shooting. One, he was right in the middle of the street. The other one was right here on the (side of the street),' she said. When the alleged attackers fled, Ainsworth waited on a neighbor's porch until EMS arrived. 'I kept applying pressure to my side and where the blood was coming from,' she said. Scene: Paris Ainsworth was shot four times in the driveway of her home on the 15400 block of Beaverland in Detroit (pictured) Treatment: Paris Ainsworth was taken to Sinai-Grace Hospital in west Detroit (pictured) for treatment, the same place where her two alleged attackers showed up and were arrested . The Detroit resident was rushed to Sinai-Grace Hospital for treatment - the same place where her alleged attackers were arrested. One of the attackers was shot in both legs. 'The victim told officers that she fired her handgun at the suspects when they attempted to rob her and did not know if the shots took effect,' Detroit police said in a statement, according to UPI. 'While at the scene, another police run was called in from the hospital stating that a male was shot.

Ainsworth said the attack brought back memories of being hit with a gun by a mugger 10 years ago. Two years ago, she got a concealed weapons permit, believing that people have a right to protect themselves with guns. 'He (the weekend attacker) didn't shoot me because he felt that I was going to shoot him. He didn't care. He just shot. He didn't look like, 'Oh my God I shouldn't have.' He just had the devil in him,' she said. 'I thank God that I'm here with my family. It was horrible. I never want to see anything like that again.'

"As the world's most famous supermodel, Kate Moss has worked with countless acclaimed photographers, designers and celebrities and now, the notoriously tight-lipped model has revealed exactly what goes on behind the closed doors of fashion. Speaking in a rare interview with photographer Nick Knight, SHOWstudio founder and long-time friend, Kate opens up about her figure, body image and enduring appeal as a model. When Knight asks her about her time as the . unwitting poster girl for 'heroin chic' - a mid-1990s look characterised by extreme slimness, pallor, dark eyes and angular bone structure - she reveals: 'I think I was just really young and . thin, I mean my daughter's tiny… . 'I was working in fashion, back in the . day they didn't feed you. The jobs I was doing they didn't have . catering.' Scroll down for video . Opening up: Kate Moss, who is usually extremely elusive and swears by the mantra 'never complain, never explain', has opened up about the industry that sky-rocketed her to fame in a candid interview . Saint Laurent Resort 2014 shirt . We adore Saint Laurent! This super model is not scared of anything! No matter what red carpet she is on, Kate is willing to try something risky, and this time it's her striped sheer shirt by Saint Laurent. Kate has shown off her more masculine, androgynous style of late, opting for tuxedo jackets and trousers, usually teamed with a fitted shirt underneath, and this one, from Saint Laurent's Resort 2014 collection, is the most luxe one we've seen her in. Even though this is head-to-toe black, the stripes on Kate's sheer shirt draw your eye in. She's a clever lady too, just about covering up enough body to be acceptable on a red carpet. Since taking over the French fashion house last year, Hedi Slimane has steered it's direction into uber cool, rock chick territory, which is where Kate comes in.

Kate, now 40, also opens up about the topless photograph by Corinne Day that featured on the cover of The Face in 1990 and catapulted her to fame at the age of 15. 'It was funny, but at the same time I was really embarrassed about my body,' she said. 'Very, very self-conscious. I was 14 or 15, still at school.' Despite fronting some of the most high-profile campaigns of the last 25 years, Kate is still mystified by her appeal. The mother, who has appeared on the cover of fashion bible Vogue 35 times, admits she has no idea why her appearance on the glossy cover causes magazine sales to sky-rocket. Heroin chic: Speaking about the angular bone structure she championed, Kate, pictured in 1993, reveals: 'I think I was just really young and thin, back in the day they didn't feed you. The jobs I was doing they didn't have catering' Modest: She has helped sell thousands of magazine covers and has fronted the most lucrative campaigns but Kate is still mystified by her appeal . 'I know it's weird though, innit? 'Cause I don't understand, I mean…let's not question it!,' she said. Having just hit the big 4-0, Mossy is busier than ever.

Bigger than ever: At the age of 40, Kate is . still going strong and one of her most popular campaigns was with St. Tropez last year . Maria Malone, Senior Lecturer and fashion expert at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: 'When .

"She's become known for her controversial comments during her participation in debates on This Morning. But on Tuesday, Katie Hopkins finally met her match - after facing off against Peaches Geldof in a discussion about attachment parenting. Despite aiming several low blows at Peaches, including referencing a picture of Peaches' son Astala falling out of his pram while the star was on the phone, Katie's argument couldn't stand up to Peaches' comments about the principles of AP. 'The panto witch has finally met her match!' Peaches Geldof shared her joy after winning a debate on attachment parenting against Katie Hopkins on This Morning on Tuesday . Following the incredibly heated debate, Peaches shared a picture of herself and a very sullen-looking Katie on Twitter, writing: 'I think we all know who won. She was quaking in her Sloanie old . boots. The panto witch finally met her match!' She later added: 'Just saw the Hopkins exiting the This Morning studios with her tail between her legs and a traumatised expression on her face. Finally!!' Katie had earlier let rip at mother-of-two Peaches, insisting that her decision to stick to the often controversial movement to raise sons Astala and Phaedra meant that she is a bad mother. Her argument reached a new low when she referenced the now infamous picture of Astala falling out of his pram, saying: 'She likes attachment parenting until her baby is on the pavement.' Heated: Katie and Peaches had a very lively debate about attachment parenting . Defending her corner: Peaches did her utmost to explain the reasons as to why she follows the principles of attachment parenting, while Katie contended otherwise . But Katie's comment didn't go down too well with This Morning hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby stepped in to defend Peaches. Phillip said: 'We've all done that. My daughter fell out of her carry chair when I was looking after her once.' And Peaches replied: 'At least I'm there for my children and not slagging them off in the press, Katie.' The lively debate began with Peaches explaining the principles of attachment parenting to Holly, Phillip and Katie. Almost coming to blows: Peaches refused to let Katie speak during the debate . Stepping in: The pair made no secret of their out-and-out dislike of each other on the show . 'Whatever she says is meaningless': Peaches labelled Katie a 'rent-a-gob' during the show . She said: 'It's sad to me that . this has a name because all it is is a return to instinctive parenting. I . follow the 7 Bs of attachment parenting - birth bonding, breastfeeding, . babywearing, bedding close to baby, belief in the language value of . your baby’s cry, beware of baby trainers and balance.' But Peaches added that while the principles of AP can be as loose or as strict as you like, she does have a routine with her two boys. She said: 'I have a . routine with my child, we have a loose feeding schedule, and they have a . really strict bed time because there are boundaries. 'It's . really not about strict rules - you can pick and choose what you like . about it, it's all inclusive. you can really mix and match.' The post that started it all: Peaches' rage stemmed from Katie sharing this picture and comment about the incident which saw her son Astala fall out of his pram . Peaches was then asked about the fact that her husband Tom Cohen sleeps in a separate bed while she sleeps with the children. She . said: 'With my family it's because I have two babies under 2. One is 17 . months and one is 7 months. We have a bed that is 9ft wide because when . you sleep with your baby you have to be safe.' When . pressed about how the sleeping arrangements affect her sex life, . Peaches replied: 'I have two babies under two so obviously I am doing . something in the bedroom. Hold on a minute: Katie was unimpressed when Peaches jumped in with her own comments as she was speaking . 'Whatever she says is meaningless': Peaches dismissed Katie's remarks without a second thought . 'Just . because I sleep in bed with my babies doesn't mean I'm in bed with them . 24/7. They go to bed at 7, but I don't go to bed at 7. We go to another . bedroom in the house and watch television or do other things couples . do. 'I'm 24 and my husband is 23, we obviously like being intimate with each other!' Phillip . and Holly then gave Katie chance to chime in, with the former . Apprentice star saying: 'It's all a bit ""knit your own Birkenstocks"" for . me. AP is just one step away from CR-AP parenting.' The many faces of Katie Hopkins: The presenter let her frustration show on her face . Head in hands: Peaches also appeared to be finding it frustrating when Katie wouldn't listen to her points . At least she's making herself laugh: Katie aimed several low blows at Peaches during the debate . But Peaches was unwilling to let Katie speak, insisting: 'Whatever you say is meaningless', before adding to Phillip and Holly: 'She's just a rent-a-gob.' Given another chance to step in on the debate, Katie said: 'I . think it's really important that mums are mums and that they are in . control. AP parents thinks it's important that you're there straight . away if the baby cries, . 'But . I think it's important to see that as a mother you put you baby down to . sleep and if they want to cry, then they should go for it.' On . the issue of baby wearing, which sees mothers hold their children close . to them via a sling, Katie said: 'I wear a handbag, I don't wear a . baby. 'You see these women . with 15 metres worth of Indian print fabric, it's always Indian print, . wrapped around their body and somewhere in there there's a mewling baby.' Victory! Peaches looked delighted as she posed up outside the ITV studios before heading home . Just about smiling: Katie's exit appearance was less cheery than Peaches' But Peaches contended: 'It's been going on for generations since mothers were in caves. For . years and years, especially in less economically developed countries, mothers sleep with . their babies and have a wildly less instance of mental health problems and . health problems in general. The reason is because they are doing this thing that says to your baby, ""I love you, I'm there for you"".' [caption . When Katie attempted to step in once . again, Peaches responded: 'This is a prime example of someone who wasn't . attachment parented when she was growing up. 'This is someone who goes on the media to slag off other women and slag off her own children.' Given the last five seconds to conclude her argument, Katie said: 'It's important to let your babies live their lives. 'Attachment parents are crap parents.' The row between Peaches and Katie had started before they even arrived at This Morning. On . Twitter on Tuesday morning, Katie had attempted to antagonise Peaches . by sharing a picture of Astala falling out of his pram, writing: 'Peaches believes in attachment parenting. Attached to a phone that is...' However, following Katie's tweet, Peaches was quick to respond, blasting her for her accusation. She wrote: 'I . don't even want to reply to Katie Hopkins desperate, incessant tweeting . because it feeds her insatiable lust for recognition. However her . posting low blows like a picture of my son falling from his pram when I . tripped over a crack in a pavement has warranted at least a few . responses from me. 'This is the woman who wrote of a disabled sporting . hero that she hoped that she would roll over nails on her way to a TV . appearance. This is the woman who hates women, ethnic minorities, anyone . with less money, anyone who dares point out the glaringly obvious about her . own children on a regular basis.' Peaches most catty barb came when she commented: 'I wouldn't be surprised if she had a . shrivelled old pair of balls under that 1980s sloaney tweed skirt of . hers. All the better to castrate her with.'

"She was nicknamed The Body thanks to those famous Sports Illustrated shoots that showed off her lithe limbs and golden glow - and, unsurprisingly, Elle Macpherson is safeguard to keep the looks that catapulted her to fame. Elle, who turned 50 in March, has launched five new professional beauty tools to extend her successful The Body wellbeing gadget line which launched in 2010. Elle has used the tips and tricks she's picked up over her many years in the fashion and beauty industry to create a range of products she hopes will help women achieve her polished look at home. Beauty buff: Supermodel Elle Macpherson has made a fortune looking good and now she's created a range of tools to help women stay preened . One of her hero products is the £39.99 Wet and Dry Face and Body Brush. Speaking about the exfoliater, she says: 'A key part of my beauty regime is exfoliation. The benefits are amazing, helping to remove dead skin cells, increase circulation and aid cell renewal. 'I always feel a noticeable difference leaving my skin smooth and glowing. Take the hassle out of dry brushing with my new 4 in 1 wet and dry brush. The battery-powered rotating head means it does all the hard work for you! You can use it all over your body and it's even suitable for the shower.' There is also a £19.99 heel smoother, which aims to give an at-home pedicure. 'It's so easy to neglect your feet but as summer approaches, keeping them in tip-top condition is a must,' Elle said. The supermodel has also included a hot wax epilator in the range, a manicure and pedicure kit and a compact mirror. All the tools a girl needs: Elle has used the tips and tricks that she has picked up over the years to create an at-home salon range, including manicure kits and body brushes . Clearly Elle isn't letting reaching her half century dampen her career goals. She also recently unveiled a range of supergreens. Speaking at the launch, the supermodel said: 'I feel loved, balanced, happy, healthy and at peace with who I am. 'Feeling good on the inside is more important to me now...looking good follows. My secret? Love, laughter...and my super greens.' The body: Elle Macpherson turned fifty earlier this year and has unveiled her own super greens to celebrate. Clearly the Australian supermodel has no plans on slowing down . Like fellow models Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Elle swears by the power of all things green and she is so convinced by their potency, that she has unveiled her very own brand. Elle introduced The Super Elixir by WelleCo, a range of alkalising food supplements, formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street nutritional doctor specialising in disease prevention. The powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is working to its optimum function. Super greens: The new product was formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street Nutritional Doctor specialising in disease prevention, and now she's unleashing it to the world . Strength: 'The Super Elixir balances and strengthens me, to enable me to be the woman and mother I want to be, and now I want to share it!,' says Elle . The product, which costs £98, is designed to support healthy nutrition at a cellular level and aid the digestive, endocrine (hormonal), circulatory and nervous systems. Packed with 45 key ingredients, including alkalising super greens, Chinese herbs, and the miatake mushroom, Elle claims that just 10g of the powder daily contains all the vitamins, minerals and trace elements you need to promote wellness and vitality. 'There's so much discussion surrounding health and fitness but what I really aspire to is wellness. Spiritual, emotional and physical...and in my experience they are closely interrelated,' she explains. Supers: Valentino Garavani, fashion designer, with models Claudia Schiffer and Elle Macpherson at a show in Paris in 1995 . Model behaviour: Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model, which Elle was a judge on, was cancelled last year . 'It's not something you achieve simply through going to the gym, using expensive creams or speaking to a therapist, it's a feeling of balance and strength that originates from within and on a cellular level. 'The Super Elixir balances and strengthens me, to enable me to be the woman and mother I want to be, and now I want to share it!' Elle's new collaborations come at just the right time for the model, who was dealt two sets of bad news last year. Fashion Star, the show she hosted in 2012 and produced in 2013, was cancelled in July. Three . months later it was announced that the other show Macpherson starred . in, Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model, was also cancelled. Elle, who began modelling in the early 80s in order to earn money to pay for her law books, also has several other business ventures under her belt, including a lingerie line and skincare range.","Elle turned 50 earlier this year .

"Eight members of the U.S. Senate are calling on the Food and Drug Administration to examine new research suggesting that some electronic cigarettes can produce dangerous carcinogens similar to those from traditional cigarettes. In a letter sent on Thursday, the Democratic lawmakers say that the FDA should work to protect e- cigarette users and those nearby from cancer-causing vapors apparently produced by high-powered nicotine devices, known as tank systems. Electronic cigarettes mainly consist of a battery, heating coil and a tank that holds flavored liquid nicotine. As users puff on the e-cigarette, the battery heats the coil and the liquid is turned into a vapor that is inhaled like smoke from a traditional cigarette. Members of the Senate are calling on the FDA to examine new research suggesting that some electronic cigarettes can produce dangerous carcinogens similar to those from traditional cigarettes . Tank systems are generally larger e-cigarettes - about the size of an electronic toothbrush - that can hold more nicotine and an extended battery supply. Studies first reported by The New York Times suggest that these devices get hot enough to produce toxic chemicals like formaldehyde, a carcinogen also found in traditional cigarettes. E-cigarette proponents have argued that the devices are a safer alternative to cigarettes because they do not produce the smoke and tar caused by burning tobacco. But the new research by scientists at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute challenges that reasoning, at least for some products. Tank systems are generally larger e-cigarettes - about the size of an electronic toothbrush - that can hold more nicotine and an extended battery supply . The Buffalo, New York-based center's study is scheduled for publication later this month in the Nicotine and Tobacco Research journal, according to the Times. The findings also raise questions about the potential hazards of e-cigarettes for non-users who inadvertently inhale their vapors. New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles have all recently instituted bans on the use of e-cigarettes in certain indoor areas and public places. Last month the FDA announced it would begin regulating the emerging e-cigarette field. But the senators point out that the FDA's proposal focuses mainly on e-cigarette ingredients, rather than the vapors they produce. 'We simply cannot afford to lag behind in our complete understanding of the health consequences to the user and bystander of these and other advanced nicotine delivery products,' states the letter. It was signed by Sens. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Jack Reed, D-Conn., Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Dick Durbin, D-Ill. New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles have all recently instituted bans on the use of e-cigarettes in certain indoor areas and public places . An FDA spokeswoman said in a statement that the agency is also funding research into the safety of e-cigarette vapor, including one of the studies referenced by the senators. 'Where the science does not exist, we are able to fund the research to answer key questions related to e-cigarette safety and consumer behavior. 'In fact, FDA is funding dozens of studies that will help answer those questions, including four studies alone that will focus on the contents of e-cigarette vapor,' said Jennifer Haliski. The FDA is now taking public comments on its proposal, which treads fairly lightly on the $2 billion e-cigarette market. The FDA's plan would ban e-cigarette sales to anyone under 18, add warning labels and require FDA approval for new products. It does not include measures favored by many anti-smoking advocates, such as a ban on TV advertising and fruit- or candy-flavored e-cigarettes. Scientists haven't completed much research on whether e-cigarettes actually help smokers kick the habit or simply serve as a gateway to paper-and-tobacco cigarettes. The government is pouring millions into research to supplement independent and company studies on the health risks of e-cigarettes and other new tobacco products.","New research .

"A Los Angeles man was arrested and charged with murder after police say he intentionally crashed into an LAPD patrol car over the weekend, killing one officer and injuring another to stop them from pursuing his friend. Roberto Sanchez, 32, a six-year veteran on the force, died at a hospital after the patrol car he was driving was broadsided by an SUV in the Harbor City area Saturday. The squad car was so mangled that Sanchez's partner had to call for help on his personal cell phone because the police radio wasn't working. Scroll down for video . Mynor Varela (left), 20, has been charged with murder for causing a crash in Los Angeles that killed six-year LAPD veteran Roberto Sanchez, 32 (right) Horror crash: Varela's Chevy SUV rammed into Sanchez's patrol car on the driver's side, leaving the car so mangled that the fatally injured officer had to be extricated by firefighters . LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said Sanchez, who only recently got married, was on patrol with his best friend and partner when the collision occurred. The surviving officer, Richard Medina, was hospitalized with a broken jaw and other injuries. He was released home Monday. Mynor Varela, 20, has been charged with second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, assault on a police officer and leaving the scene of an accident, Los Angeles Times reported. He pleaded not guilty to all counts Wednesday and is being held without bond. Varela’s next court date is June 11. Varela's brother, 19-year-old Bryan Varela, was also detained in connection to the fatal hit-and-run crash because he was a passenger in the SUV. Sabotage: Police say Varela and his brother, 19-year-old Bryan Varela (right), slammed into the police car on purpose to stop the officers from pursuing their friend . Catastrophic impact: The collision was so devastating that it broke the radio in the squad car, forcing Sanchez's partner to call for help on his personal cell phone . During a press conference held Thursday morning, LAPD officials revealed that Varela intentionally rammed his Chevy Tahoe into Officer Sanchez's squad car while he and his partner were chasing a Chevrolet Camaro following a traffic violation. At around 3.45am Saturday, the patrol car and the Camaro were driving eastbound on Anaheim Street in Harbor City and had just made a U-turn when Varela's SUV slammed into the LAPD vehicle on its driver's side. ‘He did this in order to aid a friend who was driving a Camaro that the police vehicle was following,’ said Beck. Following the collision, Varela and his brother took off from the scene without helping the injured officers, according to police. Both men were taken into custody a short time later. Officer Sanchez was rushed to a hospital after being extricated from the crumpled patrol car and died from his injuries soon after. An only child, Sanchez is survived by his parents and his wife of only three months. The driver of the Camaro has been identified and interviewed by police, but he has not been arrested. According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Varela has a valid driver's license with no reportable accidents, citations or suspensions. His younger brother, however, had a prior conviction on a DUI charge and evading police, Orange County Register reported. End of watch: Somber LAPD officers lined up outside Harbor-UCLA Medical Center where Roberto Sanchez died from his injuries . Tragic newlywed: A woman believed to be the fallen officer's wife of only three months is seen sobbing outside the hospital . Mynor Varela’s attorney, Regina Filippon, lamented after Wednesday's court hearing that prosecutors were ‘throwing everything but the kitchen sink’ at him, even though he has no criminal record, according to MyFox LA. Filippon also said that it remains unknown if police plan to file charges against her client’s sibling. Sanchez was the third LAPD officer to die on the job recently. In March, 40-year-old Officer Nicholas Choung Lee was killed when his patrol car was hit by a dump truck in Beverly Hills. Last month, 51-year-old motorcycle officer Chris Cortijo was struck and killed by a driver alleged to have been under the influence of cocaine. Mayor Eric Garcetti ordered city flags lowered to half-staff. 'This third loss of an officer in the line of duty in just two months is a stark and tragic reminder of the dangers our first responders face every day,' Garcetti said in a statement. The Los Angeles police union called Sanchez a hero. 'Today the world has lost a true hero. Roberto will be greatly missed as a protector of our society and even more as a person,' Los Angeles Police Protective League President Tyler Izen said in a statement.","Officer Roberto Sanchez, 32, a six-year veteran on the force, died from his injuries Saturday; he married only three months ago .

"Wind farms have just half the useful lifespan which has been claimed, according to new research which found they start to wear out after just 12 years. A study of almost 3,000 turbines in Britain – the largest of its kind – sheds doubt on manufacturers claims that they generate clean energy for up to 25 years, which is used by the Government to calculate subsidies. Professor Gordon Hughes, an economist at Edinburgh University and former energy advisor to the World Bank, predicts in the coming decade far more investment will be needed to replace older and ineffective turbines – which is likely to be passed on in higher household electricity bills. New research: Wind farms have just half the useful lifespan which has been claimed, according to new research which found they start to wear out after just 12 years . He said the performance of the UK’s wind turbines over the past 11 years had ‘deteriorated markedly’ and that ‘the subsidy regime is extremely generous if investment in new wind farms is profitable despite the decline in performance due to age and over time.’ The research will fuel criticism of wind farms which are already unpopular among many local communities who say they blight the landscape, generate noise and may disrupt wildlife. But the government which plans to increase the number of turbines from the current 3,873 to 10,000 within the next decade, insists they are essential to fight climate change. Predictions: Professor Gordon Hughes, an economist at Edinburgh University and former energy advisor to the World Bank . Ministers are currently drawing up plans to compensate local communities affected by them with investment – which have critics have dismissed as bribery. Prof Hughes’ study of 280 wind farms in Britain and more than 800 in Denmark from 2000 to 2011, found the larger wind farms typical in Britain are less effective than smaller ones. In Denmark, where wind power has been used for longer, the decline in output was less dramatic, which he said could be down to their smaller size and possibly better maintenance. For onshore wind, the monthly ‘load factor’ of turbines – a measure of how much electricity they generate as a percentage of how much they could produce if on at full power all the time - dropped from a high of 24 per cent in the first year after construction, to just 11 per cent after 15 years. For offshore wind –examined only in Denmark where it has been used for longer - it declined even more dramatically from over 40 per cent at the start, to just 15 per cent after ten years. He believes they become uneconomic after around 12 years. The decline in output was put down to wear and tear of the blades, and more frequent breakdowns for older turbines. His report for the anti-wind farm charity the Renewable Energy Foundation (KEEP), noted: ‘Onshore wind turbines represent a relatively mature technology, which ought to have achieved a satisfactory level of reliability in operation as plants age. Unfortunately detailed analysis of the relationship between age and performance gives a rather different picture…’ Prof Hughes told the Sunday Telegraph the trend for larger wind turbines in Britain, which reach up to 400feet tall in some areas increased wear and tear. Future: The research predicts in the coming decade far more investment will be needed to replace older and ineffective turbines - which is likely to be passed on in higher household electricity bills . He added: ‘I strongly believe the bigger turbines are proving more difficult to manage and more likely to interfere with one another.’ He said the data was verified by a statistician at University College London. It will give ammunition to many Tory MPs who are sceptical about the merits of wind farms and believe the subsidies given to the industry are too high. More than 100 wrote to the Prime Minister this year saying they were inefficient. But the Department of Energy and Climate Change say wind produced enough energy to power 2.4million homes in 2011 and they hope this will increase to 7.7million by 2020. A spokesman said: ‘Our expectations of wind turbine lifetimes are based on rigorous analysis and evidence. Britain’s oldest commercial turbines at Delabole in Cornwall have only recently been replaced after 20 years of operation, and the technology has come on leaps and bounds since that project started generating in 1991. ‘Consumer support for renewable power is based on the actual power generated. That’s why it is in the interest of wind farm operators that they keep their turbines well-maintained and running at optimum capacity.’ The wind farm industry point out that turbines are improving all the time, and say that subsidies are only paid when turbines produce electricity so there is a strong incentive for operators to protect them from wear and tear.","Study of almost 3,000 turbines in Britain sheds doubt on manufacturers claims that they generate clean energy for up to 25 years .

His lawyers said he had gunshot wounds to his head, face, throat, jaw, left hand and legs after the shoot out that occurred when he was found hiding in a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts. Tsarnaev's health 'suddenly declined' immediately after he was transported to a local hospital and doctors were forced to perform emergency surgery to keep him alive. Tsarnaev is accused of working with his now-dead brother to place two bombs near the finish line of the 2013 marathon, killing three people and injured more than 260. His trial is scheduled for November . He was intubated throughout the night and given heavy pain medication like Dilaudid, Fentanyl, and Propofol which was one of the prescription drugs that Michael Jackson overdosed on when he died. Just 20 hours after being brought to the hospital, he was questioned by investigators in a session that lasted for about 36 hours in spite of his repeated requests for a lawyer and rest. His left eye was sutured closed, had a tracheotomy tube down his throat, couldn't hear out of his left ear, and his mouth was wired shut throughout the interrogation. His legal team submitted the new documents to the court in an effort to suppress the statements he made- using a notepad because of his inability to speak- during the questioning session. Rights denied: Tsarnaev's lawyers argued that he wrote notes asking for a lawyer at least 10 times during his questioning immediately after coming out of surgery . Defense attorneys said the questioning continued 'despite the fact that he quickly allayed concerns about any continuing threat to public safety, repeatedly asked for a lawyer, and begged to rest.' 'The questioning continued for hours, in what was obviously an effort to extract as much incriminating information as possible, without regard for the protections of the Fifth Amendment,' the filing states. They said his treatment included painkillers that impaired his judgment and increased his susceptibility to pressure. Documents reveal that he complained about his pain and said that he needed to vomit. 'Mr. Tsarnaev wrote answers to questions in a notebook because he was unable to speak,' his defense team wrote in the motion filed Wednesday. 'These notes reflect his attempt to respond to urgent questions (he assured the agents that no public safety threat remained) as well as his poor functioning and limited cognitive ability. 'In all, he wrote the word ‘lawyer’ ten times, sometimes circling it. 'One of the agents insisted, nonsensically, that Mr. Tsarnaev was not in custody.' There are instances where the pen trailed off the page, and his legal team is arguing that it is a sign of him passing out or losing control of his motor function during the interrogation. At one point, Dzhokhar's note implies that the questioning agents lied to him about his brother, Tamerlan, who had been killed in a shootout days earlier. In one note, Dzhokhar wrote: 'Is my brother alive I know you said he is are you lying Is he alive?' 'These questions went well beyond even the Department of Justice's own written policy regarding use of the public safety exception to interrogate members of terrorist organizations,' his legal team wrote. The lawyers said his rights also were violated when his appearance in court was delayed to complete the interrogation, during which he told authorities about how the bombs were built and about the brothers' activities before and after the bombing. 'Agents made clear by word and deed that they would not allow him to see a lawyer until they had finished questioning him,' his defense team's filing said. According to ABC News, the prosecution has implied that they will not be using any of the bedside statements in the trial, but they have not formally noted that in court documents, so yesterday's filing is seeking a notarized version of that agreement. Also on Wednesday, the defense asked the judge to declare the federal death penalty unconstitutional. Security concerns: The FBI argues that they were able to question Dzhokhar without a lawyer present because they needed answers immediately about whether or not there were any more bombs or threats to public safety after he was caught . They cited 'worldwide revulsion over the recurring spectacle of botched executions,' including one in Oklahoma last month when the inmate was straining to lift his head off a pillow after supposedly being rendered unconscious. Tsarnaev's lawyers said the U.S. Constitution's protection against cruel and unusual punishment prohibits the application of the death penalty because it's not authorized under Massachusetts law. Mind games: Dzhokhar's notes also implies that the interrogators told him that his brother Tamerlan (pictured) was alive even though he had died during an earlier shoot out . The lawyers also asked the judge to bar federal prosecutors from arguing that targeting the crowded athletic event last year is a factor a jury should consider when weighing his possible punishment if he's convicted. The lawyers said the decision to bomb the marathon shouldn't be an 'aggravating factor' in determining whether he should receive the death penalty because prosecutors also argue he committed the offense after substantial planning to cause death and commit an act of terrorism. 'Stated differently, the allegation that Tsarnaev targeted the marathon is simply a more specific statement of the substantial planning allegation,' Tsarnaev's lawyers wrote in a court filing. Federal law requires the jury to reach its sentencing decision by weighing each aggravating factor cited by prosecutors against mitigating factors cited by the defense. Tsarnaev's lawyers said having duplicative aggravating factors 'can have no other effect than to introduce arbitrariness and unfairness into the jury's sentencing deliberations.' Tsarnaev, 20, has pleaded not guilty to several federal charges. Prosecutors allege he and his brother, 26, planted two pressure cooker bombs near the marathon's finish line, killing three people and injuring more than 260.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was shot in the head, face, throat, jaw, hand and legs .

"Police in Brazil have launched a manhunt after the severed head of a former professional footballer was left on the doorstep of his home. The horrified wife of Joao Rodrigo Silva Santos, 35, made the gruesome discovery as she left the house in Rio de Janeiro for work early yesterday morning. Santos's eyes and tongue had been cut out and his head placed inside one of his own rucksacks, police said. Scroll Down for Video . Beheaded: The head of former footballer Joao Rodrigo Silva Santos, was found on his wife's doorstep . The striker retired from football two . years ago after playing for several second-tier teams in Rio de . Janeiro, as well as for Swedish club . Oster Vaxjo and Olimpia in Honduras, between 1996 and 2005. He scored 33 goals in . 103 matches in Brazil and was nicknamed Humble Hero. He had recently set up his own business selling health foods and dietary supplements. Police said Santos is believed to have been snatched from outside the shop he had opened in the Realengo district of Rio as he closed up at around 7.45pm on Monday. Witnesses said they saw several men bundling him into his car, a Hyundai i30, and speeding off just before midnight, a spokesman said. He was reported missing by his wife at 9pm on Monday. Santos' brother-in-law, who didn't want to be named, told Brazil's Globo G1 website that the player's wife, Geisa Silva, 31, stayed up all night after her husband failed to arrive home. Motive? Police are investigating if the murder is linked to Santos' wife's work to reclaim favelas from drugs gangs . He said: 'Every time a car passed by she would go to see. 'She was getting ready to go to work at around 5.30am when she heard a noise, opened the front door and saw his rucksack. 'When she opened it she discovered it . contained his head. 'I did not want to look but the people who saw it . said they had gouged out his eyes and cut off his tongue,' said the . horrified relative. Neighbours living close to the crime scene reported hearing a woman screaming: 'My God, it's Joao! It’s Joao’s head.' 'From what I know, he didn't have any enemies and neither did his wife,' the relative added. In a statement Santos' widow said the couple had not been subjected to any threats. Lead murder investigator Rafael Rangel . from the 14th Military Police Battalion (BPM) in Rio, said witnesses . saw armed men kidnap the businessman. 'We believe the people who took him knew the family’s routine,' said Rangel. Investigators are working on the . hypothesis that Santos could have been murdered by a drugs gang . because of Mrs Silva's work at a military police base in a local slum. Shanty town: Shacks sit stacked atop each other in Catumbi, a favela in Rio . The . Police Pacification Unit in the Morro do Sao Carlos is one of dozens . set up in Rio's favelas to retake control of the city's slums from . violent drug traffickers. However, . according to police chief Rafael Rangel, Mrs Silva worked as a social . worker in the base and didn't patrol the streets or make arrests like . other police officers. He told Brazil's O Dia newspaper the motives of the murder are still unclear. He . said: 'Mrs Silva has no idea who would have done this. Neither she, her . husband or any other member of the family have suffered any type of . threat as far as she knows. 'There is nothing that would justify such a barbarous crime.' Santos did not have a police record. Later today Brazilian police said body parts dumped beside a city river were believed to be those of Mr Santos. The player's brother-in-law told Brazil's Globo G1 website that family members had positively identified a torso found next to the Guandu river in Queimados, greater Rio de Janeiro, by a birth mark on Mr Santos' stomach. Crime . ridden: Brazil still has an alarmingly high murder rate, and armed . thefts and carjackings continue to be facts of daily life . A police spokesman said other body parts had also been found in the area and were being DNA tested. He said the murder bears the hallmarks of an execution by drug gangsters, but stressed that 'every line of investigation' is still open. The couple had been together for 11 years and were described as ‘lovely’ by neighbours. 'They were a happy, quiet couple,' said a neighbour, who asked not to be identified. 'But you never know what may have motivated a crime as stupid and as senseless as this.' A recent United Nations report into drug trafficking-related crime in Brazil found that more than half of the homicides, robberies and thefts have a direct or indirect link with this criminal activity.","Witnesses saw armed men kidnap Joao Rodrigo Silva Santos on Monday .

"Britain was plunged into a diplomatic crisis over Gibraltar last night after Spanish police fired shots at a British jet-skier in waters around the Rock. In an extraordinary incident, a boat from Spain’s Guardia Civil entered Gibraltan waters and took potshots at 32-year-old Dale Villa as he rode his jet-ski close to a popular beach. Mr Villa is not wanted for any particular crime and is not thought to have strayed out of British waters into Spanish territory – although the line between the two is far from clear to people in the sea. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Britain was plunged into a diplomatic crisis over Gibraltar after Spanish police fired shots at British jet-skier Dale Villa, pictured, in waters around the Rock . The Gibraltar government has called on the UK to bring the matter up with Spain on the 'highest diplomatic and military levels' after four Spanish fighter planes allegedly entered its airspace . Foreign Office minister David . Lidington condemned the shooting as ‘completely unacceptable’ and called . on Spain to take action against those responsible. He said he had confronted his Spanish counterpart Inigo Mendez de Vigo yesterday to protest ‘in the strongest possible terms’. Mr . Lidington added: ‘I made it clear that the discharge of a weapon in or . near Gibraltar is completely unacceptable. I urged Mr Mendez de Vigo to . investigate urgently and to take action to ensure this will not happen . again.’ Father-of-three Mr . Villa described how he had been fired at on two separate occasions as he . tested his new jet-ski with family and friends on Sunday afternoon. ‘I was very shaken and furious,’ said the delivery driver. ‘When . a huge boat is hurling after you and you hear gunshots it is very . scary. There were three policemen on the boat and I actually saw one of . them with a gun in his hand. Worrying: The jet ski rider said he had been taking friends and family members on rides when he was chased by the Guardia Civil vessel . Dramatic: This video footage shows the jet ski being chased . ‘I was just about to drop my friend off at West Beach when I heard the first shot. ‘I don’t really think we took it seriously or believed it could be a gun, but clearly it was. ‘I . jumped back on again and whizzed off before realising the boat was . chasing after me and had soon fired three more shots at me. ‘I . had only just taken my friend’s ten-year-old daughter out for a spin . and was about to pick up her grandmother so we were not being . threatening or doing anything wrong. The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major source of tension between the UK and Spain. Both in 1967 and 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty. Yet, despite this, Spain still asserts a claim to the territory. The tension began in 1704 when an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltor from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession. The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Historically, it has proved to be an important base for the Royal Navy. Now, its economy is based on tourism, financial services and shipping. Under the 2006 constitution of Gibraltar, the territory governs its own . affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the . responsibility of the UK Government. Located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres. ‘Maybe . these guys were bored – it being a Sunday – but I really hope something . is going to be done about it, as it is outrageous.’ Shots can be heard . on a grainy video filmed by a witness. British sources said it was . thought the Spanish police fired rubber bullets at the man. Witness . Simy Herbert described the Guardia Civil as ‘trigger-happy’, adding: . ‘The Foreign Office has to do something now because when someone is shot . in our waters then everybody will start flapping.’ The UK’s charge d’affaires in Madrid was also despatched to make direct representations to ministers in the Spanish capital. The . incident is believed to have been witnessed by an off-duty officer from . the Royal Gibraltar Police, which has launched a formal investigation. But a spokesman for Spain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said ‘no . incident’ had taken place’ and ‘no shot fired’. Britain was given Gibraltar in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but Spain has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty. British . sources said Gibraltar suffered frequent illegal incursions into its . waters by Spanish boats, including police and naval vessels. From . December last year to April, officials recorded 176 illegal incursions . by Spanish boats. Last . November, Madrid was accused of an unlawful incursion into Britain’s . territorial waters after a Spanish warship called Vencedora, a 288ft . corvette, came within three miles of Gibraltar’s coast. The ship ignored radio warnings to leave the area and HMS Scimitar, a seven-man patrol boat, was scrambled to intercept. Gibraltar . Chief Minister Fabian Picardo described the incident as a ‘scandalous . act of aggression which is illegal, imprudent, unprofessional and . irresponsible’. Shooting: This map shows how the incident unfolded . Action: Following the shooting, a Royal Navy Rib similar to this intercepted the Rio Cedena and told it to leave the waters . Incident: The Rio Cedena boat which the shots were fired from is similar to this Guardia Civil boat . In a joint . statement, Tory MEPs Giles Chichester, Ashley Fox and Julie Girling – . who represent Gibraltar in the European Parliament – said Spanish . provocation was ‘a form of international political posturing by a . struggling government which hopes to distract attention from its . domestic failures’. They . added: ‘For a shot to be fired will push to a new level the offence . caused to the people of Gibraltar. 'This action is wholly illegal and as . provocative as it is reckless.’","Shots fired in British territorial waters on Sunday evening .

"It may fall under the category of 'reality television', but there is apparently very little that's authentic about Breaking Amish. After just two episodes, the TLC show has come under fire for deceiving viewers about the five Amish and Mennonite men and women it follows as they visit New York City for the first time. While each cast member claims to have grown up in the strict communities, evidence has surfaced suggesting they have decidedly dark pasts - involving divorce, children and time away from the faith. It comes in stark contrast to the naive characters portrayed on the show, who stare slack-jawed at Manhattan's towering buildings and pray as they travel by plane 'for the first time'. Scroll down for video . 'Reality' TV? TLC's show Breaking Amish has come under fire for its false claims about its characters' pasts . TLC has previously admitted that Kate, who is billed as an Amish bishop's daughter and aspiring model, has been arrested for a DUI, but now new information paints an even more rebellious picture. As revealed on a Facebook page, Breaking Amish the Truth, she has previously submitted images to modeling agencies - which is at odds with the Amish stance against photographs, believing they represent 'vanity' which they deem a sin. Online records show that Kate posted a photograph on exploretalent.com to enter a Best Smile contest in 2010 - years before she claimed she gave up her Amish life to move to the city. This internet savvy version of Kate is a far cry from an episode of Breaking Amish in which she is overwhelmed by new technology and struggles to work an elevator. Dark pasts: TLC had previously admitted that Kate, pictured left on the show, was arrested for DUI, right . Aspiring model: A photo of Kate has been found online from a smiling contest in 2010 . Questions: This is at odds with the persona she portrays on the show. Here, she struggles to work a lift . Two other cast members, Rebecca and Abe, are portrayed as meeting for the first time on the show - with a possible love match on the cards. But a photograph apparently shows that the pair in fact already have a child together. And while Abe claims in the program that he has never partied, police records - and a mug shot - reveal he was arrested for alcohol intoxication in a public place in 2008, when he was just 18. Jeremiah, another cast member, was reportedly away from his Amish community for up to 14 years and is pictured on social networking sites surrounded by beer cans. Public records also reveal that 32-year-old Jeremiah, who regularly swears on the show, is divorced and has three children -  two daughters, aged seven and three, and a son, five. 'False claims': On the show, Rebecca and Abe, pictured, claim they have never met before . Secret: A photograph on Facebook apparently shows two more cast members, Rebecca and Abe, with their baby - even though they 'meet for the first time' on the show . Nerves: On the show, Rebecca is seen praying as she takes the flight to New York City . The children live with their mother . in Ohio. The couple married in 2005 and she filed for divorce in 2011, . citing gross neglect of duty and incompatibility. Brush with the law: A mug shot of Abe from 2008 after he was arrested for being drunk in public . 'I've known him for years,' said Daniel Gingerich, who claims he lived with Jeremiah for a year and a half. 'I let him move in because he was living out of his truck and had no place else to go.' In the show, he is seen leaving his girlfriend for New York but it . is rare for Amish people to divorce so Jeremiah would unlikely have . been accepted back into the community and have started a new relationship. The final character, Sabrina, a 25-year-old from an Italian and Puerto Rico family who was adopted into the faith, is pictured on Facebook kissing a man while she wears skimpy clothing. She was reportedly married in 2009 and has not been a practicing Mennonite for years, friends claim, suggesting this is not the 'first time' she has left the community. The apparent betrayal by the creators of Breaking Amish is documented on a Facebook page, Breaking Amish the Truth, on which people who claim to know the cast have vented their anger. Scores of people have also uploaded photographs showing the cast in their 'real' lives. Mose Gingerich, a former Amish who appeared on a separate show, Amish in the City, lambasted the show for its dishonesty. On the show: Jeremiah says he is desperate to break away from his Amish community on the show - but has reportedly already spent 14 years away . Past: Photographs from an old MySpace page show Jeremiah looking decidedly un-Amish . Wild: Pictures also show Jeremiah, left, surrounded by friends swigging from beer cans . 'This show is doing exactly opposite of what I stand for,' he wrote on his blog. 'The fakeness of these characters supposedly just leaving the community, when in fact, they have been out for many years. 'The fact that they act like things like microwaves and iPhones are something strange, when indeed, they have owned them for years themselves, and the disrespect they show towards the Amish. 'I would never stoop to doing a show like this, and really wish no one else would have done it either.' In response to the outrage, TLC has said it will address the revelations in time. 'There is a lot of information . floating around about the group featured on Breaking Amish. Much of it . is not true, but some of it is - and is addressed in upcoming episodes,' TLC told Variety. 'Our Amish and Mennonite producers that we hired introduced us to . Amish and Mennonite men and women who were already determined to leave. They had already made the decision to go out and see . the world, with or without us. They courageously allowed us to follow . them on this journey.' Half truths: Sabrina, a Mennonite, was reportedly married in 2009 - which is not mentioned on the show . Double life: But Facebook photos apparently show her kissing a man and wearing skimpy clothes . Bewildered: On the show, the cast members are portrayed as naive and fearful of New York City . Despite these protestations, TLC has adjusted the description of the show on its website. It was previously billed as 'four Amish and one Mennonite, breaking away from their faith and traveling to New York City for the first time'. Now the TLC site explains: 'Breaking Amish offers an unprecedented look into a rarely seen world, following four Amish people and one Mennonite as they forgo horses and buggies for New York City's taxis and subways' - taking out any reference to 'first time' in New York City.

"Demi wants Ashton to pay maintenance and legal costs . Filed response three months after Ashton moved to legally end marriage . Ashton earned $24m last year from new show Two And A Half Men . Demi Moore is seeking spousal support and money for legal fees from estranged husband Ashton Kutcher in their divorce battle, it emerged on Thursday. The news comes more than a year after the pair split and three months after Kutcher filed papers to legally sever their six-year marriage. Moore finally responded on Thursday by lodging her own application at the Los Angeles Superior Court. Moore cites 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for the split, stating the date of marriage as September 24th, 2005 and the date of separation as November 17 , 2011 - two months after Kutcher's alleged one-night stand with party girl Sara Leal. While the couple have no children together, the financial stakes are high. Costly split: Demi Moore is seeking spousal support from Ashton Kutcher in their divorce battle after lodging an application at the Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday . The pair are jointly worth a reputed $285m and in the last year alone Kutcher earned $24m from the CBS show Two And A Half Men. On Wednesday it was reported how talks between the couple have broken down over money. The pair could now be facing a courtroom showdown to resolve their differences. Kutcher, 35, is said to have become ‘hostile’ whilst Moore, 50, has supposedly ‘had enough’ of his refusal to budge. The couple split in 2011 after six . years together and since then there has been much speculation about why . they have not formally divorced. Rebuttal: Moore filed her own divorce application, three months after Kutcher started the severance process . A source told the New York Post that . money could well be the issue - Kutcher is the highest paid actor in US . TV. His personal fortune is estimated at $135 whilst Moore’s is thought to be around $150m thanks to her hit . films in the 1980s and 90s. A source told the New York Post: . ‘Ashton made a lot of money after marrying Demi - a lot more than she . made - but despite him becoming just as famous through her, he believes . he doesn’t owe her that much. ‘Ashton has been very difficult during the talks. You could even say he has been hostile. ‘After over a year of attempting to . reach a settlement, Demi is definitely ready to move on. It’s hoped . lawyers for both sides can reach a settlement this spring, otherwise the . divorce will go into litigation and trial.’ As they were: The couple split in 2011 but Demi . is now keen to end it once and for all after growing sick of . the financial settlement . Both parties have called in . heavyweight lawyers and Moore is being represented by New York-based . William Beslow, who recently won a large settlement for Linda . Evangelista against French businessman François-Henri Pinault over their . five-year-old daughter. Kutcher has hired Los Angeles celebrity lawyer Laura Wasser. Moore’s marriage to Kutcher raised . eyebrows not only because of the 15-year age gap, but also because he was . not that much older than her own three daughters from her previous . marriage to Bruce Willis, 57. In the wake of the breakup there were . also fears for her wellbeing after she appeared in public looking . extremely thin and was rushed to hospital after suffering an apparent . seizure. Moore subsequently checked into a US . rehab clinic after it was claimed that she was abusing nitrous oxide, . otherwise known as laughing gas. The episode, from which she has now . recovered, marked a sad fall from grace for the woman who was once the . highest paid actress in Hollywood and earned up to £8million a film for . classics like Ghost and A Few Good Men. Kutcher and Moore's six-year marriage . came to an end in 2011 amid claims he had an affair with 22-year-old San . Diego-based administrative assistant Sara Leal. Moore . said at the time: 'As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain . values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have . chosen to move forward with my life.' He . added: 'I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi. Marriage is . one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately . sometimes they fail.' Moving on: Ashton has since found love with actress Mila Kunis and the pair have become inseparable, while Demi is still single . While Kutcher moved on with 29-year-old Kunis in July, Moore struggled to cope with the split. She entered rehab in February soon . after collapsing at her Beverly Hills home. She had been smoking ‘an . incense-like substance’ as well as inhaling nitrous oxide. Her relationship with her three . daughters with ex-husband Bruce Willis - Rumer, 24, Scout, 21, and . Tallulah, 18, - also came under strain last year. Date night: Mila and Ashton were seen enjoying each other's company in Los Angeles over the weekend as Demi readies filing the legal papers . Sources say they have grown tired of her constant partying and erratic behaviour. The girls had initially supported their . mother following her divorce from Kutcher because they believed she was . 'distraught' but were allegedly 'mortified' when she started going out . with one of Rumer's friends Vito Schnabel. But Demi was dumped by the 26-year-old . toyboy several months ago after she enjoyed a week of wild partying at . Art Basel in Miami.","Demi wants Ashton to pay maintenance and legal costs .

"Giants cornerback Prince Amukamara has revealed that he's a virgin and has never had a drop of alcohol. The 24-year-old devout Catholic, who hails from Nigeria, said his clean lifestyle has led some of his teammates to call him 'the black Tim Tebow' after his fellow Christian NFL player. 'I am a virgin,' he said in an interview with Muscle & Fitness. 'I'm not ashamed to say that.' He added that his faith has also been the driving force behind his decision not to drink. Proud: New York Giants' cornerback Prince Amukamara has revealed he is a virgin and has never had alcohol . 'I grew up Catholic, so it just started . out as one of those things,' Amukamara told the magazine. 'I'd think, . ""If I do this, maybe I can get to heaven,"" so I said no drinks, no sex, . all the big things. 'As I grew up, I realized that’s not . what it's about. It's about having a relationship with Jesus. It's not . about ""Don't do this. Don't do that."" But still, it’s just one of those . things I haven't done, and I don't see any benefit to doing it.' Although he doesn't drink with his friends, he still loves going clubbing and gets 'high off of everyone else's high', he said. It was in a club in New York City where he met his now-fiance Pilar Davis, whom he proposed to on stage at a Jabbawockeez show at Luxor Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on July 19. He told her that he might have an alcoholic drink at his bachelor party - but he's not sure yet.

They met at a Manhattan nightclub two years ago where he was 'drawn to her' and even though his friends were encouraging him to talk to her, he wasn't sure what to say. He explained: 'Later, I was waiting for Ahmad [Bradshaw] and she came by and we struck up a conversation. 'I . asked her for her e-mail address because when someone asks for your . number, it might be too personal and you might not want to give it. But . if you ask for their e-mail address, they'll give it. I was right.' But he admitted that he initially hid his job from her. He told the magazine that he has pretended to be a construction worker or a manager at Gap when meeting people in the past - and one teammate has even claimed to be an astronaut. Family man: He poses with his father, who is a chief in Nigeria - meaning Prince is quite literally a prince . Comparisons: Amukamara said some of his teammates called him 'the black Tim Tebow' after the former Jets and Broncos quarterback (pictured), who is famous for his clean living and religion . He added that he realized he had to tell Davis the truth when the Giants went to San Francisco for the conference championship. He knew he would have to come clean if he wanted her to visit him. 'So two . days later, I said ""Hey, I play for the Giants"",' he recalled. 'She thought I meant San . Francisco Giants. That's when I thought she might be a keeper.' They are planning to marry the week after the Super Bowl. For now, the star player said he sees his home in the U.S., even though his father is a chief in a village in Nigeria - meaning that he is, quite literally, a prince. He told the magazine that if he wanted to become a chief of the village, he would have to just move there - but he has no plans to do so.","Prince Amukamara, 24, grew up a devout Catholic: 'I'm not ashamed'

"Time Lord to crime lord: Matt Smith will take up the role of serial killer Pat Bateman . Doctor Who star Matt Smith appears in a new guise today – as the star of a musical that transports him back to the Eighties. Over the weekend he was  shooting his final scenes as the Time Lord for the Doctor Who Christmas special. Today he begins rehearsals for a musical version of Bret Easton Ellis’s controversial novel American Psycho, about a Wall Street serial killer. It starts at London’s Almeida Theatre in December. The 30 year old actor is the eleventh iteration of Dr Who. The twelfth will be Peter Capaldi. Smith begins rehearsals today (Monday) for a musical version of Brett Easton Ellis’s controversial novel American Psycho about Patrick Bateman a fictional 1980s Wall Street investment banker who engages in twisted, sick, sadistic, misogynistic fantasies involving rape, mutilation, torture and cannibalism. ‘It’s a damn difficult role to pull off and Smith has charm and the acting chops to do it’, a source close to the production told the Daily Mail. ‘It’s bold casting and brave for Smith to take it on’, the source added. The show, which starts previewing at London’s Almeida Theatre on December 3, has been described as a satirical commentary of the materialism and greed that marked the Eighties. Characters are deeply concerned with looks, fashion,money and status and care for little else. If the show garners critical acclaim, it will transfer to the West End,and eventually Broadway. There are already American producers involved. Smith’s casting has been shrouded in secrecy with just a handful of the musical’s creative team being in the know. Cast members weren’t being told who their leading man would be until rehearsals start today. Although Smith’s an accomplished stage actor, having starred  on the London stage in dramas such as That Face, The History Boys and Swimming With Sharks, leading a musical is an altogether different business. Classic: Christian Bale, pictured, played Bateman in the 2000 film adaptation of American Pscyho . Smith’s known to be a strong singer but he has had a series of singing lessons to stretch his vocal range , to make it easier to get through eight performances a week. Plus, he will need to be able to shake it up on the dance floor because the show’s director Rupert Goold ,has introduced  several dance numbers. The score by Duncan Sheik, who wrote the show Spring Awakening, features songs that celebrate Bateman’s obsessions with fashion and food. One number has the cast gyrating to a number about Chanel, Gucci and Armani while another is set in a gym. In the novel Bateman prepares for his grisly deeds by citing lyrics from songs by Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins and Whitney Houston. Although Sheik has written an original score it’s not yet known whether elements from songs connected to those singers will be incorporated into American Psycho in some way. In the book, a shocking indictment of yuppidom, Bateman’s crimes become increasingly repellent and when fellow workers see him splattered with blood  he jokes his way out if it by claiming the blood is cranberry juice. When he introduces the topic of serial killers in conversation his listeners  think he’s referring to the cut and thrust of mergers and aquisitions. A movie version of American Psycho, with Christian Bale as Bateman, was able to shock without resorting to showing the most graphic and repugnant aspects of Ellis’s book. Roberto Aguirre Sacasa ,who has adapted the story for the stage,described the show as a ‘perverse, dark, twisted version of the American Dream’ while director Rupert Goold called it ‘very sexy and really stylish'. American Psycho has an official opening night on December 12 after previews which begin on December 3.","Former Time Lord will star as Patrick Bateman in an upcoming musical .

"'B******s': Hamish Ogston, founder of CPP, has criticised the FCA's £1.3billion compensation plan . A businessman who amassed a £100million fortune through a mis-selling racket showed  contempt for his seven million victims yesterday. Hamish Ogston – who owns a multi-million-pound home next to Harrods and has been honoured by the Palace for ‘services to business’ – is at the centre of a scandal expected to lead to a flood of compensation claims. With the help of Britain’s disgraced banking giants, his company misled customers into buying worthless insurance for their credit, debit or store cards. But last night, Mr Ogston, who was awarded a CBE by Princess Anne in 2011, was unrepentant. Asked about the estimated £1.3billion compensation payout, he described it as ‘b*******’ and a ‘ridiculous figure’ – and accused the Financial Conduct Authority of ‘sensationalism’. The regulator said unwitting customers paid up to £84 a year for credit card insurance – even though they would never need it because they were receiving free cover from their bank. It condemned Mr Ogston’s company CPP – which he started with just £1,000 capital in 1980 – for its central role in the huge mis-selling scandal which will lead to compensation payouts of £1.3billion. And with breathtaking insensitivity for his victims’ plight, Mr Ogston remarked that the furore had made him look ‘a bit of a chump’. Following the near collapse of CPP, the banks – including the publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland, now part of Lloyds Banking Group – have been left to pick up the vast majority of the compensation bill. Fraud: 13 banks have agreed to pay out billions to customers who were wrongly sold credit card insurance . Hamish Ogston receives his CBE from Princess Anne in 2011 . The embattled business founded by Mr . Ogston, a former member of the Norwegian Merchant Navy, will contribute a . paltry sum of £29million to the pot. But Mr Ogston – who enjoys a . luxurious lifestyle and owns several multi-million pound properties – . will face no action over the scandal from which he has amassed his . £100million fortune. Experts last night condemned the ‘scandalous’ behaviour of the banks, who heartlessly ‘introduced’ their customers to . CPP – and got paid vast sums in commission from CPP for the referrals. Gillian . Guy, chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: ‘Yet again banks have . shown a complete disregard for their customers by selling them products . they did not need. 'It is a scandalous business model to make money by . misleading customers.’ The scandal involves 13 financial giants, . including Britain’s big banks, such as Barclays, HSBC, RBS, Santander . and Lloyds, as well as the country’s biggest building society Nationwide . and credit card firms such as Capital One and MBNA. The net spreads . even wider to include M&S, one of the high-street’s best-loved . chains. Its bank is wholly owned by HSBC. About 23million useless . policies were sold, or renewed, between January 2005 and March 2011, . described by the City regulator as ‘widespread mis-selling’. Typically, . a bank customer would get a new credit card, and a sticker on the card . would tell them to call CPP to activate the card, or to report that it . had arrived safely. Honour: Mr Ogston is pictured being invested with the CBE by Princess Anne in 2011 . Hamish Ogston founded Card Protection Plan in London in 1980 in order to provide insurance to credit card users who were concerned about the risk of fraud. He developed his entrepreneurial streak when he joined the Norwegian Merchant Navy aged 17 and sailed around the world, working on building sites and uranium mines in Canada. After attending Manchester University, where he made a name for himself by dealing in cocoa futures, he decided to start his own business rather than look for a job so he could avoid sky-high income tax rates levied by the Labour government. Although CPP took nearly a decade to turn a profit, it became enormously successful after he teamed up with more than a dozen banks to offer its services to all their cardholders - many of whom did not know what they were signing up for. In an interview in 2000, Mr Ogston described the firm as ‘my best investment’ - and 10 years later, CPP, now based in York, netted him £120million when it floated on the stock market. In 2011, he was awarded the CBE for services to business, receiving the honour from the Princess Royal in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. He retained a 57 per cent stake in CPP, but the firm’s fortunes turned sour last year when the FSA imposed a fine for the widespread mis-selling of card protection. Mr Ogston, a father of three in his mid 60s, launched a bid to buy the company, but after he offered just £1.7million the offer was turned down, and he resigned from the board. When they phoned CPP, aggressive salesmen would . coerce the customers into buying the useless insurance policies in . tactics described by the regulator as ‘overly persistent’. Salesmen . were given targets ‘for successfully dissuading customers who contacted . CPP to cancel their policies’, the regulator said. One former . salesman, who did not want to be named, said he left after just one week . in the job after being disgusted by the sales tactics. Speaking to the . Mail, he said: ‘It was the most awful, pressurised environment I’ve ever . worked in. Absolutely horrid place. I’m not even slightly surprised . their products are utterly useless.’ While customers were told they . would benefit from up to £100,000 of insurance cover if their card was . defrauded, they were not told they were covered by their bank for free. On average, customers paid £35 a year for a card protection policy. In reality, the FCA said the insurance actually cost 60p. As . a result, CPP scooped £34.40 from the sale – and paid up to 60 per cent . of the money to the bank as a thank-you for the referral of the . customer. An identity protection policy typically cost £84 a year, but . the insurance actually cost only £16. Again, CPP got £68 and gave as . much as 50 per cent to the bank. Simon Chouffot, from the Robin Hood . Tax campaign, which wants new financial sector taxes to help tackle . poverty, said: ‘The never-ending stream of dodgy dealings by banks puts . your average scam artist to shame. It shows they will try any trick to . fleece the public.’ All victims will be paid compensation, equal to . an average of £185 each if the bill reaches £1.3billion and is shared . equally between the seven million victims. Despite his pivotal role in . the scandal, Mr Ogston is one of Britain’s richest men, after pocketing . £120million from selling a large chunk of shares when CPP floated on the . stock market in 2010. Widespread: As many as 14 banks are said to have been involved in the insurance scam . Controversy: The scandal centres around banks' links with the finance company CPP . He still controls 57 per cent of the business, . although the share price has imploded. Mr Ogston continues to enjoy the . trappings of wealth, with several properties, including a £4.5 million . mansion in Oxfordshire and an imposing townhouse in London’s . Knightsbridge. Justin Modray, founder of consumer finance website . CandidMoney.com, said it is ‘thoroughly depressing’ to see another case . of banks ripping off their customers. He added: ‘By asking loyal . customers to pay for policies that were essentially worthless, it is no . wonder levels of trust in the high-street banks is at absolute rock . bottom.’ For information on how to claim, please click here . Donna Ettridge said she is angry at the way she has been treated by M&S after paying for its Card Safe policy . Donna Ettridge took out a ‘Card Safe’ policy on her M&S credit card in 2001 – but discovered only yesterday that it has been a waste of money. Mrs Ettridge, 54, said she was angry about how she had been treated by the high-street giant. She is a regular shopper at M&S, has had an M&S credit card since 1986 and did not expect to be duped into buying insurance which was worthless. But she was telephoned by a salesman in 2001 and coerced into taking out the policy, even though M&S Bank automatically offers the fraud protection for free. The policy has cost Mrs Ettridge, from Hornchurch, Essex, a large sum of money, although she is not sure of the full amount. In April, she was charged another £53 for a further three years of ‘Card Safe’. Mrs Ettridge, a widow, said: ‘It makes me feel quite angry that I’ve paid out for something that I did not need every three years for the last 12 years.’","Hamish Ogston, founder of CPP, blasts settlement as overly generous .

"A Virginia teenager says she was forced to leave her prom after fathers who were acting as chaperones at the event complained that she was dancing provocatively and her skirt was too short. Despite following the dress code on skirt length, and trying to reason with the organizers, the student says she was ordered to leave the dance. The 17-year-old, identified only as . Clare, is demanding a refund for her and her friends, who walked out of the prom with her in a show of unity. Scroll down for video . Ruined: Virginia teenager Clare had been excited about her prom but organizers asked her to leave because of her dress . The teenager had been excited about the $25-a-ticket Twilight in Paris prom, which offered a welcome break as she studied for her finals. After trawling round clothes stores she found the perfect outfit - a sparkly silver dress that met the regulation length of being longer than the fingertips when her arms were by her side. 'We waited eagerly for . Saturday to arrive. My dress was gorgeous, silver, and sparkly and I got . it at Macy’s and was very excited to find it after searching over six . stores for this dress,' she said, adding that she had saved over several . weeks to buy her outfit. But, as soon as she walking into the venue last weekend, one of the organizers stopped her at the door and said: 'Honey, that dress is too short,' she claimed. In a post she wrote on her sister's Wine and Marble blog about the incident, Clare said she showed the organizer that the dress did meet the regulation and she was let in. 'When I got into the ballroom I laughed, because I was surrounded by girls in much shorter dresses then me.' Clare said. A short while later, as the teenager chatted to her friends and prom date while swaying to the music, she said she noticed a group of fathers staring at her from a balcony. 'We were also a little grossed out by all the dads on the balcony above the dance floor, ogling and talking amongst themselves,' she said. Dress code: Home school student Clare had made sure her dress met the required minimum length . It was at that point that one of the organizers approached Clare again and asked to speak to her in private. '[She] told me that some of the dads who were chaperoning had complained that my dancing was too provocative, and that I was going to cause the young men at the prom to think impure thoughts,' Clare claimed. The teenager said that despite trying to tell the woman that she and her friends hadn't even been dancing, she was told again that her dress was too short and she would have to leave. Her concerned friends tried to intervene in the conversation, and say they hadn't even been dancing, but they were told the situation 'was none of their business'. Clare's date also tried to explain that because the group had arrived together, if she was made to leave they would all have to go. When the friends asked if they would be refunded for a dance they had spent less than half an hour at, they were told only Clare would be given a refund. As she was being escorted, crying, from the venue, Clare says she asked the security guard what he made of the situation. 'I asked the security guy if my dress was compliant with the dress code and if he had noticed any inappropriateness in my behavior and he said he didn’t think I did anything to get kicked out but it wasn’t his call,' Clare wrote. Support: Clare's prom date, pictured, and her friends, who drove to the dance together, are demanding a refund after having to leave early . 'We walked out of the prom, frustrated and angry and feeling very disrespected and violated,' Clare said, admitting that in a moment of immaturity they had shouted profanities. Clare added that she felt singled out for her appearance, and is demanding that the Richmond Homeschool Prom organizers refund her friends who were forced to leave alongside her. 'I was told that the way I dressed and moved my body was causing men to think inappropriately about me, implying that it is my responsibility to control other people’s thoughts and drives,' she said. 'My group of five people had to leave the prom because I stuck out, I have long legs and I was wearing a sparkly dress, I didn’t look like most of the 13-15 year old girls there.' The experience has left the teenager feeling frustrated and angry at being singled out for her appearance. 'I was talked to disrespectfully, ganged up on and treated as less then a person by people in authority, and when I requested to have one of my peers present to validate later what was said in this ""meeting"" I was denied that right,' she said. Big night: The prom for home school students was being held at the Shady Grove Methodist church in Virginia . 'I felt violated by the sheer number of male parents that were assigned to do nothing for five hours other then watch girls in short dresses and heels dance to upbeat music,' Clare added. 'I think that it is sick and wrong that they assigned them to sit on a balcony above us and look down on us and single us out for our clothes or dancing.' Friends of the teenager told her later that as the evening went on, other students were dancing proactively, yet no one intervened to stop them. 'I’m only 17, but I can see there’s something wrong about this ... please tell me I’m not the only one who think it doesn’t matter how people are dressed or how they move their bodies, we should still treat them with respect and decency.' The teenager said she wants answers from the organizers about the way she feels she was treated. '[Is] Richmond Homeschool Prom adult enough to own up to their wrong actions as well. And refund my group as they verbally promised to do, and issue an apology for kicking me out of my senior prom because their husbands felt as though my body was something they had a right to control,' she said. Organizers for the Richmond Homeschool Prom have not yet responded to a Mail Online request for comment. Clare is currently getting ready to sit her final examinations, but her sister Hannah said she was overwhelmed by the messages of support and the reaction to her experiences. The family also denied that racism had been a factor in Clare and her boyfriend being asked to leave. 'I . don’t feel race played a part in all that happened Saturday night,' Clare's boyfriend said. 'I strongly believe they did not know we were . together until the situation had already escalated.' He is the only one in the group of friends to have been issued a refund.","Home school prom organizers told Clare she needed to leave because of her dress and the way she danced .

"Two New York State boys suffered serious injuries after an inflatable bounce house was swept into the air before dumping them back on the ground from 15 feet up. In the nightmarish scene, the boys aged 5 and 6 were playing in the carnival staple Monday afternoon at a South Glens Falls apartment complex when winds spun the bounce house around as if in a tornado before blowing it into the air. One boy smashed down onto a parked car while the other landed in a street. A third child, a 10-year-old girl, suffered only scrapes after falling out just as the structure took off. Scroll down for video . Nightmarish: This dramatic photo shows an inflatable bounce house that blew to 50 feet in the air before dumping out two boys from around 15 feet and leaving them seriously injured . Way up: The children had long since fallen out when they shocking photos were taken. The bouncy house flew an estimated 50 high and made it past a stretch of woods before finally drifting back to earth and landing behind a local school . The boys were hospitalized Monday afternoon with serious injuries. One boy suffered serious head trauma, while the other sustained two broken arms as well as facial injures, a neighbor told the Post-Star. Unbelievable: Witnesses say two boys fell from 15 feet. One landed on a parked car, while the other smashed into a car and both sustained serious injuries . 'It was like a horror movie,' complex resident Taylor Seymour. 'It just kept going up and up. It cleared our building and the trees.' It was on Seymour's car that one of the children landed. The structure went on to blow a full 50 feet into the air and one witness snapped a shocking picture of it hovering above. The mother of the little girl agreed. 'My older daughters witnessed it and said it was just horrible,' she said, without giving her name. 'A big gust of wind just blew it right off the ground with the kids in it. It's just sickening.' 'The witnesses said it was a sudden burst of wind and it just lifted off the ground,' Patrolman David Gifford told the Post-Star. 'It was just a freak accident.' Gifford and the little girl's mother said the bounce house was tethered to the ground with stakes but that it was blown loose. The structure was owned by a resident of the complex. It landed behind a nearby school after clearing a stretch of woods. The owner told the Post-Star that she'd set up the Little Tikes brand toy several times in the two years she'd owned it. The mother of the lucky little girl, at least, wasn't not pointing fingers anyway. 'I don't think people know that this can happen when it's windy,' she said.

"Herculean: David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. He has portrayed the Belgian detective since 1989 and wishes to film all of his adventures penned by Agatha Christie . Agatha Christie could not stand Hercule Poirot. The little Belgian detective with the waxed moustaches brought her fame and wealth, but she found him ‘insufferable’. The actor David Suchet, luckily for us, can’t get enough of the character. He has been playing Poirot since 1989, starting with 50-minute adaptations of short stories — Christie was endlessly inventive, and wrote more than 30 novels and 50 short tales featuring the pompous little sleuth with the egg-shaped head. Suchet has made no secret of his ambition to star as Poirot in all the stories and the character has come to define his career. Last night, the 13th season of Agatha Christie’s Poirot (ITV) opened with one of her last crime riddles, Elephants Can Remember. It was not one of her better plots — the twist involves identical twins, a trick that was outlawed way back in 1929 when avid detective story fan Monsignor Ronald Knox published the Ten Commandments Of Crime (they included: no Chinamen, only one secret passage per novel, and definitely no cheating with twins). Frankly, Elephants Can Remember isn’t one of the Crime Queen’s better titles, either. Most things can remember, apart from goldfish. A cleverer title was hidden in the excellent script by Nick Dear: a retired copper relayed some ancient gossip to Poirot and reminded him, ‘Old sins have long shadows.’ But the elephant theme gave the set designers an excuse for extra fun. Among the glorious clutter of Thirties fabrics and props, from the garish rose wallpaper, to the gold tracery on the teacups, someone had placed an ivory monstrosity on Poirot’s windowsill: a tusk carved into a procession of elephants. Poirot was as riotously egotistical as ever. Suchet’s genius is that he can deliver everything Christie found so exasperating, without becoming a caricature — he minces, he trots, he fusses, he talks endlessly of himself in the third person. Partners against crime: Suchet with Zoe Wanamaker as lady sleuth Ariadne Oliver . ‘If Poirot can be of any assistance he comes at once, toute suite,’ he said. Zoe Wanamaker, as the lady detective Ariadne Oliver, worked hard to match him. She has turned the original character, a bumbling scatterbrain who eats apples by the bagful in her bathtub, into a ghastly snob who investigates murders like a prefect at a girls’ boarding school who suspects the third formers of smuggling cherry brandy into the dorms. It’s a clever device — she makes Poirot seem charming by comparison. And she gets results, sniffing out murder most foul in rural Sussex. Fearful symmetry: Operation Snow Tiger followed the plight of the majestic Siberian tiger . As one old scandal-monger tells her: ‘In this part of the world, one either hunts or has affairs.’ Affairs would be out of the question in eastern Siberia, where blizzards blow for weeks and the temperature often falls below minus 30c. Love of wildlife: Liz Bonnin's enthusiasm for the beautiful creatures was infectious . But hunting can be rewarding, when the quarry is tigers. Presenter Liz Bonnin, a former wildlife biologist who studied Bengal tigers in Nepal, brought real passion to Operation Snow Tiger (BBC2) last night, on the trail of the most magnificent predators on Earth. Fewer than 350 Siberian tigers survive in the wild. More scientists have gone into space than have seen the animal in its natural habitat. ‘The Siberian tiger stands a very real risk of becoming extinct,’ she warned. And film of the tigers was brief in this first of two episodes. Most of it came from hidden cameras in the forests north of Vladivostok, amid snow-scenes and ravishing scenery that looked like a real-world Narnia. But Bonnin’s excitement when the camera traps caught images of tigers was palpable. She squealed, gasped and shouted when a fleeting image ghosted across the frame. And she was determined to match the Russian scientists for stamina and hardihood, whether that was yomping through the snowdrifts, fighting to haul vehicles over the icy roads, or swigging Tigroff vodka. She was pop-eyed with horror after downing a shot of the fiery liquid. ‘How do you say “that’s strong” in Russian?’ she croaked. With so little footage of the tigers, there was inevitably some padding. But Bonnin’s genuine enthusiasm made every moment watchable.","Author Agatha Christie found her most famous creation 'insufferable'

In some cases when a dispute arises between an worker and employer, the exit visa can be difficult to get hold of. It took the intervention of the French government and relentless international pressure on the Qatari Football Association before Belounis was allowed to return home. The ordeal has brought the married father-of-two close to suicide, he claims. Venue: The Al-Gharafa stadium is pictured in this artists impression in Qatar 2022 World Cup winning bid which has been mired in controversy . The Qatari Football Association has disputed Belounis version of events. It claims he had not taken his case up with the judicial bodies of FIFA and that following its investigation into the allegations, Mr Belounis received all the money he was owed. El Jaish declined comment. Nick McGeehan, a Human Rights Watch lawyer, who has worked with Belounis throughout his case, said there was very little support for non-nationals who were in a contractual dispute. He called on the Qatari government to abandon the exit visa system which can create a situation where foreign workers are trapped in the country. Row: An investigation found that dozens of foreign workers had died since 2012 during the construction of Qatar's World Cup sites . He told CNN: 'It is our understanding that migrant workers often encounter serious difficulties getting exit visas from their employer for a variety of reasons. 'Migrant worker abuses are typically associated with low-paid workers from south Asia.' This case is the latest in a series of negative news stories about the treatment of some foreign workers in Qatar. The Guardian newspaper produced a report . and video alleging that Nepalese workers in Qatar 'face exploitation and . abuses that amount to modern-day slavery'. The Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee said while construction directly related to the World Cup had yet to start it was committed to providing proper treatment for workers.","Zahir Belounis, 33, claimed he was owed a salary from his club El Jaish .

"Jack Russell terrier Jack who needed surgery after swallowing 111 coins . A New York dog had to undergo a two-hour life saving operation - after swallowing more than 100 coins. The Jack Russell named Jack is recovering at his Wall Street home after he was rushed to a vet's in Manhattan last week after eating 111 pennies and quickly becoming ill. The coins had to be taken out of 13-year-old terrier Jack's stomach five at a time after he accidentally swallowed the $1.11. The dog managed to accidentally lick up the coins while eating the remains of a bagel on his owner's desk. His owner Tim Kellehar knew that something was wrong when his pet began vomiting, according to the New York Daily News. When his condition worsened over the next 24 hours, Mr Kellehar took Jack to BluePearl Veterinary Partners specialty and emergency hospital in Manhattan where an x-ray showed the cause of the dog's illness. Jack was placed under anaesthetic and the coins were slowly and methodically removed. Although the dog has shown no further ill effects since his surgery, vets say that his unusual dinner could have proved fatal. The zinc from the coins could have lethally damaged the dog's liver and kidneys. Mr Kellehar told the New York Daily: 'He’s like a voracious Tasmanian devil — if there’s food, he’s got to get it. 'He climbed on my desk to get at the bag with the bagel and knocked the change all over the floor. 'While he was licking up the crumbs, he swallowed the pennies.' Jack's owner added that he is making a good recovery and driving him crazy again. Diagnosis: The coins were spotted when Jack's owner rushed him to a nearby vets for an x-ray .

"Global warming has opened up an Arctic route mariners have been craving for centuries, making the journey from Canada to Europe shorter. A large sea freighter has become the first cargo vessel to successfully navigate the hazardous Arctic Northwest Passage carrying - somewhat ironically - coal. If other ships decide to use the crossing through the Arctic Ocean, along the northern coast of North America connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, their route would be 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the best alternative. Global warming has opened up a route mariners have been craving for centuries - a shorter journey from Canada to Europe. A large sea freighter became the first cargo vessel to successfully navigate the hazardous Arctic Northwest Passage (pictured) between Canada and Greenland . The 75,000 deadweight-tonne Nordic Orion, built in 2011 and specially strengthened to cross icy waters, left the Canadian Pacific port of Vancouver in early September with a cargo of coking coal and is scheduled to arrive in the Finnish port of Pori on October 7, according to AIS shipping data. 'The Northwest Passage is more than 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the traditional shipping route through the Panama Canal and will save time, fuel and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but even more importantly increase the amount of cargo per transit 25 percent,' said Nordic Bulk Carriers, the Danish owner of the ship. Harsh conditions in the Arctic sea route so far have limited shipping mostly to small cargo vessels and ice-breakers, which supply northern Canadian communities. The 75,000 deadweight-tonne Nordic Orion (pictured), built in 2011 and specially strengthened to cross icy waters, left the Canadian Pacific port of Vancouver in early September with a cargo of coking coal and is scheduled to arrive in the Finnish port of Pori on October 7, according to AIS shipping data . The 225 metre long Nordic Orion, a panamax-sized ship that is currently off the western coast of Greenland, has a strengthened bulk to cope with floating ice. The . vessel is to deliver the coal to Ruukki Metals, a Finnish steel . producer, which is ironic seeing as many climate scientists have blamed . the melting of Arctic ice as a consequence of warmer temperatures caused . by greenhouse gases emitted by burning fossil fuels, particularly coal. As the ice continues to melt, some . experts have estimated that shipping via the Arctic could account for a . quarter of the cargo traffic between Europe and Asia by 2030. 'The Northwest Passage is more than 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the traditional shipping route through the Panama Canal and will save time, fuel and reduce carbon dioxide emissions,' said Nordic Bulk Carriers, the Danish owner of the ship. A selection of routes through the passage are pictured . Last November, Russian gas export company Gazprom made the first ever delivery of liquefied natural gas through the Arctic north-east route, sailing from Norway east to Japan. Many maritime analysts have said, however, that large volumes of commercial shipping via the Arctic are at least 10 years away. While mariners might be excited by the prospect of faster journeys, some people are concerned what would happen in the event that one of the commercial ships ran into trouble in the remote and icy waters. Michael Byers, an expert in global politics and international law at the University of British Columbia, said: 'There are the environmental risks. The coal being carried by the Nordic . Orion would not cause much damage in the event of an accident. But the . fuel oil on board the vessel certainly would.' As the ice continues to melt, some experts have estimated that shipping via the Arctic could account for a quarter of the cargo traffic between Europe and Asia by 2030. But some people are concerned about the potential environmental impact as an accident in the hazardous waters could see fuel oil polluting the sea . Writing in an article for The Globe and Mail, he warned that shallow waters and icebergs still pose a risk to ice-strengthened ships. He said small, hard chunks of ice called 'growlers' that float low in the water are incredibly difficult to spot, while 'icing' - when ocean spray freezes onto the outside of a ship - can cause it to become top-heavy and capsize. In the event of an emergency, he also warned that Canada's search and rescue capabilities are 'desperately poor'. He said long-range helicopters could take a whole day to reach parts of the Arctic Northwest Passage, offering little help to stranded crews, who even wearing survival suits could freeze to death in just one hour in the harsh environment.

U.S. tanker-icebreaker SS Manhattan (pictured) was  the first commercial ship to make the east-west trip through Northwest Passage in 1969 . The news of the 'new' crossing comes in the same week that the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released it's latest high profile report. The UN scientists today said they are '95 . per cent' certain that climate change is man made, but still could not . explain why the world has barely got any hotter in the last 15 years. The IPCC said . that sea levels have risen by 19cm since 1901 and are expected to rise a . further 26-82cm by the end of the century. It . added that concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the . atmosphere have increased to levels that are unprecedented in at least . 800,000 years. As expected, . the IPCC raised its projections of the rise in sea levels to 26-82cm by . the end of the century. The previous report predicted a rise of 18-59cm.

Williams is seen on surveillance footage appearing to confront Ian as he comes out of a bathroom at Riverdale School. Action: Kindergarten teacher Barb Williams has been suspended without pay for ten days . As the little boy walks out of the bathroom, Williams allegedly grabs him and lifts Ian in front of a wall. The teacher then appears to grab him by the throat, tilting his head back and forcing him off his feet. In another shot, Williams appears to have grabbed the boy's shirt and used that to lift the terrified boy off the ground. 'We thought it was just a little incident that happened.That's what the school made it sound like. All of a sudden, we get this video today and this is just outrageous,' Mr Nelson said. The incident came to light when a member of staff at Riverdale Schools in Hancock County reported Wiliams. Seeing . the way their child, who was left bruised, had been treated has been upsetting for the Nelsons, . who were given a copy of the footage by the school on May 7. 'I . just started crying. I burst out in tears. I called my mom. I called his . mom,' Mrs Nelson said. She and her husband were shocked by the school's reaction however, and are demanding that Williams be fired.

"When a trio of New York college students bought a smelly secondhand couch from a charity store for $20 they had no clue about its real value. But not long after roommates Reese Werkhoven, Cally Guasti and Lara Russo got it back to their New Paltz home and nestled in, they discovered envelopes of cash - $41,000 worth - were stashed in every conceivable crevice of the pre-loved find. 'When we were in the bedroom our neighbors thought we won the lottery or something cause we were just screaming,' Guasti said of the shock April discovery. Scroll down for video . Sitting on a goldmine: Roommates Reese Werkhoven, Cally Guasti and Lara Russo, pictured, bought a smelly secondhand couch, seen above, from a charity store for $20 they had no clue about its real value . The friends bought the couch from a nearly Salvation Army in February. But last month, after watching a movie, they said they felt crinkles in two side pillows built into the couch, according to The Little Rebellion website. 'It had these bubble wrap envelopes, just like two or three of them,' Werkhoven, a SUNY New Paltz geology major, told CBS News. 'We ripped them out and was just like freaking out, like and inch and a half of hundred dollar bills.' Perplexed by the discovery, the friends all but teared the couch apart looking for what else they could find. When all the envelopes were out, they eagerly counted the cash, taking pictures along the way. The grand total amounted to a staggering $41,000. 'You keep counting more and more money . and you get excited, like Reese was thinking about buying a car for his . mom and a boat,' Russo, a SUNY graduate, said. Pictures: The stunned friends took pictures with the loot as they went . However, the students' excitement turned to moral dilemma when they found that one of the envelopes had a woman's name on it. 'The entitlement very quickly went away with finding that notice with her name on it. Because we didn’t earn that money,' Guasti, a Mount Holyoke College graduate, said. And so the hunt for the fortune's rightful owner began, with the help of each of the students' parents, who also warned them not to tell anyone else about the stash for fear it could get stolen. Finally, Werkhoven's mother found the woman in a phone book and the young man called her up. 'I'm like ""I found something that I think is yours and she's like ""what?!"" and I'm like ""I found a couch"" and then she's like ""oh my God I left a lot of money in that couch,""' said Werkhoven. The friends said the elderly woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, told them her sick husband had given her wads of cash in the years before he died, so she could have something to live off when he was gone. Dilemma: However, the students' excitement turned to moral dilemma when they found that one of the envelopes had a woman's name on it . Not knowing where else to put it, she stashed it in the old couch in the room where she slept. She said she stored her savings int he couch for 30 years until she recently had an operation on her back and spent several months in a rehabilitation center. While there, her doctors recommended her children replace the old couch to aid her back pain, and that's how it came to be at the Salvation Army. 'We almost didn't pick that couch,' Russo told thelittlerebellion.com. 'It's pretty ugly and smells, but it was the only couch that fit the right dimensions for our living room.' The trio said they don’t regret doing the right thing, and are even planning to have dinner with the elderly woman they returned the money to and her family. 'I think it’s just that anyone can do good if they will themselves to it,' Werkhoven told CBS News. 'I think it went the way it should and to be honest I don't think about it that much,' Russo added. But the good Samaritans didn't go home empty-handed. The woman gave the three a thousand dollars to share as a reward.","Roommates Reese Werkhoven, Cally Guasti and Lara Russo bought the couch for $20 from their local chariy store .

"One of the most famous rock 'n' roll guitars - that was so good Jimi Hendrix couldn't bring himself to burn it - has sold for almost £250,000. The musician tricked his fans into thinking he had set fire to his favourite electric guitar on stage at a famous concert. Instead, he switched it for a lesser model seconds before dousing it in lighter fluid as a stunt to mark the end of . his set at the Monterey International Pop Festival in 1967. Music memorabilia fans lined up to bid on the black Fender Stratocaster at the Playboy Club in Park Lane, London last night when the iconic lot went under the hammer. Scroll down for video . Jimi Hendrix sets his guitar on fire at the Monterey festival. He tricked fans into thinking he was burning his famous black Fender Stratocaster, but he had switched it for a lesser guitar . Jimi Hendrix's black Fender Stratocaster sold for a staggering £250,000 at auction yesterday . The moment Jimi Hendrix knelt down and poured lighter fluid onto the instrument before taking a match to it has become one of the most iconic images in rock history. The guitar was later given to his record company Anim Limited, where it fell into the hands of James ‘Tappy’ Wright, a manager at the firm. Mr Wright, 69, from Newcastle, decided to sell it to help fund his retirement in Florida. It had been given a pre-sale estimate of £120,000 but the sheer amount of interest in it led to the sale price to rocket. It sold at auction for £205,000 pounds, but with all the fees added on the overall price paid for it was £237,000. Ted Owen, of the Fame Bureau auctioneers which sold the guitar, said: 'I’m thrilled with the price. 'We thought it could go above the estimate of £120,000 but not by as much as it did. 'It is a hugely important guitar and we had four people seriously bidding for it, which pushed the price up. 'Tappy is getting on a bit now and this will be a nice amount for him to help fund his retirement in Florida. 'He is delighted with the price we achieved.' Hendrix, whose best known songs include Hey Joe, All Along the Watchtower and Voodoo Child, had only been planning on smashing up a guitar at the end of his set at the 1967 concert in California. But having seen Pete Townsend of The Who shove the neck of his guitar into an amplifier earlier on at the festival, he felt he had to go one better. Mr Wright, who was also a roadie for The Animals, said: 'The Who went on before Hendrix and Townshend smashed his guitar up and put the neck into the amp. 'Jimi was annoyed at this and asked for some lighter fuel. He just wanted to outdo Pete Townshend. Jimi Hendrix performing at the Marquee Club, London in 1967 . 'He played the black guitar for most of the act and then right at the end he swapped it for a repaired one that he set fire to. 'At the time the black Fender was his favourite guitar and he didn’t want to ruin it.' Mr Owen added: 'Hendrix only burnt two guitars in his career; the one at the Astoria and the one at Monterey. 'He used the black Fender for three quarters of the concert and he swapped it at the last minute. 'People who were there would have known of the swap and Hendrix fans may well be aware but it is not widely known.' Hendrix died in London in 1970 at the age of 27 from drug-related asphyxia.

"It's often hard for chefs to showcase weird and wonderful flavours without putting off potential customers. But one South Australian pub is taking bizarre flavour combinations to the next level - holding a beer festival where punters can sample brews made with squid, anchovies, chocolate, wasabi and even the droppings of a nocturnal mammal called the civet. Commencing Thursday, eccentric brewers from across the globe are converging on Adelaide's Wheatsheaf Hotel for the Good Beer Wheaty - and they'll be sharing some of their wacky ways with beer aficionados. Not your average brew: Weird and wacky flavours of beer will be showcased at Adelaide's Good Beer Wheaty this week. The concept came about in 2011, when Wheatsheef Hotel co-publican Jade Flavell met up with New Zealand craft brewers Stu McKinlay and Sam Posseniskie, also known as the Yeastie Boys, at Melbourne's Good Beer Week. Deciding to bring the concept to Adelaide, the pub and brewers launched Good Beer Wheaty the following year in 2012. The Yeastie Boys won't be the only international beer makers at the festival, with brewers from England's Magic Rock, Italy's Birra Del Borgo, Denmark's To Øl and Brookyln's Sixpoint craft breweries also featuring on the festival's lineup. Attendees can taste exotic beers, featuring unexpected flavours, at one of five daily tasting sessions. From the sea: Anchovies and squid are two of the 'unique' ingredients being used to flavour beer by craft brewers . Cake ingredient or beer flavour? Chocolate and orange peel are two more of the weird flavours being added to the beers being showcased . Write caption here . Some of the beers to be showcased at the sessions include a gin and tonic flavoured beer, in addition to the odd-sounding seafood, chocolate and wasabi flavours. In addition to tastings, workshops will also be held for festival ticketholders. Just like the odd brews being showcased, the classes promise not to be your average class. Workshops include 'The Art of Spooning,' a celebration of the strange things that happen when weird brewers collaborate. Creature of the night: Droppings from cervils, a nocturnal mammal native to Africa and Asia, are being used to give beers a musky flavour . Another workshop called 'Skunkhour,' will teach attendees about the science behind beer flavouring. 'If Good Beer Wheaty Yeastie could be encapsulated in one word, it would have to be spooning,' Wheatsheef Hotel co-publican Jade Flavell said. The festival runs from Thursday 15 May until Monday 19 May.","South Australian beer festival showcasing unique flavours .

"The 'Rice Portrait': Exciting new evidence suggests the innocent-looking teenager in the simple white dress may really be the famous author . A portrait of a pretty 13-year-old girl claimed to be Jane Austen has divided art experts for years. But exciting new evidence has now emerged that the innocent-looking teenager in the simple white dress may really be the famous author, on a visit to Kent in 1789. An analysis of the oil painting using digital photographic tools has revealed writing that seems to back up the case for it being a genuine likeness of the 19th century novelist. No other professional portrait of the writer has ever been verified - with only two artworks drawn by amateur hands confirmed as having been produced from life. But now, analysts have discovered the name Jane Austen in the top-right corner of a . reproduction of a photograph of the portrait of the teenager, taken before the painting . was restored, according to The Guardian. Beside it, in . two places, is the name Ozias Humphry. Mr Humphry was an established portrait painter of . the period, a member of the Royal Academy and a friend of several popular artists of the day, including Gainsborough and Romney. The words have been digitally enhanced using . methods that were independently . validated by Stephen Cole of Acume Forensics in . Leeds, who has spent more than 20 years analysing photographic evidence . in criminal cases. Of the two verified amateur artworks, one is a watercolour and pencil sketch by Miss Austen's sister Cassandra, said to make the young woman look a little cross. The other is an 'idealised' portrait used as the frontispiece to the Austen memoir written by her nephew in 1870. Art critic Angus Stewart, a former . curator of an exhibition dedicated to the author, said: 'To have all these words revealed on the canvas is . very, very strong. 'I think you'd be flying in the face of reason to deny . this.' There have been various other claims to have found likenesses of the author taken before her death in 1817 aged 41, but all have been the subject of furious dispute. 'Unrealistic': The two verified portraits of the author from her lifetime - left, an 'idealised' painting from the cover of a memoir by her nephew, and right, a 'cross' watercolour and pencil sketch by her sister Cassandra . In December, Austen biographer Dr Paula Byrne claimed in BBC documentary Jane Austen: The Unseen Portrait? that she had found a sketch at auction that was the much-loved author, but she has not yet proved her case to universal satisfaction. The painting of the young girl is owned by the Rice family, direct descendants of one of Jane's brothers. Arguments: Biographer Dr Paula Byrne claimed in a BBC documentary that this sketch was produced before the novelist's death . It came to light in the late 19th century and the family say it was composed while the Austens were visiting Jane's great uncle Francis in Kent in 1789, when the girl was 13. According to the recorded family history, having commissioned the portrait Francis kept it in Sevenoaks with the rest of his family collection. It was then given by his grandson, Colonel Thomas Austen, to a close friend as a wedding present, the year after the author died in 1817, because the bride was reported to be a keen admirer of Austen's books. But since the, art experts, led by the National Portrait Gallery, have raised objections - mainly that the style of the girl's dress and the general composition date the painting to after 1800, when Jane would have been in her 20s. But the new evidence could contradict that view. Artist Mr Humphry went blind in 1797 and stopped painting. The photo even seems to reveal the date 1789. The writing could have been put on the canvas by Mr Humphry himself or a later owner. But as the painting was believed to be by a more prestigious artist, Johann Zoffany, experts believe the words must have been put there during or shortly after Jane's lifetime. Professor Claudia Johnson of Princeton University said: 'Whether Humphry's name was signed by himself in the 18th century and/or by some other hand later, the attribution must be contemporaneous with Austen's lifetime or by people who knew Austen when she was alive.' If the portrait is confirmed as being Austen, it may be an embarrassment to the National Portrait Gallery, which granted the picture a licence for sale abroad on the basis that it could not be the writer. The gallery chose not to comment.","Only two existing images of novelist from her lifetime and both are by amateurs .

"Homosexuality is passed down through the generations from mother to son and from father to daughter, a new study claims. From an evolutionary standpoint, homosexuality is a trait that would not be expected to develop and persist in the face of Darwinian natural selection. It is nevertheless common for men and women in most cultures and previous studies have shown that homosexuality runs in families, leading most researchers to presume a genetic underpinning of sexual preference. Puzzle: Scientists had long puzzled over why homosexuality appears to run in families when as a genetic trait it would not be expected to develop and persist in the face of Darwinian natural selection . However, no major gene for homosexuality has been found despite numerous studies searching for a genetic connection. Now in a study published yesterday in the Quarterly Review of Biology, researchers from the U.S. National Institute of Mathematical and Biological Synthesis suggest homosexuality has an epigenetic link, not a genetic one. Epigenetics explains how gene expression is regulated by temporary switches, called epi-marks. These constitute an extra layer of information attached to our genes' backbones that determine their effect on our development. While genes hold the instructions, epi-marks direct how those instructions are carried out – when, where and how much a gene is expressed during development. Gay marriage: A study suggests homosexuality has an epigenetic link, not a genetic one, allowing it to confound the usual rules of evolution . Epi-marks are usually produced anew each generation, but recent evidence demonstrates that they sometimes carryover between generations and thus can contribute to similarity among relatives, resembling the effect of shared genes. William Rice, an an evolutionary biologist at the University of California Santa Barbara and lead author of the study, says epi-marks can determine the development of homosexuality in the offspring of heterosexual parents. 'There is compelling evidence that epi-marks contribute to both the similarity and dissimilarity of family members, and can therefore feasibly contribute to the observed familial inheritance of homosexuality and its low concordance between [identical] twins,' he told U.S. News. Dr Rice and his team integrated evolutionary theory with recent advances in the molecular regulation of gene expression and androgen-dependent sexual development to produce a biological and mathematical model that delineates the role of epigenetics in homosexuality. Sex-specific epi-marks produced in early foetal development protect each sex from the substantial natural variation in testosterone that occurs during later foetal development, the researchers say. Sex-specific epi-marks stop girl foetuses from being masculinised when they experience atypically high testosterone, and vice versa for boy foetuses. Different epi-marks protect different sex-specific traits from being masculinised or feminised – some affect the genitals, others sexual identity, and yet others affect sexual partner preference. However, when these epi-marks are transmitted across generations from fathers to daughters or mothers to sons, they may cause reversed effects, such as the feminisation of some traits in sons, such as sexual preference, and similarly a partial masculinisation of daughters. The study solves the evolutionary riddle of homosexuality, finding that 'sexually antagonistic' epi-marks, which normally protect parents from natural variation in sex hormone levels during foetal development, sometimes carry over across generations and cause homosexuality in opposite-sex offspring. The mathematical modeling demonstrates that genes coding for these epi-marks can easily spread in the population because they always increase the fitness of the parent but only rarely escape erasure and reduce fitness in offspring. 'Transmission of sexually antagonistic epi-marks between generations is the most plausible evolutionary mechanism of the phenomenon of human homosexuality,' said study co-author Sergey Gavrilets, a professor at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville.","New study answers puzzle of why homosexuality seems to run in families .

"Leaders of clowns gathered for a convention in Mexico City said Wednesday they are saddened that a killer disguised himself as a clown to kill a drug lord last week, and insisted no true member of their profession would have committed the crime. Convicted drug trafficker Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix was shot to death Friday in the Baja beach resort of Los Cabos by a gunman wearing a clown costume, including a wig and a rubber nose. The dead man was the eldest brother of Mexico's once-feared Arellano Felix clan. Scroll down for video . Saddened: Tomas Morales, pictured here posing for a portrait at the 17th International Clown Convention in Mexico City, said that no real clown would commit murder . Happy days: Mexican clown Morales stands in front of hundreds of clowns as he tries to organize a group photo and a laugh-a-thon against violence in Mexico during the International Clown Convention in Mexico City . Clown leader Tomas Morales, a 21-year veteran of the trade who goes by the stage name ‘Payaso Llantom,’ said he was certain the killer was not a professional clown. He said clowns in Mexico, especially in outlying states, know each other and their costumes and makeup are individualized and recognizable. ‘The people who do that, they're not . clowns. I can swear on my mother's grave it wasn't a clown,’ said . Morales, whose costume includes frizzy blue hair and a tiny top hat. ‘We . are not like that ... we are nonviolent.’ ‘Bufon Marley,’ the stage name of . 49-year-old Alberto Villanueva, who dresses a bit like a medieval . jester, said of the killer, ‘It's sad that it has fallen to that level.’ ‘I don't think it has anything to do . with us; we do the complete opposite,’ Villanueva said. ‘I don't think . it will hurt our profession, because in our communities, people know . us.’ Killed: Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix has been shot dead at a beach house . Morales said there have been past cases of thieves stealing clown costumes to commit crimes. ‘We clowns suffer robberies,’ Morales . said. ‘The criminals have stolen our vehicles, our costumes, our sound . equipment, our makeup, and with these same tools we use to work, they . use them to commit robberies.’ An estimated 500 clowns from around . Mexico and the rest of Latin America gathered Wednesday at the . International Clown Meeting and held a 15-minute laugh-a-thon ‘to . demonstrate their opposition to the generalized violence that prevails . in our country.’ As hard as it might sound to be a . clown in a country so riven by crime and violence, the laughing came . naturally, Villanueva said. ‘We laugh at the very things that hurt us,’ he said. ‘It is a very special, very Mexican humor.’ A spokesman for state prosecutors, describing Felix's murder, said: ‘A person dressed as a clown took his life,’ adding that the gunman fled the scene. 'He was hit by two bullets, one in . the chest and one in the head,' Isai Arias, a Baja California state . government official, said. Attack: A gunman disguised as a clown shot the former head of the Tijuana Cartel in the Los Cabos resort . Criminal past: A court sketch from 2006 shows Arellano Felix, left, in court in California . Local media reported that the killer . had two accomplices when he attacked the former drug lord at a rented . beach house, but this was not yet clear. Arellano Felix spent nearly 15 years behind bars for drug-related offenses after his arrest in Mexico in 1993. He was extradited to the U.S. in 2006 and after being granted parole and released he returned to Mexico in 2008. 'He was never really part of the . leadership of the big organization, mostly because he was in jail [in . Mexico]. He was arrested before they became what they really became,' John Kirby, a former federal prosecutor in San Diego, who co-wrote a . 2003 indictment against the cartel, said. Another official working with state . prosecutors said Arellano Felix, the oldest of the brothers who headed . the gang, was not wanted by authorities at the time of his death. The possibility that his killer had ties to organized crime was being investigated, the official said. Arellano Felix had been arrested in . 1993 in connection with the murder of Roman Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus . Posadas Ocampo, and served a ten-year sentence for weapons possession. Mexican officials were concerned that . he would return to drug trafficking after serving his Mexican sentence . and asked their U.S. counterparts to seek his extradition. 'The Mexicans were very concerned he was going to get out,' Mr Kirby said. He found enough evidence to bring . charges and Arellano Felix was extradited to the U.S. in 2006 to face . California charges stemming from a 1980 case in which he allegedly sold . cocaine to an undercover police officer. Led by a large family of brothers and . sisters, the Tijuana Cartel was one of the most powerful drug gangs in . Mexico until it was gradually weakened by the capture or killing of . several leading members. Arellano Felix's younger brothers, . Francisco Javier, Benjamin and Eduardo are serving prison sentences in . the U.S. Another of his brothers, Ramon, was killed in a shootout with . police in 2002.","Clown Tomas Morales underlined that his trade is a nonviolent one .

'I want to thank the Jones family and the entire Cowboys organization for this opportunity, as well as my friends, family, teammates, and fans for their support.' The Rams drafted the former SEC defensive player of the year from Missouri late in the seventh round in May. He was pick No. 249 out of 256. Sam had three sacks in the preseason with St. Louis playing mostly against second- and third-stringers. The Cowboys are among the league's worst in sacks but have been getting solid production with a rotation in the front four of a defense exceeding expectations. Kiss seen 'round the world: Sam shook up the pro sports community when he locked lips with his boyfriend Vito Cammisano on ESPN after being drafted by the Rams . Dallas also has rookie second-round pick DeMarcus Lawrence close to coming back after breaking his right foot in training camp. He was placed on short-term injured reserve and will be eligible to play next week against Arizona. Veteran defensive end Anthony Spencer has been getting stronger each week in his return from microfracture knee surgery that sidelined him all but one game last season. The Cowboys (6-1), off to their best start since they were 12-1 in 2007, are playing their second straight NFC East opponent at home, with Washington (2-5) visiting Monday night. While releasing Sam, the Cowboys added linebacker Troy Davis of Central Florida and defensive tackle Ken Bishop of Northern Illinois to their practice squad.","Sam, 24, was drafted and then cut by the St. Louis Rams before being hired onto the Dallas practice squad for just 7 weeks .

"At least 44 people died and dozens more were injured when an overcrowded bus fell off a clifftop in Guatemala and plunged 650 ft into a ravine below. The Guatemalan government declared three days of national mourning after the crash which happened around 40 miles northwest of the capital Guatemala City yesterday. Firefighters said that 38 people died at the scene of the crash including six children and a dozen women. Deadly crash: At least 44 people were killed after a bus fell off a clifftop and into a ravine in Guatemala. The wreckage of the bus is pictured . Carnage: Rescue workers surround the wreckage of the bus while they search for survivors . Tragic: Firefighters recover a body following the crash which happened yesterday morning . Horror: Rescuers cover the bodies of some of those killed in the bus crash close to Guatemala City . At least three of those killed were reportedly babies. Officials say that the bus was carrying around 90 people when it fell into the ravine, despite only having an official capacity of 54. Early investigations suggested that the driver of the bus, Yony Cumar Cana, who died in the crash, may have lost control on a bend. Residents of the closest town San Martín Jilotepeque gathered at the crash scene as rescue workers began retreiving bodies from the scene. Shocking: The bus plunged around 650ft down into the ravine after the driver apparently lost control on a bend . Grim: At least three of those killed in the crash are said to have been babies . Mayor Otto Vielman said: 'From what we see, the bus crashed against a wall of rocks first and then fell over the cliff.' Many of the passengers on board are said to have been vendors taking farm produce to sell at a market in the city. Around 46 passengers were taken to hospital for treatment. Onlookers: Locals gather at the site of the crash to watch the rescue operation . Rescue effort: Hydraulic equipment was used to cut some of the survivors from the wreckage of the bus, say rescuers . Probe: Early investigations suggest that the driver of the bus, who was killed in the crash, may have hit a wall before the bus careered off the cliff . Grieving families gathered outside a recreation center near the accident site where authorities set up a makeshift morgue to identify the bodies of the passengers. spokesman for the volunteer fire department, Mario Cruz, said: 'Some of the people were rescued with hydraulic equipment, and others were thrown (from the bus) at the time of the accident.' The route is made up mostly of dirt roads that wind through steep mountains without guardrails or other safety measures. The mayor said a similar bus accident in 2000 on the same road killed 40 people. The last major bus crash in the country occurred in 2008 when an overcrowded bus slid off a highway and down a 50ft slope 40 miles southeast of the capital, killing 53.

"A fugitive former bank boss is set to be stripped of assets worth more than £150million including an £18million mansion in one of London's most upmarket streets. Mukhtar Ablyazov, who fled Britain earlier this year after he was sentenced to 22-months in jail for failing to disclose full details about his wealth, is accused of defrauding one of Kazakhstan's largest banks while he was chairman in 2009. Sitting at London's Court of Appeal yesterday, senior judge Lord Justice Maurice Kay said Ablyazov had shown 'rare cynicism and deviousness' as he fought the claims against him. Cynical: Mukhtar Ablyazov (pictured) fled Britain this year after being sentenced to 22-months in jail and has had £150m of assets seized . Mr Ablyazov’s property portfolio in Britain is worth more than £63 . million. His Bishops Avenue property — Carlton House — is worth £17 . million and is in a street nicknamed Billionaires' Row. The mansion has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, and is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts. He also has a £1m apartment in Albert . Court, closet to Lord's cricket ground; and Oaklands Park - a 100-acre . estate on the edge of Windsor Great Park with tennis courts and . helicopter pad. Taken: Ablyazov's mansion in Hampstead, which has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts . Judges heard that Ablyazov, who is in his late 40s, had been a Kazakhstan government minister and chairman of a Kazakh bank. He had been accused of defrauding the bank he used to run of more than £3billion. Ablyazov denies wrongdoing and says any allegations are politically motivated. The JSC BTA Bank, now owned by the . state of Kazakhstan, alleged 'widespread misappropriation' and had . launched legal action in England in the hope of recovering as much as . possible. Missing: The former banker's whereabouts remain unknown and he was handed a 22-month sentence for contempt of court . In February, a High Court judge concluded that Ablyazov had been in contempt and imposed a 22-month jail term. Mr Justice Teare said Ablyazov was accused of 'fraud on an epic scale' and had committed 'deliberate and substantial' contempts by breaching an asset-freezing order imposed to stop money vanishing before litigation concluded. Ablyazov did not appear at the High Court hearing. Mr Justice Teare issued a warrant - but the former banker's whereabouts remain unknown.Ablyazov today failed to overturn rulings by Mr Justice Teare in the Court of Appeal. In May, a Court of Appeal judge ruled that Ablyazov could launch an appeal against Mr Justice Teare's rulings even though he was on the run. Lord Justice Moore-Bick said 'it would not be in the interests of justice' to require Ablyazov to surrender to custody as a condition of proceeding with an appeal. Three appeal judges - Lord Justice Maurice Kay, Lord Justice Rix and Lord Justice Toulson - heard argument from lawyers at an appeal hearing in London in July before dismissing Ablyazov's challenges in a written decision today.","Mukhtar Ablyazov is accused of £3billion fraud .

"The horrific truth of the angora fur industry is revealed in these shocking images from a Chinese workshop. The rabbits are tied up and stretched out before workers rip out the fur by hand, leaving the rabbits bleeding in their cages. In a video recorded by PETA in China, where 90 per cent of the world's angora fur is sourced, the animals can be heard screaming in pain. Scroll down for video . Factory horror: An angora rabbit is tied up and its skin stretched as it is being cut with an electric shear . The animals are kept for two to five years, with their fur being yanked out every two-three months, according to PETA Asia. When the fur has been plucked, the animals are thrown into tiny cages to recover. Once a bunny has outlived its purpose, it is killed and skinned. ‘PETA UK is appealing to shoppers this holiday season’, says PETA UK Associate Director Mimi Bekhechi. ‘Please take the time to read the label on that sweater or scarf. If it says ""angora,"" leave the item on the rack.’ Pain and suffering: The terror in the animal's eyes is unmistakeable as a worker with a Chinese angora trader stretches it out and yanks out its fur . Animal cruelty: The angora rabbits are alive throughout the plucking and are kept for several years, plucked every few months, before their throats are slit . Torture: The Chinese fur traders use the plucking technique as it results in better quality fur and more money . Shocking truth: The animals are constantly injured from throughout the plucking as they struggle to break free . Left to recover: After the rabbit had had all its fur yanked out it is thrown into a cage to regrow its fur in complete solitude . Rabbits who have their fur cut or sheared also suffer: during the cutting process, their front and back legs are tightly tethered and the sharp cutting tools inevitably wound them as they struggle desperately to escape. PETA reports that the traders keep the animals in solitary in barren wire cages that harm their sensitive feet. They are denied solid flooring, bedding and the vital companionship of other rabbits. In China, there are no penalties for animal abuse on rabbit farms and no standards that regulate the treatment of animals. WARNING: Content in this video has been censored.

"Florida police are investigating after cell phone footage emerged of officers appearing to put a boy in a choke hold and kicking him to the ground. The Boynton Beach force has put one officer on administrative leave as it investigates how police treated two grade six students who had been taken off a school bus on Thursday last week. As the youngsters, who are thought to be 11 years old, are handcuffed and made to sit on the sidewalk, their classmates filmed from the window of the bus. Scroll down for video .

In one piece of footage, an officer appears to put one of the detained teenagers in a choke hold, before marching him towards a grass embankment. In a second film, as a boy is handcuffed an officer walks over and appears to kick the student's legs, forcing him to fall to the ground. The boys had been removed from the school bus because of reports of minor misbehavior, Gawker reported. A police spokesman said that no formal complaints had been made about the incident, but the audio in the footage shows the shock other students had at what was happening. At first, there was a sense of excitement on the bus as the students discussed the arrests of their classmates, while an adult could be heard in the background ordering them to sit down. But as the alleged rough handling of the boys was witnessed, the youngsters sounded shocked.

"A shocking video shows a teacher helplessly stuck in the middle of a classroom fight - with no one coming to her aid. The footage, recorded by a teenage boy in the class at Gibbs High School in St Petersburg, Florida, shows two young girls exchanging a war of words with their classmates egging them on. The female teacher initially stands between the girls, trying to get them to calm down, but then the students start lashing out at each other - and she can do nothing but stand back and watch. Other students clear tables to make way for the fight, while they encourage the girls to scrap. Scroll down for video . Helpless: A teacher at a Florida high school is caught on camera as she unsuccessfully tries to stop two girls from fighting in her classroom. At one point she became a barricade between the girls . The fighting students can be seen pulling each other's hair, slapping each other's faces and dragging each other across the floor in the four-minute footage. The teacher can do nothing but abandon any effort to continue teaching the class. At some point, she called for help, but it is not clear when, Pinellas County Schools spokeswoman Melanie Marquez Parra told the Tampa Bay Times. A campus monitor, two administrators and another teacher responded to the fight, Parra said. On the video, a group can be seen pulling the two girls apart. She would not reveal the grade or name of the teacher because it could identify the students. St. Petersburg police spokesman Mike Puetz told the Times that officers were not called to the scene. Out of control: She can be seen left at the corner of the frame as she gets between the girls - but they push past her, with one girl grabbing the other's hair, right .

The video of the fight was posted on Facebook and later removed - but it continued to circulate. The student who filmed the fight, as well as the two students involved, are now both facing punishment, which could be anywhere between suspension, school reassignment and expulsion. Board members said that Gibbs High has struggled with a poor reputation due to the number of fights on campus, and said they feared that this incident would only worsen that belief. 'I am extremely hurt because we have really been making strides and Gibbs itself has been making strides,' board member Rene Flowers said. 'Now you have this situation that sets it back.' She added that she was stunned to see the disrespect the students showed the teacher. Probe: Officials are dealing with the incident internally and the students involved face punishments . Lisa Wheeler-Brown, president of the Council of Neighborhood Associations, agreed. 'Number one, I don't see how this could go on in a classroom - the students could just blatantly disrespect the teacher and the other students who want to learn,' she told the Times. 'It's a sad reality that in too many of our classrooms, teachers spend just as much time trying to keep control as they do teaching.' Last . year, Gibbs High School issued 76 out-of-school suspensions for fighting, the most . of any Pinellas high school. It also had the highest rate of suspensions, with 20.5 . percent of students suspended for at least one day last year.

"Tax row: The French government is demanding £160million from internet retailer Amazon in unpaid tax . The internet giant Amazon has received a £159million demand from France for unpaid taxes. The figure includes fines and interest in relation to 'the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions'. European nations including Britain are clamping down on US firms that channel their vast profits through low-tax countries. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said Amazon, Starbucks and Google should all be punished for not paying their 'fair share' of tax. She has called for consumers to boycott the firms in protest against what she describes as 'immoral' tax avoidance here. But Amazon said it might go to court to fight the French tax claim, which relates to four years from 2006. A report by the company says: 'We disagree with the proposed assessment and intend to vigorously contest it.' Amazon's public policy chief for Europe, Andrew Cecil, appeared before the public accounts committee on Monday, and the French demand was referred to during the hearing. The company keeps its tax bill down in European countries by channelling money through Luxembourg, which offers generous concessions to businesses. Google, which channels its profits through Ireland, is also being audited by the French tax authorities. Andrew Cecil, Director Public Policy at Amazon, received a grilling at a commons committee hearing over the company's tax strategy . Amazon has also run into problems with the tax authorities in other countries, with American and Japanese officials both forcing the company to ‘reach an agreement’ on the allocation of the company’s earnings between 2006 and 2012. The company has also revealed that it is under investigation by the US Internal Revenue Service over its tax returns for the two years from 2005. The company is also facing demands for taxes dating back to 2003 from countries including China, Germany, and Luxembourg, as well as Britain. Google is currently being audited by the French, although the company has denied a report that it the Paris tax authorities want 1 billion in back taxes. Yesterday, Andrew Cecil the online retailer's . public policy director, told the commons committee that the business's . turnover in 2011 was £7.3billion yet it paid . taxes of just £6.4million. Amazon employs nearly 70,000 people world-wide. Last year, it turned over more than $48bn revenue. The company was founded in 1994. But since then has grown into the biggest online retailed in the world. It is estimated to be worth $102.51bn . Some 65million customers log on to its U.S. website each month. It paid no UK tax in 2010 on revenues of . £3.3billion. MPs were furious that he refused to reveal how much the company made from its British arm. 'It's quite insulting to our . intelligence that you claim you don't know what sales you make in the . UK,' said Liberal Democrat MP Ian Swales, a member of the influential . Commons committee. Mr Cecil claimed that Luxembourg, . which employs around 500 people, was the real 'engine' of the business, . rather than the UK, where it employs 15,000. Its profits are booked in Luxembourg, . with the UK figuring only as a 'service arm'. MPs said his answers were . 'evasive' and 'annoying' and Margaret Hodge said the committee would . call 'a serious person' for further questioning. She said Mr Cecil's ignorance was 'outrageous' and that he had 'been put up' to it by the company. The parliamentary committee, which is . also examining the tax affairs of Google and Starbucks,  said it would . be summoning a more senior Amazon executive to answer their questions. It is not just in Europe that Amazon has run into problems with the tax authorities. In its statement to the SEC, it revealed that US and Japanese tax authorities had reached an agreement on the allocation of the company's earnings between those two countries for 2006-12. The cost to Amazon of this settlement was 'not significant', it said. The company however also revealed that it remains under investigation by the US Internal Revenue Service over its tax returns for 2005 and 2006. It also admitted that there was a chance of the company being hit by demands for taxes dating back to 2003 in 'various states and other foreign jurisdictions' including China, Germany, Luxembourg, and Britain.","Figure includes fines and interest in relation to 'the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions'

"A band of parents have formed a vigilante group to snare suspected paedophiles. Their tactics have led to six arrests – but police forces have reacted with anger, warning that they could be compromising existing investigations.

Confrontation: Members of Letzgo Hunting filming an encounter with an alleged would-be paedophile . Making a break: The suspect appears to start running once the group leader confronts him . Using these, the group, who call themselves Letzgo Hunting, exchange . messages with suspected paedophiles, sometimes for weeks, before luring . them into meetings in parks or other public areas. The parents, some of whom are trained in the martial arts of jujitsu and . karate, film the resulting confrontations, in which they demand an . explanation from the men and warn them to expect to be arrested. They then upload the footage on to their website and Facebook page. Their most recent video, created on Sunday, shows a suspect flee as a . vigilante gives chase in a park on the outskirts of Leicester.

Vigilantes: The Facebook homepage of 'Letzgo Hunting', a group of parents exposing alleged paedophiles . Social media: The group posts videos of its sting operations on sites such as Facebook and Twitter, pictured . The clip was viewed 4,000 times within two hours yesterday. The group’s . Twitter account was also inundated with messages of support from members . of the public as word of their activities spread. The group – three men and a woman assisted by 13 ‘helpers’ – admit to . being vigilantes but say they are not a lynch mob and never threaten . violence. But Leicestershire Police warned that such ‘naming and shaming’ tactics . threatened ‘chances of success in court’, potentially blocking justice. Child welfare charity the NSPCC also urged the group to step back and . said tracking down paedophiles must be done ‘by proper authorities’. And Warwickshire Police and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection . Centre added to warnings that vigilantes could harm investigations. Letzgo Hunting’s leader, who calls himself Scumm Buster, told the Daily . Mail he works in the security industry, but declined to reveal the . backgrounds of the others. He said the group had 84 online profiles, . using images of young-looking adult female friends with their consent. Sometimes these were airbrushed to remove signs of ageing such as . wrinkles and ‘make the girls look obviously young’. Arrests: Seven alleged predators have been apprehended over the past few weeks thanks to the group . Controversial: Police have warned that the vigilantes could be undermining legitimate law enforcement . He added: ‘Usually the men meet us under their real names but we will . also try to find out what car they will be arriving in, so we can make a . note of the registration plate to pass on to the police.’ He said the explicit nature of some of the men’s online messages was . ‘shocking’, but explained it was crucial to actually meet each suspect . because that is what proves their ‘intent’ to break the law under the . Sexual Offences Act 2003 by inciting a child to participate in a sexual . act.

"The love of her life died fighting in the trenches of the First World War and she had lived through the horrors of the London Blitz. But nothing prepared Britain’s oldest woman for the terror of being targeted in her own home by a violent career criminal. Grace Jones had just celebrated her . 112th birthday when Jesse Coker burst into her flat. He kicked her door . down and shoved her against a wall as he rifled her handbag, snatching . £100 in cash. Jesse Coker (right) pretended to be a delivery man to gain access to her . home, where he pinched her purse. Yesterday, after he was jailed for . four and a half years, it emerged that Coker was on licence at the time . for a series of burglaries in which he preyed on the elderly. The 46-year-old has 16 convictions for . 48 burglaries dating back to the age of ten. Yet he was let out in May . 2009 after serving half of a seven-year sentence despite the risk of him . reoffending. Miss Jones, who was born on December 7, 1899, became the oldest living person in Britain in February this year. Jesse Coker, 46, tricked his way into the home of Grace Jones (right) in south London a month after her 112th birthday. The spinster had only celebrated her 112th birthday a month before she was attacked in her home in Rotherhithe, south London. The former seamstress, who lost her . 19-year-old fiancé Albert Rees during the First World War, now lives . alone in the area which has become a magnet for crime. Woolwich Crown . Court heard that five days before her birthday, an unidentified thief . entered her home and stole her £300 pension. The next day Coker attempted to . break-in by posing as a parcel delivery man but her neighbour Matthew . Maddigan, 31, chased him off after the brave pensioner told Coker to . ‘hop it’. Then on January 24, Miss Jones answered a knock at the door to find Coker posing as a policeman. Vivian Walters, prosecuting, said: . ‘Miss Jones went to the door and called out “Who’s there?” ‘She was . expecting the district nurse to visit her that day in order to change a . dressing on her leg. ‘She heard no reply so she opened the . door a crack. He pushed the door open, barged past Mrs Jones and made . his way into the flat.’ When the trembling victim followed him into the living room, Coker pushed her against the wall. He grabbed her purse, which contained . £100 as well as other treasured items including a four leaf clover she . kept for luck, before leaving her crumpled on the floor. Mr Maddigan confronted Coker outside . having recognised him, but the thug threatened to stab them, snarling: . ‘I’ve got a tool and I will hurt you.’ The neighbour said: ‘I was just so . shocked to see the same guy back again. I heard someone ring Grace’s . doorbell and opened the door to make sure everything was alright. ‘I heard Grace say “What are you doing” and “Get off me” so I rushed downstairs. ‘I confronted him. I just wanted him . to stop and tried to get in his way. He said he had a knife and was . going to stab me. He kept saying he was going to kill me.’ Coker was only caught when he was spotted by chance by Mr Maddigan the next day a mile away. He flagged down a police car and the thief was arrested on the spot. But the criminal continued to deny responsibility until he suddenly changed his plea on the first day of his trial on Tuesday. Yesterday Miss Jones said she has been ‘frightened ever since’ and now refused to leave her home. She said: ‘I told him to hop it. Then some days later, he came back and said he was from the police. ‘After I opened the door, he pushed me and got my bag. I have been frightened ever since.’ The spinster, who has outlived her . seven siblings, added: ‘I am so old that all my friends and family are . now dead. I think I’m very lucky to have such good neighbours. ‘They are my family now, and they know it. They are very good to me.’ Detective Constable Mark Powell, from . Southwark’s Priority Crime Unit, said: ‘Coker picked on a vulnerable . victim who he believed to be an easy target, he didn’t consider the . bravery of the victim or the tenacity of her neighbours who were . commended by the judge at today’s sentencing. ‘It is thanks to them Coker was . apprehended so quickly and allowed police to conduct a thorough . investigation, giving him no choice but plead guilty.’","Jesse Coker, 46, jailed for four years and five months after tricking his way into her south London home .

"An FBI agent who authored a highly sensitive FBI interrogation manual submitted the document for copyright protection - making it available at the Library of Congress for anyone with a library card to read. The inexplicable mistake has been reported by Mother Jones journalist Nick Baumann who viewed the document, which was written in 2008 and submitted for copyright at the U.S. Copyright Office in 2010. Baumann reports that the filing is baffling for several reasons, not least that any member of the public can read the document that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) fought for years to gain access to. Publicly available: The FBI interrogation manual has been available for any member of the public to read at the Library of Congress since 2010 . The FBI did eventually provide the ACLU with a copy of the interrogation guidebook in 2012, but it was heavily redacted, reports Mother Jones, with whole pages blacked out. Unlike the very similar version which has been sitting in the Library of Congress since 2010. Interrogation: The FBI's interrogation methods have previously been made available only in heavily redacted form to the ACLU . In addition, the 70-page manual is a . secret government document and government documents cannot be . copyrighted: Anything 'prepared by an officer or employee of the United . States government as part of that person's official duties' is not . subject to copyright in the United States. 'A . document that has not been released does not even need a copyright,' Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy expert at the Federation of . American Scientists told Mother Jones. 'Who is going to plagiarize from it? Even if you wanted to, you couldn't violate the copyright because you don't have the document. It isn't available.' Calling the copyright filing 'a comedy of errors,' Aftergood says it seems to be the result of 'gross incompetence and ignorance.' According to Mother Jones, agent who . authored the manual and then filed it for copyright is an FBI . supervisory special agent who once worked as a unit chief in the FBI's . counter-terrorism division. He registered the work under his own name, effectively claiming rights for the document for himself and not for the FBI. Baumann . was able to compare the document obtained by the ACLU with the . unredacted FBI manual and find out what the blacked out parts in the . ACLU version might have contained. 'A redacted sentence in the manual says the document is intended for use by the FBI's ""clean"" teams - investigators who collect information intended for use in federal prosecutions,' writes Baumann. 'That raises the question of whether teams collecting information that's not for use in federal courts would have to follow the manual's (already permissive) guidelines at all.'","The author of a sensitive FBI interrogation manual submitted the document for copyright protection .

"Loss: Capt. Lucas Gruenther's body was recovered several miles off the coast of Italy on Thursday . The body of a U.S. fighter pilot has been recovered from Italy’s Adriatic Sea Thursday, days after he went missing while piloting an F-16. Capt. Lucas Gruenther’s body was recovered early Thursday afternoon by an Italian vessel seven miles from the coast. The 32-year-old captain had been missing since Monday, after the Air Force lost contact with him; he was flying an F-16 Falcon. During the frantic search, Capt. Gruenther’s family kept their hopes high. His wife, Cassy, remained optimistic as the search went on. ‘If anyone could survive something like this, it would be Luc,’ she said from her home in northern Italy. Mrs Gruenther, who is weeks away from delivering their first child, Serene, said yesterday that she had faith that her husband was coming home. ‘If he has his mind set on something, he will find a way to make it happen,’ she told the Aviano Air Force Base blog. ‘If he wants to do something, he finds a way to do it.’ Mrs Gruenther added on Wednesday that her husband was highly active in the local community, and learned Italian at lightning speed, and added that he had aspirations of making a lifetime career out of the Air Force. Embrace: Cassy Gruenther hugs her husband, Lucas before he flies of for a mission; the two were high school sweethearts . Expecting: Cassy Gruenther is expecting the couple's first child, a daughter they planned to name Serene . Following the discovery of his body off the coast of Pesaro, the Gruenther family released a statement expressing their grief and thanking those who searched tirelessly to recover him. ‘A compassionate husband, a loving son, and a devoted brother, Luc leaves behind a family who loves him dearly and a legacy of achievement. 'We will never fully recover from our loss, but take heart in the knowledge that during his all-too-shirt time in this world, he made a significant difference in the lives of all whom he met. ‘We would like to thank the people around the world for your messages and your prayers. We especially want to extend our deepest gratitude to the many people who volunteered their time and resources to help bring Luc home.’ World travelers: The young couple traveled around the globe and documented their travels in a blog . Adventurous: Mrs Gruenther said that her husband was very brave and had hope to the last that he would be found alive . On Wednesday, search crews located his parachute and helmet scattered among the debris floating in the water. Even so, Mrs Gruenther held onto hope, saying that the helmet was found in good condition. Brig. Gen. Schott J. Zobrist, 31st FW commander said in a statement: ‘Capt. Gruenther was an outstanding officer who epitomized what it means to be an Airman. He was not only a first-rate pilot; he was an exceptional leader whose presence will be sorely missed.’ He added that his ‘thoughts and prayers’ were with his surviving family members. According to the Modesto Bee, Capt. Gruenther was from Twain Harte, California; he and Cassy were high school sweethearts. She documented the many travels she took with her husband on a personal blog. Capt. Gruenther was a graduate of the Air Force Academy and flew multiple combat missions during a six-month deployment to Afghanistan in 2011. Missing: The Air Force searched the Adriatic Sea after losing contact with a U.S. fighter jet during a training mission off the coast of Italy; an F-16 is pictured at the base in this photo . The paramilitary Carabinieri force deployed helicopters, the Italian coast guard had motorboats in the area and Italian air force helicopters were also involved. The search was being concentrated in the waters off a roughly a 9.5 mile stretch of coast between Cervia and Cesenatico in the northwestern end of the Adriatic. Italian news agency LaPresse said the F-16 had sent an alarm signal to Aviano before it disappeared, and that three other F-16s that were flying in the same training mission made it safely back to Aviano base. Location: Aviano Air Force Base is located in northern Italy .","F-16 of Capt. Lucas Gruenther went missing off the coast of Italy on Monday during training exercise .
