"Sydney Swans veteran  Adam Goodes has revealed that he is considering entering politics when he playing days with Australian Football are over. The Australian of the Year recipient has been vocal in the past about his desire to be remembered as more than a football player, and to use his career in AFL as a way to create history on and off the field. 'I don’t simply want to be remembered for just kicking around a footy. I want to be remembered for making a difference,' Goodes said. Scroll down for video . Adam Goodes has expressed interest in a career in politics when he hangs up his Sydney Swans jersey . Goodes was the 2014 Australian Of The Year . The premiership-winning captain, who is an anti-racism activist, said that a career in politics after he retires from AFL is an option. 'I wouldn’t say yes or no to politics but it is a real option. It allows you to do something positive for a large amount of people,' Goodes said. Goodes said that he was passionate about addressing issues such as domestic violence, and throwing his energy into campaigns such as Say No to Racism, and the Recognise campaign to include indigenous Australians in the constitution. He said that he knew politicians in sympathy with the causes would be needed to make a real impact. Goodes, an ambassador for Indigenous Australians, said that a decade ago he had suffered mental health issues in the past which had made him passionate about seeing others reach out for help. 'Only about 10 years ago I fell in a pretty dark hole. I was pretty upset. I didn’t want to be in Sydney any more and I had to go and see someone – I was constantly down. I had to ask for help because I didn’t know how to help myself,' he told news.com.au. Speaking about the high pressure environment of football, Goodes said that the spotlight was always on during game time, which made reaching out even more vital. At 34, Goodes has played more than 300 AFL matches for Sydney and was twice named the best player of the year. He was crowned the Brownlow Medalist in 2003 and 2006 and was this year given the country's top honour when named Australian Of The Year. 'Very proud' Australian Of The Year Adam Goodes said his indigenous heritage is a very important part of his life. On receiving his award he said he was a 'very proud indigenous man' who was keen to fight racism in Australia. He said it was a different accolade altogether to the one's he was used to receiving in AFL. 'I’m a little bit overwhelmed, to be honest. It’s not like winning a premiership or winning a Brownlow medal for the skills that you show on the football field, it’s quite amazing.' Earlier in the year during an interview with the BBC, the AFL star said some Australian policies had resulted in the suppression of indigenous people and other minorities and called for better education about the country's history. 'The history of our country is built on so much lies and racial policies, and things that have suppressed my people and lots of minorities in this country, so you can't blame people for having the views that they have,' he said. Racist: Adam Goodes points to the 13-year-old girl after she shouted 'Ape' at him . Challenge: Goodes (right) and Marley Williams of Collingwood battle for the ball . He also said children needed to be taught that Australia wasn't founded by Captain James Cook. 'I can use my position to help educate people to see through the things that they've been taught growing up,' he said. Goodes stepped up his work as an anti-racism campaigner last year after being subjected to abuse by a 13-year-old girl during a Sydney Swans game, and later became the subject of a joke made by Collingwood President Eddie McGuire in relation to King Kong the musical. On Shane Warne and the controversial Twitter admission he made during an AFL match where the leg spinner said he was 'shocked' he won the Australian Of The Year honour, Goodes said: . Adam Goodes of the Sydney Swans speaks to the media during an AFL press conference on May 25, 2013 in Melbourne, Australia - to address the racial abuse sent his way the previous evening . 'My argument has always been, 'I didn't nominate me...I don't have a vote on the Australia Day council, it's their choice.' Former test Cricketer Adam Gilchrist who is a member of the Australian Day council said Shane Warne is entitled to his opinion on both the AFL player and the Australian of The Year winner, but stopped at saying Warne was 'racist'. 'Some have misconstrued Warnie's comments as racist. People have got wildly out of control if they think that.'","Sydney Swans veteran Adam Goodes said that he wants to be remembered 'for making a difference'

"Colorado emerged as the state with the second-highest percentage of regular marijuana users as it began legalizing the drug, according to a new national study. The Denver Post  reports the study by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found about one out of every eight Colorado residents older than 12 had used marijuana in the past month. Only Rhode Island topped Colorado in the percentage of residents who reported using pot as often, according to the study. The study averaged state-specific data over two-year periods. It found that, for the 2011-2012 period, 10.4 percent of Colorado residents 12 and older said they had used pot in the month before being surveyed. That number jumped to 12.7 percent in the 2012-2013 data. That means about 530,000 people in Colorado use marijuana at least once a month, according to the results. Scroll down for video . The study by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found about one out of every eight Colorado residents older than 12 had used marijuana in the past month (file picture) Nationally, about 7.4 percent of people 12 and older reported monthly marijuana use. That's an increase of about 4 percent. In Washington state, which also legalized marijuana use and limited possession for adults, monthly pot use rose about 20 percent to 12.3 percent of people 12 and older. The survey is among the first to quantify pot use in Colorado since late 2012, when voters approved legal pot use and possession for those over 21. But the survey did not analyze data from 2014, when recreational marijuana shops opened, which means it is not a good indication of the effect of commercial sales on marijuana use. ""I don't think this tells us about the long-term impacts of legalization,"" said University of California, Los Angeles, professor Mark Kleiman, who studies marijuana policy. The number of medical marijuana patients in Colorado rose over the same time period, so the results are not surprising, Kleiman said. He told The Post that researchers will have a better idea about pot use in the first state to legalize recreational sales of the drug once they can focus on data showing how many people use pot daily. ""The fraction of people who are monthly users who are in fact daily users has gone way, way up,"" he said. Nationally, about 7.4 percent of people 12 and older reported monthly marijuana use. That's an increase of about 4 percent .","Only Rhode Island topped the percentage of residents who used the drug .

"Police hunting for a rogue Afghan policeman who shot dead an unwitting British soldier have arrested a suspect. Corporal Brent McCarthy, who was attached to the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, was gunned down while guarding a base in Lashkar Gar in Helmand Province. The 25-year-old died alongside Lance Corporal Lee Davies, 27, after they were shot by men dressed in Afghan police uniform in May 2012. Chilling photographs emerged of the tragic British comrades smiling and posing with their killers just moments before they opened fire. Moments after this picture was taken, the gunman and another man gunned down Cpl Brent McCarthy . It has emerged the RAF policeman's parents have received news of one or more people being detained by Afghan authorities in connection with their son's murder . The man thought to have murdered Lance Corporal Davies was shot by a British soldier as he fled the compound and was later executed by Afghan police – but the second man escaped. The wanted man's sponsor, who acted as his mentor in the Afghan police, was arrested last December and questioned as to the whereabouts of Corporal McCarthy's killer. It has emerged the RAF policeman's parents have received news one or more people are being detained by Afghan authorities in connection with their son's murder. Sarah and John McCarthy, who live in Telford, Shropshire, are now waiting for news of any charges and say they want justice for their son. Mrs McCarthy said: 'I believe they've caught him. I wanted to go out there and see him face-to-face. And I wanted him to face the death penalty in the beginning but I don't know now. 'Time has passed and you feel more controlled over your feelings. 'The main thing is to get justice for Brent now and to make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else. 'It's just a case of waiting for more information which is difficult.' The two rogue Afghan policemen suspected of shooting dead British soldiers. The Army unit was in the area in May 2012 acting as a police advisory team helping train the Afghan police . Corporal Brent McCarthy died alongside Lance Corporal Lee Davies, 27, (pictured) after they were shot by men in Afghan police uniform in May 2012 . Cpl McCarthy's parents found out about the murder suspect's arrest in a letter from the British Army. They have now given permission for a photograph of their son's body to be released to prosecutors in Afghanistan as evidence in the case. The letter, sent from the Army Headquarters director of personal operations bereavement support, said: 'You may be aware there are a number of detainees being held by the authorities in Afghanistan for alleged crimes against members of our armed forces. 'Unfortunately it is extremely difficult to obtain accurate and detailed information from the authorities but there is evidence to suggest that one of more were involved in the shooting that killed your son Brent. 'Under the Afghan judiciary when criminal charges are made against these detainees it's essential for a photograph of the person killed to be presented in evidence to the courts. 'In order for this case to proceed it is intended to use photographs taken by the Royal Military Police at the time of the incident which is held on their files.' Both soldiers were part of an eight-man team who had gone to the Afghan police base in the Lashkar Gah district of Helmand province on May 12. The patrol had gone there so British officers could meet local police officials with RAF policeman Cpl McCarthy acting as a specialist adviser. During evidence at their inquest, it was heard the men were in the wrong place at the wrong time. It also emerged there had been confusion on the day as to which of the men was acting as the 'guardian angel' to watch the Afghans. Recording his verdicts, coroner for Oxfordshire Darren Salter said both men had, in the words of their patrol commander a Lt Benjamin Bardsley, performed 'phenomenally' on operations.","Cpl Brent McCarthy was shot while guarding a base in Helmand Province .

"The parents of brain cancer boy Ashya King say they are scared of returning to Britain in case the authorities try to take their sick son away from them. Ashya's father Brett, 51, said he asked his MP  to speak to social services so they can give the family assurances the five-year-old boy will not be placed in care on his return to the UK, but was told to 'keep out of the way'. Mr King, who fled abroad with Ashya and his mother, Naghmeh, earlier this year to seek pioneering proton treatment denied by the NHS, says the family feel like 'refugees'. Scroll down for video . The parents of brain cancer boy Ashya King say they are scared of returning to Britain in case the authorities try to take their sick son away from them . Speaking to the Sunday People from the family's holiday home in Malaga, Spain, Mr King said: 'My local MP Mike Hancock has asked social services, ""What would happen if the King family return to England? Would you involve yourself with them?"" 'They haven’t been able to give a clear answer, so my MP said to keep out of the way for the time being. 'He said, ""If anything happens, like your child grazes his head and you take him to the hospital, maybe social services will try and take the child away"". 'It's like we're refugees. We're not happy here [in Spain], it's not our home. Our home is in England.' Earlier this month, Mr King claimed he was 'treated like a criminal' when he returned to Britain for the first time after fleeing the country with his cancer-stricken son. He said Border Force officials took his and his older son's passports at Gatwick Airport and made the pair wait in a holding area while they phoned other authorities and called in two uniformed police officers - who later decided to let the father and son go. Ashya's father Brett, 51, said he had asked his MP to speak to social services so they can give the family assurances the five-year-old boy will not be placed in care on their return to the UK . Mr and Mrs King sparked an international manhunt when they removed  Ashya from Southampton General Hospital on August 28 without medical consent. Under the belief that British doctors were not taking the best course of treatment for their son, they fled to Spain with the sickly boy in their care. Police traced the couple to Malaga and arrested Mr and Mrs King, holding them in a Spanish jail at the request of British authorities. Ashya was put in hospital under armed guard and was unable to see his parents for days. Then, in a dramatic turnaround amid a national outcry, the parents were told they would not face charges. Their son was taken for 30 rounds of experimental treatment at the Proton Therapy Centre (PTC) in Prague and is now said to be 'improving every day' with the family in Spain.","Cancer boy Ashya King's parents fear bringing their son back to Britain .

"Boston Mayor Marty Walsh has proposed to make the school day 40 minutes longer for around 23,000 public school students. Walsh announced in a press conference on Friday that around 60 elementary and middle schools could host longer days in the hopes that children will gain a more comprehensive education. Teachers in the Boston Teacher Union will be able to vote on the new plan on January 14. In addition to longer days, teachers would make an annual stipend of $4,464 to pay for their extra hours of work. Longer days: Boston Mayor Marty Walsh has proposed to make the school day 40 minutes longer for around 23,000 public school students . The Boston Globe reports that the plan would only be implemented at 20 schools in the fall and then includes 20 more schools in each of the next two years. High schools and private schools would not be affected by the plan. 'We know that when our students have more time to learn, they have a better chance of succeeding,' said Walsh. 'I thank the Boston Teachers Union and the Boston Public Schools for their partnership in helping us reach this milestone that will strengthen our education system and help us close the achievement gap so we can give all of our young people the opportunity to succeed,' he added. Walsh said that the extra 40 per day of class work is the equivalent of adding an extra month of instruction for elementary school students. More time to learn: Walsh said that the extra 40 per day of class work is the equivalent of adding an extra month of instruction for elementary school students . The head of the Boston Teacher’s union, Richard Stutman, supported the plan. 'The school day extension will help our students by offering well planned, school-based instruction that promotes teaching and learning while allowing for increased participation in a variety of under-served subject areas, such as art, music, drama and foreign language,' said Stutman. 'We are pleased to have been part of a truly collaborative effort that brought this about,' he added. CBS reports that extending the school day would cost around $12.5 million per year once all 60 schools are affected. 'With this agreement we are transforming the definition of the 'school day' in the Boston Public Schools,' said BPS Interim Superintendent John McDonough.","Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced in a press conference on Friday that around 60 elementary and middle schools could host longer days .

"A six-year-old schoolgirl spent more than five years with a hole in her heart before the life-threatening condition was discovered when her parents thought she had a cold. Sophie Smith from Gateshead was only given the diagnosis of having a an atrial septal defect after she was taken to her GP by her grandmother Janice, who thought she was suffering from a common cold. The grandmother, 55, had become concerned about Sophie when the youngster fell ill during a drama class at her school and took her to see a doctor, who discovered a murmur. Six-year-old Sophie Smith from Gateshead with her grandmother Janice, who is recovering from open heart surgery after it was discovered she had been living with a 2.5cm hole in her heart . The youngster, who lives with her sister Erin at her grandmother's home was then referred to Newcastle's Freeman Hospital, where it was found she was living with the serious heart defect, called atrial septal defect (ASD). Almost immediately, she was then whisked off for life-saving open heart surgery, which involved repairing the 2.5cm hole with mesh. Mrs Smith, an assistant medical administrator, said: 'I took Sophie to see the GP after the incident in school and he picked up a mumur. 'We were referred to the hospital but were assured it would be nothing serious but then the cardiologist said: ""You do realise Sophie has a hole in her heart?"" 'We couldn't believe it. The hole was quite a size and we had no idea until it was found by luck. Sophie underwent the operation at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle after being referred there when her GP diagnosed her with a heart murmur . 'We were told that a hole in the heart usually forms at birth, so she will have been living with it her entire life. 'The hole was found in October and a month later, she was having the surgery. 'It was a bit of a whirlwind coming round to it after I thought both my granddaughters were fit and healthy. Sophie's family first grew concerned about her health after she repeatedly suffered from colds and fell ill while at school . Now following the operation Sophie's grandmother says she was back at school within five weeks and is as 'fit as a fiddle' 'She seemed absolutely fine for the first five years of her life. 'Surgeons had to repair the hole by using a mesh material so the muscle would regrow to close the hole. 'They had to stop her heart at one point so it was worrying for me and her family.' Artial septal defect is a congential heart condition that suffers are born with although the cause is unknown. The condition usually means that there is a hole in the upper chambers of the heart, which means that the oxygen-rich and the oxygen-poor blood, instead of being kept separate, are allowed to mix and flow from the heart to the body and lungs. Children with ASD only show mild symptoms but can be prone to more chest infections and can sometimes cause breathlessness and a heart murmur. Some small defects just require close monitoroing as they can sometimes close on their own. However, larger holes require surgery to correct the defect, although after surgery, most children do not need further operations, and go on to lead normal healthy lives. A hole in the heart is a defect usually formed from birth which changes the flow of blood through the heart. ASD is a hole in the upper chambers of the heart and allows blood to pass from one side to the other, with some oxygen-rich blood moving to the lungs instead of the entire body. Throughout her whole life, Janice never saw any reason to be worried about Sophie's health, except that she suffered the odd cold more than usual. She would often attribute the frequency of the colds to Sophie's pale skin and red hair. After Sophie fell asleep in school, teachers called Mrs Smith and suggested that her granddaughter may be unwell. She spent five days in hospital recovering from her life-saving surgery and is now back to school and living a normal life. The 55-year-old added: 'Sophie would have runny noses and colds quite often but we thought it was just part of childhood, especially with her being at school around other children. 'She was back to school within five weeks and now she is fit as a fiddle. 'When I look at Sophie now I do see a difference in how much more energy she has. 'The unit at the Freeman hospital was fantastic. The staff were so supportive and it was an ideal place for Sophie to have the operation. 'Without them she would still be suffering with a defect that could have endangered her life, so I'll be eternally grateful to them.'","Sophie Smith had been suffering from a cold and had fallen ill at school .

"The First Family have now officially hit the halfway point of their Hawaiian holiday and enjoyed a nice lie-in followed by an afternoon at the beach on the eight day of their vacation. However while a regular bunch would just hit the sand and surf, the Obamas had their regular motorcade drop them at Bellows Air Force Station in Waimanalo, and Secret Service agents on wave runners circled them in the water. The main task of the agents seemed to focus on stopping any other people in kayaks getting to close to the President, his wife and their two daughters. The officers could be seen telling different groups at the popular spot to turn around, as they sectioned off part of the water. There was also a strong contingent of local police on the ground.

'We're able to gather with family and friends because our troops are willing to hug theirs goodbye and step forward to serve,' Obama said in the speech. 'After a long day, we can come home because they're willing to leave their families and deploy. 'We can celebrate the holidays because they're willing to miss their own,' Obama said.

President Barack Obama, with first lady Michelle Obama, speaks to troops and their families on Christmas Day, at a Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii during the Obama family vacation . Thirteen years and $1 trillion later, the U.S. is preparing to pull the vast majority of its combat troops out of Afghanistan by year's end, as the U.S. and its partners seek to turn the page on a bloody chapter that started the day that al-Qaida militants struck American soil on Sept. 11, 2011. From a peak 140,000 troops in 2010, the U.S. and NATO plan to leave just 13,500 behind for training and battlefield support. Although there are reasons for cautious optimism, including a new Afghan president whose seriousness of effort has inspired U.S. confidence, the broader picture still looks glim. The U.S. is shifting to a supporting role after the bloodiest year in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion. Civilian casualties this year are on track to hit 10,000, and some 5,000 Afghan forces were also killed in 2014, a figure that has escalated as the country took on a greater role in its own security. Insurgents have seized territory across the country, raising fears that Islamic militants will successfully exploit the security vacuum formed as the U.S. pulls out. Roughly 2,200 U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan over the last 13 years in a war that cost the U.S. $1 trillion, plus another $100 billion for reconstruction. A celebratory cheer of 'hooah' rang out from the hundreds of troops here when Obama affirmed that the combat mission was finally ending. The motorcade carrying President Barack Obama from the gym is seen as it passes a large tree decorated for Christmas . 'We still have some very difficult missions around the world — including in Iraq,' Obama said. But, he added, 'the world is better, it's safer, it's more peaceful, it's more prosperous and our homeland protected because of you.' On the U.S. mainland and across the globe, other prominent leaders were fanning out, echoing the president's message with their own Christmas visits and phone calls to American troops. Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to spend time with wounded troops and their families and express gratitude for their service. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called military members on deployment, the Pentagon said, including those in Afghanistan and others assigned to U.S. Central Command, which is running the U.S. mission to fight the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. Senator. John McCain, was spending Christmas in Kabul, Afghanistan, where the former Navy pilot met Thursday with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his chief executive officer, Abdullah Abdullah. A chief critic of Obama's foreign policy, McCain is set to lead the Senate Armed Services Committee next year.","On day 8 of their vacation the Obamas had a lie-in and then went to beach .

"The influx of high-tech digital speed cameras has seen the the number of motorists trapped surge to 115,000 in the last year - the highest number since 2009. Ministry of Justice figures show that a total of 115,549 motorists were fined at least £100 pounds by magistrates after being caught speeding. The increase has been put down to the £10,000 digital cameras, that no longer require film and can operate 24 hours a day, the Telegraph reported. The introduction of high-tech speed cameras has seen the number of motorists trapped surge to 115,000 Britons in the last year . South Wales has seen one of the biggest increases, with the number of people fined tripling last year to 6,491, from 2,181 three years earlier. The number of offenders has also grown in that period by almost 1,000 in both South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, and by close to 2,000 in Staffordshire. While London saw the most people fined last year, the figure for the Metropolitan Police area has fallen to 7,736 - its lowest level in five years. Those convicted of a speeding offence must pay a minimum of £100 and will have three penalty points added to their licences. The total number of motorists caught speeding is believed to be far higher, as the figures only take into account those summoned to court for failure to pay fines and where speed was particularly excessive.

Hugh Bladon, one of the founding members of the Alliance of British Drivers, said: 'Speeding accounts for less than five per cent of accidents and only takes into account one aspect of how people are driving. 'They (speed cameras) do not measure whether the driver is under the influence of drink or drugs or how roadworthy their vehicle is. What about the other aspects?' The number of motorist caught speeding has reached its highest figure in four years . AA president Edmund King said the introduction of digital cameras mean the devices are now working all day long. He told the Telegraph newspaper: 'It (the rise in speeding fines) is a reflection that cameras are more efficient than ever. 'In the past, cameras in London they would only take valid pictures for a quarter of day and it was pot luck whether you are fined. The cameras are now working 24 hours a day.' Last week the Institution of Engineering and Technology said in the future the speed at which cars can travel may be altered to fit the driver's experience, and the development of driverless cars may mean an end to speeding. 'Within 15 years, we predict that the performance of cars could be altered to fit the driver,' the institution said. 'Speeding may become a thing of the past as cars are likely to be fitted with speed-limiting devices.' This year this year a speed camera in Cardiff generated more than an estimated £800,000 worth of fines in just six months. According to road safety group GoSafe Wales, the device on the junction of the city's Newport Road and Colchester Avenue caught 13,624 speeding motorists and a further 146 running red lights between January and June. A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said: 'Speeding can have devastating consequences and it's right that drivers should abide by the speed limit. These fines were issued at the discretion of the magistrates and show the number of fines issued is in decline across many police force areas.'","Figures show that 115, 549 motorists were fined in the last year by courts .

"In light of new reports that the Syrian government used nerve gas against its own citizens, killing at least 213 and as many as 1,300, President Obama is  considering military options to respond to an action he previously warned the Assad government was crossing a 'red line'. U.S. naval forces are moving closer as the president emphasized that a quick intervention in the Syrian civil war was problematic, given the international considerations that should precede a military strike. The White House said the president would meet Saturday with his national security team to consider possible next steps by the United States. WARNING: Graphic content. Scroll down for video... Escalation: Angela Kane, the UN's high representative for disarmament, arrives in Damascus, Syria on Saturday to press President Bashar Assad to let UN investigators look into the reported chemical attack . Four battleships have been moved to within striking range of Syria as President Obama weighs his options following a reported use of chemical weapons against citizens on Wednesday . Officials say once the facts are clear, Obama will make a decision about how to proceed. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel declined to discuss any specific force movements while saying that Obama had asked the Pentagon to prepare military options for Syria. U.S. defense officials told The Associated Press that the Navy had sent a fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern Mediterranean Sea but without immediate orders for any missile launch into Syria. U.S. Navy ships are capable of a variety of military actions, including launching Tomahawk cruise missiles, as they did against Libya in 2011 as part of an international action that led to the overthrow of the Libyan government. 'The Defense Department has a responsibility to provide the president with options for contingencies, and that requires positioning our forces, positioning our assets, to be able to carry out different options - whatever options the president might choose,' Hagel told reporters traveling with him to Asia. Hagel said the U.S. is coordinating with the international community to determine 'what exactly did happen' near Damascus earlier this week. Calling Assad a 'thug' and a 'murderer,' John Kerry declared, 'History would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator's use of chemical weapons.' 'Evidence': Secretary of State John Kerry said images like these contributed to the U.S. assessment that chemical weapons were used in Syria . According to reports, a chemical attack in a suburb of the capital killed at least 100 people. It would be the most heinous use of chemical weapons since Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein gassed thousands of Kurds in the town of Halabja in 1988. Hagel left little doubt that he thinks the attack in Syria involved chemical weapons, although he stressed there is not yet a final answer. In discussing the matter, he said, 'it appears to be what happened - use of chemical weapons.' The United Nations disarmament chief, Angela Kane, arrived in Damascus on Saturday to press the Syrian government to allow U.N. experts to investigate the alleged chemical attacks. Obama remained cautious about getting involved in a war that has killed more than 100,000 people and now includes Hezbollah and al-Qaida. He made no mention of the 'red line' of chemical weapons use that he marked out for Syrian President Bashar Assad a year ago and that U.S. intelligence says has been breached at least on a small scale several times since. 'If the U.S. goes in and attacks another country without a U.N. mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented, then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it - do we have the coalition to make it work?' Obama said Friday. 'Those are considerations that we have to take into account.' Obama conceded in an interview on CNN's 'New Day' program that the episode is a 'big event of grave concern' that requires American attention. President Obama appeared on CNN's 'New Day' on Friday to discuss the alleged attack, saying it was a 'big event of grave concern' that requires American attention . He said any large-scale chemical weapons usage would affect 'core national interests' of the United States and its allies. But nothing he said signaled a shift toward U.S. action. U.S. defense officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss ship movements publicly. But if the U.S. wants to send a message to Assad, the most likely military action would be a Tomahawk missile strike, launched from a ship in the Mediterranean. For a year now, Obama has threatened to punish Assad's regime if it resorted to its chemical weapons arsenal, among the world's vastest, saying use or even deployment of such weapons of mass destruction constituted a 'red line' for him. A U.S. intelligence assessment concluded in June chemical weapons have been used in Syria's civil war, but Washington has taken no military action against Assad's forces. U.S. officials have instead focused on trying to organize a peace conference between the government and opposition. Obama has authorized weapons deliveries to rebel groups, but none are believed to have been sent so far. In his first comments on Syria since the alleged chemical attack, Obama said the U.S. is still trying to find out what happened. Hagel said Friday that a determination on the chemical attack should be made swiftly because 'there may be another attack coming,' although he added that 'we don't know' whether that will happen. After rebels similarly reported chemical attacks in February, U.S. confirmation took more than four months. In this instance, a U.N. chemical weapons team is already on the ground in Syria. Assad's government, then as now, has rejected the claims as baseless. Obama also cited the need for the U.S. to be part of a coalition in dealing with Syria. America's ability by itself to solve the Arab country's sectarian fighting is 'overstated,' he said.","Activists report that a nerve gas attack near Damascus Wednesday killed as many as 1,300 .

"Prince Charles, who is said to be ready to take over the management of the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk . He is already taking part in a ‘gentle succession’ from his mother, representing the Queen on a growing number of state occasions. Now Prince Charles is stepping into his father’s shoes, too. The Mail on Sunday has learned that the Duke of Edinburgh is privately handing management of Sandringham to his eldest son. The job includes overseeing arable, livestock and fruit farms, property and a 240-acre country park. The 93-year-old Duke is responsible for several estates, including Balmoral, Windsor and Sandringham in Norfolk, where the Royal Family has just enjoyed Christmas. But local sources say Prince Philip started to pass control of Sandringham’s 20,000 acres to Charles this year. The Duke will continue to be consulted over changes, but Charles will have a more hands-on role. ‘We understand Prince Philip has handed the management over to his son,’ said a source. ‘Charles is now taking a very close interest in the estate and its running. He has excellent ideas and we are expecting to see different things happening.’ Estate workers say they expect to see more of the Prince in the coming months as he implements changes, such as more organic farming. Sandringham has been a private home for British monarchs since 1862. As well as the Queen’s country retreat it is a successful commercial estate. Hundreds of fields are leased to commercial farmers. The change has not yet been officially announced and Buckingham Palace last night said it could not comment on what might happen as it is ‘the Queen’s private estate’. But sources close to the Prince of Wales say handing management to Charles would be ‘a natural decision’. Although he is in excellent health, the change will be viewed as further evidence the Duke is scaling back his duties. Philip has cut down overseas travel in recent years but carries out hundreds of engagements for the Queen each year. The Duke began managing Sandringham when he married the Queen. The Sandringham estate, where the Queen and the rest of the royal family spend Christmas, which is famous for producing apples and apple juice . The huge estate includes tidal mudflats, woodland and wetland, and produces everything from wheat to Christmas trees. But it is most famous for its apples and apple juice. The Duke spends most of his time at Windsor or Sandringham. Like his son, he is known for forward thinking, and turned the estates into successful enterprises. At Windsor, he set up a farm shop to generate income. Charles turned his own estate, Highgrove and the Duchy Home Farm, into a model of sustainable farming. He visits Sandringham at Christmas and usually stays there at least once a year. The Duke of Edinburgh, right, is responsible for several estates including Balmoral and Windsor. He is pictured with Timothy Laurence and Princess Anne walking to church in Sandringham on Christmas Day . The change has not yet been officially announced and Buckingham Palace last night said it could not comment on what might happen as it is ‘the Queen’s private estate’ ‘Charles is likely to turn the whole estate organic,’ said the source. ‘He’ll do things like introduce rewards for environmentally friendly farming. Philip’s a passionate conservationist but has very set ways on how the estate should be run. He doesn’t like outsiders interfering.’ Though Sandringham is ‘green’ (5,000 trees are planted each year and all food waste, glass, plastics and paper are recycled) it does not have some of the more modern green techniques Charles uses at Highgrove –such as irrigating the land with rainwater and using bio-dynamic farming methods.","Prince Charles is set to take control of the management of Sandringham .

"Most fairytales are overrun with wicked witches, entrapped princesses and dashing young princes. But a new collection  offers a different take on the classics - without the Happily Ever After. The stories were compiled by German historian Franz Xaver von Schönwerth in the 1880s - around the same time as the Brothers Grimm folk tales - from across the Bavarian region of Oberpfalz. Twist in the tale: The stories, published in The Turnip Prince (left) were compiled by Franz Xaver von Schönwerth around the same time as the Brothers Grimm. Right: A Little Red Riding Hood illustration . And now the collection, which lay undiscovered in a local archive for 150 years, is set to be published in English for the first time, the Guardian reports. While the well-known Grimm fairytales often feature a vulnerable princess and dragon-slaying hero, Schönwerth reverses their roles - offering readers powerful female and vulnerable male characters. In Schönwerth's fantastical version Cinderella, for example, the heroine uses her golden - not glass - slippers to rescue her lover from beyond the moon. But his work, which also includes untold tales such as The Stupid Wife and The Girl And The Cow, failed to attract the same attention as that of the Brothers Grimm and faded into obscurity. Many of the tales were told to him by peasants, labourers and servants, after being passed down through generations by word-of-mouth. He completed a book on his findings called Aus der Oberpfalz – Sitten und Sagen, which came out in three volumes. They included the fairy tales and historical background on them. Girl power: While Grimm fairytales often feature a vulnerable princess and dragon-slaying hero, Schönwerth reverses their roles. Above, the Grimm fairytale Town Musicians of Bremen, shown in a 1829 sketch . In 1885, Jacob Grimm said this about him: 'Nowhere in the whole of Germany is anyone collecting [folklore] so accurately, thoroughly and with such a sensitive ear.' But Schönwerth's volumes never gained prominence and were mostly forgotten. It was only when Erika Eichenseer, 80, was sifting through Schönwerth's work in an archive in Regensburg that his work re-emerged into the public domain. Ms Eichenseer, a retired teacher who now works as a cultural curator, moved to have the tales translated English and they will be published in a new Penguin edition called The Turnip Princess. One story tells of a maiden who escapes a witch by transforming herself into a pond. The witch then lies on her stomach and drinks all the water, swallowing the young girl. But once she has drunk the pond, the girl uses a knife to cut her way out of the witch. In another, a woman gives her belongings to the poor but regains her wealth after she scares off a group of thieves. There are also more well-known but local examples of tales such as Cinderella and Rumpelstiltskin. Ms Eichenseer says the fairytales were invented for people of all ages. Speaking about the books in 2012, she said: 'Their main purpose was to help young adults on their path to adulthood, showing them that dangers and challenges can be overcome through virtue, prudence and courage.'","Well-known fairytales feature vulnerable women and dragon-slaying men .

"The Pakistani government has hit out at U.S. television series Homeland over its portrayal of the country as a safe haven for Islamic terrorists. Diplomats condemned producers for depicting Islamabad, the setting of the show's fourth series, as a 'hellhole' refuge for the Taliban. Complaining to Showtime which airs the Emmy-winning show, one official described it as a 'disservice to the people of the US'. Scroll down for video . Pakistani officials complained the show, starring Claire Danes (pictured above), depicted Islamabad as a hot-bed for terrorist activity . The fourth series of the popular show sees star Claire Danes acting as a member of the Central Intelligence Agency in Islamabad. Filmed in fact in Cape Town, the first episode sees a violent mob of local people beating another agent to death over a drone strike which killed a sought-after terrorist hiding in a rural farmhouse. 'Maligning a country that has been a close partner and ally of the US... is a disservice not only to the security interests of the US but also to the people of the US,' Pakistan Embassy spokesman Nadeem Hotiana told the New York Post. 'Islamabad is a quiet, picturesque city with beautiful mountains and lush greenery. The Pakistani directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence has been widely accused of hosting and assisting terrorist activity in the past. Based in Islamabad, doubt was cast over the ISI in 2011 upon the news of Osama Bin Laden's execution by U.S. forces. How, it was asked, could the government not have known the world's most wanted terrorist was taking refuge in a rural compound some 30 miles from its headquarters? Following his assassination, Adm Mike Mullen, then the most senior U.S. military officer, said Pakistan had a 'long-standing relationship' with Afghan insurgents. It has been claimed the directorate differentiates between terrorists committed to corrupting Pakistan and those whose interest lie abroad, with Afghan officials describing the country's handling of terrorism as 'double gamed'. In September a new chief was appointed to lead the ISI, Rizwan Akhtar. 'In Homeland it’s portrayed as a grimy hellhole and war zone where shootouts and bombs go off with dead bodies scattered around. Nothing is further from the truth,' another added. 'Repeated insinuations that an intelligence agency of Pakistan is complicit in protecting the terrorists... is not only absurd but also an insult to the ultimate sacrifices of the thousands of Pakistani security personnel in the war against terrorism.' This week the Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif spoke of the country's need to persecute terrorists following an attack on a school in Peshawar which saw Taliban fundamentalists massacre 132 children. Describing the incident as a 'national tragedy', he lifted a moratorium on the death penalty as a result of the attack. In previous years however the government has been widely accused of colluding with terrorists in recent years, with repeated claims officials helped 9/11 orchestrator Osama Bin Laden evade capture. Among those convinced the country had a hand in protecting the terrorist is Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Carlotta Gall who spent more than a decade reporting in Pakistan. 'Pakistan did know. They were hiding him, they were handling him. Someone on the inside told me this,' she told ABC news this year. Upon news of the terrorist's death in 2011, a Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman confirmed the killing but, unlike foreign counterparts, offered no congratulation to U.S forces. The fourth series follows Carrie Matheson as she fights terrorism on behalf of the CIA in Islamabad .

Critics suggested the Pakistani government knew the terrorist was hiding in the region that is 30 miles from Islamabad . 'In an intelligence driven operation, Osama bin Laden was killed in the surroundings of Abbotabad in the early hours of this morning. 'This operation was conducted by the U.S. forces in accordance with declared U.S. policy that Osama bin Laden will be eliminated in a direct action by the U.S. forces, wherever found in the world,' a statement said. In 2012, a leaked NATO report revealed concerns officials had been assisting the Taliban from the heart of Islamabad. Among testimonies given by al-Qaeda and Taliban detainees in thousands of interviews, one senior fanatic condemned: 'Pakistan knows everything. They control everything. 'The Taliban are not Islam. The Taliban are Islamabad.' Speaking of the report at the time, then Pentagon spokesman Captain John Kirby said: 'We have long been concerned about ties between elements of the ISI [Pakistan's intelligence service] and some extremist networks.' Pakistani government officials dismissed detainees' claims as 'ridiculous' at the time.","Pakistani diplomats condemned the Emmy-winning show's fourth series .

"A new high-security  fence erected in Calais to stop migrants crossing the Channel to Britain has been blown over in 100mph winds. Sections of the 12ft steel barrier, which was only installed at the French port last month, were flattened  on Friday night as storms wreaked havoc on both side of the English Channel. The incident could have led to chaos in the French port, amid fears migrants would take the opportunity to invade the terminal. But the high winds also prompted ferry services to be cancelled. A new high-security fence erected in Calais to stop migrants crossing the Channel to Britain has been blown over in 100mph winds . Sections of the 12ft steel barrier, which was only installed at the French port last month, were flattened on Friday night as storms wreaked havoc on both side of the English Channel . The fence, which is topped with razor wire to deter refugees, was funded through a £12m grant from Britain to help French authorities tighten security at the terminal. A Calais police spokesman said: 'The fence had only been up for a matter of weeks. 'It provided a second layer of security for the ferry port after repeated attempts to break into the terminal by migrants during the summer. 'Work has already begun to repair the damaged sections of the fence, and full security should be restored in several days.' Tensions have been mounting in Calais in recent months as hundreds more refugees fleeing war zones in the Middle East and poverty in Africa flood across Europe. At least 15 migrants died during 2014 as they tried to get to Britain from France, either by drowning in the sea, or being knocked over by lorries. Before the fence was erected, 250 illegal immigrants stormed the ferry terminal in a bid to board ferries and lorries bound for the UK. The fence, which is topped with razor wire to deter refugees, was funded through a £12m grant from Britain to help French authorities tighten security at the terminal . After the incident in October, Home Secretary Theresa May promised to give France £12m to tighten security. The UK also offered Calais an 11-mile long high security fence used at a NATO summit in Wales to keep the migrants out of the terminal. Meanwhile, authorities have been busy setting up a 'cold weather emergency centre' for migrants in the town. The heated hostel - which is to be used when temperatures fall below -5C - was opened today as the mercury plummeted to below freezing. A spokesman said: 'We had around five hundred people in over Friday night, and numbers should increase up to around fifteen hundreds over coming days. 'At the moment the centre is a provisional one, but it will become more permanent as the winter progresses.'

Complete with hot showers and mattresses, it is easy walking distance of the main ferry port. The British government had argued that providing beds and showers for migrants will only encourage many more to come to Calais hoping to stow away aboard lorries and ferries to Dover. It is the first large-scale facility since the controversial Sangatte Red Cross hostel was bulldozed in 2002. Sangatte was used as a stepping stone to Britain by an estimated 18,000 refugees over six years. Calais prefect Denis Robin said the new centre would only be open on certain nights, with migrants being forced out by 9am each morning. He said: 'The cold weather plan will provide shelter for all those people left outside when temperatures fall. 'We need a space that can house around 1,500 people, that they can reach on foot, but one that is not in the town centre, because encouraging migrants to remain in the town centre is a sensitive issue in Calais.' A separate day centre offering hot food and showers to only the most vulnerable women, children and elderly migrants is also set to be opened in January. Mr Robin insisted the shelters were 'humanitarian gestures', adding: 'Neither of these centres are in any way new Sangatte-type hostels in Calais.' Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart blames the UK's generous state benefits for their influx of migrants, saying Britain was viewed as 'an Eldorado'.","Sections of the 12ft steel barrier were flattened by 100mph winds on Friday .

"Delivery companies Royal Mail and DX Group were approached before Christmas in a bid to rescue parcel delivery firm City Link, after it went into administration this week. Preliminary talks were reportedly held in recent weeks between the firms and KPMG, which was helping the company's owner attempt to find a potential buyer. It comes as it was revealed last night that 3,700 jobs are at risk - 1,000 more than originally thought, after workers found out the firm had gone into administration via news reports on Christmas Day. Parcel firms including Royal Mail and DX Group were reportedly approached before Christmas in rescue bid . It is understood that Royal Mail is interested in taking on some of the company's large customer contracts, including deliveries for high street retailers, according to Sky News. The broadcaster also reports that DX held talks about a more comprehensive deal involving City Link's assets and could now acquire parts of the company out of administration. Other specialist restructuring firms were allegedly approached but a deal could not be reached in time before directors appointed EY as administrator at the end of trading on Wednesday. It emerged yesterday that the livelihoods of 1,000 contractors not directly employed by City Link, but who work for the firm as self-employed drivers or agency support staff, are also under threat. They will be treated as ‘unsecured creditors’ by administrators and are unlikely to receive any further salaries owed until all creditor claims have been assessed. One creditor claimed that he was owed almost £300,000, but administrators said he would be ‘lucky’ to get a penny for every pound owed. City Link went into administration on Christmas Eve and customers waiting for deliveries must now collect orders from depots next week . City Link went into administration on Christmas Eve and customers waiting for deliveries must now collect orders from depots next week. Its online parcel tracking system remains available, and a phone helpline will be open today and on Monday. Customers have been asked to pick up their parcels as soon as possible after depots re-open on Monday. The firm had been delivering 60million parcels a year for several high street chains, including John Lewis, which has transferred all its business to other carriers following its collapse. Unions demanded an urgent meeting with Business Secretary Vince Cable and said it was an ‘absolute disgrace’ staff had learned their jobs were in jeopardy on Christmas Day. Business Secretary Vince Cable said it was an 'absolute disgrace' staff learned their jobs were in jeopardy on Christmas Day . Worker Mark Critchley discovered via his union, not from his managers, he faced redundancy. Staff who had discussed rumours the firm was in trouble were threatened with disciplinary action by managers, he said. Outside the firm’s main base in Coventry, he told Sky News: ‘We would like them to come down here and man up and tell us what’s going on and why they have done it… They’re all very cowardly men who will not face the music.’ Mr Cable said the firm’s collapse was a bitter blow to the workforce, adding he would happily meet the union in the New Year.’ RMT general secretary Mick Cash said employees ‘worked their socks off’ for Christmas, only to learn a day later that their jobs were in danger. He questioned whether the firm had fallen prey to ‘classic asset stripping’ after it was sold to venture capitalists Better Capital, owned by Tory donor Jon Moulton, for just £1 last year by Rentokil. Administrators EY were appointed after close of business on Christmas Eve. Responding to the RMT’s claim of ‘asset stripping’, an EY spokesman said Better Capital invested £40million in City Link and had not received any return on its investment. The private equity group is one of the firm’s ‘secured creditors’, meaning it will get a priority ranking in any distribution from the realisation of City Link’s asset, EY said. In a leaked internal email from City Link’s chief executive Dave Smith, he told staff: ‘With the business still incurring losses the company was faced with the situation of imminently running out of cash.’ The firm had made a loss since 2007, and Rentokil had written off millions when it owned the company. Better Capital said it could not comment further while the stock market remains closed. A spokesperson from DX told MailOnline that the company would not be releasing a comment at this stage, while Royal Mail was unavailable.","Talks were reportedly held in recent weeks between rival delivery firms .

"Survivor: Kevin McGrath, 70, was staying in a Sri Lankan guest house when the tsunami wave swept in. Above, he returns to the beach to remember . As Kevin McGrath walked along the baking sandy beach in the popular southern Sri Lankan resort of Unawatuna his thoughts focused on a decade earlier and the day he feared he would die, swept away near the same spot by the power of the tsunami wave. ‘It was going to be the perfect day,’ the 70 year-old psycho therapist recalled, ‘ the weather had been unusually good and it was a holiday for local people so we were expecting it to be just perfect.’ Mr McGrath and his wife Diana were staying in a room on the first floor of a guest house, set among palm trees and protected by a small hotel 50-metres from the beach at Unawatuna, a resort popular with Western tourists close to the southern city of Galle. ‘It was 9.20am and I was still in my room when I heard a noise just as I was getting up,’ he said, ‘I thought it was a bus but it was too loud...maybe a helicopter. ‘I went out on to the balcony and my wife was there. We could see a dark line in the water and this loud, thunderous noise. It was extraordinary. We stood and watched as the water came in relentlessly, powerfully.’ People who were on the beach were screaming and running for their lives, others were desperately trying the cling on to palm trees or make it to the highest point in surrounding buildings. ‘The water came over the sand, picking up fishing boats and sun loungers, washing them across the road and sending them crashing into buildings and cars. The power was so great that one of the boats side-swiped a bungalow demolishing it. ‘I knew it was a tsunami and I thought “God, this must be a big one”. I was calculating mentally as the water was rising and we went to the back of the house to see if it was possible to go higher. ‘I remember thinking it was ironic that I was going to die here on holiday…if the water kept rising, I would die. It was a seven or eight metre wall and it just swept on. ‘We could hear buildings collapsing, objects crashing in to one another, the cries of desperate people and animals. ‘Our building was made of reinforced concrete but walls around us were punched out by the water. ‘I began to take photographs, I thought that if I died there I wanted people to know how and why I died. It had reached the first floor and our room but then suddenly stopped rising. ‘The power of the water was just incredible. People were in quite a lot of distress – as the water was going down they were being towed out to sea together with all kind of debris. ‘A British couple sleeping on the ground floor after partying the night before were blown out of bed by the water and ended up stark naked hanging on to palm trees. Devastation: Schoolchildren walk among what is left of the school buildings that once stood in the southern Sri Lankan town of Unawatuna. Mr McGrath was staying in the popular resort when the tsunami swept in . ‘People were being pulled screaming out of the water, they were clinging for dear life to anything they could lay their hands on that was fixed to the ground. ‘We saw a young girl being swept away and shouted for her to hang on the gate post. She survived. ‘We stayed on the balcony for another house. There was a German woman going in to deep shock. Her partner had gone for a walk and was missing. He turned up eventually covered in mud, cuts and debris.’ Mr McGrath, from Ironbridge, Shropshire, continued: ‘We went down stairs and it was almost unrecognisable. The road was full of water that was knee-height. ‘We picked our way through glass, dead dogs, filth. It looked like Sarajevo after taking major mortar fire. There was so much devastation. The bay was full of rubbish, the coral had been trashed and was floating about, a fridge-freezer was floating by.’ They made their way to the Rock House, one of the buildings that had survived with little damage and joined 200 others. ‘There was a lot of panic, a lot of anxiety,’ Mr McGrath said. ‘There was a bit of aftershock and one much smaller wave. ‘On a beach nearby a French couple had lost their baby…almost everyone in the village had lost someone.’ Days later, the Britons were evacuated by the UK Embassy but within three months Mr McGrath had returned to help local schools and village vendors. Recovery: Along Unawatuna beach, pictured above, there are still some reminders of the day when the tsunami struck. Mr McGrath returned this year to take part in a memorial service held there on Boxing Day . He was back again for the first anniversary where tens of thousands of traditional clay oil lamps were lit on the beach in memory of those who died – a memorial repeated this Boxing Day. Along Unawatuna there are still some reminders of that dreadful day a decade ago from the waterlines marked on walls and three 25ft above sea level to the clock on a popular beachfront hotel and bar wall which stopped at 9.27am when it was washed from the wall. The clock has been hung again but the time remains untouched. In the room where Mr McGrath feared he would die as he watched the water rise and rise, there is a mark he made on the wall of his first floor room when it was at its highest. Each year he returns to the same room and remembers.","Kevin McGrath from Shropshire was in Sri Lanka on Boxing Day in 2004 .

"Former Channel Seven weatherman Grant Denyer has told of the moment he realised he knew the man behind the Sydney siege - Man Haron Monis.

Former Channel Seven weatherman Grant Denyer has told of the moment he realised he knew the man behind the Sydney siege - Man Haron Monis . As he watched the siege unfold, right across from his old workplace, the Family Feud host said he and his wife Chezzie were often hassled by Monis (right) when they used to live in Chinatown - Sydney's CBD . 'I used to see him on my street corner all the time - ranting,' Denyer told the Herald Sun. 'I always put myself between him and my wife... there was a really bad vibe around him. 'When I saw his face on the television it all came flooding back.' Monis spent six years lobbying the Australian media watchdog over what he perceived were breaches of broadcasting regulations involving Sunrise news segments. The hostage-taker died along with two of the 17 hostages he took in the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place just metres from Channel Seven's Sunrise studio last week. The attack took place so near Seven's offices it prompted speculation the Sunrise studio was his target from the very beginning, but that his initial plans went awry. Fairfax revealed that the 50-year-old first complained in mid-2007 to the ACMA about a Sunrise program broadcast on July 4 of that year. It's been nearly two weeks since the Lindt cafe siege in Martin Place, which resulted in the death of Monis and two other hostages  Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson.

"An assassin who tried to killer Pope John Paul II has laid white roses on his tomb and said he wants to meet Pope Francis. Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turk, stood for a few moments over John Paul's tomb in silent meditation before leaving two bunches of white roses. It comes 31 years to the day that the Pope visited the assassin in prison and forgave him for the attempt on his life. Agca left John Paul critically injured when he fired several shots at close range in St Peter's Square on May 13, 1981. The 56-year-old spent 19 years in prison for the failed assassination attempt. His motive remains a mystery. Scroll down for video . Turkish assassin Mehmet Ali Agca, 56, put roses on the tomb of Pope John Paul II, who he tried to kill in 1981 . Agca, 56, spent 19 years in prison for the failed assassination attempt, which he carried out when he was 23 . The assassin left John Paul critically injured when he fired several shots at close range in St Peter's Square . Today, the Vatican gave a cool response to his request to meet with Pope Francis. On May 13 1981 John Paul II was on his way to his regular weekly public audience - being driven in his white - and then unarmoured popemobile, through a crowd of 20,000 worshippers. The Polish pontiff had been elected  less than three years earlier. At 5.17pm, shots rang out and John Paul II slumped back in his seat after being struck by four bullets - two of which hit him in the stomach. After a second of silence, people in the square began to scream: 'Hanno sparato il Papa! Hanno sparato il Papa!' (They've shot the Pope). A minute or so later, police grabbed a man running from the scene - Mehmet Ali Agca. Following a five-hour operation, John Paul II went on to make a full recovery. It is the second time Vatican officials have denied Agca's request for a face-to-face meeting with His Holiness. 'He has put flowers on the tomb of John Paul II. I think that is enough,' Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi told La Repubblica newspaper. Agca, once a member of a Turkish far right group known as the Grey Wolves, carried out the attack on John Paul after escaping from a Turkish prison where he was serving a life sentence for killing journalist Abdi Ipekci in 1979. During the assassination attempt, John Paul was left seriously injured, with one bullet passing through his abdomen and another narrowly missing his heart. During his 19 years imprisoned in Italy, Ali Agca converted to Christianity, and the Pope helped to pressure Italian authorities for his eventual release and deportation to Turkey in 2000. He then served an additional ten years in prison for the murder of Ipekci and other crimes. He was released from jail in 2010. After a second of silence, people  began to scream: 'Hanno sparato il Papa!' ('They've shot the Pope!') It comes 31 years to the day the Pope visited the assassin in prison and forgave him for the attempt on his life . Following a five-hour operation, John Paul II went on to make a full recovery and forgave his would-be murderer . Agca was released from prison in Turkey in 2000 after serving the best part of three decades behind bars . When police seized Agca, they found a letter in his pocket which read: 'I have killed the Pope so that the world may know of the thousands of victims of imperialism.' A number of theories have been put forward about who was behind the assassination attempt. An official inquiry blamed Soviet-sponsored assassins - who wanted the Pope dead because of his support for the democracy movement Solidarity. But in 2011 Polish communist leader General Wojciech Jaruzelski, who died this year aged 90, claimed Islamic fanatics sponsored the would-be assassination. 'Radical Islam detested the pope and saw in him a leader of crusades,' he told Poland's 'Jezus' Catholic magazine.

"The North Korean government called President Obama 'a monkey living in a tropical forest' in a racist tirade against the United States, which the dictatorship blames for knocking out its internet. Officials on the National Defense Commission, led by Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, lashed out at America, calling its leader 'reckless' and saying the U.S. is shameless. Washington has denied it has anything to do with the disturbance, which has seen the internet repeatedly black out in the country. Does it work yet? Kim Jong Un, pictured surrounded by military commanders, lashed out at Barack Obama, calling him a 'monkey' in a racist tirade following several internet outages . 'Reckless': President Obama, pictured above with Michelle Obama on his Hawaiian vacation, was the target of the latest North Korean tirade . It comes after North Korean officials claimed the U.S. government also masterminded the production and release of The Interview - a Sony Pictures comedy which was almost cancelled after a massive cyberattack. Instead, after encouragement from Obama, the film opened on Christmas day in cinemas and online, making more than $1million in its first day and shooting to the top of online rental charts. The movie, directed by Seth Rogen, shows the assassination of Kim Jong Un. The satirical film depicts Kim as a childish, camp maniac who cries over Katy Perry songs and soils himself live on air. The Defense Committee has called The Interview illegal, dishonest and insulting. It statement Friday said: 'Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest.' All-American opening: The Interview, a controversial satire which was almost derailed by hackers, opened on Christmas Day online and in some theaters in a move which the President praised . Moneymaker: The filmed grossed $1million on its first day. It depicts Kim Jong Un as an effeminate and unstable leader who cried over Katy Perry songs . It went on to attack the United States as a whole, saying: 'the U.S., a big country, started disturbing the Internet operation of major media of the DPRK, not knowing shame like children playing a tag.' It threatened to retaliate for the internet outages, though it did not specify what it would do. White House officials did not respond. The Interview was for a time cancelled completely after a hacking cell - which gained access to Sony's network and started leaking embarrassing secrets - threatened to stage real-life terrorist attacks against any theaters which screened the film. Many major distributors pulled out as a result, but independent theaters filled the gap, while Sony arranged for a simultaneous online release. Offensive? The film, which depicts Kim dying in a fireball after his helicopter is shot down, has sparked fury in Pyongyang . Obama, who had lamented the short-lived cancellation, congratulated Sony when it decided to go ahead with the film after all. FBI specialists have pinned the devastating hack attack on the North Korean regime - though all its officials deny involvement and some independent experts have queried the attribution. Korea and the U.S. remain technically in a state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. The rivals also are locked in an international standoff over the North's nuclear and missile programs and its alleged human rights abuses.

"A grieving family were forced to pay nearly £1,000 for a great-grandmother to be buried next to her husband - because she moved less than a MILE down the road. Janet Smith had bought the plot next to Terence - who was known as Terry - at Redhill Cemetery in Gedling, Nottingham, after he died from lung cancer in September 2001 aged 67. The mother-of-two's family were left stunned after she passed away, aged 72, and funeral directors told them it would cost £1,500 for her to be buried next to her husband as planned. The grieving family of Janet Smith, pictured with her husband Terrence, were forced to pay nearly £1,000 for the great-grandmother to be buried next to her husband because she had moved less than a mile down the road . When Mr Smith died the couple - who had been married for 34 years - were living in Daybrook, which was within the Gedling Borough Council boundary. However, Mrs Smith was unable to bear living in the house she had shared with her husband for eight years, so moved less than a mile away to Bestwood Park, Nottingham, in 2006. Penpushers at Gedling Borough Council have said her burial fee would be £1,416 because the pensioner had become a Nottingham City Council resident. The family  found out if she had stayed 0.9 miles away in the Gedling borough, the cost would have been just £520. Mrs Smith's granddaughter Ammie Hemingway, 30, who lives in Arnold, Nottingham, accused the council of 'grave robbing'. 'The funeral directors told us the graveyard in Gedling Borough Council was nearly £1,500 because she didn't live there anymore. 'When she bought the grave she bought a triple plot so she could be buried next to her husband. 'We were absolutely gob-smacked when we found out. It feels like 21st-century grave robbing. The map shows the distance Janet Smith moved after buying the burial plot at Redhill Cemetery . 'My nan had lived in Gedling borough for eight years before she moved, but apparently that isn't long enough. 'The council are saying because she hasn't paid council taxes there for eight years we have to pay that much more. 'We just couldn't understand why a job that is being done by the same people and using the same equipment has an £896 price difference depending on where in Nottingham you live. 'My nan moved because she didn't want to live in that house on her own and she wanted a fresh start but she didn't want to move out of the area. 'She only moved just down the road and she walked to the cemetery every day to visit my grandad's grave and look after it.' Mrs Smith passed away on December 12 after a short battle with secondary liver cancer. Her daughter Karen McEvoy, 47, who lives in Bestwood Park, added: 'When they told us how much it was going to cost we just sat there dumb-founded. 'It was a hard enough time anyway, having just lost my mum, so to be told that we'd have to fork out all that money was a kick in the teeth. Mrs Smith bought the plot at Redhill Cemetery in Gedling, Nottingham, in 2001 after the death of her husband . The council said 'we 'We offer a discounted price for residents who wish to be buried in one of the borough's cemeteries' 'She moved less than a mile away, but the fact she'd moved to a different council area wasn't something she'd ever thought about. 'We've paid the extra money as that's where she wanted to be buried, but it felt like we had no choice.' The grandmother-of-four, who also had seven great-grandchildren, had left some money to pay for her funeral but it wasn't enough to cover the extra cost of digging the grave. The family have now had to cut back for the service, which is taking place on December 30, to ensure the widow can be buried next to her husband  who worked as a gas man. A spokesman for Gedling Borough Council said: 'We offer a discounted price for residents who wish to be buried in one of the borough's cemeteries. 'While we understand the family's frustration, the eight years when the person lived in the borough was not long enough to have a long-term connection to the area.'","Great-grandmother Janet Smith bought the plot in Redhill Cemetery in 2001 .

"Snow has finally arrived in the Alps after skiing resorts endured one of the worst starts to their season in recent memory. Vehicles were pictured in a massive jam near some of the best known resorts in France as winter sports enthusiasts made a dash for the mountains amid blizzard conditions. It comes just days after weather experts predicted the snow-starved region was in line for up to 30 inches of snow and as icy conditions caused havoc in Britain. Scroll down for video . Finally: The snow has arrived in the French Alps after parts of the region endured one of the worst starts to the winter sports season in recent memory . Some of France's top skiing destinations had been void of snow while openings were delayed in a number of resorts with the slopes bare. It came after a spell of unseasonably warm weather that has persisted throughout December - until now. Images emerged yesterday of thousands of cars lining snow-covered roads near Albertville on the way to the Tarentaise valley in the heart of the French Alps. It comes after a huge weather system moved in over the area bringing a massive downfall. The sight of falling snow is certain to have brought a sigh of relief to frustrated resort operators and others whose livelihoods depend on traditional winter weather, and will no doubt have delighted British skiers who were planning a winter getaway. Families have shown up over the Christmas break to find slopes bare in some resorts. Gridlock: Cars were caught out in blizzard conditions as the snow came down at Albertville - close to some of the best known resorts in France . The sight of falling snow is certain to have brought a sigh of relief to frustrated resort operators . The situation was such that bosses at the resort of Les Gets, in the Northern Alps, turned on snow cannons to fill slopes with man-made snow. Yesterday's snow storm is expected to be followed by colder temperatures, meaning the snow will stick around handing a major boost to the ski tourism industry. In a ski report issued amid a mild Christmas, Meteo France said snow is non-existent or very low on all ranges up to 5,000ft and there is only a small amount of snow on ranges from 5,900ft to 6,500ft. But the national weather service said such a lack of snow is not that unusual as it occurs roughly every five years. High in the French Alps, particularly in the Savoie and Haute-Savoie regions, the latest values have made this season one of the ‘least snowy’ winters in 35 years following the warmest year on record in France.","Some Alpine resorts were enduring one of the worst starts to their season in recent memory .

"A high school basketball tournament on the Northern California coast has become the latest flashpoint in the ongoing protests over police killings of unarmed black men after a school was disinvited because of concerns its players would wear T-shirts printed with the words 'I Can't Breathe' during warmups. The athletic director for Mendocino High School was informed by his counterpart at Fort Bragg High School this week that neither the boys nor girls teams would be allowed to participate in the three-day tournament hosted by Fort Bragg High starting Monday, Mendocino Unified School District Superintendent Jason Morse said. Scroll down for video . A school was disinvited to a basketball tournament because of concerns its players would wear T-shirts printed with the words 'I Can't Breathe' during warmups. Cleveland Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving warms up before the game in his customized t-shirt . The athletic director for Mendocino High School (pictured) was informed by his counterpart at Fort Bragg High School this week that neither the boys nor girls teams would be allowed to participate in the t tournament hosted by Fort Bragg High . The boys were reinstated after all but one player agreed not to wear the shirts inspired by the last words of Eric Garner, the New York man who died after an officer put him in a chokehold, while  on the Fort Bragg campus during the Vern Piver Holiday Classic tournament, Morse said. Too few girl players accepted the condition for the team to field a tournament squad, he said. Brian Triplett, the athletic director at Fort Bragg High, did not return a call and email seeking comment. Principal Rebecca Walker issued a written statement Friday saying school administrators respected the Mendocino teams 'for paying attention to what is going on in the world around them' and that the T-shirts were being prohibited as a security precaution. 'To protect the safety and well-being of all tournament participants it is necessary to ensure that all political statements and or protests are kept away from this tournament,' wrote Walker, who said she was speaking on behalf of the athletic director and the Fort Bragg school superintendent. 'We are a small school district that simply does not have the resources to ensure the safety and well-being of our staff, students and guests at the tournament should someone get upset and choose to act out.' The boys were reinstated after all but one player agreed not to wear the shirts inspired by the last words of Eric Garner, the New York man who died after an officer put him in a chokehold (pictured) , while on the Fort Bragg campus during the Vern Piver Holiday Classic tournament . Mendocino varsity teams first wore the 'I Can't Breathe' T-shirts before a game with Fort Bragg on December 16, according to the girls coach, Caedyn Feehan. The girls also wore them before games at two other tournaments and didn't receive any blowback, Feehan said. 'I didn't even know what it meant. I thought it was a joke about how I had conditioned them so hard,' Feehan said. 'None of the administrators knew what it was or that any of them were doing it in advance. This was entirely for their cause that they had strong feelings about.' Professional basketball players such as LeBron James, Derrick Rose and Kyrie Irving wore 'I Can't Breathe' shirts during warmups this month without repercussions from the NBA. After Kobe Bryant and other Laker player wore them before a game and on the bench on Dec. 9, coach Byron Scott said he viewed it as a matter of 'freedom of choice and freedom of speech.' That's how Marc Woods, whose 16-year-old son Connor plans to sit out the tournament, sees it. Connor wore the T-shirt at the December 16 game in the name of team solidarity, but 'now that's become a First Amendment violation, that's what he is fired up about,' the father said. Woods, whose father was a California Highway Patrol officer, said he is outraged by what he sees as using intimidation to silence players and fans. Fort Bragg administrators have warned spectators who plan to protest the T-shirt ban that they will be asked to leave, he said. 'It doesn't take a lot to suppress the exchange of ideas when you put fear into it,' Woods said. Both schools are located in Mendocino County, known for redwood forests, rugged coastline and marijuana-growing, located 120 miles north of San Francisco. The student bodies at the two schools are 1 percent black and 50 percent white and 41 percent Hispanic at Fort Bragg, 75 percent white and 9 percent Hispanic at Mendocino. A county sheriff's deputy, Ricky Del Fiorentino, was killed in March by a man suspected of murder and carjacking in Eugene, Oregon. The suspect was killed by a Fort Bragg police officer. Walker referenced Del Fiorentino's death, saying 'We simply feel this issue is too emotionally charged to allow such a demonstration to happen in our tournament and be able to ensure the safety and well-being of all involved.'

"Holidaymakers will spend nearly £1,220 on their main break next year and are planning to throw in an additional trip away from home, new research has revealed. With the average Briton planning three trips instead of two in 2015, travellers are expected to spend nine per cent more on their main holiday compared to 2014, according to the study. And it should come as no surprise that a typical British holiday next year will be a ten-day trip to a Spanish beach resort. A typical British overseas holiday in 2015 will be a ten-day trip to a Spanish beach resort, a study says . The study by Travel Supermarket found that the average overseas break will involve a couple flying to Spain in June and spending a total of £1,218.52. That includes £707.24 from their savings account to pay for flights, transport and accommodation, leaving them with £511.28 spending money. But staycations will be most common with 32 per cent of respondents saying their main holiday will be in the UK. For those who are heading abroad, Spain remains the most popular spot outside the UK - with 12 per cent of adults saying they plan to go there next year, down from 13 per cent in 2014. A third more holidaymakers (16 per cent) are looking for adventure trips compared to last year . Source: Travel Supermarket . Beach breaks remain the top holiday choice for 2015 (29 per cent), but more tourists (12 per cent) will be embarking on cultural city breaks than in recent years. Adventure, luxury and city breaks as well as all-inclusive trips are also becoming more popular. A third more holidaymakers (16 per cent) are looking for adventure trips compared to last year, a 12 per cent increase, with only 10 per cent planning to pay for a cottage or villa rental. In search of comfort, 15 per cent of Brits will be treating themselves to a luxury trip (a 36 per cent increase on last year), while 17 per cent will opt for all-inclusive breaks - up 31 per cent on last year. Holiday destinations have remained largely unchanged for the past four years with Turkey and Portugal still making the top ten despite decreasing in popularity by one per cent. The Caribbean is the only new location to enter Travel Supermarket's list of the top destinations for 2015 . The US (eight per cent), France (five per cent) and Italy (three per cent) are also on travellers' check lists as places to visit next year. The Caribbean is the only new location to enter the top ten destinations for 2015 with two per cent planning to spend their main holiday there. One in ten (nine per cent) are planning to holiday alone and nine per cent of adults have said they will be holidaying with parents. Travel Supermarket's annual Travel Trends Tracker found consumer confidence is rising, with those looking to go away having three breaks instead of two - the average number of holidays since the tracker started four years ago. More tourists (12 per cent) will be embarking on cultural city breaks than in recent years, says the study . Bob Atkinson, travel expert from Travel Supermarket, said: ‘Holiday habits are often a reflection of consumer confidence and the results of our Travel Trends Tracker indicate that the mood of the nation is becoming more positive. ‘We're seeing people starting to spend more on their main break, go away more often on holidays and even book more luxurious and costly trips. ‘While Spain continues to be a firm favourite, holidaymakers are now seeking more than just a “fly and flop” in a sunny clime, whether it's trekking in the Himalayas, bungee jumping in New Zealand, or soaking up the culture in a city like Berlin. ‘As the festive period comes to an end, now is the time for Brits to get in early to get the best deals for their 2015 holidays. ‘Looking around both on and offline and comparing your options will help you get the best value for money on a huge variety of trips, whether it's a short city break, your annual family break or something more luxurious or unusual as a treat.’","Travel Supermarket study says average Briton is planning three breaks .

"The leading professional athletes in Australia are at risk of being blackmailed into match-fixing, according to an organised crime detective. The NSW Police Organised Crime Squad is addressing match-fixing, in particular the use of 'honey trapping', where players are set up to cheat on their spouse then blackmailed with the evidence. Detective Superintendent Scott Cook has claimed that most sports have already been infiltrated by match fixing, with players sabotaging their events to benefit criminals, reports News.com.au. A senior detective in the department has claimed that most sports have already been infiltrated by match fixing . Detective Superintendent Scott Cook claims the operations involve criminals from overseas, which makes it difficult for police to gather evidence on who is responsible . Mr Cook said the match fixing is being organised by a select number of individuals. 'The intelligence we are getting suggests that most sports have been infiltrated to some degree, but it's just a few people, not thousands.' 'A lot of the information we're getting is that players and sports people are being influenced or approached in social settings in order to manipulate them ... that is one example,' he said. 'It's early days for us, but we're looking to develop the intelligence to proceed into prosecutions.' Mr Cook believes underworld figures could be making billions of dollars from the match-fixing operations. 'In offshore locations the amount of money that's bet on games, like cricket, is billions of dollars,' he said. Mr Cook believes underworld figures could be making billions of dollars from the match-fixing operations . Professor Jack Anderson of Queen's University in Belfast estimates that 25 per cent of world sport now is controlled by organised crime . He claims that the operations involve criminals from overseas, which makes it difficult to gather evidence on who is responsible. He also claimed that many acts go unpunished due to a lack of evidence. Four Australian soccer players and a coach from the Southern Stars premier league team were arrested in 2013 for match fixing. Police claimed the syndicate had earned more than $2 million from betting. At an international sports law conference in Adelaide in October, Professor Jack Anderson of Queen's University in Belfast said match fixing had become the number one threat to sports integrity.

"Fewer rapists are being brought to justice because of cuts to police forces, Labour has claimed. Despite a massive increase in the number of cases reported to police, fewer arrests are being made and both prosecution and conviction rates have fallen. Figures obtained under Freedom of Information laws show that recorded rapes soared by 30 per cent between 2011 and 2014 – but the number of arrests fell by eight per cent. A Labour MP claims fewer rapists are being brought to justice because of cuts to police forces. File photo . The 32 of Britain’s 43 forces who replied to the request recorded a rise of almost 4,000 cases, up to 16,983 in the last year. But in the same period the number of arrests fell by nearly 1,000 to 10,710. The proportion of reported crimes leading to a conviction fell from around one in seven to one in ten; and the number of prosecutions from one in four to fewer than one in five. Labour MP Seema Malhotra said: ‘This is a devastating example of the justice gap created by this Government’s policies. 'More victims are struggling to get the justice they deserve and fewer rapists are being caught.’ Ms Malhotra blamed ‘heavy cuts’ to specialist police units and claimed the Government planned further reductions next year – which she promised Labour would reverse.

"The Russian government has been forced to triple the bailout of one of its floundering banks as the country's financial crisis deepens. The $2.4 billion rescue of Trust Bank, which uses Hollywood actor Bruce Willis to advertise its credit cards, is said to be the second largest ever seen in Russian history. Trust Bank fell victim to the sharp fall in the value of rouble, which prompted the panic buying of foreign currency and the rise in deposit withdrawals. Scroll down for video . The Russian government has been forced to triple the bailout of floundering Trust Bank, which is advertised by Hollywood A-lister Bruce Willis . The $2.4 billion rescue of Trust Bank, which uses Hollywood actor Bruce Willis to advertise its credit cards, is said to be the second largest ever seen in Russian history . Russia's central bank said on Monday that it would provide $540 million (30 billion roubles) to shore up its finances. Four days later they said the loan would be replaced with another for up to 99 billion roubles over 10 years from the Deposit Insurance Agency, a state corporation, to cover the discrepancy between Trust Bank's assets and liabilities. As much as 28 billion roubles will also be loaned over six years to Otkritie bank, which will oversee Trust Bank's rescue. The slump in Russia has been blamed on Western sanctions and the falling price of oil. Last Friday Russia's lower house of parliament hastily approved a draft law to give the banking sector a capital boost of up to 1 trillion roubles, which banks are expected to receive from early next year. The funds earmarked just for Trust Bank - Russia's 32nd largest lender by assets according to Interfax data - are equivalent to almost 13 percent of that figure. Analysts said the bailout showed the central bank wanted to shore up confidence in the banking sector and that Otkritie would benefit from overseeing the rescue by receiving a cheap liquidity boost. People seen walking past the headquarters of the troubled bank in Moscow . The central bank has also launched a drive to clean up the banking sector and has revoked the licenses of over 100 banks since the beginning of last year, bringing the total number of licensed banks in Russia below 1,000. With Russia's economy taking a nosedive, the pain for its banks seems certain to continue next year as consumer spending and earnings shrink. The rouble rose on Friday to its strongest levels in more than three weeks after the government ordered exporters to sell some of their hard currency revenues. But the currency remains down 38 percent against the dollar this year. Trust Bank's bailout is now Russia's largest behind the 2011 rescue of Bank of Moscow, which cost the government almost 400 billion roubles.","Russia triples the bailout of floundering Trust Bank to $2.4 billion .

"It was a bad year for Sheldon Adelson. Earlier this month Businessweek revealed that the owner of some of the largest casinos in the world was the target of Iranian hackers, who brought down servers at the Las Vegas Sands Casino. The cyber assault, in retaliation for comments from Adelson, 81, about threatening to nuke Iran, was followed by another embarrassment - seeing his personal fortune drop by $8.9billion in 2014. Losses: Sheldon Adelson, 81, dropped to 23rd wealthiest person in the world in 2014 after suffering a $8.9billion drop in his personal fortune . Bloomberg Billionaires, which indexes the fortunes of the wealthiest individuals in the world, showed Adelson was joined by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, 50, who lost $7.5billion, and IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, 88, who fell $8.4billion, in racking up the highest losses in 2014. Bezos, who owns 84 million shares in Amazon, suffered by owning an 18 percent stake in a company that is struggling to make gains even as sales expand. The online retailer dropped serious coin in 2014, the New York Post reports, buying up gaming site Twitch and expanding company warehouse locations. The company also gained 10 million Prime members able to enjoy free two-day shipping, a costly expense for Amazon, who started gifting Prime customers $1 every time they decided to forgo rush shipping, Huffington Post reported in June. On the other end of the spectrum, Bezos's counterpart in China made a killing in 2014, shoring up his fortune by $25.2billion. Jack Ma, 50, founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, began the year with a lowly $3.6billion before multiplying his fortune thanks to a successful September IPO and shot up to number 21 in the world, just one step above Bezos.

At the very top of the chain, there was a re-establishment of the old order, as Bill Gates rose to reclaim the number one spot earlier in 2014. He had been briefly overtaken by 74-year-old telecom billionaire Carlos Slim in 2007, according to Fortune, before losing the spot for several years starting in 2010.

"Home owners in London are benefiting from the largest increases in property values, with Greenwich and Ealing showing the strongest returns with an almost 25 per cent price hike. Across the UK, the average price of a house is £209,428, an annual increase of 8.5 per cent. But householders across many areas of the north and the midlands are watching their investments plummet, with property in Bury tumbling by almost 5 per cent. Houses in Greenwich, pictured, have recorded the strongest year-on-year price increase during 2014 . Tower Hamlets, pictured, has seen prices rise by 22 percent over 2013, with an average price of £424,000 . Property prices in Hackney have  jumped by almost 20 percent in 2013 . The research, based on house price data from Halifax found that the value of property in Greenwich, which has benefited from the Olympics regeneration, jumped by 24.6 percent over the past twelve months. Other areas of the capital increased by more than one-fifth. The average London house price has risen by 13 per cent since 2013. Buying into the Olympic dream will cost more than £328,000. Nine out of ten areas which have seen the strongest price growth over the last year are dotted across London. They included Ealing, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Brent, Southwark and Hackney. It might look picturesque, but investing in Bury, pictured, is risky as  property prices tumbled by five per cent . According to the survey, house prices across the capital are booming with increases of up to 25 per cent . The worst ten places to buy property in the UK according to a new survey by Halifax . Crawley in West Sussex was the only place outside London to make the top 10, with prices there rising by 22.4 per cent over the last year. Looking across the UK, Cambridge was another strong house price performer this year, with property values there lifting by 17.3 per cent to reach £328,081 typically. Outside southern England, property values in Sheffield have seen the strongest annual uplift, with a 13.7 per cent increase pushing the average price to £148,372. Halifax said house prices in Sheffield are likely to have been boosted by the fact that over the past five years, the South Yorkshire city has seen a significant increase in employment, particularly in managerial, professional and technical skilled occupations. In Wales, Wrexham was the top price performer, with values there increasing by 8.9 per cent compared with 2013 to reach £155,232 typically in 2014. Dundee was Scotland's strongest performer. House prices in Dundee have risen by 10.9 per cent year on year to reach £146,306 on average. Looking at Northern Ireland, Halifax said prices in Craigavon have increased by 3.8 per cent annually to reach £104,789 typically. Newport in South Wales, pictured, has seen a fall of almost three per cent on 2013 . Even Durham, with its prestigious university, pictured, has missed out on the mini property boom . Meanwhile, Swindon was the South West region of England's strongest price performer. Property values there have increased by 9.5 per cent annually to reach £178,826 typically. Chester gave the strongest performance in the North West, with values there lifting by 8 per cent year on year to reach £189,640 on average. In the North region of England, Gateshead had the highest house price surge. Values in Gateshead have increased by 7.7 per cent year on year to reach £130,827 typically. In the West Midlands, values in Coventry have typically increased by 8.9 per cent to reach £158,931, while in the East Midlands, prices in Kettering recorded a 10.1 per cent uplift, taking them to £167,980. Craig McKinlay, mortgage director at Halifax, said: 'Continuing improvements in the economy, rising employment and low mortgage rates will no doubt have supported housing demand and, combined with a shortage of homes coming on to the market, will have contributed to rising property values. 'At the other end of the spectrum, several of the towns experiencing price falls in the past year are still suffering from relatively weak employment conditions, which may have had an adverse impact on their local housing markets.' The towns with the biggest average falls in house prices between 2013 and 2014 were all outside southern England and four out of the 10 weakest-performing towns were in north west England.

"A pilot whose passenger plane was stuck on the tarmac at Manchester Airport for three hours due to snow delays called police after getting frustrated at the hold-up. Passengers on board the Germanwings flight to Hamburg said the pilot became so frustrated at the long wait and the lack of response from airport staff that he dialled 999. The plane was waiting to be 'de-iced', but many complained there only seemed to be one vehicle equipped to remove snow from all the planes and some claimed it broke down at one point. Officers boarded the plane which was carrying 150 passengers at around 11pm, but took no action. A pilot whose passenger plane was stuck on the tarmac at Manchester Airport for three hours due to snow delays called police, pictured is the airport in snowy conditions in 2010 . A number of flights to destinations including Belfast, Paris and Hamburg were unable to take off at the airport after a snow storm and plummeting temperatures meant conditions were not safe. After a long delay, the Hamburg flight was rescheduled to set off at 10.15pm, but had still not left by 11pm. Passenger Adrian Adam, 30, said the pilot, attempting to contact airport staff or operator Germanwings, became so frustrated at waiting, he eventually called the police. 'After being delayed for that long, we couldn't land in Hamburg because they don't allow flights in after 11pm,' said Mr Adam who lives in Hamburg had been visiting family in St Helens for Christmas. 'We were waiting, like a lot of other planes, to be de-iced. There was one for all the planes that were waiting. 'No-one was coming back to the pilot, so eventually he called the police. He said he couldn't tell us anything because he couldn't get hold of anyone - he said no-one was responding. The plane was waiting to be 'de-iced' at Manchester Airport (pictured) but many complained there only seemed to be one vehicle equipped to remove snow from all the planes and some claimed it broke down . 'It was getting pretty hot and all the food was gone. There was about 150 people on the plane, people were getting frustrated.' A spokesman for Manchester Airport insisted the airport was 'operational', despite some delays because of planes needing to be de-iced. He said he couldn't comment on the specific incident on the plane due to set off to Hamburg. 'We're operational, things are taking a bit longer than usual, but we're doing what we can and flights are coming in,' said the spokesman. Greater Manchester Police confirmed officers had been on the plane after a call from the pilot. He said despite the pilot's claims that passengers were agitated, those on board were calm and officers did not have to remove anybody. It is understood that when police left the plane, some passengers followed and others remained on board after being told the flight would be diverted to Hannover. Passengers on board a flight to Belfast were left waiting for more than four hours on the tarmac, according to reports, but were eventually ushered off the plane and back into the terminal. Natalie Merchant said: 'Spent a week in an alpine country and where do we get stranded thanks to snow? Manchester Airport.' Alan Wilson, who was left stranded in the airport after waiting four-and-a-half hours on a plane due to go to Belfast, said: 'If you turn up four minutes late for one of their flights, you won't get on. And yet we're left waiting for four hours.' Both Liverpool's John Lennon Airport and Leeds Bradford International in Yorkshire closed last night while their runways were cleared of snow.","A pilot called police after his plane was stuck on the tarmac for three hours .

"A new video shows the moment that actor Dustin Diamond stabbed a man  on Christmas night. On Thursday the actor - who played Screech on the popular nineties series Saved by the Bell - was arrested and charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety; carrying a concealed weapon; and disorderly conduct, use of a dangerous weapon after getting into a fight at the Grand Avenue Saloon in Port Washington, Wisconsin. After the  fight Diamond fled the scene along with girlfriend Amanda Schutz, who works as a clown named Loli Pop. Officers soon located the two and both were taken into custody, where Diamond said that he was trying to close out his tab to avoid intoxicated people he thought were going to 'brawl' when he turned around and saw two men grabbing his girlfriend's hair as she bled. As he went to help her he claims a man grabbed him and that is when the incident occurred. Scroll down for videos . Dustin Diamond and girlfriend Amanda Schutz were arrested Thursday following a bar fight at the Grand Avenue Saloon in Port Washington, Wisconsin . Dustin says he was protecting his girlfriend from two men when he unintentionally stabbed someone with a switchblade . Schutz (above) was arrested and then released . In a police report obtained by CNN, it says; 'Diamond stated that he did not intentionally stab the individual in the bar but that chaos broke out and people were grabbing at him and that he swung his arms to break free.' Other bar patrons are claiming 'a women was upset because people were taking pictures of her and her boyfriend,' and shoving broke out. This after TMZ claimed the Celebrity Fit Club alum and his girlfriend allegedly got into a dispute with another couple at the bar because they were being photographed, the website reported. After the couple exited the establishment, things escalated when Dustin's girlfriend reportedly pushed the woman. That is when the actor pulled out a knife, it was claimed. The victim is reported to have suffered a half inch wound and bled heavily. The couple who Dustin argued with then fled before authorities arrived, according to the report. Authorities found the weapon in Diamond's possession in his car, and his girlfriend was booked on a disorderly conduct charge, though she was later released. Diamond (above) is still being held in jail on $10,000 bail . Dustin's girlfriend works as a clown in the area and goes by the name Loli Pop . According to Linked In, 'Loli Pop the Clown is fun, loveable, and the perfect entertainer for children of all ages' He has not paid his $10,000 bond for release from a Ozaukee County jail and is claiming he acted in self-defense. Meanwhile cops are hoping to get their hands on another video taken on the scene as the one they currently have is a little bit to shaky for them to clearly see the incident. According to state regulations, owning a switchblade or any 'blade which opens by pressing a button, spring or other device in the handle' is against the law. Saved By The Bell with Elizabeth Berkley, Lark Voorhies, Mario Lopez, Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, Dustin (bottom) and Mark-Paul Gosselaar . Dustin was a key part of the Saved by the Bell ensemble - that aired from 1989 to 1993 - was a massive success with the teen audience and also starred Elizabeth Berkley,  Mario Lopez, Lark Voorhies and Tiffani Thiessen. Leah Remini and Tori Spelling also appeared on the series. He also appeared on the spinoff Saved By The Bell: The College Years, which was canceled after one season. In 2006 he released the sex tape Screeched - Saved By The Smell. Later he told Oprah that he used a stunt double for the tape. Dustin has been working in reality TV more recently. He made an appearance in Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling in 2000, Celebrity Fit Club in 2007 and Celebrity Big Brother in 2013. In 2009, Diamond published an inside story of the show's cast and crew, from his point of view, titled Behind the Bell. In 2009 he also reportedly got married to Jennifer Misner, his longtime girlfriend, though a rep for the actor said the two are no longer together. In November he looked to be in good spirits as he co-hosted the Saved By The XIV party at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. On Tuesday, Dustin made a return to Bayside High School in a parody segment for truTV's Friends Of The People, where the actor performed the role of a high school principal. A rep for Dustin declined to comment at this time.","A video shows the moment that Dustin Diamond stabbed a man at a bar on Thursday night before fleeing with his girlfriend .

"Canadian parents who have suffered the loss of three of their sons are sharing their heartbreaking story. Anne and Clifford Arnall raised their six children on a farm near the tiny community of Ravenscrag, Saskatchewan. Then, on March 25, 2008, tragedy struck when their son Blake, just 14, was killed while out on an all-terrain vehicle. The already suffering parents then had to deal with this nightmare again on July 23, 2014 when their sons Sean and Lyndon died in a tractor accident. Three deaths in just six years. Sean, Blake and Lyndon Arnal, who all died in tragic farm accidents . Blake Arnal (right) and his brother-in-law Corey Henderson (left) on quads preparing to chase cattle . Anne, Lyndon, Sean and Clifford Arnal in a photo taken before the boys were killed . 'It destroyed an entire generation that should be running that farm … There’s no future there now that they’re gone,' Clifford told the National Post. Clifford has now left the farm and taken a construction job five hours away, saying he does not know if he will ever return to the farm after burying two of his sons this summer as the 'loss is too much to bear.' Sean and Lyndon were laid to rest in the same coffin. Anne drives the five hours once a week to go be with him. 'I could never imagine how or why I would be asked to have to do this,' Anne says of the deaths. 'You try to figure out whether you’re supposed to gain something or whether you’re supposed to change somehow or what you’re being tested for … and I don’t have the slightest idea.' School photos of Lyndon (left) and Sean (right) Blake and his tobaggan on Family Day in 2007 . Lyndon writing on a dirtbike (left) and with his older brother Dylan (right) The couple also take time to address the belief held by some that they are responsible for their children's death and for allowing them to ride these vehicles and work on the farm at such a young age. Anne said the boys now working on the farm was not an option, saying that 'Sean and Lyndon were energetic boys and she didn’t want them growing up in a bubble, playing video games in the basement.' Now, with no one left on the farm and her three older children, daughters Chantal, 26, and  Olivia, 18, and son Dylan ,24, out of the house, Anne gets very lonely she admits, and sad - but only briefly, making sure to keep it in an imaginary box. 'I open it a little bit every day and I have my little bit of sad time and crying and whatever I need to do. Then I shut that box … I don’t have to throw it open and cope with it all right now,' she says. 'I’ll carry that box forever.'","Anne and Clifford Arnall raised their six children on a farm near the tiny community of Ravenscrag, Saskatchewan .

The third most popular scenic backdrop of 2014 was Northern Ireland, the principal filming location for HBO’s Game of Thrones. The drama was down two spots after finishing atop last year’s poll of Radio Times readers, who were asked to vote for the location they would most like to visit after watching their favourite television programmes in 2014. Cornwall, the setting for BBC One’s adaption of Daphne du Maurier’s Jamaica Inn, was voted the fourth most popular destination, while Derbyshire, the shooting location for Peter Moffat’s The Village on BBC One, rounded out the top five.

"Vice President Joe Biden visited the devastated family of slain NYPD officer Wenjian Liu after delivering and emotional eulogy to Rafael Ramos during his funeral on Saturday. He and his wife Jill spent 25 minutes in the Brooklyn home of the 32-year-old officer's widow and his family after the funeral service for his 40-year-old partner. Thousands of officers line the streets of Queens to pay their respects to Ramos who was shot and killed last week alongside his partner. Vice President Joe Biden arrives with his wife Jill for the funeral of Rafael Ramos at the Christ Tabernacle Church in Queens where he delivered a eulogy. After the ceremony he visited the home of his slain officer Wenjian Liu . When he was invited on stage at the Christ Tabernacle Church, he spoke directly to the murdered officers family while standing in front of the casket. He began by saying: 'There is little anyone can say or do at this moment to ease this sense of loss, this sense of loneliness. Biden then went on to say: 'When an assassin's bullet targeted two officers, it targeted this city and it touched the soul of the entire nation. 'There will come a time when Rafael's memory will bring a smile to your lips instead of a tear to your eye. My prayer for you is that it will come sooner rather than later.' Following the touching speech he then travelled to Brooklyn where he spoke to Liu's family. According to the New York Daily News, Biden told the father: 'These people will be with you your whole life (referring to the NYPD). 'You now have a family larger than you ever thought you'd have.' During his speech Biden also touched on the marked increase in the racial diversity of the city's police force, which only a few decades ago was almost entirely white. 'I believe that this great police force of this incredibly diverse city can and will show the nation how to bridge any divide.' During his touching tribute he said Ramos' death had 'touched the soul of the entire nation',  and also spoke directly the victim's family who were sat in the front row . At the end of the funeral he spoke to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, one of the many other dignitaries there to pay their respects . The ceremony was later marked by an unusual protest against Mayor Bill de Blasio. As he rose to deliver the customary mayoral eulogy, thousands of uniformed officers outside silently turned their backs on him in a pointed display of disrespect as his image filled the large screens broadcasting the service. Angered by the mayor's qualified sympathy for nationwide demonstrations calling for police reform, some New York police officers had similarly shunned de Blasio as he arrived a week ago at the hospital where Ramos and his police partner, Wenjian Liu, were declared dead. 'He believed in protecting others,' de Blasio said as he stood behind Ramos' coffin, which was draped in the police department's flag and bathed in blue light, 'and those who are called to protect others are a special breed.' In the top left, Mayor Bill De Blasio leaves along with other guests including former New York Mayor Rudy Guliani (bottom right in glasses) The Vice President arrived at the funeral wearing sunglasses and was surrounded by some of the thousands of cops who lined the streets of Queens .","After the funeral for Ramos in Queens he and his wife Jill spent 25 minutes in the home of Liu's family, including the officer's widow .

The last time she held him was when he was one-year-old. Australian businesswoman Charlotte Chou has been released from a Chinese jail after about seven years of being held in detention . When Ms Chou walked free from the detention centre, she was greeted by her 19-year-old son Cleon, who's attending university in Beijing, and Sydney-based 21-year-old daughter Chloe and Ms Chou's sister Fiona Zou. In 2008 she was taken away by police while her one-year-old son Lincoln was asleep in their  home in Guangzhou, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. He is now seven-years-old and is in the care of Ms Chou's parents in Sydney's north shore, according to the Australian Financial Review. Ms Chou was accused of stealing about 29 million yuan, which is $5.3 million, from a private university which she helped establish. As a result she was sentenced a year and a half in jail on bribery charges in 2008 but was rearrested upon her released in December 2009. After numerous trials, in 2012 she was found guilt of embezzlement and was sentenced to eight years behind bars. During an appeal last year, her sentence was reduced to three years.","Charlotte Chou was released from Guangzhou No.1 Detention Centre in South China on Saturday morning .

"In his first major show of philanthropy, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg made a splash by announcing his plan to give $100million to help turn around Newark, New Jersey's public schools in an appearance on Oprah in 2010. But nearly four years later, Zuckerberg's money has run out, having been spent mostly on labor contracts and consulting fees with no noticeable improvement in student performance, a report in the New Yorker reveals. 'Everybody's getting paid, but Raheem still can't read,' Vivian Cox Fraser, the president of the Urban League of Essex County, told the magazine. Change: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg pledged $100million dollars to help Newark, New Jersey public schools in 2010 but the money is mostly gone and the schools aren't any better . Big check: Zuckerberg announced the plan with then-Newark Mayor Cory Booker and Governor Chris Christie on the Oprah show in 2010 . Then-Mayor Cory Booker came up with the plan to bring cutting-edge educational reform to his city in 2010. He saw a way to bring rapid change through philanthropic donations, which require no public reviews on spending, and Governor Chris Christie got on board. The program's largest donor was Zuckerberg, who even admitted to Booker that he didn't know much about education reform or philanthroy. Zuckerberg's conditions were that Booker find other donors to match his contribution and hire a new 'transformational leader' as superintendent. Cami Anderson was eventaully selected as superintendent, but the job of turning Newark's schools into 'a symbol of excellence for the whole nation' has not been easy. 'This is 16-dimensional chess,' Anderson said. Complicated: Cami Anderson was chosen as Newark's new superintendent but has had a hard time making changes, describing the work as '16-dimensional chess' Zuckerberg's money has mostly gone into the early stages of overhaul, paying consultants upwards of $1,000 a day to find solutions to Newark public schools' problems. According to the report, between 2010 and 2012 'more than twenty million dollars of Zuckerberg's gift and matching donations went to consulting firms and various specialities: public relations, human resources, communications, data analysis, [and] teacher evaluations.' And the plans for overhaul did not settle well with Newark parents, who were informed that many of the schools would be closed and replaced with charter schools. Anderson's plan, titled 'One Newark', is the latest iteration of how to change the schools. It offers familes the ability to chose between 55 public schools and 16 charter schools to send their children to, with low-income familes and those with special-needs students getting first pick. But there are still several flaws with the plan, such as the fact that it doesn't include funds to provide transportation for students. The author took a walk with some Newark parents, tracing the route their daughter would take to a potential new school, down streets of boarded-up homes occupied by gangs. 'I will not allow my daughter to make this walk,' Jacqueline Edward said. 'My twenty-eight-year-old started off in a gang, and we fought to get him out. My twenty-two-year-old has a lot of anger issues because Daddy wasn’t there. I just refuse to see another generation go that way.' And now there are fears that the plan will be slowed since Ras Baraka, Newark's new mayor as of Tuesday night, has been an outspoken opponent to the plan. Meanwhile, the two people that championed the plan have all but abandoned the Newark problem. Booker has since gone to Washington as a New Jersey senator and Governor Christie is busy repairing his reputation after Bridgegate. It's unclear if Zuckerberg will offer additional funds.","The Facebook founder pledged $100million to Newark schools in 2010 to bring sweeping educational reforms .

"When Hollywood couple Helena Bonham Carter and film director Tim Burton abruptly announced the end of their 13-year relationship last week, they insisted the split was amicable. The eccentric pair, whose joint fortune is estimated at £80 million, even put on a united front for Christmas when they went for a stroll in London with their two children, Billy Ray, 11, and Nell, six. But now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Burton, 56, is already involved in a long-term relationship with Berenice Percival, a production assistant who has been working for him for three years. Scroll down for video . 'In love': Tim Burton and Berenice Percival, on the right wth tartan scarf.  Their relationship took off when they went to Vancouver . The 39-year-old mother of one has been identified as the mystery blonde pictured in a passionate embrace with the Edward Scissorhands director last year after a cinema trip in Hampstead, North London. She is said by friends to have been an important factor in the separation. Sources close to Bonham Carter and Burton said that the actress had fought to save their relationship. One added: ‘She thought Tim was having a midlife crisis and gave him room to get it out of his system. But it never happened so she reluctantly decided to end things.’ The break-up has apparently divided friends in the film industry, many of whom have thrown their support behind the quirky 48-year-old actress. Burton and Ms Percival, meanwhile, are believed to have been staying at a London house with her nine-year-old son. Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter (pictured together left) announced the end of their 13-year relationship last week. The 'mystery' woman kissing Burton (right) has been uncovered as film assistant Berenice Percival . ‘Berenice is telling friends that they’re happy, in love and that she sees a future with Tim,’ said the friend. ‘He has been caring and a lovely father figure to her son. She refers to Tim as her boyfriend.’ Ms Percival began working for Tim Burton Productions between late 2011 and 2012 after being introduced by members of Johnny Depp’s support team. She had been an assistant on several of Depp’s films, including Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and Sweeney Todd, which were both directed by Burton and starred Bonham Carter. Initially, Ms Percival dealt with basic administration but later began to arrange foreign travel for Burton and accompany him on business trips. Their relationship took off when they travelled to Vancouver. ‘They were there for a few days,’ a source said. ‘They stayed out late and drank tequila.’ Another source added: ‘Berenice and Tim have just returned from San Francisco and will start shooting a new film in the New Year. It’s business as usual for them.’ When contacted by The Mail on Sunday, Ms Percival made no comment. Representatives for Mr Burton did not respond to our enquiries.","Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton announced their split last week .

"The SNP are on course to more than double their vote share in Scotland at the next general election, potentially stripping 31 seats from the Labour Party. The swing could see Labour reduced to just 10 MPs in their traditional heartland of Scotland, and could put Downing Street out of Ed Miliband's reach. Buoyed by the recent independence campaign, Nicola Sturgeon's party are predicted to take 43 per cent of the vote next May, compared with just 20 per cent in 2010. Meanwhile support for Labour would be decimated, falling from 42 per cent at the last Westminster election to just 26 per cent. Nicola Sturgeon could see the SNP double its vote share at the next general election, returning 45 MPs to Westminster, and almost wiping Labour off the political map . Such a dramatic shift in Scotland's political landscape would be a bitter blow to new Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, who has vowed to retain every on of Labour's seats, and an embarrassment to beleaguered Ed Miliband. The new poll, conducted by ICM for the Guardian, could prove disastrous for Mr Miliband's hopes of becoming Prime Minister, even if Ukip succeeds in splitting the Tory vote in the rest of the country. Most alarmingly for Labour, further analysis of the poll by Professor John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, suggests it could lose some fortress seats that it has held since the 1920s. When the seats are broken down into categories and analysed individually, rather than as an overall trend, virtually every Labour seat in Scotland is at risk, he added. David Cameron's party are set to drop from 16 per cent to 13 per cent voter share in Scotland, though they will still retain the single seat they hold north of the border, according to ICM. The Lib Dems are looking at another collapse in voter confidence in 2015, falling from 19 per cent at the last general election to 6 per cent. Mirroring the political change taking place throughout the UK, both Ukip and the Greens are on course for gains, with Nigel Farage's party picking up seven per cent of the votes, and the Greens finishing on four per cent. Labour could be reduced from 41 MPs to just ten while the SNP would gain a crushing majority according to a new poll released today . The SNP, then lead by Alex Salmond, returned just six MPs at the last general election but could take 45 of Scotland's 59 constituencies if current trends continue. The findings echo those of recent research by Survation for the Daily Record, which found that 48 per cent of voters would back the SNP with Labour trailing on 24 per cent. Issues on which the SNP were strong was the right for Scotland to set its own corporation tax, which is currently set in London, where 53 per cent felt the power should be devolved. The poll also showed that 43 per cent thought the Trident nuclear deterrent should be scrapped, another issue on which the SNP campaigns. On the issue of the Smith Commission, which was set up after the independence vote to recommend powers to hand over to Holyrood, 30 per cent of Scots thought its proposals did not go far enough, while 26 per cent though it got the balance right. Jenny Marra MSP, Scottish Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said the recent election of new leader Jim Murphy heralded a 'fresh start' for the party. She said:  'We will come back in the New Year with passion and energy, setting out our vision for making Scotland the fairest nation on earth. 'We want the wealthiest Scots to pay a little bit more in tax so we can improve our NHS and give the poorest kids being let down by the SNP government in Edinburgh a better start in life. The disastrous prediction would be a bitter blow to Jim Murphy (left), the new Scottish Labour leader who has publicly vowed to hold every 2010 seat, and may put Number 10 beyond the reach of Ed Miliband . 'The choice facing Scots next May is clear - we can send SNP MPs to the House of Commons to protest against the Tories, or we can send Scottish Labour MPs to replace the Tories. 'The only way to remove David Cameron from Downing Street and return a UK Labour Government is to vote Labour.' Angus Robertson MP, SNP general election campaign director, said:  'This is another very encouraging poll for the SNP, on top of the Survation poll showing the party on a record high. 'While these polls are extremely welcome, we take absolutely nothing for granted - and the hard work begins in the New Year to ensure that Scotland's voice is heard at Westminster. 'This is the second poll in a week showing that Jim Murphy has experienced a 'reverse honeymoon' as Scottish Labour leader, with Labour trailing far behind the SNP.

"The girl was given the tablet to help with her schoolwork. But a month later her mother checked the device and  discovered she had been targeted by at least 16 men (picture posed by model) A ten-year-old girl was groomed by perverts through her iPad  - despite her parents taking 'all sensible safety measures' to protect her. The girl was given the tablet to help with her schoolwork. But just a month later her mother checked the device and was 'terrified' to discover that she had been targeted by at least 16 men. They used popular applications such as Skype and Snapchat to send the girl explicit messages and encourage her to expose herself on camera. The perverts, who are understood to be based in the UK and overseas, were able to contact the girl, who lives near Middlesbrough, even though her parents had taken child safety precautions. Police have now launched an international investigation to find the men. Detectives from Cleveland Police are liaising with Snapchat and Skype bosses in the hope of tracking them down, according to the Sun. It comes just weeks after David Cameron unveiled new plans to tackle web pornography, calling for internet firms to do more to help catch paedophiles. The schoolgirl was first contacted by a man on Snapchat, who won her trust before leading the conversation on to sex. Her parents believe that he must have passed her details on to others. Her father, 37, said that his daughter told many of the men that she was ten years old, but that it only encouraged them to ask for explicit images. He told the Sun: 'In one case they begged her to undress. When she refused he said ""Your parents won't come into your room in the time it will take to get out of your pyjamas"".' He father added that the most frightening exchange he read was one in which a man offered to transfer his daughter money so that she might travel to meet up with him. On another occasion one man begged: 'Open cam baby open' and added: 'plzzzzzz I like sex. What problem r u no interest to sex.' The father, 37, said that he and his wife knew she was using the applications - which are popular with teenagers - and had taken 'all the sensible child safety measures that all good parents do'. Her mother, 32, said it was 'terrifying' that the men could reach children in their own home and said she 'thanked God' that she checked her iPad. She said: ' I'm asking every parent in Britain to do the same. My little girl was groomed into doing things we thought were unthinkable. If it can happen to us it can happen to anyone.' At a summit with internet firms and experts earlier this month, Mr Cameron announced a new criminal offence of sexual communication with a child is to be created, closing a staggering loophole in the law. Paedophiles who currently solicit explicit pictures of children routinely escape punishment if it can't be proved they have received an illegal image. But the new law will allow police and prosecutors to pursue those who send text messages or 'fish' for victims online, irrespective of the outcome of their behaviour. Mr Cameron announced that a Serious Crime Bill currently going through Parliament will introduce a broad new offence, punishable by two years in jail. It will allow police and prosecutors to pursue those who 'fish' for child victims on social networks and chat rooms but cannot usually be punished unless they can be shown to have received an illegal image. Mr Cameron said he and his wife Samantha had applied filters to computers and other devices in their home to keep the internet safe for their children. The schoolgirl was first contacted by a man on Snapchat, who won her trust before leading the conversation on to sex. Her parents believe that he must have passed her details on to others (picture posed by model) The PM urged parents and children to talk to each other about the dangers of online child sexual exploitation but added: 'That's difficult for parents - we're still learning a lot about the internet ourselves.' The NSPCC's research shows that there has been a 168 per cent increase in the number of children being counselled by ChildLine about online sexual abuse – averaging seven contacts a day to its helpline. Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief executive, hailed the announcement as 'a victory for our Flaw in the Law campaign but more importantly a major step forward in preventing online child abuse'. There are a number of steps that parents can take to safeguard their children while online - on tablets, laptops and desktop computers. The UK Safer Internet Centre offers parents, teachers and children advice on what they can do to make sure that children are able to use the internet safely. It suggests parents take the following steps. Have ongoing conversations with your children about staying safe online. The Safer Internet Centre suggests parents start by asking their children what sites they enjoy visiting and what they do to stay safe online. They could also ask children whether they know where to go for help online. Use tools on social networks and other online services, eg Facebook privacy settings . Parents should think about the sites their family uses and take a look at which services and features the sites have that might be helpful. It recommends: 'Talk to your children and make sure they know how to use the tools on the sites and services they use.' Decide if you want to use parental controls on your home internet . The 4 big internet providers in the UK – BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media - provide their customers with free parental controls which can be activated at any time. But no filter or parental controls tool is 100 per cent effective, and many of the risks that young people face online are because of their own and other’s behaviour. Understand devices and the parental control tools they offer . The UK Safer Internet Centre recommends parents start by talking with their child about using their device safely and responsibly and agreeing a set of family rules. Rules could cover: not meeting up with people they have only met online, how much they are allowed to spend on apps, what websites it’s okay and not okay to visit, and whether their phone should be switched off at night. Get Safe Online,  a public / private sector partnership supported by HM Government, adds that it is sensible to set these boundaries before children get their first device with internet access. It advises parents to their child about the kind of content they see online. It says: 'They need to understand the importance of not sending other people - whoever they are - pictures of themselves naked.' It adds: 'Explain to your child that being online doesn’t give them anonymity or protection, and that they shouldn’t do anything online that they wouldn’t do face-to-face.'

"It’s the Christmas dinner table accessory that children take most delight in. But there’s one strange fact about the innocuous Christmas cracker that almost no one in Britain seems to realise: it’s illegal to sell them to anyone under 12. Thanks to an EU directive, crackers are classified as low-grade fireworks and shopkeepers who sell them to children could be jailed for up to six months or fined £5,000. Thanks to an EU directive, it is illegal to sell Christmas crackers to anyone aged under 12 . The bizarre regulation has led to a number of cases of check-out staff challenging teenagers buying Christmas crackers. Last week, a 16-year-old boy was turned away from a Sainsbury’s Local in Islington, North London, because he was unable to prove his age. When the box of crackers he wanted was swiped through the till, the supermarket’s ‘Think 25’ warning flashed up on the screen, indicating that it was an age-limited purchase, like alcohol, cigarettes and adult DVDs. The teenager had to leave the shop empty-handed, even though the minimum age at which they can be purchased was dropped last year from 16 to 12 in a Government crackdown on red tape. A Sainsbury’s spokesman said: ‘Our corporate age restriction on Christmas crackers is 12, in line with trading standards policy. ‘But it is up to the discretion of store managers on whether to go ahead with a sale.’ Last week, a 16-year-old boy was turned away from a Sainsbury’s Local in Islington, North London, because he was unable to prove his age when buying crackers .","Christmas crackers are banned for under-12s thanks to an EU directive .

"Two women came to blows in front of shocked travellers after one of them was accused of jumping the queue at an airport in Thailand. Passengers pulled out their phones to record video and snap photos as the fight erupted at Bangkok’s Don Mueang International Airport on Friday. According to one of the witnesses, there was an orderly queue at a check-in desk for budget airline Thai Lion Air, but travellers became furious when a woman from China cut in front of them. Two women trade punches after arguing at a check-in desk at Bangkok’s Don Mueang International Airport . The Chinese traveller and a woman from Thailand began shouting and were briefly involved in a physical fight, the Bangkok Post reported. After trading blows for a few seconds the brawl was broken up by several men who were in the queue, but the women continued to scream at each other. Friday’s airport rage incident follows a series of clashes or disturbances this month involving Chinese passengers. In one incident, a female passenger, who was upset because she wasn’t seated next to her boyfriend, threw a cup of hot water and noodles into the face of a Thai AirAsia flight attendant. The women, reportedly from China and Thailand, were separated but continued to argue . During the chaos her boyfriend jumped out of his seat and made a threat to blow up the Nanjing-bound plane, which was forced to turn around and make an emergency landing in Bangkok. That incident led to the Chinese travellers being called ‘barbarians’ by China’s state-run media, and the country’s government vowed to severely punish the couple and two travel companions. In a scathing statement, China’s National Tourism Administration said the tourists disrupted the flight, hurt other passengers and ‘badly damaged the overall image of the Chinese people.’ Days later, a mum was involved in a brawl on an Air China flight from Chongqing to Hong Kong after two women complained that her crying baby was making too much noise. Passengers were queuing at a check-in desk for budget airline Thai Lion Air when the fight erupted . The two women reclined their seats fully backwards, which led to the mid-air scuffle. In another incident, a man on board a Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu caused panic when he opened the emergency exit just before take-off as he 'wanted some fresh air’. Only days before, a man opened the emergency exit and deployed the slide after wanting to 'get off quicker' from his China Eastern flight that landed at Sanya Fenghaung International Airport in Hainan. Incidents involving Chinese tourists making angry outbursts have prompted Beijing to issue stern guidelines on behaving abroad.","Travellers recorded video of fight at Don Mueang International Airport .

"It was the worst kind of news to receive on Christmas Day when Helen Hart was told her dog may no make it through the night. The six-year-old jack russell terrier had been bitten by a 1.5m brown snake - one of the world's most venomous. So his chances of survival were very slim, according to the local vet. But Tater beat the odds and has now been hailed a hero - even dubbed as a 'wonder dog' by the family. Helen Hart's dog Tater was bitten by a brown 1.5m brown snake on Christmas Day. The offending brown snake (pictured), which is now dead, is held by Mrs Hart's son-in-law Nigel Hamer . Tater is a six-year-old jack russell terrier but became paralysed when he got bitten by the snake. The local vet kept a close eye on him and placed him under the Christmas tree . Mrs Hart has had Tater for six years on her property in Orange, the Central West region of NSW. 'When my husband died my daughter told me that I should get a dog,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm not much of a dog friendly person so I wasn't too keen on the idea but we bought him anyway from a lady down the road for $50. 'The reason why we call him Tater is because my husband used to grow potatoes so we named the dog 'Potatoes' - in loving memory of my husband.' Since then Mrs Hart admits she never cared too much for Tater - also known as Tate - but when it came to Christmas this year, she decided she'll take him a family lunch at her daughter's house. 'She lives in Newbridge (also in the Central West region) so I decided to take the dog with me for the Christmas lunch,' Mrs Hart said. 'My son-in-law was watching the dog while everyone was getting ready with the food when he heard Tate yelp. 'Then we went over and saw that there was a five foot brown snake. My son-in-law isolated it then killed it. It had to be done because we had family around.' Mrs Hart admitted that she never cared too much for Tater - also known as Tate - but when she was told that her dog might die, she was distraught . 'That's when I realised I really loved him because I didn't want him to die,' Mrs Hart said . Ten minutes later, their fears were confirmed when Tate began to show symptoms of a snake bite. 'His back leg was paralysed and he couldn't walk,' Mrs Hart said. 'I was so distraught. We called the emergency number for the vet in Blayney which is about 15 minutes from where we were.' Once Tate was examined by Vet Ruth Thompson, of Blayney Veterinary Hospital, things were looking grim. 'The vet told me that Tate probably won't make it through the night but she'll take him with her to keep an eye on him,' Mrs Hart said. 'That's when I realised I really loved him because I didn't want him to die.' The next morning, on Boxing Day, Mrs Hart received a call from Dr Thompson. 'She told me he's still in a bad state but he's alive and that I can take him home,' Mrs Hart said. 'So he's back in Orange with me and he's doing well, getting a lot of love and attention. 'He's a bit of a celebrity now. We think he's a bit of a hero. He's just gorgeous.' Other family members have affectionately described him as 'Tater the Wonder Dog'.","Tater, a six-year-old jack russell terrier, was bitten by a 1.5m brown snake .

"Security chiefs have taken the dramatic step of withdrawing Royal Guards from their high-profile posts outside palaces amid mounting fears of ‘lone wolf’ terrorist attacks. Elite soldiers of the Queen’s Guard have pulled back from public positions at many landmarks in response to possible threats from Islamic extremists. For the first time since the height of the IRA’s terror campaign, the soldiers are also no longer allowed on sentry duty alone, and are now accompanied by armed police. Scroll down for video . Elite soldiers of the Queen’s Guard have pulled back from public positions at many landmarks in response to possible threats from Islamic extremists . The move to more secure positions behind gates or railings is a direct response to attacks such as the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby and the killing of a sentry by a lone gunman at the Canadian Parliament two months ago. But the measures have been described as a ‘retreat’ for the Guards, known the world over for their bearskin caps. Retired officer Major Iain Dalzel-Job of the Scots Guards told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I think this is a big shame. 'The reason people know we’re around is because they can see us. But I suppose the changes are necessary as there is a significant threat.’ This newspaper has confirmed the changes to the Guards’ security at sites including Clarence House, St James’s Palace, Windsor Castle and Horse Guards Parade. For the first time since the height of the IRA’s terror campaign, the soldiers are also no longer allowed on sentry duty alone, and are now accompanied by armed police . At Clarence House, the official residence of Prince Charles, the guardsmen who used to stand in front of the gates on The Mall, a public road, have now been relocated, along with their sentry boxes, behind metal gates. Tourists, who love to pose with the Guards, can now barely see them. Police officers confirmed changes had been made for security reasons. At St James’s Palace, the London home of Princess Anne and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, two Guardsmen used to perform sentry duties beneath its famous clock tower on Pall Mall. These guards and their sentry boxes have now been moved into a secluded courtyard inside the perimeter, leaving no visible presence at the clock tower gate. The measures have been described as a ‘retreat’ for the Guards, known the world over for their bearskin caps . In Horse Guards Parade, two sentries still stand guard where tourists can pose for photographs with them. But four armed police officers now guard the soldiers. The officers carry Heckler and Koch carbine rifles, pistols and Taser guns – in contrast to the Guards, who just carry ceremonial swords. A Metropolitan Police officer on duty there told our reporter: ‘Yes, we are a recent addition here. It’s us guarding the Guards. I think there’s a Latin phrase for that.’ At Windsor Castle, up to three armed officers now stand next to the lone sentry on guard duty on the Western side of the castle. The tightening of security to levels unseen since the height of the IRA terror campaign comes in the wake of fanatics from the so-called Islamic State based in Iraq and Syria threatening Britain. Al-Qaeda groups have also called on would-be terrorists to launch ‘lone wolf’ attacks against UK soldiers and police. On Christmas Eve, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) encouraged Muslims to launch attacks in the West on their own. It published a magazine that gave instructions for a home-made bomb, and urged its readers to use such a device to blow up an airliner or other Western target. Former soldiers said last night that the changes were needed as sentries felt vulnerable to attack. One Guards insider said: ‘We’re fully in favour as if an attack on a sentry can happen in Canada it can happen here. By moving behind the railings we’ve got a chance to respond, most likely saving lives. ‘The changes were introduced in response to the Canadian attack and because there’s been a sharp rise in people armed with mobile phones trying to wind up the sentries and make them lose their temper.’ Former Welsh guardsman and former Met police officer Terry O’Shea said: ‘Moving the Guardsmen back to a more secure area seems an honourable retreat given the danger posed by the terrorists. 'We have got to strike a balance between not compromising our traditions and protecting our soldiers. ‘Unfortunately this is a sign of the times and how unpredictable the current situation is. 'We’ve seen horrific incidents across the world and in our capital city, so some action had to be taken to reduce the risk, even if it can never be eliminated. ‘You could argue that there should be a defiant stand but how do you protect the soldiers on parade in a bright suit, shiny boots and a furry hat? 'Where do we draw the line? Do you allow these soldiers to be armed? I think that could cause a greater problem. 'The terrorists know that a Guardsman is a higher profile target than an ordinary soldier and they’re looking for publicity, something spectacular, so the Guards would suit their agenda.’ Although there have not been any successful terror attacks in Britain since Lee Rigby was killed outside Woolwich Barracks in May last year, intelligence services say they have foiled a number of plots this year. Last month, police stopped an alleged plot to launch an attack on Remembrance Sunday, after arresting four men in London and High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Also last month, police chiefs warned officers not to wear their uniforms to and from work as Islamic terrorists were looking to target officers. In October, Muslim convert Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, shot dead sentry Nathan Cirillo, 24, outside the National War Memorial in Ottawa, Canada, then stormed into the nearby Parliament building before being shot dead by security guards. The soldiers currently performing ceremonial duties outside the Royal palaces are drawn from the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, F Company of the Scots Guards and 7 Company of the Coldstream Guards. These Guardsmen carry rifles equipped with bayonets but as a rule their rifles are not loaded with live ammunition. The Guardsmen may carry up to six rounds in a belt pouch and may load their rifles in event of a terrorist attack, but that would take valuable time. The two sentries beneath the clock tower at St James’s were temporarily withdrawn during the 1980s when the IRA threat level peaked, but The Mail on Sunday understands that this is the first time they have been redeployed permanently. Ken Wharfe, Princess Diana’s former bodyguard, said: ‘These officers are always stagnant, so an attack on them is very easy. 'Although the Queen’s Guards are there to protect the Royals, the actual security is done by the Met Police. 'But the Palace has always resisted getting rid of the Guards as they are part of the tradition. The Palace would have been consulted on this.’ Lord Carlile, the former Government watchdog on counter-terrorism, said: ‘I think the changes are measured and not an over-reaction.’ Chloe Howard, deputy editor of the popular Royal Central blog, said: ‘It is a shame, as it denies the public the chance of seeing these well-known uniforms that are part of the British identity. Some may think it is a retreat.’ Buckingham Palace and the Met Police would not comment on security matters, while the Ministry of Defence said: ‘We routinely review security arrangements.’","Security bosses have withdrawn Royal Guards from posts outside palaces amid fears of a 'lone wolf' terror attack .

"Children are being forced into hours of unnecessary classes by pushy parents trying to one-up each other, head teachers' chief Gail Larkin . Sending children to tutors for up to two hours after school is 'child abuse' and they should go and play in the park instead, according to the leader of a head teacher's union. Gail Larkin, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, said children were being forced to sit through hours of unnecessary tuition by pushy parents competing with one another. She added that instead of two or three hours spent in more classes after school, children would benefit from joining a swimming club, taking up ballet, or playing in the park instead. She also took a swipe at parents, saying part of the drive for extra tuition was down to adults being unwilling to help their children with homework. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, she said: 'I have children in tears because it is the day that they go to their tutor and they don't want to go. 'Putting your child in there for two or three hours after school, I think ""You poor thing"". The parents think they are doing something really worthwhile. I think it's child abuse.' 'It is part of parenting to help your children with homework, even if you're not very able yourself. We are too busy absolving parents of their responsibilities instead of supporting them.' Mrs Larkin, a former primary school headteacher in Surrey, singled out Explore Education, which has opened branches in Sainsbury's and shopping centres, for particular criticism. She said parents taking their children straight from school and leaving them there while they went shopping were torturing the youngsters. Private tuition has boomed in popularity in recent years as parents coach their children through tough school entrance exams. More than half of children are being tutored privately as parents fight to get them into the best schools, a study suggested last year. Some are as young as two. Instead of going to see a tutor after school, children would instead benefit from taking up ballet, joining the Scouts, or simply playing in the park instead, she added . Mrs Larkin has previously criticised parents who use forward-facing push chairs for depriving their children of social contact as they went for walks. She said children were arriving at school struggling to talk because parents were not having conversations with them because they were too busy talking on their phones instead. She also attacked 'runny mummy' prams, designed to be pushed along by parents while they jog along behind it. She also shot down Nick Clegg's policy of free school meals for pupils aged between four and seven, saying the idea was a 'nice soundbite', but in practice it was 'ridiculous'.","Gail Larkin said parents are trying to one-up each other with extra lessons .

"The challenges of childcare affordability looks to continue for parents as the cost of the service is set to rise up to 30 per cent over the next four years. Figures presented by the Department of Education predict parents who front up $100 a day for childcare would be hit with a rise of $40 by 2018, while parents forking out $80 a day would be paying $32 more within the same time frame, The Sunday Telegraph reported. It means fees will rise an average of 7 per cent every year over four years, with a total 29.1 per cent rise by 2018. Scroll down for video . Figures presented by the Department of Education predict parents who front up $100 a day for childcare would be hit with a $40 rise by 2018 . It comes after Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey's less than favourable budget update earlier this month which saw $2.4 billion more spent on childcare payments than expected 'on the back of more parents looking to participate in the workforce'. These growing costs means a handful of parents will breach the childcare rebate threshold for assistance to claim back 50 per cent of their out-of-pocket costs. Right now, parents are eligible to claim a maximum of $7,500 per child per year under the scheme, according to the Department of Human Services. To drive down the costs of the scheme, Mr Hockey said the government would 'announce a comprehensive families' package in the new year, including child care and parenting leave initiatives'. It comes after Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey's less than favourable budget update earlier this month which saw $2.4 billion more spent on childcare payments than expected . He said it would aim to give greater work participation opportunities for parents. In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, Shadow Early Childhood Education Minister Kate Ellis said these projections released by the Department of Education were another 'broken promise'. 'Tony Abbott promised to make child care more affordable, but families are facing bigger than ever expected increases in cost,' she said. 'This government is only good at one thing and that is breaking every promise they have ever made.' A national parenting advocacy group recently called on the government to redirect funds earmarked for Tony Abbott's paid parental leave scheme into early childhood education and care. A survey of 1,200 parents across the country done by The Parenthood found this was what 90 per cent of mums and dads wanted. Mr Abbott is looking to tweak this policy over the summer holidays in a bid to win Senate support next year. He has said the paid parent leave scheme, to be funded by a 1.5 per cent tax on big businesses, would involve more money for childcare after a previous version looked at a rebate for parents using carers in the family home. But The Parenthood spokeswoman Jo Briskley said the group's survey showed parents' biggest obstacle was finding affordable and quality childcare spots. 'Women are reporting that child care is just too expensive and that it's not worth working more hours or returning to work even though they want to,' Ms Briskey said. 'Only about 10 per cent of parents have said that money should go to subsidising nannies. 'That's because the vast majority of parents are seeking high quality, affordable childcare.'","Daily childcare fees will rise an average of 7 per cent over four years .

"'Diatribe': Jeremy Hardy has come under criticism from Radio 4 listeners for his 'extreme left-wing views' on his show . The BBC has admitted it finds it ‘very difficult’ to find Conservative comedians to appear on radio programmes in order to provide political balance. Radio 4’s comedy boss has claimed it is a ‘struggle’ to find performers regarded as having a right-wing point of view. The admission was made by Commissioning editor Caroline Raphael, in response to criticism from listeners over Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation, described as a new ‘Tory and coalition bashing comedy’. The content led many to complain to Radio 4 audience opinion show Feedback with one stating: ‘This programme appears to be a diatribe of Jeremy Hardy’s prejudiced extreme left wing views. It wasn’t clever and it certainly wasn’t funny.’ He added: ‘The BBC is a non-political organisation and yet it is paying for broadcasting what appeared to be a party political broadcast for the Communist Party’. Miss Raphael suggested that ‘possibly the right feels more comfortable with a pen and paper’ when she tried to explain the dearth of right-of-centre comedians on its shows. She admitted the problem is not that they do not exist but that they are not coming through. The BBC executive added that she was keen to find comics who can challenge the perceived left-wing domination of BBC comedy shows such as The News Quiz. In Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation, which airs in a prime evening slot, Mr Hardy repeatedly mocks Tory politicians describing David Cameron and George Osborne as a ‘horrible kind of posh’, saying they were ‘braying hoorays’.Among a string of anti-Conservative and coalition remarks, he also joked about the Tory party killing foreigners. One listener told Feedback: ‘I think anyone would be hard pushed to call the 30 minutes of incessant Tory and coalition bashing comedy. Just broadcasting such a left-wing biased show in a prime-time comedy slot is I am afraid fuel to all those who accuse the BBC of such bias.’ A member of the audience added: ‘Jeremy Hardy had me screaming at the radio I’m afraid to say. Next time for a bit of balance can we maybe have a right wing comedian if you can find one.’ Miss Raphael tried to defend the show saying the targets of satire would always be ‘those in power’, but admitted the BBC did have a problem finding comedians from a right-of-centre viewpoint. BBC Radio 4 Commissioning editor Caroline Raphael has claimed it is a struggle to find right-wing comedians . She told Feedback: ‘It is very difficult to find comedians from the right. I am not saying they aren’t out there. ‘Producers…spend a lot of time in the comedy clubs looking for people with a range of views.’ She said the broadcaster was ‘very open to names’, adding: ‘But we are not seeing them come through, there isn’t a tradition in terms of stand-up, possibly the right feels more comfortable with a pen and paper and the left standing up on a soap box, or in a comedy club.’ She added she was sure there was a PHD thesis in the subject, adding ‘but I do admit it is something we struggle with.’ Presenter of Feedback Roger Bolton suggested programmes like The News Quiz, which has been accused of being anti-Conservative and also features Jeremy Hardy, could take ‘note’ of The Now Show which is satirical about everyone. The News Quiz is regarded by many as being dominated by left-wing voices and has been accused of being biased against Tory politicians. But Miss Raphael said The News Quiz was very different from the other programme, because it relied on people’s ‘personal views’ while The Now Show was ‘very scripted’. The News Quiz has been trying to extend the range of its panellists including the number of women in recent times. The Radio 4 comedy chief said they were ‘trying people out’ and producers were working hard at extending the range of people. Among the names from a right-of-centre viewpoint who have been on the show in recent months is newspaper columnist Daniel Finkelstein. Speaking about the political balance on programmes, such as The News Quiz, she added producers often did not known exactly what people’s political views are as many comedian’s routines are ‘observational’ rather than about politics. The BBC boss added that while the corporation has a ‘responsibility’ for balance it did not mean you could not broadcast something ‘because you cannot find the opposite’.","Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation led to complaints from Radio 4 listeners .

"Flying off the shelves: More than a million children unwrapped a console this Christmas . Games consoles flew off the shelves at a phenomenal rate before Christmas, with shops around Britain shifting, on average, one machine every SECOND. That remarkable figure means that more than a million children unwrapped a console on the big day itself – no doubt as their indulgent parents gazed happily on. But parents expecting PlayStation 4s and XBox Ones to provide their offspring with puzzles to solve, or colourful worlds to explore, could be in for an unpleasant – and grisly – shock. While the high-powered consoles themselves offer more life-like play than ever before, most parents do not realise this means the violence and depravity featured in the best-selling games will be depicted in sickeningly realistic detail. There are games suitable for small children, but peer pressure means many of the teenagers who provide the core audience for video games will want to play the heavily promoted 18 Certificate products. Indeed, seven out of the top ten sellers this Christmas were either blood-soaked ‘first-person shooters’ (where players look through the eyes of a gunman) or gruesome horror titles. Even more concerning is the fact that the new consoles are built for online gaming and ‘voice chat’ via headsets – which can lead to impressionable teenagers being exposed to foul language and worse, regardless of which titles they choose. The recent murder of 14-year-old Breck Bednar was linked to a chat service that teenage killer Lewis Daynes used to ‘groom’ his victim, turning him against his friends and family before killing him. Both were dedicated players of the bloodthirsty war game Battlefield 4 and were part of an online group of fans of the game. Graphic: A table highlights some of the game console industry's most violent (and popular) games . One of the most notorious games is the British-made Grand Theft Auto V (GTA), which has been released in an ‘enhanced’ version. The game has been condemned as misogynist and sexually violent by many critics – and taken off the shelves by two leading Australian retail chains. The game contains scenes where players can have virtual sex with prostitutes then beat them up and steal their money, and a scene of torture where the player is expected to remove a gang rival’s teeth one by one using the joy pad, which vibrates as the victim begs for mercy. Groomed: Mail on Sunday report about killing of teenager Breck Bednar by a gamer . It also includes scenes where the player smokes marijuana, and takes the dangerous hallucinogenic drug peyote. There is also a brief instance of necrophilia. Yet GTA V is one of the top-selling computer games in the world. Vivienne Pattinson, director of anti-violence group MediaWatch said: ‘Grand Theft Auto is a violent game which allows players to be violent not just towards women but men too.’ However GTA’s depiction of female characters is broadly one-dimensional with women portrayed in the main as prostitutes, naggers or powerless damsels in distress. Ms Pattinson added: ‘Research published earlier this year found that hours spent playing violent video games was effectively stunting emotional growth. There are lots of games which are not violent and misogynistic but developers need to provide a product that will be talked about and sometimes pushing the boundaries is an easy way to do this.’ Modern computer games can take as much money to develop as Hollywood films – and violence is a sure-fire way to recoup that investments. One of the newest titles, Destiny, a first-person shooter with a science fiction theme, cost £320 million to make, but recouped its entire development budget on the first day of release. Last night Dr Jo Twist, chief executive officer of games industry trade body Ukie, said: ‘Games have clear age ratings and content descriptions. ‘In addition, all games devices, including mobiles, have parental controls to make sure age-appropriate content and games are played by younger players.’","One game console was selling every second in build up to Christmas .

"A million fewer shoppers turned out on Boxing Day compared to last year as Britain began to tire of discounts after more than a month of heavy promotions. Around seven million shoppers hit our high streets, shopping centres and retail parks on Friday, according to exclusive figures given to The Mail on Sunday. That was 12.4 per cent down on the same day last year as shoppers suffered 'sales fatigue', said market research firm Springboard. Scroll down for video . Experts say Boxing Day sales are dwindling in popularity because of the rise of Black Friday in November . There was a 12.4 per cent drop on Boxing Day this year  as shoppers suffered 'sales fatigue' Shoppers in Selfridges, in Oxford Street, hunted around for a bargain on Boxing Day . More turned out yesterday than on Boxing Day, but the overall numbers were down on December 27 last year. But the number shopping online on Boxing Day jumped 47 per cent on last year, said Postcode Anywhere, which tracks customer addresses. Experts warn Boxing Day is losing relevance as retailers focus on Black Friday in late November, pulling spending forward. In the US, Black Friday lures shoppers out the day after Thanksgiving. It was imported here three years ago by retailers including US online giant Amazon, and Asda, owned by US retail giant Wal-Mart. The stampede in online traffic meant that shops were quieter than in recent years . This year, chains such as John Lewis, Tesco and Currys followed suit, but many shops were caught out. Parcel firms said retailers underestimated demand, millions of orders flooding the system before they were ready. The shift meant mid-December was quieter than usual. 'Black Friday then led to a lull as shoppers only have so much money,' said Springboard's Diane Wehrle. After a rush on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, shoppers then took a day off. However, numbers visiting all retail locations from November 24 to Boxing Day rose 4.8 per cent. Shopping centres and retail parks led the increase.","Around seven million shoppers hit high streets and retail parks on Friday .

"A Central Coast man  is in a critical condition after being punched in the back of the head in a 'one-punch' incident outside a pub on the NSW central coast. The 24-year-old Wyong man was found unconscious by emergency services when they were called to the car park of the Woodport Inn, in Erina, around 12.45am on Saturday. Police were told that the man was punched in the back of the head by another man following an argument, causing him to fall and hit his head on the pavement. The 24-year-old Wyong man was found unconscious by emergency services when they were called to the car park of the Woodport Inn, in Erina, around 12.45am on Saturday . The Bonnal Rd establishment had been hosting Australian electro DJ Timmy Trumpet at the time of the incident, who labelled the act of violence 'heartbreaking'. 'It's truly heartbreaking to hear about something happening like this and my thoughts are with him, his family and his friends,' the DJ told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'I'm against violence in any capacity and incidents like this are exactly why,' he said. The young man was taken to Gosford Hospital with serious head injuries, and was later transferred to Royal North Shore Hospital in a critical condition. 'It's truly heartbreaking to hear about something happening like this and my thoughts are with him, his family and his friends,' said electro DJ Timmy Trumpet (pictured), who was playing at the venue . In 2013, the NSW Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing listed the The Woodport Inn as one of the 16 most violent venues in the state . A spokesperson from the hospital said that he remains in a serious but stable condition. Following investigations, a 22-year-old man was arrested at a home on Nirvana Street, Long Jetty. He was taken to Gosford Police Station, where he was charged with cause grievous bodily harm to person with intent. The man has been refused bail, to appear at Gosford Local Court on Sunday. In 2013, the NSW Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing listed the The Woodport Inn as one of the 16 most violent venues in the state, a title which was removed in 2014, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. The NSW government introduced new 'one punch' laws for unlawful assault, which came into effect on in January 2014. The sentence carries a 20 year maximum sentence for anyone who 'unlawfully assaults another who dies as a direct or indirect result of the assault,' said Government's website set up for the introduction of the laws. The young man was taken to Gosford Hospital with serious head injuries, and was later transferred to Royal North Shore Hospital in a critical condition . 'If the offender was intoxicated by alcohol or drugs, a minimum of eight years and a maximum 25 year sentence applies.' Police are appealing for public assistance to help identify the man involved, and have described the man as having a solid build, with a shaved head, wearing dark pants and a white shirt. Police are urging anyone with information in relation to this incident to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or use the Crime Stoppers online reporting page.","24-year-old man was punched to the back of the head in the car park of the Woodport Inn in Erina, on NSW Central Coast .

"Computer hackers could have the ability to take down the entire U.S. electrical grid within the next two years, the head of the National Security Agency has warned. General Keith Alexander expects the 'hacktivist' group Anonymous to be able to bring about a limited national power outage through a cyber attack. He has relayed his concerns over the growing threat during a White House meeting last week, reports the Wall Street Journal. Warning: General Keith Alexander expects the 'hacktivist' group Anonymous to be able to bring about a limited national power outage through a cyber attack . Although he has made no public statement regarding Anonymous in particular, cyber attacks represent an increasing security risk for the U.S. government. General Alexander has previously warned of the ongoing determination of hacker groups to expose institutional corruption, and now believes Anonymous is moving in a more disruptive direction. James Lewis, a cyber security specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who is currently researching the group, told the Journal: 'It's a real threat. You want to occupy Wall Street? How about turn Wall Street off? Even for a day.' Anonymous has never indicated a widespread power outage as a goal, and a post on a blog linked to the organisation claims the U.S. government is trying to discredit them. It reads: 'Anonymous attracted the attention of the National Security Agency. 'In private meetings at the White House, NSA director General Keith Alexander warned that in a year or two the group could attack the energy grid and shut off power for millions. 'Ridiculous! Why should Anonymous shut off power grid? Makes no sense! They just want to make you feel afraid.' Threat: The U.S. government now believes Anonymous is moving in a more disruptive direction . But last week Anonymous announced Operation Global Blackout, a plan to shut down the Internet on March 31. Security experts, however, rate the group's chances of taking the web offline as minimal. Anonymous' ability to take down the power grid is also thought to be slim. Grid officials say they regularly face cyber attacks on their systems, and invest a lot of time making sure they are as secure as possible. White House spokesman Caitlin Hayden said the government 'has made cybersecurity a top priority, and we are working tirelessly to protect ourselves from the threats we face, whether they come from other nations, cyber criminals, or from stateless activist hacker groups'. Earlier this month, Anonymous claimed responsibility for an attack on the CIA’s website that disabled it for nine hours. The group targeted the personal details of more than 46,000 people in attacks on government websites including cia.gov. Anonymous hackers also intercepted a highly-sensitive telephone conversation between Scotland Yard officers and the FBI and posted it online. As well as targeting the CIA, the hackers broke into several Alabama law-enforcement websites, stealing criminal records, addresses and social security numbers to raise awareness of ‘racist legislation’ affecting illegal immigrants. The group warned it would destroy the data, saying: ‘Because of the possible cost of lives and money to regular citizens, we are deleting this data and are seeking to make it known you not only have shown zero regard for immigrants, but for the very citizens that live in the great state of Alabama.’ Hackers claiming to be affiliated with Anonymous have launched a spate of attacks on law enforcement websites in recent weeks, hitting such cities as Salt Lake City, Boston, Syracuse, N.Y. and Greece. The collective of activists, pranksters and hackers have also targeted financial institutions such as Visa and MasterCard, as well as the Church of Scientology.",U.S. government believes Anonymous is moving in a more disruptive direction .
"A father has been charged with murder after the body of his two-year-old son was found dumped in a lake, police have revealed. Steven Blue, 31, is being held without bond following the death of Tristan Blue in Raleigh, North Carolina. Police announced on Thursday that Blue had been arrested following the disappearance of the child a day earlier from their apartment complex. Tristan Blue, two, went missing from his home in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Wednesday. His remains were then found in a lake, authorities revealed .

The boy's mother Briana Dangerfield, 25, was also charged with accessory after the fact, altering and destroying evidence and attempting to conceal the death of her son and a misdemeanor child abuse. On Friday a search operation launched by authorities in the area discovered remains believed to be of the boy in Beaver Dam Lake in North Wake County. According to WCNN, in a 911 called released by Raleigh police on Friday, the caller told the dispatcher she woke up 15 minutes previously to find the boy had gone. They added that there was a package outside the front door and was concerned because the youngster could not normally open the door to the property. A 911 caller told police that a package was left outside the home where the boy lived and he was not inside. They were concerned as he was normally unable to open the door . One member of the community told the station that those living near the apartment complex where the boy stayed were heartbroken at the news. 'It's a somber mood. Everybody is just kind of moseying around and doing the best they can. Of course there were plenty of police officers patrolling so everybody is just kind of in a downward type of mood.'

"The Ebola epidemic affecting West Africa is predicted to last a further 12 to 18 months, according to U.S. scientists. Epidemiologists have been creating computer models of the Ebola epidemic for the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Department. The model they have created is a far less optimistic estimate than that of the World Health Organization (WHO), which last month said it hoped to contain the outbreak within nine months and 20,000 total cases. Scroll down for video . Spreading: A child looks at a man  suspected of suffering from the Ebola virus, while holding his hand over his nose,  in a main street and busy part in Monrovia, Liberia, Friday, September 12 . Epidemic: The virus is rapidly spreading through impoverished and densely populated cities in West Africa . The New York Times reports that various researchers have said the virus could grow at a rate that could be closer to 20,000 per month. The WHO is sticking to its estimates, a spokesman said Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is doing its own projections which it plans to make public as soon as possible. The director of the CDC, Dr Thomas R Frieden, has said that the situation is worsening and earlier this month said it's 'spiraling out of control.' Unlike previous outbreaks which have been kept at bay due to their confinement to rural areas, the current Ebola crisis is spreading rapidly in densely populated cities such as Monrovia, Liberia's impoverished capital. The spread is rapidly gaining traction, with the most recent report from Liberia of 400 cases, double the number from the week before, reports The New York Times. As of September 7, there had been 4,366 Ebola cases in Libera, Sierra Leone and Guinea, including 2,218 deaths, more than half of them in Liberia. Fatalities: The dead body of a man who died early  Saturday morning in the poor neighborhood of Monrovia that locals call New Kru Town is taken away on Saturday September 13, 2014 in Monrovia, Liberia . International plea: The WHO said on Friday at least 500 foreign experts are needed to help deal with Ebola in West Africa . The WHO has also admitted that there is likely to be 'substantial underreporting of cases and deaths.' With the death toll from Ebola in West Africa rising sharply in the last week, the WHO said on Friday at least 500 foreign experts were needed. Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has also called on wealthy nations to send military medical teams to West Africa to boost healthcare systems that have been completely swamped by the disease. Cuba on Friday announced that it would deploy 165 medical personnel to Sierra Leone next month, the largest contingent of foreign doctors and nurses committed so far. The U.S. military said this week it will build a 25-bed, $22 million field hospital in Liberia to care for health workers infected with the virus. A Pentagon spokesman said it would be built by the U.S. military and handed over to Liberians to run. France has also said it would deploy 20 specialists in biological disasters to its former colony Guinea. Britain will also build and operate a 62-bed hospital in Sierra Leone. MSF has said, however, the pledges by Western government represent just a fraction of the beds required to cope with the disease. It estimates that hundreds of additional beds are needed in Monrovia alone, where Ebola patients have been turned away from overflowing clinics.","U.S. scientists say the Ebola crisis is worsening .

"From Turkish storytellers to the songs of the Aka Pygmies in Africa – there is certainly no shortage of contenders when it comes to finding the world’s most unusual cultural traditions. Many are now being officially endorsed by the United Nations’ Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco), with Belgium  recently launching a bid to have potato fries recognised as part of its cultural heritage. After being set up in 2008, the UN’s cultural agency has already approved 281 elements to its Intangible Cultural Heritage list. Scroll down for video . The Kırkpınar oil wrestling festival takes place in Edirne, Turkey, attracting thousands of spectators . The Intangible Cultural Heritage list includes Polyphonic singing of the Aka Pygmies of Central Africa . Differing from the more widely known list of World Heritage Sites, the aim is to ensure the protection of important and worldwide heritages and to raise awareness of their significance. Elements are added each year following submissions by national governments of UN member states. Each member is allowed to submit a single element to be assessed by Unesco. A panel of experts in intangible heritage and an appointed body, known as the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, then examine each of the nominations before officially inscribing the candidates as elements on the list. Added to the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage items in 2010, Spanish human towers are known as castells . The criteria rules that items can be added if they are deemed to be ‘an essential component and a repository of cultural diversity and creative expression’. Britain doesn’t currently have any items on the list, despite having 28 items of the list of World Heritage Sites, including Stonehenge and the Tower of London. Last year Morris dancers sought to protect the 157-year-old tradition under Unesco's Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Here are some of the world’s more off-beat traditions to have made the list: . The farmers’ dance of China’s Korean ethnic group is passed on by senior members to younger generations . The Korean ethnic group in north-eastern China offers a traditional sacrifice to the God of the Land . FARMERS’ DANCE OF CHINA’S KOREAN ETHNIC GROUP . Gathering in fields or villages during community festivals, members of the Korean ethnic group in north-eastern China offer a traditional sacrifice to the God of the Land to pay homage to nature and pray for good fortune and a plentiful harvest. The farmers’ dance of China’s Korean ethnic group is a popular folk practice passed on by senior members of a community to younger generations. Musicians play oboe-like instruments, bell-shaped gongs and a variety of drums. The dance is inspired by the motions of farming, which it imitates through gestures such as ‘walking the field ridges’. Castells are usually built during annual festivities in towns and cities in Spain's Catalonia region . HUMAN TOWERS OF SPAIN . Added to the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage items in 2010, Spanish human towers are also known as castells. They are human towers built by members of amateur groups, usually as part of annual festivities in Catalonian towns and cities. The traditional setting is the square in front of the town hall balcony. The human towers are formed by castellers standing on the shoulders of one another in a succession of stages, usually between six and ten. Each level of the tronc, the name given to the second level upwards, generally comprises two to five heavier built men supporting younger, lighter-weight boys or girls. The pom de dalt – the three uppermost levels of the tower – comprises young children. Anyone is welcome to form the pinya, the throng that supports the base of the tower. The knowledge required for raising castells is traditionally passed down from generation to generation within a group, and can only be learned by practice. Costa Rica's tradition of painting and decorating oxcarts started in the early 20th century . The traditional oxcart is the product of Costa Rica’s most famous craft dating from mid-19th century . OXHERDING AND OXCART TRADITIONS IN COSTA RICA . The traditional oxcart, or carreta, is the product of Costa Rica’s most famous craft. Dating from the mid-nineteenth century, oxcarts were used to transport coffee beans from Costa Rica’s central valley over the mountains to Puntarenas on the Pacific coast, a journey requiring ten to 15 days. In many cases, oxcarts were a family’s only means of transport; they often served as a symbol of social status. The tradition of painting and decorating oxcarts started in the early 20th century and originally each region of Costa Rica had its own particular design, enabling the identification of the driver’s origin by the painted patterns on the wheels. Each oxcart is designed to make its own ’song’, a unique chime produced by a metal ring striking the hubnut of the wheel as the cart bumped along. Since oxcarts have become obsolete as means of transport, there is a decreasing demand for them, which means that the number of artisans who possess the training to manufacture and decorate oxcarts has strongly declined over the past decades. Joking relationships are a social practice performed among ethnolinguistic communities in Niger . PRACTICES AND EXPRESSION OF JOKING IN RELATIONSHIPS IN NIGER . Joking relationships are a social practice performed among ethnolinguistic communities in Niger. They take the form of a playful taunting between two people from different communities. Relationships are often based on ancestral pacts forbidding conflict or war between specific communities, and imply that the members must love one another and provide assistance where needed. The members have a duty to tell each other the truth, to joke together and settle any dispute peacefully. Joking relationships are practised in public places, in the fields, offices, market places, at water sources and in the home, every day as well as on special occasions such as weddings, baptisms, ceremonies and funerals, commercial transactions, and cultural and entertainment events. Wrestlers fight for the Kırkpınar Golden Belt and the title of Chief Pehlivan in the popular event . KIRKPINAR OIL WRESTLING FESTIVAL . The Kırkpınar oil wrestling festival takes place in Edirne, Turkey. Thousands of people from different age groups, cultures and regions travel every year to see wrestlers fight for the Kırkpınar Golden Belt and the title of Chief Pehlivan. The golden belt is carried through the city in a procession, followed by prayers recited in the Selimiye Mosque. The 'oil man' oils the wrestlers and he is assisted by a towel holder, before the warm-up exercises and greetings. Each wrestler wears kıspet, thick trousers made of water buffalo or cow leather. Kırkpınar oil wrestling is open to men from all cultures, regions and ages without discrimination between religion, language or race. Pehlivans are considered exemplary figures in society with attributes such as generosity, honesty, respectfulness and adherence to traditions and customs. The whistled language of La Gomera Island replicates the islanders’ Castilian Spanish with whistling . The whistles can be distinguished according to pitch and whether they are interrupted or continuous . WHISTLED LANGUAGE OF THE ISLAND OF LA GOMERA . The whistled language of La Gomera Island in the Canaries, the Silbo Gomero, replicates the islanders’ Castilian Spanish with whistling. Handed down over centuries from master to pupil, it is the only whistled language in the world that is fully developed and practised by a large community (more than 22,000 inhabitants). The whistled language replaces each vowel or consonant with a whistling sound: two distinct whistles replace the five Spanish vowels, and there are four whistles for consonants. The whistles can be distinguished according to pitch and whether they are interrupted or continuous. With practice, whistlers can convey any message. Taught in schools since 1999, the Silbo Gomero is understood by almost all islanders and practised by the vast majority, particularly the elderly and the young. It is also used during festivities and ceremonies, including religious occasions.

MONGOLIAN KUNCKLE-BONE SHOOTING . Mongolians revere certain parts of bones of their domestic livestock and use them in religious rites, plays and traditional games. One such popular team-based game is knuckle-bone shooting. Teams of six to eight players flick thirty domino-like marble tablets on a smooth wooden surface towards a target of sheep knuckle-bones, aiming to knock them into a target zone. Each shooter possesses individually crafted shooting tools and instruments, and wears costumes embossed with distinguished characteristics depending on their rank and merits. The rituals, knowledge, skills, technique and expertise associated with knuckle-bone shooting, as well as the craftsmanship of tools, accessories and equipment, are transmitted through apprenticeship.","UN's cultural agency set up the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008 .

"Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, is leading calls for the terminally ill to be able to end their own lives . Eighty prominent public figures today call for the legalisation of assisted dying, warning that one Briton travels abroad each fortnight to end their own life. Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, author Ian McEwan, actress Zoe Wanamaker and a number of doctors tell political leaders that refusal to debate the issue in Parliament is ‘heartless’. They have signed a letter saying that all parties must commit to completing a process that would allow terminally ill people to take their own lives. The call for action follows the tabling of a bill by Lord Falconer, the former Lord Chancellor. This would permit doctors to prescribe fatal drug doses to patients who had no more than six months to live and had a ‘clear and settled intention’ to end their lives. Under current law, helping someone to take their own life could carry a jail sentence of up to 14 years. David Cameron has previously said that he would oppose plans to legalise assisted dying. If the issue is debated in Parliament, MPs will be given a free vote. Those leading the call for change include Sir Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools, who suffers from motor neurone disease. Sir Chris has previously told of how he considered starving himself to death following a diagnosis of cancer. In an interview with Sky News he said: ‘I mean one option that I considered this winter, when I was diagnosed with cancer and kidney stones in addition to the motor neurone disease which I already had, was to starve and dehydrate myself to death.’ Actress Zoe Wanamaker and author Ian McEwan and a number of doctors tell political leaders that refusal to debate the issue in Parliament is ‘heartless' Those leading the call for change include Sir Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools, who suffers from motor neurone disease, and actor Sir Patrick Stewart . Other signatories include author Julian Barnes, and philosopher AC Grayling. Hugh Grant, Sir Patrick Stewart, Jo Brand, Zoe Wanamaker and Eric Idle from the world of showbusiness have also backed the campaign. The letter to the Daily Telegraph reads: ‘If there is not enough time for the (Lord Falconer’s) Bill to complete its stages before the general election then it is imperative that Parliament continues this important debate afterwards. ‘Currently, one Briton a fortnight is travelling to Dignitas. For each person who travels abroad, ten terminally ill people are taking their own lives in this country. ‘The overwhelming majority of the public supports law change on assisted dying and no one believes that someone should face a prison sentence of 14 years for compassionately assisting a loved one to die.’ Comedians Eric Idle and Jo Brand have also signed the letter calling for a change in the law . Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Sarah Wootton, chief executive of the campaign group Dignity in Dying, said she was now sure that the law would be changed. She said: ‘We are fast approaching tipping point on the issue of assisted dying. It is now a question of how, not if, we change the law. ‘This letter has been signed by people across the political spectrum and from all areas of society, including those who have been directly affected by our cruel and outdated law. It is clear we can no longer let dying people suffer against their wishes and the next government has the opportunity to change this.’ The letter comes after an 86-year-old widow starved herself to death – an act she considered the only legal way to exercise her right to die. Jean Davies, a long-term right-to-die campaigner, had a range of health problems but was not terminally ill. She began refusing food on August 28 and died on October 1. The former maths teacher’s daughter, Bronwen, said at the time: ‘I was very angry when my mother first told me of her decision. ‘However, I recognised that this wasn’t about me. All the family did. We are all respectful of the fact that it was her life and her choice.’ Miss Davies added: ‘My mother was a fiercely independent lady who had the capacity to make this decision.’","Leading figures have signed letter calling for all parties to complete process that would allow terminally ill people to take own lives .

"A patient in Honolulu, Hawaii, has been placed in isolation with suspected Ebola, the Department of Health confirmed on Wednesday. Even though the disease is a possibility, the patient has not yet been specifically tested for it, but is displaying some symptoms. The Hawaii Nurses Association said the person is being treated at The Queen’s Medical Center. Scroll down for video . Measures for safety: 'We are early in the investigation of a patient — very, very, early, who we’re investigating that might have Ebola,' said Dr Melissa Viray, deputy state epidemiologist (pictured) A Transmission Electron micrograph of the Ebola virus spreading quickly across West Africa and slowly creeping its way into the United States .

Ebola symptoms can include fever, muscle pain, vomiting and bleeding, and can appear as long as 21 days after exposure to the virus .

Two suspicious factors would be if the patient had a fever and if he traveled to West Africa in the last 21 days. The Department of Health is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on this particular case to ensure that is it being handled with the utmost caution and care. 'We’ve asked the hospitals to tell us about is anyone with a travel history and anyone with a fever, and when those things come together, we’ve asked them to be very careful and in an abundance of caution while you’re working, for whatever else might be going on, also make sure you isolate against Ebola, just in case,' said Dr. Melissa Viray, deputy state epidemiologist. The patient is currently being kept in a regular room but anyone who goes in must wear protective gear. 'They’re monitoring who goes in and out of that room and making sure that everybody as safe as possible, while the patient is being evaluated for Ebola and what other conditions that patient might have,' Dr. Viray told KHON. The patient has symptoms that could be associated with Ebola. The hospital did not confirm if the patient was traveling in West Africa but they said that unless people are traveling in a place where Ebola is prevalent, their chances of getting the virus is very low. The Queens Medical Center does not have a specific Ebola room but it is prepared to handle the virus if the patient should have it. 'If someone showed up in the ER with suspected Ebola symptoms, they would immediately be placed in an isolation room,' Erlaine Bello, Queen’s Medical Center infectious disease specialist, previously told KHON2.

"Former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are worth between $10 and $50 million, according to their financial disclosure forms – but taxpayers will still pony up nearly $1 million this year to fund their post-White House lifestyle. Like the three other living former presidents, Jimmy Carter and the two George Bushes, Clinton receives a $201,000 annual pension. But that just scratches the surface of the government benefits he shares with his wife Hillary. The total for 2014 also includes $157,000 for staff salaries and benefits, $414,000 for office space and $9,000 for phone bills. In all, The Washington Post first reported, taxpayers are providing Clinton with $944,000 in post-presidential pay and benefits. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Overkill? Bill Clinton costs taxpayers nearly $1 million every year, five times what his salary was during his presidency . Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is scrambling to redefine her public image, with husband Bill saying Tuesday that focusing on their joint wealth is 'the wrong debate' to have as the 2016 election season approaches . Public art subsidy? Former president George W. Bush got $1.28 million in government payments and benefits this year while he painted portraits . Nice digs: Taxpayers shelled out $414,000 this year for Bill Clinton's office in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City . That tab was $1.28 million in 2002, the year after he left office, according to a Congressional Research Service report cited by the Post and the Washington Free Beacon. Hillary Clinton was lambasted in the press for saying on June 9 that she and Bill were 'dead broke' after their White House tenure. Her rhetorical play at poverty during an ABC News interview included the claim that she and Bill 'struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea’s education, you know – it was not easy.' The CRS report, issued in April, also noted that government payments and benefits for former President George W. Bush outstripped Clinton's in every full year since Bush left the White House. Bush the younger is costing taxpayers $1.28 million this year, and averages 4 per cent more annual than Clinton. The government's General Services Administration inexplicably budgeted $102,000 for Bush's telephone expenses in 2014, and planned to spend $135,000 more on furniture, computers, office supplies and other miscellany. The former president and first lady both tried to pivot away from the national frenzy over their elite financial status on Tuesday, with Bill Clinton saying that his wife is 'not out of touch' with the middle-class Americans. During an annual Clinton Global Initiative conference in Denver, he told event moderator David Gregory of NBC’s 'Meet the Press' on stage that discussing their millions is 'the wrong debate' to have in the run-up to the 2016 election season. Instead, according to Businessweek, he claimed the public should focus on how to counter the 'demise of the American dream.' He acknowledged that Hillary didn’t 'give the most adept answer' to questions about whether they were as wealthy as Republican politicians who have been tripped up by insinuations of upper-class snobbery. 'You can say, ""OK, I gotta clean that up,"" which she did,' he claimed. But 'it is factually true that we were several million dollars in debt,' Clinton said, and reporters 'should put this in some sort of context.' He also claimed that he had 'the lowest net worth of any American president in the twentieth century when I took office, but I still could have been tone deaf. And, you know, now I don’t. And we’ve got a great life and I’m grateful for it.' 'But I still, we go to our local grocery store on the weekend. We talk to people in our town. We know what’s going on. The real issue is, if you’ve been fortunate enough to be successful, are you now out of touch and insensitive to the agonizing struggles other people are facing?' Pivot: On Tuesday in Denver Bill Clinton tried to reposition his wife Hillary, the former secretary of state, describing her as a warrior for poor and middle-class Americans instead of a wealthy, out-of-touch elitist . At the same Denver event, Hillary Clinton repositioned herself as a warrior for the downtrodden, including poor children. Upward mobility 'really does take a village,' she said. Mrs. Clinton hasn't yet said whether she will run for president. Her . missteps in recent weeks, along with lackluster sales of her memoir . 'Hard Choices,' have become the first chink in what was thought to be an . unassailable political armor. The Former Presidents Act of 1958 provides one-time residents of the White House with pensions, office expenses, professional staff, coverage for medical care, and lifetime Secret Service protection. Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz tried to change the arrangement in 2012 with his Presidential Allowance Modernization Act, but it died in committee. The legislation would have capped the government's total spending on any former president to $400,000. And that amount would have been reduced dollar-for-dollar by any money they earned. Ka-ching: Bill Clinton and George W. Bush together collect more than $2 million each year in taxpayer money and benefits -- not including the cost of Secret Service protection -- and will continue that pace until they die . According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, George W. Bush costs taxpayers more in his post-presidency than any other former president . Under that scenario, Clinton would have received nothing this year and last year. His earnings for individual speeches reportedly can top $500,000. 'Nobody wants our former presidents living the remainder of their lives destitute,"" Chaffetz said at the time, 'but the fact is none of our former presidents are poor.' 'Reports actually indicate that between book tours and speaking fees, these men are making millions of dollars a year. There's little reason why American taxpayers should be subsidizing these former presidents when they're doing fine on their own.' Jimmy Carter, who left office in 1981, spends the least among the four living former presidents. His office space costs just $109,000 per year, and the GSA budgeted $466,000 for his total upkeep in 2014.","Bill Clinton said Tuesday his wife's claim that they were 'dead broke' after his presidency was 'factually true'

"They have survived hundreds of years and provide a fascinating insight into ancient civilisations, but papyrus scrolls are now being sold in online auctions, potentially putting the manuscripts at risk. The scrolls, some dating back as far as the 3rd century, are being sold on eBay for large sums of money, but experts fear that private collectors are damaging the precious papyrus. A 4.5in by 1.5in rectangular scrap of paper featuring 15 lines of Homer's The Iliad, jotted down by an Egyptian scribe in the 4th century, recently sold online for £16,000.

In another sale, a third century parchment sheet containing a section of Paul's Epistle to the Romans was bought at Sotheby's for £301,000, astonishing experts. While neither of these sales were unlawful, scholars fear some buyers are carving up larger scrolls to sell online for profit. Brice Jones, a papyrologist and lecturer in New Testament and Early Christianity at Concordia University in Montreal, told the Sunday Telegraph that private collectors were also damaging the ancient manuscripts. A 4.5in by 1.5in rectangular scrap of paper featuring 15 lines The Iliad, by Homer (marble bust pictured), sold for £16,000, astonishing experts . He said: 'The study of ancient papyri is a fascinating field of historical inquiry, because these artifacts are the fingerprints of real people from a bygone era. 'Each time I study a new papyrus, it is as if I am peeking over the shoulders of the scribe who wrote it, eavesdropping on a conversation that in many cases was meant to be private: an argument between a husband and wife, a divorce contract, an invitation to dinner, a letter between a father and son. 'But when private collectors acquire papyri for personal enjoyment and restrict scholarly access to them, the immediate consequence is that we lose valuable historical information that would otherwise advance our knowledge about ancient people.' One example Mr Jones used was that of the papyrus codex of the Gospel of Judas, which was stored in safety deposit box by its owner and then placed in a freezer as the collector believed that was the best way to preserve it. 'The results of these decisions were horrifying: the codex crumbled into many hundreds of tiny pieces and what was once a virtually complete codex was now badly deteriorated and difficult to restore,' Mr Jones said. The papyrus expert added that he spends hours trawling through auction websites, such as eBay, looking for scrolls being sold, as well as forgeries. An eBay spokesman said sellers on the website 'must ensure listings comply with our clear policy on artifacts. We work with regulators, law enforcement and other parties including the Egyptian Embassy to apply this policy, and if a listing of concern is identified we will require proof that it was legally exported and remove any listing where this proof is not provided.'","Papyrus scrolls have started selling online for thousands of pounds .

"Two alleged victims of a registered sex offender have filed a lawsuit seeking damages for pain and suffering after he won $3 million in a Florida Lottery jackpot.

Scroll down for video . Winner: Timothy Poole, a registered sex offender, won $3million from a scratch-off ticket . The lawsuit was filed by two brothers, who were ages 9 and 5 when Poole was arrested. In 2010, the Legislature eliminated a statute of limitations for victims of sexual battery younger than 16. Poole pleaded guilty to attempted sexual battery in 1999 after a 9-year-old boy claimed he was molested by the man in his bed . Poole, a driver and dispatcher for his mother's cab company, Triangle Cab, is a registered sex offender. In 1999, Poole was arrested following allegations that he sexually abused a 9-year-old boy. According to WKMG, Poole was accused of sleeping in the same bed as the boy and waking him up while he was sleeping to perform sex acts. He eventually pleaded guilty to attempted sexual battery after accepting a plea bargain and being required to serve ten years of sex offender probation. Four years later, in 2003, he has his probation revoked and was sent to prison for three years after he missed four of his required group sessions. Poole maintains that he is innocent. 'It may be hard for some to believe, but sometimes people are wrongly accused,' he said. 'I've known him for years and I've never seen any inclination of anything like that with him,' said his friend Floyd Snyder. 'He's a very positive person. Very kind. Giving. I think that's why he won. It's Christmastime and the dude deserves a break.' It is not illegal for convicted sex offenders to play or win the lottery in the state of Florida. As for what Poole plans to do with the money, it is being reported that he is looking to help his mother expand her cab company.","Timothy Poole of Mount Dora, Florida, won the money from a scratch-off ticket he purchased  in Mount Dora, near Orlando .

It was purposefully hit by a car early Friday morning, according to supporters of Brown and his family. The memorial was quickly rebuilt. The inflammatory comments from Zoll, a public relations officer, came when Washington Post reporter Jose A. DelReal called the department to ask whether they were investigating. Slain: The memorial was to Michael Brown, 18, who was killed in August in the Missouri town . In response to the query, Zoll said: 'I don’t know that a crime has occurred. But a pile of trash in the middle of the street? The Washington Post is making a call over this?' He later denied making the comments, but changed his story after an investigation from Ferguson Police Department investigators. His superiors placed him on unpaid leave while they decide whether to enact a more serious penalty. A press release announcing his suspension said that Zoll 'admitted to Department investigators that he did in fact make the remarks attributed to him, and that he misled his superiors when asked about the contents of the interview. 'The officer has been placed on unpaid leave, effective immediately, while disciplinary proceedings begin.' It added: 'The City of Ferguson wants to emphasize that negative remarks about the Michael Brown memorial do not reflect the feelings of the Ferguson Police Department and are in direct contradiction to the efforts of City officials to relocate the memorial to a more secure location.'","Timothy Zoll made dismissive remark while speaking to reporter .

"When Matthew Deane and his family moved into their Utah home, they were constantly harassed by teenagers throwing toilet paper at their house. The torment got so bad, their 15-year-old daughter decided to leave her school in the town of Oakley. So when some of the culprits were caught by the police, instead of pressing charges, they asked them to donate the rolls instead. Since then they have received more than 1,000, after the campaign spread on social media and the toilet paper throwing has stopped. Scroll down for video . A family who were tormented by toilet paper throwers when they first moved into their Oakley, Utah, home told the culprits to donate the rolls, now they have received over 1,000 after the campaign spread . Matthew and Liz Deane were harassed late at night for four months, but when police officers caught those responsible, they decided against pressing charges . Mr Deane said he would wake up to find up to 13 rolls draped over the trees in front of his family home . Talking to Fox 13, Mr Deane said that groups would throw up to 13 rolls on his house at a time. As it went on however, they started to bang on the windows in the early hours of the morning and would wake up to find his garden furniture torn apart. 'It was really frustrating because we didn’t know everyone involved, we didn’t know why,' he told the station. They felt invincible and we felt very vulnerable.' In early December, police officers caught some of the culprits during one of their 'papering' sprees. Mr Deane and his family decided that, instead of pressing charges, they should ask them to bring toilet paper to the house. People have driven to the family's home especially to hand over their paper, which is going to the nearby Kamas Food Bank . Mr Deane said he was happy that a bad situation had been turned around into one that was beneficial and of service to the local community . The harassment came to an end, and instead of winding up in the trees, the toilet paper will be donated to the Kamas Food Bank. Their idea then started to spread on social media, prompting others to donate their rolls. He told Fox: 'One man has driven up from Salt Lake twice with toilet paper. We had a really crappy situation and we took it and turned it into something nice and happy and beneficial and of service.'

"An explosive new book has claimed that the Queen Mother was 'insane and inebriated' during the final 20 years of her life. The book, a biography of the Queen Mother's steward William Tallon, also makes a number of allegations about the rest of the royal family, including accusations of drunkenness and swearing. But courtiers have hit back, with the Queen's cousin Margaret Rhodes, a former lady-in-waiting herself, describing the book as 'disgusting' and 'nonsense'. Scroll down for video . Explosive: The claims were made in a biography of the Queen Mother's steward William Tallon (right) 'One really would have hoped that the Queen Mother was above such allegations,' said Mrs Rhodes, 89, in an interview with the Sunday Express. 'To write such absolute nonsense about someone who is dead and unable to answer back is disgusting.' Backstairs Billy: The Royal Life of William Tallon is the work of historical novelist Thomas Quinn, whose oeuvre  includes works on angling and shooting as well as a series of memoirs based on the lives of aristocratic serving staff. In the blurb for the book, which is due to be published in March 2015, Quinn describes Tallon as 'charming, amusing, occasionally bitchy - and extremely promiscuous'. Tallon, who was known as Backstairs Billy and was the son of a shopkeeper, worked for the Queen Mother for more than 50 years. Memories: Mr Tallon, seen here dancing with the Queen Mother, worked for the royal for more than 50 years . Faithful: Mr Tallon, who died in 2007, never spoke about his royal employer during her lifetime . Close: Mr Tallon (pictured left at the Queen Mother's funeral) was left devastated by her death in 2002 . The equerry, who died in 2007, was still working for the royal when she died at the age of 101 in 2002. 'As a child growing up in relative poverty in Coventry, Billy thought working for the royal family would be hugely glamorous,' continues the blurb. 'As a teenager he sent letters to the royal household begging to be taken on. It was a shock, however, when he found himself barely out of his teens and working for a family that had two very different sides. 'As far as the public was concerned, the royal family was a model of reticence. But Billy saw the other side of a family whose members loved drinking and smoking, swearing and playing sometimes cruel practical jokes on each other in private. 'They hated anything serious and were constantly making jokes at each other's expense. The Queen Mother was especially good at all this, according to Billy. Nonsense: The Queen Mother's niece Margaret Rhodes has rubbished the claims, saying they are 'nonsense' Bitchy: According to the book, the royal family are fond of playing cruel practical jokes on each other . Hardworking: The Queen Mother remained a key part of the royal family following the death of George VI . Happy marriage: The Queen Mother and King George VI while still Duke and Duchess of York in 1926 . 'This was partly because she had a great sense of fun and partly because, for the last twenty years of her life, she was dotty to the point of lunacy.' It also goes on to claim that the reason the Queen Mother loved Tallon so much was because he knew how to make gin and tonics the way she liked them - 'nine-tenths gin and one-tenth tonic'. This, says Mrs Rhodes, is just one of the book's many inaccuracies - particularly because the Queen Mother 'never drank a gin and tonic, not ever'. 'She preferred a gin martini mix which she usually made herself,' continued Mrs Rhodes. 'She drank no more than one or two drinks of an evening but never drank too much. 'She was very conscious of her standing and knew what was proper of someone in her position to do and not to do. 'Of course she had a wonderful sense of humour. She laughed until she cried watching programmes like Dad’s Army and Keeping Up Appearances, but she wasn’t some party girl and she certainly didn’t go potty. Absolutely not. 'She could talk to anyone about anything, from rhododendrons to Persian poetry. She knew her onions, right until the end.' Buckingham Palace has been approached for comment.

"If it weren't for the threepointed badge, at first blush you might mistake it for a BMW. But this car, pictured right, is Mercedes-Benz's new GLE Coupe — its answer to arch-rival BMW's X6 sports utility vehicle. It's the latest 'niche' Merc to be unveiled and will be on sale here next June from around £53,000, following its launch at the Detroit Motor Show next month. M-B is going through something of an identity crisis with its naming structures. It says the GLE Coupe is based on its GLE SUV. This, in turn, was previously called the ML. The new GLE Coupe is to get sporty styling, improved suspension and gearing for a sportier drive . And even the ML was originally going to be called the M-Class, until BMW scotched that one by claiming rights to the 'M', on which its sporty M-Power range is based. I know this, because I was there and witnessed at close quarters the row that ensued at the Geneva Motor Show many moons ago when the prototype M-B M-Class was unveiled. I may even have caused it. It all blew up when I innocently asked a senior German BMW executive, with whom I was dining, what he thought about his rival's new M-Class, and showed him the press release and photo from the unveiling just an hour earlier. All hell broke loose as Dr Wolfgang Reitzle — number two in BMW globally at the time — dashed from the table to confer with his boss, Bernd Pischetsrieder, on the next table, and returned to say they were calling in the lawyers. That aside, the new GLE Coupe is to get sporty styling, improved suspension and gearing for a sportier drive, plus five different driving modes: Individual, Comfort, Slippery, Sport and Sport+. Each setting makes subtle or significant changes to the chassis, engine, suspension and steering systems, which will make the driving experience sportier or softer. Four-wheel drive is standard and there will be a new souped-up AMG Sport version, while the range is topped by the GLE 450 AMG, powered by a twin-turbo 3-litre V6 petrol engine developing 362bhp. The GLE 400 is a lower-powered version of the same engine, developing 328bhp. Best-seller, however, is expected to be the sole diesel, GLE 350d, powered by a 3-litre V6 turbo-diesel with 254 bhp. Expected options include Airmatic air suspension, 22 in alloy wheels (two inches bigger than standard), leather sports seats, and carbon-fibre trim. But it still looks rather like a BMW X6. Will the Munch company threaten to sue again, I wonder? Order books are open for a limited run of just 500 Fiat 500X 'Opening Edition' crossover models — with delivery in May. Two options are available. There'll be 325 examples of the two-wheel drive City Look and 175 of the more rugged all-wheel drive (AWD) Off-Road Look. The City Look comes with a load of kit including 'Art Grey' pastel paint; 18in alloy wheels, keyless entry and ignition and tinted rear windows. The safety pack includes laneassist, blind-spot and parking aids, a reversing camera and a collision mitigation system controlling the brakes. It is powered by a 1.4 MultiAir II 140bhp engine and priced from £17,595. Fiat says this price includes £1,725 worth of bonus equipment 'at no extra cost'. The beefier AWD version, available only in tri-coat 'Amore Red' is powered by the 2.0 Multi-Jet II 140bhp engine linked to a 9-speed automatic transmission as standard. It also has a long list of extras, including leather interior, rain and light sensors, powerfolding door mirrors, electrochromic rear view mirror, and steering wheel paddle shifters. Added to this are powerful HID headlamps, an adjustable cargo floor, front floor mats and 18in alloy wheels. There's a 3.5in screen to control the in-car entertainment and a 6.5in screen for the 3D satnav system. The model costs from £25,845. Volkswagen is taking orders for its first petrol version of the Polo BlueMotion, priced from £14,730 for UK deliveries from March. The German giant says the greenest petrol engine in the range is the frugal 1-litre BlueMotion TSI, pictured left, which averages 68.9mpg and emits just 94g/km of CO2. Yet it will still sprint to 62mph from a standing start in 10.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 119 mph. Volkswagen is taking orders for its first petrol version of the Polo BlueMotion, priced from £14,730 for UK deliveries from March . This 95bhp engine joins the three-cylinder diesel 1.4-litre TDI BlueMotion engine that produces 75 bhp and returns 91.1 mpg while emitting just 82g/km of CO2. The newcomer sports uniquely shaped front and rear bumpers, radiator grille, side skirts and rear roof spoiler, body coloured door handles and door mirrors with integrated indicators, front fog lights and special badging. It has a height-adjustable driver's seat, 15in alloys and even an in-built 'trainer' to give you hints and tips on how to drive in a more economical fashion by analysing journey patterns.","It's Mercedes-Benz's its answer to rival BMW's X6 sports utility vehicle .

"The family of Sir Winston Churchill pleaded with him not to convert to Islam, a newly-discovered letter from his future sister-in-law has revealed. The Prime Minister who led Britain to victory in the Second World War was apparently so taken with Islam and Oriental culture that his relatives wrote to try and persuade him not to become a Muslim. He had been exposed to the religion during his time serving in North West India and Sudan. Scroll down for video . In the note, written in August 1907, Lady Gwendoline Bertie, left, urged her future brother-in-law, right, to 'fight against' the desire to become a Muslim. Right: Churchill in India, where he was exposed to Islam . The letter, pictured above, was discovered by Warren Docker, a history research fellow at Cambridge University. In it she writes that Churchill has a 'tendency to orientalise Pasha-like tendencies' The revelation contradicts some of the beliefs expressed by Churchill in his own writings. In the note, written in August 1907, Lady Gwendoline Bertie - who would later marry his brother, Jack - urged Churchill to 'fight against' the desire to convert. She wrote: 'Please don’t become converted to Islam; I have noticed in your disposition a tendency to orientalise [fascination with the Orient and Islam], Pasha-like tendencies, I really have. 'If you come into contact with Islam your conversion might be effected with greater ease than you might have supposed, call of the blood, don’t you know what I mean, do fight against it.' The letter was discovered by Warren Docker, a history research fellow at Cambridge University, while researching his forthcoming book, Winston Churchill and the Islamic World: Orientalism, Empire and Diplomacy in the Middle East. He told the Sunday Telegraph that Lady Gwendoline's concerns may not have been unfounded as Churchill admired the military prowess and expansion of the Ottoman Empire. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, centre, sitting with his son Randolph, left, brother John Churchill, right, and nephew John. At one point, his family were concerned that he would convert to Islam . The future Prime Minister also took the progressive stance that Islam and Christianity should be viewed as equal. In the same year as Lady Gwendoline's letter, Churchill wrote one to Lady Lytton that read: 'You will think me a pasha [a rank of distinction in the Ottoman Empire]. I wish I were'. Dr Dockter said that Churchill had 'much experience on being in ""Islamic areas"" after serving in Sudan and on the North West frontier of India. But he added that his fascination was 'largely predicated on Victorian notions which heavily romanticised the nomadic lifestyle and honour culture of the Bedouin tribes'. There is also conflicting evidence of Churchill's own beliefs, as included in his book, The River War, right which was published in 1899. One passage focuses on his observations about Islam. Left: Winston Churchill . Churchill's true understanding was so limited that, during his term as colonial secretary in the early 1920s, he had to ask what the difference was between Shia and Sunni Muslims. Dr Dockter told The Independent that Churchill was never truly serious about converting. He said that Churchill 'was more or less an atheist by this time anyway. He did however have a fascination with Islamic culture which was common among Victorians.' There is also conflicting evidence of Churchill's own beliefs, as included in his book, The River War, which was published in 1899. One passage of the book focuses on Churchill's observations about Islam while serving during the Anglo-Egyptian reconquest of the Sudan. It reads: 'The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. 'Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. 'No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith.'","Sir Winston Churchill was fascinated with Islam and Oriental culture .

Leah Costa of Buckeye vanished with the unnamed boy December 24, according to her mother. That boy was found by police wandering down a desert stretch of Interstate 10 near Tonopah on Saturday evening. His clothing was tattered and he was dehydrated and disoriented. He told police he wasn't sure where he and Costa had been or where police could find the girl.

"A Chicago Cubs baseball player has been questioned over a nightclub shooting in which four people were injured. Starlin Castro, a shortstop for the team, was spoken to by officers in Monte Cristi, the Dominican Republic, over an alleged argument between Castro's younger brother and a government official. The shooting, which took place in the sportsman's home town, is the second in the town to which he has been linked this month. Arrested? Local law enforcement said Cubs player Starlin Castro was arrested and had his house raided after a shooting - but his agent denied either thing happened . 'Not even close': According to Castro's agent, the player had nothing to do with the incident and only went to police to explain as much . The player was one of six people detained by police, and his home in the town was also searched, according to a law enforcement spokesman. He said Castro has now been released. However, the player's agent said that he went to police of his only accord - with the sole intention of telling them he had nothing to do with it. He has denied he was arrested. Agent Paul Kinzer said: 'They said they had video and they knew he wasn't involved'. He told the Chicago Tribune: 'He said he wasn’t even close to [the shooting]. He doesn’t even know what happened. 'He just heard there was a fight and just left through the back door to go to his car and then he went to the police to make sure they knew he wasn’t involved.' The shooting occurred in the northwest province of Montecristi, where the 24-year-old Castro is from. Police said at least four people were treated at a hospital for injuries. According to local reports, one man is in serious condition after being hit in the abdomen. Police are investigating allegations that the shooting occurred after an argument between Castro's brother and the assistant of a government official. Castro's name was linked to a separate shooting in a different nightclub in early December - but the player appeared at a new conference to say he had already left a club when a the shots were fired. 'It's just they keep dragging his name into this and he had nothing to do with either incident,' Kinzer said. Kinzer said Castro had spoken with the Cubs and 'they aren't happy his name is involved' again.

"The colourful flash of a red squirrel in the trees is a spectacle few Britons have had the pleasure to witness. After more than a century of decline, experts say the plight of the native red squirrel may have finally turned a corner. Fewer than one in 20 of us in Britain have ever seen the distinctive animal, according to a recent RSPB survey. Research by Red Squirrel Northern England reveals that the animals have been spotted in parts of the Yorkshire Dales, the North Pennines and Lancashire for the first time following a century of decline . But it could be an increasingly common sight after conservation work has helped the native species make a comeback in areas where it has not been seen for years. Research by Red Squirrel Northern England reveals that the animals have been spotted in parts of the Yorkshire Dales, the North Pennines and Lancashire for the first time in decades. The success is mostly down to a huge effort to control invasive grey squirrels, which were introduced to Britain from America in 1876 but carry a pox virus that is fatal to its red cousin. As a result grey populations grew to 2.5 million while the number of red squirrels fell to 120,000 – mostly in Scotland. Just 15,000 remained in England – mainly in northern areas like the Lake District and Northumberland. None exist in the South, apart from isolated pockets on the Isle of Wight and Brownsea Island, Dorset. However, conservation work has helped boost populations, which grew by seven per cent last year. Prince Charles (pictured) recently ordered a cull of grey squirrels on his Duchy of Cornwall lands . The latest work reveals that the number of reds in the North held steady – but they have expanded their territory. New sightings this year include Upper Swaledale in Yorkshire, Teesdale in County Durham and Ormskirk in Lancashire. Despite the grim historic trends, experts say efforts to control and cull greys is paying dividends. Colonies are stable in Cumbria and Northumberland, according to Red Squirrel Northern England. Nick Mason, project manager at Red Squirrels Northern England, told the Daily Mail: ‘In several areas, red squirrels appear to be re-establishing range long since lost. ‘Time will tell how persistent these new pockets of red squirrels are but they are all close to areas where high quality conservation work is in place. We think this is really exciting!’ A recent Liverpool University study found some red squirrels in northern England may be becoming immune to the squirrel pox virus. The more likely reason for the boosted figures are huge efforts to control greys. Dr David Bullock, head of nature conservation at the National Trust, said: ‘It looks like we might be turning a corner with red squirrels. There is optimism, cautious optimism, but definitely optimism. ‘Personally, I have never been more positive about the future of red squirrels. It is down to some really hard work. ‘This doesn’t mean that we can be complacent. We still need to manage grey squirrels and there are huge areas of Britain where we have no red squirrels at all.’ Fewer than one in 20 of us in Britain have ever seen the distinctive animal, according to a recent RSPB survey . He added: ‘Removing grey squirrels seems to be key. We have seen that when you remove grey squirrels, you get red squirrels coming back - it is that simple.’ Prince Charles recently ordered a cull of grey squirrels on his Duchy of Cornwall lands, and the Government is encouraging others to follow suit. The Forestry Commission agrees that controlling grey squirrels is essential if red squirrels are to thrive. Earlier this month it published a new policy offering landowners grants of £100 a hectare to shoot grey squirrels. It has also insisted that landowners have a plan in place to reduce grey squirrel populations if they want to apply for other woodland funding. The Forestry Commission had considered making it a legal requirement that all landowners shoot a certain number of grey squirrels a year, but that plan was ruled out after a public consultation. The new policy says ‘incentives’ are key to reduce grey squirrel populations. It adds: ‘Where grey squirrels are causing problems, land owners and managers are critical to the success of policy implementation by taking responsibility for controlling grey squirrels on their land.’","After century in decline experts say red squirrel may have turned corner .

"The chipped vase, pictured, sold for £634,000, after an expert identified it as a Chinese relic . A chipped vase a couple kept artificial flowers in has sold for £634,000, after it was discovered to be an 18th century Chinese relic. The unnamed husband and wife inherited the damaged vase from the woman's late father and were 'completely oblivious' about is origin and value. They emailed an auction house photos of some 'modest' antiques they were considering selling, including one of the 16 inch tall pea green vase. And an expert immediately identified the porcelain vase as unique and made in the 18th century for one of the palaces of the Chinese Emperor Qianlong. A large chunk of the rim had broken off some time in the 19th century and then crudely fixed using staples. It it not known how and when the famille rose and calligraphic vase left China but it was bought at a sale in the 1960s by the owner's late father. She and her husband inherited it and kept it in the corner of their lounge to put fake flowers in - and they were thrilled when the auction house put a pre-sale estimate of £10,000 on the piece. And with bidders lined up from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Canada on the day of the sale, the price soon shot up to £100,000 before escalating to a final hammer price of £520,000. With fees added on, the total price paid for the item was £634,400 - and it is thought the sale price would have been at least double the amount had the vase been in good condition. A large chunk of the rim had broken off some time in the 19th century and then crudely fixed using staples . Tom Rowsell, of auctioneers Toovey's of West Sussex, said: 'It is like a lottery win for the couple. 'I sent them an email an hour after the sale to give them the good news. They replied and asked if I had added on some zeros by mistake. 'They were delighted. The Chinese market is incredibly strong at the moment and this sale demonstrates some of the phenomenal sums people are happy to pay.' The vase once made up a small group of highly-desirable wares bearing Emperor Qianlong's own poetic text and seal mark on the bottom. The emperor's words praise the merits of four native flowers relating to the seasons in China; peony for spring, lotus for summer, chrysanthemum for autumn and plum blossom for winter. It is thought the sale price would have been at least double the amount had the vase been in good condition . Mr Rowsell added: 'The owners didn't really know anything about it, it was just something the woman's father had picked up at some stage at a charity sale in the 1960s. 'He would have paid an unremarkable sum for it because he never hinted that it was valuable. 'The vendors were completely oblivious to its significance. 'They stored dried flowers in it and tucked it away in the corner of their lounge. 'I was scrolling through eight or nine emails including theirs and suddenly a picture of this vase appeared. It was obvious that it was a very high quality piece. 'I picked up the phone straight away and left a message to say that I thought it could be special, despite the chips and damage to it. 'A couple of days later the couple brought the vase in a box wrapped in bubble wrap. As soon as I unpacked it it was quite apparent they had a very valuable piece. 'Because of its damaged and repaired condition we gave it a conservative estimate which the vendors were delighted with. 'They are recently retired and this large sum of money is an ideal retirement present for them.'","Couple inherited damaged vase and were unaware of its true value .

"CERN's Large Hadron Collider will be restarted in March after a £97 million upgrade that could help solve some of the universe’s greatest remaining mysteries. The world's biggest particle collider, located near Geneva in Switzerland, has been undergoing a two-year refit. Its two proton beams — each with a diameter less than a third that of a human hair — will now contain energy equivalent to the detonation of 154 tons of TNT. Scroll down for video . Upgrade: The LHC's computer screens are dark, but behind the scenes, work  gave the vast machine a mighty upgrade, which will enable the collider to advance the frontiers of knowledge even farther . CERN: A worker stands below the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), a general-purpose detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, during maintenance works . It was shut down in February 2013, and will be turned back on in March 2015 - at double power, scientists revealed. Experts believe that the souped-up power  will allow them to explore aspects of high-energy physics — such as dark matter, the suspected existence of new fundamental particles and gravity. It may even be possible to produce microscopic black holes. In 2012, a less powerful version of the collider confirmed existence of the Higgs boson particle, 'the God particle' which explains how fundamental matter took on the mass to form stars and planets. It led to worldwide fame for Peter Higgs, an emeritus professor of physics at Edinburgh university, who first suggested it existed and shed tears as he was awarded the Nobel prize for physics. That discovery was a landmark in physics but there are still plenty of other mysteries to be unraveled, including the nature of 'dark matter' and 'dark energy'. Mystery: How the LHC could delve into the universe's deepest secrets and reveal the hidden mysteries that have baffled scientists . New frontier: When experiments resume in 2015, scientists at CERN will use its enhanced power to probe dark matter, dark energy and supersymmetry . Scientists: A year ago, the world's largest particle collider made one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science, identifying what is believed to be the Higgs Boson -- the long-sought maker of mass . Work is now 'in full swing' to start circulating proton beams again in March, with the first collisions due by May, the European Organization for Nuclear Research said. 'With this new energy level, the (collider) will open new horizons for physics and for future discoveries,' CERN Director General Rolf Heuer said in a statement. 'I'm looking forward to seeing what nature has in store for us.' CERN's collider is buried in a 27-km (17-mile) tunnel straddling the Franco-Swiss border at the foot of the Jura mountains. The entire machine is already almost cooled to 1.9 degrees above absolute zero in preparation for the next three-year run. The old machine had several drawbacks. However, there are many other unsolved questions that could now be answered. DARK MATTER . Mysterious dark matter is one of the greatest mysteries in modern astrophysics. It cannot be seen directly with telescopes; and it does not emit or absorb light. The total mass–energy of the known universe contains 4.9 per cent ordinary matter and 27 per cent dark matter and 68.3 per cent dark energy. Experts believe that the souped up power of the collider will allow them to make dark matter. HIGGS BOSON . The existence of the Higgs boson was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. Theory has it that as the universe cooled after the Big Bang, an invisible force known as the Higgs field formed. This field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles – or Higgs bosons. As other particles pass through it, they pick up mass. In 2012, a less powerful version of the collider confirmed existence of the Higgs boson particle, which explains how fundamental matter took on the mass to form stars and planets. ANTI MATTER - Antimatter is material composed of antiparticles, which have the same mass as particles of ordinary matter but have opposite charge and other particle properties such as lepton and baryon number, quantum spin, etc. There should be as much anti matter as matter but it has disappeared. Now scientists hope that the LHC could locate it. Energy: The LHC's particle collisions transform energy into mass, the goal being to find fundamental particles in the sub-atomic debris that help us to understand the universe . As engineers focus on the technical mission, physicists are sifting through data that the mighty atom smasher has churned out since 2010 . These include the relative lack of antimatter in the universe, when equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created in the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, and the possible existence of other new kinds of particles. Tara Shears, a physics professor at the University of Liverpool said: 'We have unfinished business with understanding the universe.' Shears works on one of the four main experiments at the collider. CERN's work can baffle non-scientists, but researchers want to find ways to make it simple to understand the work done by the large Hadron collider. The new collider uses magnets to accelerate subatomic particles called protons to near light speed. Each proton has similar energy to that of a small fly, but each bunch contains 115 billion protons and has as much energy as a 330 pound motorbike travelling at over 90 mph. There are 22,208 bunches in each beam and two beams travel in opposite directions through the tunnel and have the equivalent energy of the Eurostar train at maximum speed. Scientists aim to smash the beams together inside detectors to recreate conditions similar to the conditions existing after billionths of a second after the Big Bang. The latest Large Hadron Collider (LHC) replaced the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP), which ran from 1989 to 2000. It came online in 2008, but ran into problems, forcing a year-long refit.","The world's biggest particle collider is located near Geneva, Switzerland .

"The Circus Chimera was closed down in 2007. Its founder and operator, Jim Judkins, could no longer establish work visas for his many international performers - mostly from China, South Africa and Russia - following legislative changes, and was forced to stop the tour he had done for almost 10 years. However the circus will forever live on thanks to photographer Norma I. Quintana. The one-ring show started in 1998, and the following year visited Napa, California, where Quintana lived at the time. She quickly became obsessed, wanting to know more about the people involved, and, with Judkins blessing, following the circus every summer from that year right up until the end. Scroll down for video . Under the big top: The Circus Chimera toured America from 1998 and 2007, and California photographer Norma I. Quintana traveled with them every summer . Inside look: Quintana was given unprecedented access to the one-ring show . Behind-the-scenes: Quintana said she wanted to capture a more human side to the circus people . Family act: Some of the families involved started their children in the circus young . As her knowledge of the circus life grew, Quintana realized Chimera was different. While other shows were strict about hiding their performers until it was time for them to be in the big top, Chimera was open. 'It felt like home in the back,' she told CNN. 'They were with their children, having cookouts, repairing costumes. 'This experience was very different from the others.' Over the years performers would come and go, but the circus remained the same despite its changes in acts. Each summer Quintana would shoot behind-the-scenes in black-and-white using only natural light. As a mother herself, she was drawn to the parents in the show and how they managed their children. 'They had the ability to strap their kids in the stroller, do these death-defying acts, then put on their shoes and return to the trailer,' Quintana said. Afternoon nap: Quintana has published her images into a book called Circus: A Traveling Life . Child star: As a mother herself, Quintana was particularly interested in the parents and their kids . Multi-tasking: . Candid: Quintana's photo book contains almost 100 black-and-white portraits . Life and times: Quintana photographed the circus until the end of its run in 2007 . Quintana said that, while the circus folk were fine with being photographed, it was initially difficult to get them to act the way she hoped because 'they immediately act', she told The Huffington Post in October. 'I wanted to provide more of a human side to it—a sense of family and tradition and culture and love of performance,' she said. Quintana would usually go to the shows and then leave at night. Sometimes she stayed with them if it was too late. 'I dreamt of having my own trailer, but usually I’d leave when the lights would go down,' she told The Huff Post. 'I did it even when my kids were little. 'My family thought I’d lost my mind.' For more information Quintana's work, visit her website, www.normaiquintana.com .

"Famous Anglophile Sir Robert Menzies loved Britain dearly and it's certainly no stretch to say that before he made history as Australia's longest-serving Prime Minister he had seriously contemplated a career in UK politics. However, his allegiance to the Mother Country was sorely tested in 1956 by his British counterpart, Sir Anthony Eden, during the Suez Canal crisis. The Suez Crisis pre-dated the Cold War. It became a flash point in the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States, and Australia's most revered leader was caught up, smack-bang in the middle. It's a story outlined in the latest book on the political life of Sir Robert, 'The Menzies Era', written by another former PM, John Howard. Robert Menzies and Queen Elizabeth at a Canberra reception in 1954. Australia's longest serving PM always had a close affinity with the royals and the UK . The early political days. Robert Menzies walks through a guard of honour in 1941 at Rose Bay in Sydney . The stand-off over the Suez was sparked by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser move to take control of the canal - so pivotal to global trade at the time - from Britain and France . In his book, Mr Howard calls the Suez crisis as 'a series of events variously described as the last gasp of the British Empire, a meltdown in trust between the United States and Great Britain, a crisis that destroyed the career of British Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden .. a worldwide political drama that saw, for a time, our own prime minister, Robert Menzies, at its very centre'. The stand-off over Suez was sparked after Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser moved to take control of the canal - so pivotal to global trade at the time - from Britain and France. The West then started to consider how it could wrest back the trade route from Egypt, according to Mr Howard's account. Middle Eastern strongman, Gamal Abdel Nasser, the then Egyptian President, successfully called the western powers' bluff over their warnings of military action over control of the Suez Canal, much to the detriment of Robert Menzies at a pivotal meeting . This scene is of an Advisory War Council, which brought together no less than five Prime Ministers and a Governor General. Standing (l to r) Norman Makin, Percy Spender and Arthur Fadden. Seated (l to r) Jack Beasley, Billy Hughes, Robert Menzies, Lord Gowrie, John Curtin and Frank Forde . Some big political names go for a stroll outside Old Parliament House in Canberra with Menzies (far left) joined by Lyons, Harrison, Holt and White . Nearing the end of his long reign, this is the Menzies ministry photographed prior to the 1963 election . Western nations met in London for crisis talks, with US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles taking the lead in early negotiations. However, Dulles soon withdrew from the talks, telling his President Dwight D. Eisenhower he was to return home as 'it is preferable that we (the United States) become less conspicuous'. At that time the US economy was not reliant on trade through the canal, unlike much of Europe. The Americans also knew the Brits were far from financially secure post World War II, and that a crisis over Suez could potentially help the United States’ position as the world's growing superpower. Menzies had been due to return to Australia from a meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London but as the drama over Suez began to unfold, he decided to personally take control of Australia's role in the discussions. The Indonesian President Sukarno introduces his young daughter Megawati to Robert Menzies and Dame Pattie in 1959. She would go on to also become president of Indonesia . Sir Robert Menzies was a devoted cricket follower and is pictured here with Sir Donald Bradman (far right) and the England captain of the day in 1963, Ted Dexter. They are seen in Canberra for the traditional PM's XI match . Whether the UK was miffed at Menzies' insistence that, while Australia would support the UK in action against Egypt, it would be without troops, is unclear. What is certain, though, is that the Brits were not pleased when Eden's request for an Australian warship to be placed in Yemen was met with no more than 'a cagey response'. With Dulles' departure, it was Menzies who was charged with delivering a plan devised during an international meeting in London to Nasser. The plan included the potential for US-backed military action. However, Eisenhower publicly denounced the use of force and Menzies was effectively left with a document not worth the paper it was written on. An increasingly brusque Nasser knew that 'Eisenhower had given Nasser a green light to rebuff Menzies,' Mr Howard wrote in his book. Larger than life. Menzies holding a cartoon of himself . And worse was to follow for Menzies. He continued to back the British cause but with one eye still fixed on the Americans. Subsequently he was sidelined when Britain, France and Israel agreed on a bizarre cloak and dagger proposal, in which the latter would invade Egypt, providing a pretext for the British and French to issue a cease-fire ultimatum to both Israel and Egypt. 'This agreement was recorded in the Sevres Protocol, which remained secret for many years,' wrote Mr Howard. Ultimately, Egypt refused the ultimatum and an Anglo-French invasion of Egypt then took place, sparking international condemnation, championed by the US, and leading to a cowering withdrawal. The debacle broke Eden, who resigned. In summarising the event, Mr Howard made very clear that he believed Eden had been less than frank with his ally in Menzies. 'Even allowing for the less discreet and rapid communications at that time, Eden's failure to consult Menzies before the issuing of the ultimatum to Israel and Egpyt was poor treatment of a loyal ally,' he wrote. John Howard is Australia's second longest serving PM, behind only Sir Robert Menzies. His book 'The Menzies Era' is a candid account of those years in Australia . 'Suez was significant for Menzies,' wrote Mr Howard. 'It placed him in the world spotlight as the man who presented the proposal for international control of the canal to Nasser. Always a tough brief to argue, it became impossible once Eisenhower had pronounced, ""we are committed to a peaceful settlement of this dispute, nothing else.""' 'Most distressing of all to Menzies was the poisonous atmosphere that developed between London and Washington over Suez; it challenged a world view which had governed his thinking for a decade,' stated Mr Howard. 'To him there would never be tension between his Anglophile instincts and his realistic acceptance that America now dominated the free world, because those two ""great and powerful friends"" would always be of one mind on important international issues. But they were not so on Suez.' 'The Menzies Era' recalls the longest unbroken period of government for one side of politics in Australia's history .","Sir Robert Menzies was caught in the middle of a power play by the US and Britain over the Suez Canal crisis in 1956 .

"The Queen and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been voted as the public figures who provide Britons with 'moral leadership' according to a poll. The findings released in a YouGov survey suggested that Britons looked towards the actions of  the Royal family ahead of church leaders like the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. The poll surveyed 2,109 adults and asked respondents to choose three or four names from a list of public personalities who they believed showed strong moral leadership. Moral: The Queen was voted as the public figure who gave Britons the most moral leadership . Poll: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge got 30 per cent of the vote in the YouGov poll . Guidance: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, pictured, was not seen as providing 'moral leadership' The Queen -- 34% . Duke and Duchess of Cambridge -- 30% . Malala Yousafzai -- 19% . Archbishop of Canterbury -- 15% . David Cameron --8% . At least 34 per cent chose the Queen and she was followed by her grandson Prince William, and his wife Kate who snagged 30 per cent of the vote. It's a far cry from the scandals which dogged the Royals in the 1990s when a series of divorces and the death of Princess Diana threatened to eclipse the monarchy. The Royals, however, were closely followed by Pakistani teenager Malala Yousafzai, who gained international notoriety when she was shot by the Taliban for going to school. She received 19 per cent of the vote. And was recently honoured when she became the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, at a ceremony in Oslo on December 10. Winner: Children's rights activists Malala Yousafzai, 17, became the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, earlier this month, and is seen as 'moral' The Pakistani teenager was ahead of Justin Welby, who only came in fourth place in the poll. But the findings come as The Church of England revealed it attracts fewer than 800,000 worshippers to its churches on a typical Sunday. The amount of people sitting in the pews has fallen to less than half the levels of the 1960s. The signs of continuing decline in support for the CofE followed census evidence of a widespread fall in allegiance to Christianity. Meanwhile, British politicians did not do very well as  champions of moral leadership, the poll revealed. British Prime Minister David Cameron only managed to get fifth place, with 8 per cent of the vote. Labour leader Ed Miliband landed 15th place with just 5 per cent of the vote. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage, of Ukip, got 39 per cent of the vote for worst moral leadership.","The poll surveyed 2,109 adults who chose from a list of public figures .

"For patriotic Scots, home-produced smoked salmon is as cherished a part of the national heritage as Nessie, kilts and Robbie Burns. But now, in an astonishing cross-border power grab, politicians in Westminster are seeking to claim the delicacy for England. Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss has said she believes ‘London Cure Smoked Scottish Salmon’ should have the same legal safeguards as other famous food products such as Melton Mowbray pork pies and Cornish clotted cream. Politicians in Westminster are seeking to claim Scottish smoked salmon because of the curing process invented in the East End of London . Not surprisingly, the campaign – the first such bid by the capital – has not gone down well with the Scots, and is likely to leave leading figures north of the border, such as former First Minister Alex Salmond, distinctly unimpressed. The claim for London, by reputed firm H Forman & Son, is based on the ‘delicate taste and texture’ created by a special smoking cure that has been used in the East End since the 19th Century. The company’s owner, Lance Forman, said he was delighted to be involved in the application, which would give his company’s product ‘protected food name status’. But Tom Campbell, who founded Fencebay Smokehouse in Fairlie, Ayrshire, more than 25 years ago, said: ‘Most people recognise that Scottish salmon is the best in the world. I don’t think too many will be swayed by it having London in its name.’ The claim for London, by reputed firm H Forman & Son (pictured), is based on the ‘delicate taste and texture’ created by a special smoking cure . In supporting the application, Ms Truss said: ‘The marriage of a generations-old curing process born in London’s East End and quality Scottish salmon is testament to this country’s amazing food culture.’ Last night a Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ‘We will pay close attention to any application for protected food names that relate to Scottish products.’ A Defra spokesperson said: 'This EU scheme is open to any part of the UK that produces food or drink in a unique fashion distinct to a geographical area - this Government will continue to support any applicants who meet the relevant criteria. 'We were pleased to have supported the successful Scottish Farmed Salmon bid for Protected Food Name status, along with a number of other successful Scottish bids in recent years.'","Westminster politicians seek to claim Scottish smoked salmon for England .

"As the search for missing AirAsia flight QZ8501 resumed on Monday morning Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop pessimistically admitted that 'our worst fears may be confirmed', however the government has sent help anyway. The Foreign Minister admitted that hope that the saga would reach a happy conclusion was fading fast with each passing hour. But despite this, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) deployed a Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft from Darwin to assist in the search on Monday morning. 'Whilst we hope for the best, as time goes on I’m afraid our worst fears may be confirmed,' Ms Bishop warned. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has told the Indonesian president that Australia has an aircraft ready to go and will do whatever is possible to help with the search for missing Air Asia flight QZ8501 . Defence Force boss, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, said the ADF was still willing to help in the search for Air Asia flight QZ8501, and that the Orion aircraft was perfect for the job. 'The Orion aircraft has a well proven capability in search and rescue and carries maritime search radar coupled with infra-red and electro-optical sensors to support the visual observation capabilities provided by its highly trained crew members,' Air Chief Marshal Binskin said. A Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion has been deployed from Darwin to help with the search for the missing AsiaAir flight . Ms Bishop emphasised that discussions are continuing with her government and Indonesian authorities to confirm if there were any Australian dual nationals on the missing AirAsia flight. The plane was carrying 162 people when it went missing in bad weather on its way from Indonesia to Singapore, and Ms Bishop told The Today Show that the nationalities of the passengers involved were still being double checked. 'We understand there are no Australian citizens on board. We are looking for details of any potential dual nationals or permanent residencies or any linkages with Australia. At this stage we don't have those details but we are accessing the manifest from authorities,' Ms Bishop said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has already pledged Australia's support and has called Indonesian president Joko Widodo to offer assistance. Mr Abbott told the Indonesian president Australia would do whatever 'we humanly could' to help. Ms Bishop also said she had spoken to Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi and expressed similar sentiments in support and assistance for Indonesia in any way. 'I know Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi from MH17 days, because she was Indonesian's Ambassador to the Netherlands when Indonesia lost 12 people on board MH17,' she explained. A massive search and rescue operation began for the plane with fishing boats and official vessels being sent out by Indonesia's national search and rescue authority. Helicopters and Hercules aircraft from Singapore were also sent out to search for the plane, with efforts focusing around the area of the Java Sea near Belitung. However the efforts have been halted until sunrise due to poor visibility. Mr Abbott said he was sorry to hear about the tragedy, especially the many families who would be left bereft by the loss. Ms Bishop earlier said she called her counterparts in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea, all of whom have citizens aboard the aeroplane. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with their families,' Ms Bishop said. Mr Abbott called Indonesian president Joko Widodo to offer assistance after a plane carrying 162 people went missing in bad weather on its way from Indonesia to Singapore . 'We hope and pray there will be survivors.' Devastated AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes also could only hope for the best. 'We are very devastated by what’s happened, it’s unbelievable,' he said in a media address in Surabaya. 'Our concern right now is for the relatives and for the next of kin - there is nothing more important to us, for our crew’s family, and for the passengers’ families.' The Australian embassy in Jakarta and the Australian High Commission in Singapore have been making inquiries with local authorities. Air traffic controllers lost contact with the Airbus A320-200 about an hour after it left Juanda international airport in Surabaya, east Java, at 5.20am local time. It was scheduled to arrive in Singapore at 8.30am. Shortly before disappearing, the plane asked permission from Jakarta air traffic control to track away from its flight plan and climb above adverse weather in an area renowned for severe thunderstorms. The pilots requested 'deviation due to en route weather before communication with the aircraft was lost while it was still under the control of the Indonesian Air Traffic Control (ATC)', AirAsia said in a statement on its Facebook page. It's the third major incident to affect a Malaysian carrier this year. AirAsia issued a passenger list indicating there were no Australians on the flight, but Ms Bishop said she had sought information on whether there were any dual citizens or Australian residents. The Australian embassy in Jakarta (centre) and the Australian High Commission in Singapore have been making inquiries with local authorities . AirAsia said the plane was carrying 155 passengers as well as two pilots, four flight attendants and an engineer on the flight. As well as the 155 Indonesian passengers there were three South Koreans, one Malaysian, one British and one Singaporean, according to AirAsia's statement on Sunday night. One French national has also been identified as part of the crew. The breakdown of passengers is 138 adults, 16 children and a baby, said Indonesia's air transportation director general Djoko Murjatmodjo.","Foreign Minister admits hope of finding anyone alive on the missing flight is receding .

"Jamie Oliver has revealed he was asked to play a part in The Hobbit movie in exchange for cooking a meal for the director's 50th birthday . Jamie Oliver has revealed he turned down a chance to play a hobbit in the movie adaptation of the book by JRR Tolkien. The TV chef said he was asked to cook at director Peter Jackson's 50th birthday during filming three years ago, and in exchange he was offered a part. He had to turn it down due to work commitments – although he confessed he was tempted by the idea of taking the costume home to impress wife Jools. Oliver spoke about the missed opportunity while filming the new series of Jamie And Jimmy's Friday Night Feast, which he presents with farmer and broadcaster Jimmy Doherty. While chatting with guest Kate Hudson about parts she has missed out on, Oliver explained: 'The worst thing that happened to me was that I got phoned up by the exec producer and asked did I want to go and cook for Peter Jackson's birthday, the big birthday. 'And if I did, they would fly me over and I could be a hobbit in the film. But I was working, I couldn't get out of it. 'I really wanted to do it, I would have got right into it as well, I would have taken the costume home and said ""Jools, let's make love!"".' The first edition of the six-part series - filmed in a pop-up cafe on Southend pier - is to be screened on January 2.

"The Labour party is advertising for a £33,000 a year endorsement officer to forge new relationships with celebrities for Ed Miliband. The Labour leader is hiring the aide to show he is in touch with the people of Britain in the run up to the general election. A job advert on the Labour party's website says the  candidate will need to 'deliver an effective General Election endorsements programme with specific focus on real people and celebrity endorsements.' Ed Miliband is advertising for a £33,000 a year endorsement officer to forge new relationships with celebrities. He is pictured here with Towie star Joey Essex at a party last December, which the reality star tweeted . The Sun reports that party chiefs hope the new employee will rekindle Tony Blair's 'Cool Britannia' and show Mr Miliband is 'in touch' with the public following a number of embarrassing photo opportunities. But Conservative vice-chairman Bob Neill told the paper: 'Poor Ed is so desperate for support he's now paying someone to find him friends.' In October Mr Miliband was pictured chatting with EastEnders' star Danny Dyer, rattling off detailed facts about the cast of the show. But he soon admitted he had not watched the show but had been reading about it online, leaving the actor bewildered. Then in November former Hear’Say singer Mylene Klass took the Labour leader to task in a heated TV debate, with viewers praising her for ‘doing a Paxman’ and ‘wiping the floor’ with him. Mr Miliband said the photo opportunity is ‘not where my talents lie' after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich . In April Essex took a second picture of himself with Mr Miliband and posted it on Twitter with the group shot, labelled ‘My selfie buddies’ - but the Labour leader appears awkward and only just made the photo . The pair clashed on ITV’s The Agenda, when Ms Klass criticised Mr Miliband’s controversial proposal for a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million. The Labour leader has said previously that the photo opportunity is ‘not where my talents lie' after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich. He has also been mocked for posing wearing a feminist t-shirt and awkwardly giving money to a beggar in Manchester. In a boost for Mr Miliband in December last year Joey Essex took a selfie with the Labour leader at the British Military Awards and referred to the would-be prime minister as his ‘bezzie’, slang for best friend. Tory MP Bob Neill said: 'Poor Ed is so desperate for support he's now paying someone to find him friends' The 24-year-old, who tweets about vitally important matters such as having a bad hair day, has 2.98 million followers on Twitter. Mr Miliband has 365,000. In April Essex took a second picture of himself with Mr Miliband and posted it on Twitter with the group shot, labelled ‘My selfie buddies’.

"The fastest way to update your look for New Year’s Eve is with a slick of lipstick — and vibrant colours are in fashion right now. They’ve been all over the catwalks and sales are at an all-time high, doubling in the past month. But there is a fine line between alluring vamp and tragedy queen. So to save you from picking the wrong shade, Kate Battersby tried five of the best-selling lip colours to see which work best for a middle-aged woman... Scroll down for video . BERRY DELICIOUS . MAC Satin Lipstick in Rebel, £15.50, maccosmetics.co.uk . You know where you are with MAC — as a brand it isn’t dirt cheap, but the quality always backs up the price. Berry has been named ‘the new red’ by a glossy fashion magazine, so this shade could not be more on-trend. The colour looked frighteningly dark on the stick, but the berry shade that emerged when on my lips was a wonderfully flattering tone. I’m not certain, however, that it’s splashy enough for New Year. 3/5 . BROWN AND OUT . Topshop Lips, Boardroom, £8, Topshop . Beauty bloggers rate this colour as the pick of the season. Well, they’re welcome to this one. The dark brown shade made my lips look like a giant blood blister. I’d sum it up as hideous, but it was less attractive than that. Not even a bit sexy. I wouldn’t go near this. And the quality isn’t great either: the pigment is blotchy. 0/5 . TANGERINE DREAM . Body Shop Colour Crush in Coral Cutie, £10, Body Shop . No doubt about it, this is an out-and-out orange. Not even a burnt orange or autumnal shade, but a vibrant, summer orange — and that’s the problem. Even though I loved the colour in its casing, this is a holiday shade and goes best with a deep tan. It doesn’t feel a natural choice for the party season. Like every stronger colour, this one needs a lipliner or the colour will bleed. It has a lovely velvety texture, but it’s not for this time of year. 2/5 . THE NEW NUDE . Bourjois Rouge Edition in Beige Trench, £7.99, Superdrug . Everyone remembers the cakey nude lipsticks of the Eighties, but today’s promise a much more subtle effect. Examining this before application, it seemed distinctly mauve, but on the lips it came out on the blush side of nude, a pretty shade a touch stronger than natural. I approve. You’ll need a blusher with this lipstick to lift the colour. 4/5 . SHOCKING PINK . Revlon Super Lustrous, Fuchsia Shock, £3.99, Boots . Never in a million years would I go near this kind of shocking pink. To my mind, there is a reason that the price is so low — this shade screams ‘cheap’, particularly for those of us not in the first bloom of youth. But it doesn’t form a block of colour. It’s translucent, like a tinted lip shine, which is surprisingly flattering. It’s better applied with a lip brush, as the wand which comes with it isn’t too precise. However, within ten minutes the colour was fading and needed topping up. 2/5 .","The fastest way to update your look is with a slick of lipstick .

"House prices across Britain will fall in 2015 after a year in which they soared, a leading independent forecaster warns. The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) is poised to break ranks with estate agents and forecasting agencies in its assessment for the New Year. The group will next month warn prices will slip by 0.6 per cent during 2015 – compared with an expected rise of 8.8 per cent in the past 12 months. The Centre for Economics and Business Research will warn house prices will slip by 0.6 per cent during 2015 . It puts the forecaster – which has one of the best records when it comes to predicting the housing market – at odds with other analysts, including the Treasury’s own independent forecasting unit, the Office for Budget Responsibility. The OBR has said it expects prices to rise by a further 7.4 per cent during 2015. In London, house prices are set to fall by around 8 per cent in just 12 months, the CEBR will say. Changes to stamp duty will see anyone buying a home worth less than £937,500 pay less than under the old system. But because of the number of expensive homes in the capital, prices are likely to be hit. By October 2015 the average London house price will have fallen by around 8 per cent compared with this year, the CEBR will say. Prices in the capital have risen by almost 20 per cent in just 12 months, the ONS said in October. The average property is now worth £514,000. CEBR executive chairman Doug McWilliams said: ‘London is an unusual market driven primarily by the top end, and though the majority of Londoners will benefit from [the stamp duty reforms], it is going to mean that overall prices will be lower not higher. ‘Despite the drop it does still mean that London prices will be around 6 per cent higher than two years ago because they went up then down.’ Overall, new rules over mortgage lending and a glut of sellers have stemmed the rise of house prices. Other evidence also points to a dip. Property website Zoopla has said one third of all UK properties on sale today have seen their asking price lowered at least once since coming on to the market. By October 2015 the average London house price will have fallen by around 8 per cent compared with this year, the CEBR will say . Mortgage approvals also fell for the fifth consecutive month in November, according to the British Bankers’ Association, largely because of the rules introduced in April that applied stringent tests to applicants. The Chancellor’s reforms to stamp duty will also not be sufficient to support a continued climbing of house prices, the CEBR will say in its quarterly update next month. Its economist Nina Skero said: ‘While the reformed system of stamp duty is expected to boost transaction activity in nearly all regions, this alone is unlikely to entirely offset other factors weighing on the market.’ The price of the average UK home was £271,000 in October, according to the Office for National Statistics, up from £252,000 at the start of the year – a rise of 7.5 per cent in ten months. The CEBR has already said Britain’s housing market will hit a ‘turning point’ in the new year. It said many homes were taking longer than expected to sell as prospective buyers ‘baulked’ at rising price tags.","After a year of soaring house prices across Britain, they are set to fall .

"A Fox News host has drawn the ire of the internet after speculating on air what could have caused the disappearance of AsiaAir Flight QZ8501. The flight from Surabaya, Indonesia to Singapore went missing early this morning over the Java Sea, shortly after the pilot asked for a change in altitude due to severe weather. Fox News co-host Anna Kooiman interviewed former FAA spokesperson Scott Brenner about the search for the missing flight Sunday morning, asking the airline industry insider whether foreign pilots were at a disadvantage since they were trained using the metric system. 'Even when we think about temperature, it's Fahrenheit or Celsius,' Kooiman said. 'It's kilometers or miles. You know, everything about their training could be similar, but different.' Controversial: Fox News co-host Anna Kooiman (center) sparked criticism on Twitter for wondering whether foreign pilots' use of the metric system could have contributed to the disappearance of AsiaAir flight QZ8501 . While the Imperial System may provide a conversion challenge for metric users, it likely was not a problem since the vast majority of the world excluding the U.S. uses the metric system. Brenner pointed out that the bigger difference was foreign pilots' reliance on auto-pilot, which he says they are often required to switch over to after take-off. This requirement is due to the fact that most crashes are due to pilot error. He added that he believes 'our U.S. pilots are very well trained' for 'situations like this' because 'they actually fly the aircraft when they're in the cockpit'. Lost: An AsiaAir flight from Indonesia to Singapore went missing this morning over the Java Sea. A search for the plane was suspended due to bad weather. There were 162 people on board, including 17 children . But Kooiman continued to ask Brenner if the difference in measurements were to blame, and if that makes international travel riskier. 'It's not just a difference in the way that we measure things?' Kooiman asked. 'Is it not as safe in that part of the world? Because our viewers may be thinking, ""International travel, is it safe? Is it not safe?""' Brenner reassured Kooiman that air travel is the safest mode of transportation in the world, and there's nothing to fear about international travel specifically. This line of questioning earned Kooiman some flack on Twitter, where users critiqued her questioning the metric system's relevance in the disappearance. 'Most all media speculation right after an air crash is ludicrous but Anna Kooiman takes the cake,' one user wrote.","Anna Kooiman asked airline expert whether differences in Imperial and metric measuring systems cause problems for foreign pilots .

"Authorities have asked the public for help after two deputies in Dade City, Florida, were reportedly shot at three times  on Sunday. The shooting took place at approximately 3:30am in the Northside Baptist Church parking lot, the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said in a release. The news comes one week after NYPD Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were shot and killed  in broad daylight. Police officer Charlie Kondek was also shot and killed in Tarpon Springs, Florida, last Sunday. The Dade City shooting also comes after the Pasco County Sheriff's Office asked for help from the public on Friday in connection with a graffiti message that spelled 'Shoot MP Cop.' Shooting: The shooting took place at approximately 3:30am in the Northside Baptist Church parking lot, according to the Pasco County Sheriff's Office . Each Pasco County deputy was keeping an eye on traffic in a nearby intersection, the sheriff's office said. They were in two different patrol cars at the time. The deputies were shot at three times, according to the Pasco County Sheriff's Office. Both deputies survived the shooting unharmed. The release said that 'Both deputies reported hearing the whizzing sound of each projectile as they flew by. 'Deputies did not see the suspect or the vehicle from which the shots were fired. 'Area residents also heard the three gunshots and reported seeing a small, dark-colored vehicle with tinted windows in the area at the time of the shooting.' The Pasco County Sheriff's Office says $3,000 is being offered for tips. It also says that information can be submitted several ways: by dialing 1-800-873-TIPS, going to www.crimestoppersTB.com, and also by texting 274637 'CSTB and your tip.' Reward: The Pasco County Sheriff's Office says $3,000 is being offered for tips in regards to the shooting . Threat: The shooting comes one day after deputies asked the public for help in connection with a graffiti message that spelled 'Shoot MP Cop' The 'Shoot MP Cop' graffiti appeared on a road barrier in Meadow Point, the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said in a Friday release. 'The vandalism took place sometime between 2 p.m. And 7 p.m. Friday,' the release said. Deputies said tips on the graffiti can be made by calling 727-847-8102 and 1-800-706-2488. 'We're not saying it's tied together, but it definitely raises your antenna,' sheriff's office spokesman Eddie Daniels Jr. told The Wall Street Journal. Sheriff Chris Nocco told Bay News 9, 'Our deputies deserve to be safe and our family members deserve to have their loved ones come home at the end of the shift.' 'We're going to come out in force and we are not going to apologize,' Nocco also said. 'We are not going to be politically correct.

"Niki Taylor knew getting divorced could be a painful experience – but nothing prepared her for the heartbreak she endured when her ex-husband secretly gave away her beloved pet dog. Niki, 39, was so distraught at losing Dolly the doberman that she has launched a remarkable nationwide hunt to find her pet. She has already discovered that Dolly was rehomed by a local kennels – and is now trying to trace the family who took her in. Bond: Niki Taylor, 39, and Dolly as a puppy, who was secretly given away by Niki's husband after their divorce earlier this year. It was arranged that Simon Taylor would look after the dog until she found a home . The sad saga began when Niki and Simon Taylor, 43, went through an acrimonious divorce early this year after seven years of marriage. As part of the settlement, it was agreed Mr Taylor, a corporate headhunter, would look after Dolly for a few months while Niki found somewhere to live. Niki had owned Dolly since she was a puppy. When Niki suffered a knee injury in April, her mother wrote to Mr Taylor asking for the arrangement to be extended. In September, Mr Taylor told his former mother-in-law that Dolly had ‘never been happier’, but refused permission for Niki to see the dog. Now, Niki has learned that by then her former husband had already given Dolly up to a kennels near his home in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, and told them to find the dog a new owner. Niki, who has been staying with friends in West London, was contacted anonymously earlier this month and told her ex had rehomed Dolly without her knowledge. She says that when a mutual friend contacted him, his reply made her fearful for Dolly’s welfare. She says: ‘He told my friend he was not going to tell her what had become of Dolly. He was so vehement, I feared something worse than rehoming.’ The police told Niki they could not help and in desperation she launched a Facebook campaign. ‘Dolly licked away my tears during a very difficult time in my life and I will never forget her,’ Niki wrote. ‘It’s now my turn to make sure she is OK. Please help me find her.’ The appeal struck a chord and within days had been shared more than 40,000 times. Niki has launched a nationwide campaign to find Dolly after she discovered she had been given to kennels in Leigh-On-Sea and rehomed. She is now trying to trace the family that took in her beloved pet . One well-wisher got in touch last week to help business development manager Niki track down the kennels where Dolly was last seen. However, the kennels refuse to tell her where Dolly has been rehomed. Niki learned her ex-husband had signed the dog over to Acres Way Kennels in Benfleet, Essex. She said: ‘They told me that Dolly had been given to a family in the area, but because of confidentiality rules, they couldn’t give me any details. ‘They assured me that Dolly is in a nice home, but at the very least, I need to know that for myself.’ Simon Taylor’s solicitor, Rash Mahal, said: ‘We had a court order and she was supposed to collect the dog by May 1. ‘She didn’t do it and she didn’t contact our client, so he had the right to rehouse the dog. Nothing more to say.’ Tom Millson, manager of Acres Way, said the dog was signed over to them in June. ‘We have behaved responsibly and conducted a visit at the home of the new owner,’ he said. ‘They are a kind couple who have looked after Dolly, but they don’t feel comfortable coming forward.’ Anyone with any information about Dolly’s whereabouts can get in touch with Niki through the contact box at www.angelsfortheinnocent.com.","Niki Taylor's husband secretly gave away pet dog after divorce this year .

"The mom of a three-year-old who works in fast food, a man who just graduated from a study course aged 49, another who cares full-time for his mom - and two men who are in prison. They may seem very different, but these people have something in common - their lives have been blighted by an addiction to methamphetamine. Esther Allison, Glenn Lagrew, James Hibbs, Joseph Harris, and Perry Bennett became the public faces of drug abuse when their mugshots were used in the Faces of Meth campaign in 2004 - and are still recognized for it today. And - thanks to an extensive investigation by The Oregonian - with some making steady progress kicking the drug, holding down jobs and making their way in life. Scroll down for video . Public faces: Esther Allison, now 38, is pictured above in jailhouse mugshots showing the effects of meth addiction over just eight months. She now works as a manager in McDonald's . Today: Allison is now out of jail and has a managerial job at McDonald's - as well as a son to look after . Decline: The above mugshots show how the drugs aged  Glenn Lagrew, who has done 17 years of jail time . Out and working: Lagrew now has two jobs - and graduated from an education program in June . Reporter Kasia Hall tracked down six of the eight drug users who featured in the campaign, which was born from a project by a sheriff's deputy at the Multnomah County Jail in Portland, Oregon. Deputy Bret King was the ravaged faces in front of him every day, and compiled mugshots of the most extreme examples into a drug prevention package which made it round the country thanks to its stark, visual message. Some of those featured later revealed that they hated the fact that their problems were made so public - while others are glad if their pictures turn anybody away from the same path. Allison was tracked down by The Oregonian to a home in Carlton, an hour outside of Portland. Despite last being arrested as recently as 2012, the 38-year-old has managed to turn her life around, splitting her energies between caring for her son and working as a manager at a McDonald's. Shocking: Images such as these - showing Theresa Baxter - were compiled in the Faces of Meth campaign, which showed the stark physical effects of using the drug . Grizzled: Patrick Lucas, now 51, is another former addict whose image was featured in the attention-grabbing campaign . She began using meth as early as 12, she said,  while she was living in foster homes around Portland. She later became homeless and worked as a prostitute - but now has something to live for and is trying to shake her association with the drug. She said: 'Everybody knows your name here, but I'm trying to be a good mom. Now, I'm a manager at McDonald's. That means something to me.' Lagrew, 49, graduated from an education program this year in Portland and now holds down two jobs: working in a warehouse and delivering home equipment. But the former addict, also a father, has spent a total of 17 years behind bars - and during one of the appearances landed in the campaign. Speaking at the graduation ceremony, he said: 'I want to make amends to the city and be a role model so my son ... will make it out, too.' He told The Oregonian he hopes to be an addictions counselor and help others. James Hibbs is a third who made it out and is now clean. He started using the drug aged just 15, while travelling with his carnival worker parents, and ended up homeless in Portland - where he says the generosity of locals meant he had no trouble supporting his habits by begging. Troubled past: James Hibbs, pictured above in successive mugshots, started using meth when he was just 15 . Now: Hibbs is now married and cares for his mom in their Spokane, Washington home. He says participating in the campaign - and potentially turning people away from meth - makes him feel better . In an interview with the newspaper, he said: 'Other people should see what [meth] does. 'Even though I'm dumb enough to do it, if I can convince anybody else from doing it, that makes me feel better. Not everybody has to be as dumb as I was.' Though he was once a gang member - and has the tattoo to prove it - he says it has been seven years since he used the drug. He now lives with his wife and ill mother, whom he cares for, in Spokane, Washington. However - the stories of those whose images were turned into a weapon against the drug that so damaged them are not uniformly positive. Two of the eight faces are still behind bars - and one admits he is likely to start using again once he gets out. Joseph Harris, 52, has been using meth since he was 14. And he told the paper that as soon as he is let out of Jefferson County Detention Center, Kansas, he will probably start up again. Pocked:  Joseph Harris, 52, has one of the most shocking set of mugshots. But according to a recent interview, he will take up meth again once he leaves jail in Kansas . Arrested not long after a pressure cooker exploded while preparing the drug, his pockmarked faces from 2000 is one of the most shocking in the series. He said he hopes to keep living in Kansas with his girlfriend once he leaves jail - and to pay his way by fixing up then selling his dad's Montana ranch. Perry Bennett, 50, is also in jail - this time a correctional facility in Portland. He has spent just over half his life inside and has repeatedly tried to quit meth. Hoping to fix it: Perry Bennett, shown above, has spent more than half his life in jail - but now has a son and hopes to stay clean when he is next released for his sake . Missing link: Jennifer Lundgren, shown above at the times of her arrests, could not be found for an update . But he said that once he is released next month he will approach the task with renewed vigor because he now has a son - which could spur him to leave the drugs behind. Two more of the subjects - Theresa Baxter and Jennifer Lundgren - either could not be found or would not agree to be interviewed - but their shocking images of decline continue to form be used as a tool in the war of meth.","Mugshots of addicts were used for campaign showing ravages of meth .

"With its dirty sheets, empty vodka bottles, cigarette butts and discarded underwear, it is the most infamous bed in the world. Having recently sold for more than £2.5million, Tracey Emin’s artwork ‘My Bed’, the product of a chaotic low point in her life when a failed romance resulted in severe depression, must also be among the most expensive. But despite being directly inspired by the messy scene left after she spent four days in bed after the break-up, a leading art expert has cast doubt on whether Miss Emin ever actually slept in her crumpled creation. Scroll down for video . Tracy Emin sits in front of her 1998 piece 'My Bed' on display at Christie's in June. With its dirty sheets, empty vodka bottles, cigarette butts and discarded underwear, it is the most infamous bed in the world . Martin Kemp, emeritus professor of art history at Oxford University, inspected the 1998 artwork, which comes with a dossier of photographs of the detritus and instructions for where to put each object every time it is reassembled, in its various incarnations, including its first display in Japan and in the 1999 Turner Prize exhibition after it was shortlisted for the award. Professor, Kemp, an authority on Leonardo da Vinci, said: ‘I began to wonder… have any of those beds really been slept on continuously over four sweaty and desperate days?’ He noticed the creases are ‘caused by rumpling, not sharp, compressed creases caused by a warm body’, the pillows show no compression by a head and the bed-base of the Japan version has a different graining pattern. ‘Look at the various incarnations of My Bed and it’s clear that the detritus of Emin’s legendary four days in bed has been reconfigured a good deal,’ Professor Kemp said. ‘Discussions tend to be about autobiography, about feminism, obvious theoretical things, all of which are relevant… Nobody has really looked at these as I would look at versions of a Leonardo painting… . But despite being directly inspired by the messy scene left after she spent four days in bed after the break-up, a leading art expert has cast doubt on whether Miss Emin ever actually slept in her crumpled creation . ‘It’s not just some things not arranged scrupulously, which is fine. They’re actually different items.’ He concluded that the different versions are not one bed in which Miss Emin slept for a long time, adding that if she had lain in the bed ‘its conservation state would be pretty horrendous. ‘Organic materials don’t do nice things if they’re left… Why doesn’t it smell?’ he wondered. Advertising executive Charles Saatchi, the ex-husband of chef Nigella Lawson, bought the work for £150,000 in 2000. He sold at auction it to an anonymous buyer for £2,546,500 in July, more than triple the guide price of £800,000. Despite his observations, Professor Kemp regards Emin as a ‘brilliant’ artist and says the myth she created behind ‘My Bed’ should not be taken literally. He plans to include ‘My Bed’ in his new book to be published next month. Martin Kemp, emeritus professor of art history at Oxford University, inspected the 1998 artwork, which comes with a dossier of photographs of the detritus and instructions for where to put each object every time it is reassembled, in its various incarnations . Asked about Professor Kemp’s comments, Miss Emin, 51, who was awarded a CBE for services to the arts in the New Year honours list two years ago, said: ‘The bed came directly from my flat. When I say ‘My Bed’ I mean it was the idea of the artwork. ‘The bed has gone through many transformations. In a way it’s a self-portrait. It’s like a ‘Descartes-ian’ theory of the soul: the candle burns, but the wax still remains in a different form… As I get older my face changes, my skin changes. ‘Every time I reinstall the bed it will always be different. [After my death], the people… will install it differently because of the nature of how I haunt the room. ‘The bed is the physical ghost of my own existence.’","Tracey Emin’s artwork ‘My Bed’ is the product of chaotic low point in her .

"Drunks who clog up casualty wards should be arrested in a 'zero-tolerance' crackdown, Britain's A&E chief has said. College of Emergency Medicine president Dr Cliff Mann called on police to break a cycle that has made extreme pressure on doctors 'normal' on Friday and Saturday nights. He spoke as it emerged more than 300 patients had operations cancelled every working day in the first two weeks of this month, with winter illness clogging beds. Crackdown: Drunks who clog up A&E  should be arrested, a casualty doctors' leader has said (file photo) The figures, released by the NHS, show 1,788 operations were cancelled in the second week of this month alone - the highest in any single week since the start of November. Most were routine 'elective' procedures but 71 were urgent operations, seven of which were cancelled more than once. Dr Cliff Mann (pictured) said it should not be 'normal' for wards to be inundated with drunks . Dr Mann, who also spoke in expectation of a huge spike in A&E attendances  on New Year's Eve, said 'these days very few people are arrested' meaning 'they do it again the next week'. 'There's far too much acceptance that this is normal for a Friday or Saturday night,' he told the Observer. 'It's not normal. It shouldn't be normal. 'If more people knew that if they got drunk they were going to be arrested, they wouldn't drink in the first place and then end up in A&E.' He added: 'We aren’t really using carrots and sticks to change their behaviour. There are no sanctions on people for being a nuisance and for taking up vital A&E resources as a result of their own alcohol excess. Fines have clearly not worked.' He described argumentative and obnoxious patients, and their acquaintances, who can end up being physically abusive towards staff, and said workers are fed up having to deal with such people. But several organisations including the Police Federation said the issue is too complex to deal with by a 'crackdown', and jailing people is not always the answer. Katherine Brown, director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies think tank, and Emily Robinson, director of campaigns at charity Alcohol Concern, told the Observer the problem needs to be tackled at the source, by looking at the easy availability of cheap alcohol. Today it emerged more than 300 operations are being cancelled every working day as the already under-strain NHS faces up to the pressures of winter. Increase: NHS figures show the increase in cancelled operations per week from 1,360 in November to 1,788 . In the first two weeks of December, 3,274 operations were cancelled - an average of 327 every working day, NHS England figures show. Most of them were planned elective procedures, and Labour party chiefs claimed many were called off just hours before surgery when patients had already been admitted. Attack: Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham blamed the problems on the government . According to Labour that number rose 16 per cent since the first fortnight of December last year, and almost 50 per cent in two years. Some 161 urgent operations were also cancelled - up from 138 last year - and 21 of them were cancelled more than once. The same two-week period also saw a record 159,054 patients admitted to A&E wards, up from 159,054 last year. Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused the government of triggering the crisis by taking social care away from the elderly. 'This is yet another sign that, under David Cameron, the NHS is simply not working,' he said. 'Standards of patient care are slipping by the week and now more and more people get ready for an operation only to face a last minute postponement.' The Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt hit back at Labour's claims today. He described coverage of the figures as 'disappointing' and said the number of cancelled operations had remained relatively stable since 2010. Posting a graph on Twitter, he said that was achieved despite the overall number of operations increasing by 'nearly 1million' since the same year. Critics, however, questioned the 1million figure and pointed out that the graph showed only the figures for July to September in each year. Fightback: Health secretary Jeremy Hunt responded by tweeting a graph which showed the number of cancelled operations in July to September each year remaining 'stable' while demand went up .","Call comes from College of Emergency Medicine president Dr Cliff Mann .

"Challenges: Dr Nathalie MacDemott, pictured before she returned to Liberia to treat Ebola patients . British Ebola doctor Nathalie MacDermott made headlines when she returned to Liberia despite previously fearing she had contracted the disease. Now the 32-year-old, who quarantined herself in her Cardiff flat for three weeks, has sent back a diary which lays bare the chaos and confusion which treating the outbreak involves. More than 7,500 people have died of Ebola in West Africa since the disease broke out in March this year, and almost 20,000 people have been infected. The vast majority of infections have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and Liberia has had the worst death toll at almost half the victims. However, case rates have been declining in Liberia since the middle of last month according to the World Health Organization, which is hopeful of its demise. Despite the grim figures, Dr MacDermott is surprisingly optimistic - and insists the prospect of the disease being wiped out in Liberia in 2015 is a reality. December 14 . There has recently been a suspect case in Greenville, who unfortunately despite many agencies' best efforts, including our own, has disappeared and refused to be tested for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). We arranged for his transport to the Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in Bong County, but he declined to go. He then stopped answering his phone and we were no longer able to trace him as he had left the village and disappeared somewhere in Bong County. This makes the decision to remove the team difficult. If he was a confirmed case he may well have infected other people in the town as he also refused to fully isolate himself. However if he was not a case then we are retaining our team in a very challenging environment for several weeks longer than needed. Upbeat: Dr MacDermott with a patient and a colleague in Liberia, where she tackles more than just disease . In the field: The Ebola doctor with colleague Judith Hoover at one of many Community Care Centres . We eventually manage to get hold of him and he hangs up the phone on me when I offer to arrange an ambulance to take him to get a blood test done. We manage to determine though from community leaders that he seems much better and so it is less likely he has EVD. We make a decision to pull our team out but regularly monitor the situation. December 15-18 . Over the course of the next few days I am largely based in the office in Monrovia. I hear news of a suspect case in Lofa county. This is concerning as Lofa county has just passed 42 days clear of any cases of Ebola. The potential case lives very close to the border with Guinea and Sierra Leone and there is concern he has travelled there. Fortunately the case turns out to be a false alarm. Front line: Dr MacDermott in protective clothing . December 19 . We are preparing to travel to Zorzor tomorrow for the official opening of our Community Care Centre (CCC) when we learn that several of our staff have been in a car accident. They were driving to Monrovia in convoy from our base in Fish Town, River Gee County. Unfortunately one of the vehicles has been in a head-on collision with another vehicle. We learn that four of our staff are injured, two of them severely injured. They are at a small health centre in a village in the middle of the jungle. The nearest town is over an hour's drive on very poor roads. One of our staff members is unconscious, the other is unable to move her neck and has chest injuries. We are unable to get any further information. I am concerned that both of them could have injuries to their necks and that if they are not immobilised prior to transfer they could be permanently paralysed if they are moved. We attempt to request a helicopter but we are told they are not allowed to transport Liberians. This decision cuts deep. If this was one of my US or British colleagues, there would be no hesitation to use one of the five helicopters currently sitting on the tarmac at the airport. But somehow because they are Liberian, they are not entitled to the same treatment I would be. To me they are my colleagues, whether they are Liberian, American or British, and I will do my best for them however I can. With tears in my eyes I make the decision not to move them that night. It is a horrible decision to make. The health centre they are in has no facilities, but I understand they are both relatively stable. My concern that I could do them more damage by requesting they be moved by people inexperienced in manual handling. I go to bed that night praying it was not the wrong decision. Waiting game: United Nations helicopters are in short supply, and getting one is far from guaranteed . December 20 . It is a miracle we had a UN helicopter scheduled today to take us to Zorzor. This has enabled us to re-schedule this helicopter to take us to Tapetta to collect my colleagues instead. We arrive in Tapetta and the pilots tell us they will wait for us for a maximum of three hours. It is an hours drive to Toe, the village where my colleagues are. We race along the dirt track trying to save as much time as possible. We know that time will be short when we arrive to immobilise them both and get them into the back of our land cruiser. I don't have everything I need, but I at least have two neck collars to stabilise their necks and two decent combat stretchers. It is the best I can do. We leave Toe with only 50 minutes until the helicopter will leave and once again race along the dirt track. This time the driver tries to be even more cautious about avoiding the pot holes, after all we have two colleagues on stretchers in the back of our land cruiser with the sideways fitted seats pushed upwards out of the way. We make it back to the helicopter 10 minutes late, but fortunately they have waited for us. X-rays confirm I was right to have been concerned for one of my colleagues. Fortunately both of them do well and are discharged home from hospital a few days later. Finally I am able to get some time off. It has been three weeks with no day off and two medical evacuations, which are pretty exhausting in the current context. On Sunday evening we go carol singing and take some baked items to the neighbouring houses on the compound. December 22 . We are taking over a transit centre that has been converted following the closure of the ETU in Foya. A transit centre is similar to a CCC but patients will only remain for a few days until we have determined if they have a positive test for Ebola or not. I visit the facility today but unfortunately there is a lot more work to do on the lay out and the water source so we will not be opening the facility before New Year as we had hoped. Rescue: A new care centre in Zorzor, whose opening was partly marred by a car crash involving the staff . Home turf: The 32-year-old doctor outside Singleton Hospital in Swansea, where she normally works . December 23 . Today I spend time responding to emails and trying to resolve issues regarding staff contracts. I then attend a meeting regarding the CCCs that are being constructed by UNICEF, of which we will take over the coordination of three facilities when they are completed in January. December 24 . I spend a part of the day baking cookies to take to the medical staff at the medical facility set up by the USPHS for Liberian and International health care workers who contract EVD. They had kindly lent us two combat stretchers last week when we evacuated my two colleagues and so we wanted to thank them and wish them a Merry Christmas. Dr MacDermott said: 'An Ebola-free Liberia really could be a possibility in a few months' time' In the evening we go out for a team meal that the charity Samaritan's Purse has kindly offered to pay for. It is a moment of normality amidst the chaos where we all dress up and feel relatively smart for the first time in weeks. December 25 . Whilst we will continue to work we do ensure the entire team takes the day off today. The only staff working are the health care workers who are staffing our two functioning CCCs. Our international team share brunch together. Then we do a gift exchange and go for a swim in the ocean. The obligatory drone of Chinooks and Black Hawk helicopters throughout the day reminds us of the ongoing battle we find ourselves in. December 26 . It is back to work today but as there are not many meetings this week and many people are not working there is a limit to what can be done. I am hoping to make these few days a little bit easier and to complete all the formal documentation I have been unable to do due to all of my other responsibilities over the last few weeks. I remain hopeful that we will see the end of Ebola in Liberia in the next few months. Numbers continue to remain down, although there was a small increase in cases again last week. As long as there is no peak following the Christmas period, an Ebola-free Liberia really could be a possibility in a few months' time. Then more attention can be focused on Sierra Leone and Guinea. Here is to a 2015 where the largest Ebola epidemic in history is brought to an end.","Dr Nathalie MacDemott quarantined herself at Cardiff flat for 3 weeks .

"The Ministry of Defence has paid out more than £2million to settle claims of sex abuse against youngsters in the cadet forces over the past three years, it has emerged. The payments include both historic sex abuse of children who are now adults, as well as more recent cases, it was reported. Cases include alleged sexual abuse in different arms of the cadets including the Army Cadets, Combined Cadet Force, and Air Cadets. Five payments of nearly £1.5million were made in 2012, and payouts added up to nearly £65,000 in 2013 . Freedom of Information requests revealed eight payments were made this year totalling more than £500,000. Five payments of nearly £1.5million were made in 2012, and payouts added up to nearly £65,000 in 2013. The information released by the MoD did not show which of the cadet groups were associated with the cases. No payments were made in 2011, according to the Guardian newspaper’s inquiries. One reported case involved abuse carried out by teenagers on younger cadets, and another the rape of a female cadet who became pregnant and gave birth to a child. A lawyer for several victims in the Army Cadets said abusers had exploited their positions of trust. Rebecca Sheriff, from Bolt Burdon Kemp, said: ‘It is common practice for sex offenders to seek out positions of authority in organisations such as the Army Cadets, and vulnerable children need to be safeguarded from this risk. ‘It is terrible that often these children have joined the cadets with a view to a career in the armed services, which they are unable to pursue as a result of abuse by people that they should have been able to trust.’ The mother of one victim said her son was sexually abused by two older cadets. But despite a settlement of £23,000 she has yet to receive an apology. The Ministry of Defence has paid out more than £2million to settle claims of sex abuse against youngsters in the cadet forces over the past three years . The case was reported to the police but the alleged abusers were given only a warning. The woman, who was not named, said: ‘If something like that goes on and is not right then somebody needs to take responsibility, and the cadets [organisation] had to pay what they paid to compensate for all the hurt. But the two lads have got away with it, they just received warnings, and it was put on file. [The police] said it was bullying and intimidation of a sexual nature – because it wasn’t anything like a rape.’ She added: ‘I believe that they had been doing it for a while. It makes me sick and saddened inside. It really, really, does. I was told that the cadets had their own internal investigation but I’m not aware of what happened.’ In another case, a victim who was abused and then raped by a cadet instructor received £210,000. A spokesman for the MoD said: ‘We take any allegation of abuse extremely seriously. All adult volunteers undergo enhanced criminal record checks and are made fully aware of their responsibility to protect children from harm. ‘Any suspicion of bullying, harassment or abuse will be dealt with immediately and any allegation of a criminal nature is handed to the police. This is reinforced throughout all safeguarding training.’ Earlier this month it was claimed the Scout Association has paid out nearly £900,000 in compensation over sex abuse charges. Following the BBC report, the movement issued a formal apology, in which a spokesman admitted that it had tried to deal with paedophiles without telling police.","MoD paid money to settle claims against youngsters in the cadet forces .

"This is the moment a brazen thief stole Christmas presents from a stranger's doorstep in broad daylight after chatting to the delivery driver while the homeowner was inside. In the shocking footage - recorded days before Christmas - the man is seen lurking on Troy Hall's doorstep for several minutes before sparking up a conversation with a UPS driver as he delivers the parcels. The thief even allegedly tells the employee to leave the parcels on the homeowner's doorstep, before shamelessly walking off with the goods under his arm. Scroll down for video . This is the moment a brazen thief stole Christmas presents from a stranger's doorstep in broad daylight after chatting to the delivery driver while the homeowner was inside . The disturbing incident was only revealed when homeowner Mr Hall wondered why his delivery had not turned up and checked his surveillance camera. It was then that he saw the stranger walking down his driveway as the UPS delivery truck pulled up outside. He then realised that his wife had been inside the couple's home throughout the 'disturbing' incident. He told KCPG news: 'It's disturbing. Because he seems to know where the cameras are, he’s hiding his face. 'I think what he says is, ‘Would these be safe here?’ The thief says, ‘Yes, sir.’' In the shocking footage, recorded days before Christmas, the man is seen lurking on Troy Hall's doorstep for several minutes before having a chat to the driver as he delivers the parcels . The thief even allegedly tells the driver to leave the parcels on the doorstep - before shamelessly walking off with the goods under his arm. Mr Hall says he is furious that the driver trusted the 'suspicious' stranger and left the parcels on the doorstep without a note, despite his wife being inside at the time. He told KCPQ: 'I think I would have left a note or come back later or something different than just slide it right next to the person who's looking very suspicious.' Mr Hall complained to UPS about the incident, but the company insisted the driver had followed company policy. On the company's website, it says drivers will leave deliveries at the front door unless a signature is required. Homeowner Troy Hall (pictured) said the incident was 'disturbing' and that the driver should have left a note or come back to finish the delivery later . In that case, a note will be left saying an attempt was made to deliver the package and when the next attempt will be made. Mr Hall's package did not require a signature but he said the driver did not leave a note. According to a post office spokesman, thieves are no longer opportunistically coming across packages outside houses. Gus Ruiz told KMAX: 'These parcel pirates are following these trucks and as soon as they drop off a parcel on a doorstep or whatever and they see that it's unattended, they will swoop in and off they go.'","Thief seen walking up Washington driveway as UPS delivery van arrives .

"A troubled funfair ride at Cardiff's Winter Wonderland will be permanently removed after children were left dangling 65ft in the air for 40 minutes in freezing conditions. At least eight youngsters were trapped on the Sky Swing after the ride broke down due to an electrical fault last night. It is the second time the ride has gone wrong in a month, coming just three weeks after two carriages collided on the amusement ride while spinning almost 200ft up in the air. Scroll down for video . Children were left dangling 65ft in the air for 40 minutes in freezing conditions after an amusement ride at Cardiff's Winter Wonderland broke down . Emergency services were called in to help rescue the passengers left shivering around 65ft in the air as the temperature dipped to around 2C. The 12-seat side, which rises to heights of up to 200ft in the air, stopped and became stuck just before the halfway mark. Fire crews began preparing ladders to rescue revellers, but the  ride became operational again and passengers were lowered back down to ground level. Ellie-May Jones, 12, from Newport was trapped on the ride and her father Luke, who was watching from the ground, said she was 'cold and frightened'. 'It looked like they tried to re-start it about 20 times, they seemed to be going through manuals,' he said. 'Ellie-May was so high up she looked like a dot. She was so cold and frightened. It was every parent's worse nightmare.' At least eight youngsters were trapped on the Sky Swing after the ride broke down due to an electrical fault . Emergency services were called in to help rescue the passengers left shivering around 65ft in the air . Simon Gale, who saw the ride break down, said: 'It's horrible and cold, so it must be pretty scary up there.' Chris Averis, 26, said: 'It had apparently been stuck for over an hour, I certainly won't be going on it.' The operators of the Sky Swing suspended the ride while they carried out an investigation and confirmed it has been axed and will be replaced by a smaller attraction called the Mega Swing. The ride is due to be dismantled this evening. 'We are not going to take any chances,' said a spokesman for Sayer's Amusements. 'An electrical malfunction occurred with the Sky Swing, when the ride's safety procedures operated automatically, stopping the ride as it descended. 'All passengers were checked over by our medical staff, and given hot drinks when they came off the ride, and all were of course given full refunds, in addition to our apologies for any anxiety caused.

'They were all comfortable with the way the situation was handled. Though the emergency services were called, they were not required to intervene. 'Public safety is our paramount concern, and though no one was injured, we will be investigating this incident fully.' The terrifying moment when two carriages collided on the amusement ride earlier this month was captured by spectators filming the ride at ground level . After initially joking about how close together some of the carriages were swinging, those filming the incident reacted with shock when they witnessed the collision. One said: 'It looks like its going to hit her. See that? It him them.' His friend then responds: 'Oh my God it's hit them. They've stopped the ride.' Leanne Williams described the collision as the 'scariest moment of my life'. The ride's operators Sayer's Amusements are currently investigating the fault and the ride will only be operational again when they are satisfied it has been resolved .

"Five people were killed and 11 injured after a three-alarm fire broke out at the Wedgwood Senior Living Apartments in San Antonio, Texas, on Sunday morning, officials at the scene said. Firefighters evacuated the building by carrying some elderly residents out windows and down ladder trucks from the 11-story building. The building is home to some 700 residents and somewhere between 75 and 120 elderly residents were carried out. Five people were killed and 11 injured after a three-alarm fire broke out at the Wedgwood Senior Living Apartments in San Antonio, Texas, on Sunday morning. Firefighters evacuated the building by carrying some elderly residents out windows and down ladder trucks from the 11-story building . At least one of the injured is in critical condition at an area hospital. The cause of the fire is still not known and MySA reports that the building's sprinkler system didn't work. Witnesses said there was smoke pouring from the back of the building. SAFD Police Chief Charles Hood said the third floor of the building was completely gutted and that doors were charred. The fire started around 6:30am and a total of 150 firefighters from San Antonio and area municipal fire departments responded to the fire. Those killed in the blaze have not yet been identified. An evacuation center was established at Churchill High School nearby and family members are encouraged to check there about elderly relatives. The building is home to some 700 residents and somewhere between 75 and 120 elderly residents were carried out . According to television news reports, San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said evacuating the residents was hindered because of the building's construction. It's the worst catastrophe in my knowledge to happen in Castle Hills,' said Time Howell, mayor of the city of approximately 4,300. Castle Hills was the main fire department responding. The Castle Hills City Manage Diane Pfeil said there were efforts underway to send blankets to Churchill High School and that Castle Hills Police would be in charge of making sure medications were distributed.","Fire broke out at the Wedgwood Senior Living Apartments in San Antonio, Texas, on Sunday morning .

"From hearty lasagne to creamy spaghetti carbonara, Britain’s love affair with pasta spans decades. But sales of the traditional Italian staple have plummeted – with speculation that the trend away from carbohydrates and even towards gluten-free food might be to blame. After booming in Britain since the 1960s when it was introduced by mainstream supermarkets, pasta sales slumped by 4.2 per cent in the past year. Sales of pasta have plummeted - with speculation that the trend away from carbohydrates might be to blame . Correspondingly, demand for rice had shown a strong increase - up 3.6 per cent to £393.3 million, an improvement on last year’s 1.8 per cent growth - suggesting Britons are switching from Italian food to more Asian-inspired cuisine. Rice has also become a staple of convenience food in many popular supermarket microwave meals. Trade magazine The Grocer, which revealed the sales figures, said: ‘Arrivederci pasta? More of us are saying farewell to the Italian staple in favour of rice and noodles. ‘Pasta is down 4.2 per cent in value and 3.9 per cent in volume in a sector increasingly shaped by every-second-counts convenience.’ Increased rice sales have been recorded by big brands such as Uncle Ben’s, Tilda and Veetee. In 2011, a global survey by Oxfam named pasta as the world’s most popular dish. In British households, spaghetti bolognese has been a regular feature of meal-times since the 1960s and a staple of children’s diets. Gluten-free eating is popular with many celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow (left) and Victoria Beckham . The mix of tuna-pasta-sweetcorn is credited with sustaining many UK students through their years at university. But the dish may now have fallen foul of faddish eating habits. Many supermarkets and food brands have responded to the demand for gluten-free products by handing over more shelf-space and increasing their ranges. Since the high-protein, high-fat Atkins diet exploded on to the dieting landscape in the 1970s and resurged in the early 2000s, the idea that carbohydrates lead to weight gain has spawned a multitude of low-carbohydrate diets. These include the Paleo or ‘caveman’ diet which consists of protein, nuts and berries; the high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets, which aim to change the way the body metabolises its fat stores, and low-GI and –GL diets, which restrict the glycaemic index (GI) glycaemic loads (GL) and therefore control blood sugar levels. In 2011, a global survey by Oxfam named pasta as the world’s most popular dish - but sales have slumped by 4.2 per cent in the past year . In recent years bread and pasta have become the enemies of the waistline, as more people realise that wheat and gluten products are often highly processed and refined. This means they have a less complex molecular structure - resulting in the food getting broken down and absorbed into the bloodstream quicker. This results in a ‘hit’ to the bloodstream, a spike in insulin levels and the excess glucose being stored as fat, and leads to a ‘crash’ and further hunger pangs. Asda more than doubled its Free From range in time for the festive season to include gluten free sage and onion stuffing, Free From gravy and gluten-free Christmas cake and pudding. Its gluten-free mince pies were particularly popular, while shoppers also snapped up gluten-free shortbread Christmas trees and Asda Free From cranberry and orange Cookies. Hannah Thirkill, Asda’s Free From buyer, said: ‘There are now 12 million Brits buying gluten-free — a 120 per cent increase over the past five years — so we wanted to make sure our shoppers had lots of choice.’ Last week Kellogg announced it was launching its first gluten-free breakfast cereal in the UK in January . It said its Gluten Free Organic Puffed Corn Cereal had secured listings with ‘major’ supermarkets and was supported by the group’s £7m Kellogg’s “masterbrand” marketing campaign in 2015. A spokesperson for Kellogg said: ‘Shoppers have been crying out for a gluten-free cereal from Kellogg’s and our new Puffed Corn Cereal gives us and our retail partners a brilliant opportunity to grow the “free from” category. The Clintons are also famous gluten-free eaters - Bill Clinton adopted a gluten free diet after heart surgery in 2010, while daughter Chelsea had gluten free cake at her wedding, and a baby shower with a gluten-free menu . ‘More and more shoppers want to make healthy choices, but most gluten free products are manufactured by unfamiliar brands they’re not sure they can trust.’ Gluten is a protein found in grains including wheat, rye and barley, and many who give it up claim to have more energy, better sleep, less water retention and weight loss. But less than one per cent of the population actually suffers from coeliac disease – a serious autoimmune illness characterised by gluten intolerance – so most dieticians say there is no real benefit, yet the trend to eliminate it from the dinner table has exploded in recent years. Gluten-free eating is popular with many celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow, Rachel Weisz, Russell Crowe and Victoria Beckham, and in 2011 world tennis Number One Novac Djokovic credited a gluten-free diet with helping change his game around. He had crashed out of several tournaments and collapsed in the 2010 Australian Open, but the following year after adopting a gluten-free diet he was virtually unbeatable and said: ‘My movement is much sharper and I feel great physically.’ The Clintons are also famous gluten-free eaters, and Bill Clinton adopted a gluten free diet after heart surgery in 2010, while his daughter Chelsea had a gluten free cake at her wedding, and a baby shower with a 99 per cent gluten-free menu.","Sales of traditional Italian staple have plummeted, falling by 4.2% this year .

"From a greasy-fry-up and strong coffee to 'hair of the dog' and a dose of painkillers, Britons have long sought after the perfect hangover cure. And now even the NHS has issued official advice on how to combat a hangover ― don't get drunk. Health bosses state the obvious in a 'hangover cures' guide on the taxpayer-funded NHS Choices website, dedicating a page to debunking myths about how to avoid a headache after a heavy night. The NHS has issued official advice on how to combat a hangover ― do not get drunk in the first place (file picture) The common sense advice states: 'Hangover cures are generally a myth. There are no cures for a hangover. There are tips for avoiding hangovers and for easing the symptoms. 'The best way to avoid a hangover is not to drink.' With millions preparing for a New Year knees-up on Wednesday evening, the official advice from the health service adds that drinkers should consider eating pasta or rice before they go out. The hangover guide also suggests drinking 'water or non-fizzy soft drinks in between each alcoholic drink', and drinking a pint of water before bed. The patronising tips page adds: 'If you wake up the next morning feeling terrible, you probably didn't follow this advice.' Listing methods to lessen the alcohol-induced aches and pains felt the morning after the night before, the NHS Choices page suggests taking paracetamol rather than aspirin, as the latter can cause nausea. The official advice from the health service adds that drinkers should consider eating pasta or rice before going out (file picture) The humble bacon sandwich has long been considered a hangover cure, but NHS experts suggest trying Bouillon soup instead . Other suggestions include drinking water, fizzy drinks or isotonic sports beverages to rehydrate the body. The NHS' top tip for hungover men and women is having some Bouillon soup, a thin vegetable-based broth. The soup 'is a good source of vitamins and minerals, which can top-up depleted resources. Its main advantage is that it's easy for a fragile stomach to digest,' the health experts say. 'Hair of the dog', drinking more alcohol in an attempt to drink off a hangover, does not work, the NHS say. The health experts call the alleged cure a 'risky habit', and explain that it may simply delay the appearance of hangover symptoms until the booze wears off once more. In a final piece of advice, webpage suggests waiting 48 hours after a hangover before drinking again. 'Sometimes, of course, a hangover makes that advice easier to follow,' the guide adds. Experts agree drinking water before you go to bed will help stave off some of the damaging effects of dehydration, which contributes to a hangover. But migraine specialist Andy Dowson recommends milk before bed instead.‘Drinking milk will combat many symptoms,’ he says. ‘Hangovers are thought to be triggered by low blood sugar and dehydration, both of which are potent triggers for migraine — so if you can stomach it, drink milk before sleeping. 'This will give you the volume of fluid as well as help get your blood sugar levels back up.‘Milk is also an anti-diuretic (stopping kidneys producing urine).’ This should mean fewer trips to the loo, minimising sleep disruption. The fact that milk is alkaline might also counteract any inflammation of the stomach caused by excess acidity.","Official NHS guidance says the best way to avoid a hangover is to not drink .

"A Kansas family of wheat growers felt so at home among the 30-foot bins that hold their harvested crops, they moved into one. Louise and Vance Ehmke saw more than just vessels for their grain in the galvanized steel cylinders that dotted their Dighton farm, they saw a cozy opportunity. So, in 2001, the couple renovated one of their bins--which measure just 42-feet in diameter--to become a two-bedroom, two-story home complete with all the amenities a prairie home might need. Little grain bin on the prairie: A Kansas family turned this 42-foot in diameter grain bin into a unique and cozy home . Unique problems: The 31-foot tall grain bin was converted into a home in 2001 by wheat farmers Vance and Louise Ehmke. Here is a view from their dining room which shows the double-doored foyer, built that way to kep the prairie dust out of their home . Galvanizing: Mr. and Mrs. Ehmke are pictured on their porch swing. The couple say upkeep on the outdoor walls and roof of their home takes zero effort thanks to their galvanized steel covering . One of them, as pointed out in a segment on the unique home that aired on HGTV, is unique to the prairie and visitors encounter it just as soon as they arrive: a double-door foyer designed to keep out the dust of the plains out of the home. Also downstairs are a surprisingly modern kitchenette, two conference rooms where the Ehmkes conduct farm business, a bathroom and a utility room. Up a contemporary set of steel stairs is the home's second floor, where both its bedrooms and a second bath are located. The look of the decor is both modern and folksy: sleek kitchen cabinets are finished with animal antler handles; a ceiling fan sports clear plastic blades where it hangs from the wooden-slatted ceiling; animal furs are slung over the steel staircase. High concept: Being a grain bin, the roof is tall--31 feet to be precise. This gives the interior a unique and vaulted look . View from above: Looking down, the circular home looks almost like a lighthouse...one without a light that was built to hold 25,000 bushels of grain . Mixed metal: Instead of the cold, galvanized steel, the Ehmkes covered the ceilings in wooden slats with copper trim . Though there was only room for a galley style kitchen, the Kansas home was built with round rooms that give a feeling of roominess . For more videos, please go to HGTV . And to complement the home's circular structure, how else to construct each cozy room but round? 'We wanted round rooms in a round house, so this is what we came up with,' Louise Ehmke told HGTV's You Live in What? While odd, the structure's non-tradition materials come with perks. For instance, with galvanized steel adorning the entire facade and roof, they require zero upkeep. There were challenges, though. Specifically, they had to think outside the box to put a rectangular porch and balcony on the totally circular home. Despite the head-scratching moments, all the typical amenities are in the home, which has central heat, central air, wall-to-wall carpet and running water. 'We wanted round rooms in a round house, so this is what we came up with,' Louise Ehmke told HGTV's You Live in What? Cozy: The upstairs of the home has two bedrooms and a bathroom . Farm bills: The downstairs features two conference areas where the Ehmkes can conduct farm business .",Louise and Vance Ehmke saw a cozy opportunity within the 31-foot galvanized steel structure on their Dighton wheat farm .
"Super-hydrating coconut water may have been the health drink to be seen with this year. But in 2015, it’s birch water, a drink extracted from silver birch trees, that looks set to overtake it in the popularity stakes. Why? Well, it’s thanks to its array of potential health and beauty benefits. With only 18 calories per 100ml, birch water contains lots of important, naturally occurring nutrients, such as antioxidant vitamin C, rehydrating potassium, immune system-boosting zinc, and copper — thought to have anti-ageing benefits. The thin, watery sap is tapped from birch tree trunks in early spring and has been a popular drink and herbal remedy in Russia, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia and even some parts of Northern China for centuries. Scroll down for video . The thin, watery sap is tapped from birch tree trunks (pictured) in early spring and has been a popular drink in areas such as Russia and Northern China for centuries thanks to it's health benefits . Credited with helping a range of maladies, from high cholesterol to flu, kidney stones, headaches, eczema, cellulite and dandruff, birch sap is also considered to have powerful hydrating and detoxifying effects. No wonder it’s recently become the fashionable health drink du jour in the U.S., where birch water is now found not just in cafes, gyms and healthfood stores, but is even on sale in petrol station chiller cabinets. Currently only available online in the UK, it is expected to take off here next year, becoming as ubiquitous as coconut water. According to Professor Barbara Maher (pictured), the trees were able to absorb more than 50 per cent of the particulate dust — linked to respiratory problems — from passing traffic, much more than other species . But what, exactly, is in this magic elixir and why does it have such an impressive reputation? According to the website of Byarozavik, one of the biggest American birch water brands, the basic nutritional profile of birch water is very similar to its coconut cousin — but with a couple of impressive nutritional extras. It is also infused with natural sugars, protective antioxidant vitamins, hydrating electrolytes (nutrients like potassium that help the body to rehydrate itself) and trace minerals such as copper, calcium, zinc and magnesium. Unlike coconut water, birch water also contains compounds called saponins, which are said to have powerful cholesterol-reducing properties. Unlike coconut water (pictured), birch water also contains compounds called saponins, which are said to have powerful cholesterol-reducing properties . ‘Saponins are found mainly in legumes such as soya beans and peas,’ says Azmina Govindji, of the British Dietetic Association. ‘There is some research to suggest that saponins may help to lower cholesterol levels, although these claims have still not been approved by the European Food Safety Authority.’ The other super-ingredient that birch water boasts and coconut water does not is xylitol — a sweetener with 40 per cent fewer calories than sugar. Used commercially as a low-calorie sweetener in chewing gum, toothpastes and mouthwashes, xylitol — which reduces tooth decay and strengthens enamel — is found in useful amounts (around 1 to 2 per cent) — in birch water. So where does birch sap come from? Most of the commercially sold birch water is sustainably harvested, by hand, in huge organic forests in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. Byarozavik water, for example, comes mostly from Belarus, while Sealand Birk, another popular brand, comes from Finland. The window for harvest is incredibly short and unpredictable: only a few weeks in early spring, when the climate is right and the sap starts to run up the trees to nourish budding leaves, will supply large quantities of the water. Depending on the weather, and how well the trees have been growing, up to four gallons of sap can be taken from a tree for several consecutive days. It is collected in much the same way as maple syrup — from a simple tap driven into the trunk. The trees are then carefully plugged so as not to damage them. Unlike maple syrup, which is boiled down to intensify its sweetness, birch water is usually bottled with no more than a little light pasteurisation to extend its shelf life. The result tastes very fresh — like super-clean spring water, with a subtle underlying sweetness and woody aftertaste. Byarozavik birch water (pictured) originates from Belarus and is one of the biggest American birch water brands and has a similar nutritional profile to coconut water . It would be all too easy to be cynical, but it’s worth remembering that birch extracts have been widely used, and valued for their natural health benefits — particularly for urinary tract problems, arthritis and hair loss — for hundreds of years. And a recent study by Lancaster University, also showed the tree’s amazing detoxifying capabilities when they planted silver birch trees between a street of houses and a busy road. According to Professor Barbara Maher, the trees were able to absorb more than 50 per cent of the particulate dust — linked to respiratory problems — from passing traffic, much more than other species, such as oak. So should we all rush out to buy birch water? Azmina Govindji says: ‘It’s definitely healthier than sugary soft drinks, even if some of the more sensational health claims can’t yet be substantiated.’","Coconut water, the trendy drink of this year, has been overtaken .

"It's the fashion portfolio of an Australian jihadist. Sharky Jama, from Melbourne, has traded in a 'budding' modelling career for a life devoted to the Islamic State in the Middle East, according to a report. The Australian reported that Jama and friend, former La Trobe University student Yusuf Yusuf, claim to have fled Australian for the key IS outposts of Fallujah, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, respectively. In various pictures published by his modelling agency, Jama, of Somalian descent, is seen posing for photographs in smart casual clothing. Scroll down for video . Decked out in smart casual wear, these are some of the modelling pictures of a Melbourne man who claims to have joined the Islamic State . Some pictures of Jama, above, feature him sauntering down laneways wearing a fedora, while others show him posing in high-top sneakers and colourful scarfs . In a series of professional photographs, he is seen showing off high-topped leather boots, cargo pants and a colourful scarf on a picturesque Australian beach. In other pictures, he gazes down the barrel of the camera, a patterned fedora tipped forward on his head as he saunters down a laneway wearing a short-sleeve dress shirt and pants. His marketing card describes his chest, waist and collar measurements as well as his height (5'11""), suit size (38R) and shoe size (10.5). Jama's role in Fallujah - the first major city to fall to the Islamic State in 2014 - is not known, but is no doubt very different to his Australian occupation. The Federal government believes more than 70 Australians have fled to join the fighting in Iraq and Syria and the passports of more than 100 others have been cancelled. Counter-terrorism researcher Dr Anne Aly, from Curtin University, told Daily Mail Australia the young men matched the 'typical' profile of Australians joining the Islamic State. 'That is pretty much a very typical profile, young men who for all intents and purposes seem to be quite well integrated... but then there's something that turns them'. 'It might take a year, it might take six months and if they continue down that path and become more and more radicalised they get to the point where they're ready to take action'. From Melbourne to the Middle East: Jama claims he has moved to Fallujah, one of the first cities to fall to the Islamic State terror group's initial onslaught . While many Australians have taken up arms on behalf of the Islamic State, and several have died, others have joined the terrorist group's propaganda arm. Last week, it was reported that a western Sydney man has joined the organisation's media arm, which produces its slick, high-definition propaganda packages for broadcast and upload. The man is understood to be working as a video editor. He described his life as 'pretty typical' in an interview with The Australian newspaper. 'I have a job, I live in a HQ, eat, sleep, work, hope an airstrike gets me so I can be Shaheed (martyred),' he was quoted saying. Two Australian nationals have featured in Islamic State videos - the so-called 'Ginger Jihadi', Abdullah Elmir, 17 and Zakaria Raad, 22. Elmir has not appeared in a video since October, when he was broadcast wearing military fatigues and surrounded by chanting Islamic State militants. Raad was reported killed shortly after his appearance in a July recruitment video with other militants.

"Named by rivals: Vincent Omari, 22, was said to be a member of Lizard Squad, which has claimed responsibility for hacking into the PlayStation and Xbox networks. He denied the accusation . Three rival hacking groups have called a ceasefire after admitting their Christmas attack on Xbox and Playstation gamers 'took it too far'. The attack - said to be carried out by a group called Lizard Squad, among others - left 160 million users unable to use their consoles, including children who had just received them as Christmas presents. Microsoft's Xbox live which has more than 40 million subscribers was disabled for around 24hrs. Meanwhile, some of Sony's 110 million users were still reporting problems on Sunday afternoon. Sky News reports that Lizard Squad, rival hackers from the Anonymous group, Finest Squad group, and controversial internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom debated the attack in a video uploaded to YouTube. A hacker from the Anonymous group said: 'We care about the status of Xbox and Playstation, and we want to make sure that gamers stay connected for as long as possible. Kim Dotcom said the attack had overshadowed good work of hackers. 'I think that this attack on Christmas and on kids around the world, the hacker image has suffered,' he said. 'I think we should talk about the impact that this attack had on kids worldwide and I want to make sure that we leave this call with some conclusions and agreements that this type of thing won't happen again. 'Hacking is one thing but taking down an entire gaming network when people have just got their Christmas gifts is taking it a notch too far.' At the end of the video, the groups declare a 'ceasefire'. It has emerged that the FBI is investigating an alleged member of the Lizard Squad hacking group. The teenager is said to be named Julius Kivimaki and who goes by 'ryanc' online. Kivimaki is said to be 16 or 17 years old and lives in Finland, DailyDot.com reports. The comments come after British man who was named as one of the hackers who carried out the Christmas Day cyber attack on game consoles is believed to have posted online about his fears of 'ending up in jail'. Vincent Omari was last night said by a rival group to be a member of Lizard Squad, which has claimed responsibility for hacking into the PlayStation and Xbox networks. About 160 million users were left unable to use their consoles, including children who had just received them as Christmas presents. Last night Mr Omari, 22, denied the accusation. Speaking outside his parents' home in Twickenham, South-West London, he said: 'I am not a member of Lizard Squad. I am not one of the hackers. It is a case of mistaken identity.' However, in messages believed to have been posted by Omari, a Twitter user with the tag @VinnSec admitted he was the 'spokesperson for the group', adding that police knew about cyber attack 'and they have all my info if needed'. Another tweet from the account read: 'Let's see what happens next, I wonder if I'll end up in jail for representing lizardsquad.' Earlier, Mr Omari spoke to Sky News and presented himself as 'an independent security analyst', without any suggestion of him being a member of the hacking group. However, on BBC Radio 5 Live, an unnamed man with an identical voice who said he had just turned 22 admitted being part of the attack. Mr Omari turned 22 on Christmas Eve. A second Lizard Squad member has been identified online as a 16-year-old grammar schoolboy in Kent. Meanwhile, a Finnish man in the hacking group claimed the attack was simply designed to expose the poor security of PlayStation and Xbox. Calling himself Ryan, he said just three people masterminded the attack and felt no guilt at forcing 'a couple of kids to spend their time with their families instead of playing games.' Ryan told Sky News: 'We have a massive capability to take down networks like this. Fears: In messages believed to have been posted by Omari, a Twitter user with the tag @VinnSec said: 'Let's see what happens next, I wonder if I'll end up in jail for representing lizardsquad.' Claiming responsibility: In a brazen television interview, the man (pictured), who went by the name 'Ryan', said he and a small group launched the Christmas Day cyber attack on computer games consoles . 'One of the big aspects was raising awareness regarding the low state of computer security at these companies. These companies make tens of millions every month from subscriber fees – they should have more funding to be able to protect against these attacks.' The Xbox status page said yesterday that Microsoft services had been restored, while Sony's PlayStation said it was getting to grips with the issue. The hacking meant that downloaded games could not be played and gamers could not compete against others around the world. Ryan said: 'It is sort of a game for us, I have to admit. I completely understand that it's a bit unethical.' Meanwhile, another hacking gang has published details of more than 13,000 users of websites including those run by PlayStation, Xbox and Amazon. The group posted username and password details as well as credit-card numbers and expiry dates. They left a message on Twitter saying they had done it 'for the Lulz', meaning 'for laughs'.","Vincent Omari was named by rival group as being member of Lizard Squad .

"It's a coming together of two of the biggest, and arguably most controversial, names in Australian political history with Clive Palmer turning to the son of a Queensland parliamentary icon to revive his party's flagging influence, ahead of next year's state election. The Palmer United Party (PUP) announced that John Bjelke-Petersen, the son of former long-time premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, will lead the Queensland arm of the party to the 2015 election. Clive Palmer is hoping the appointment will help turn around flagging fortunes of his embattled party, which has been beset by internal wrangling, particularly on a federal level, in recent months. Scroll down for video . The Palmer United Party (PUP) announced that John Bjelke-Petersen, the son of former long-time premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, will lead the Queensland arm of the party to the 2015 election . John Bjelke-Petersen stood in the 2013 federal election for Mr Palmer in the seat of Maranoa, claiming more than 13 per cent of the primary vote, ultimately losing out to LNP MP Bruce Scott . Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer, left, pictured with John Bjelke-Petersen back in June, 2013. Bjelke-Petersen had just been endorsed as a Palmer United Party federal candidate for the seat of Maranoa in south-west Queensland. He was unsuccessful at the election . Two of Queensland's political heavyweights. Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and Clive Palmer. The ex-Premier's son has now taken the reins for Mr Palmer's political party in his home state . The PUP had been without a state leader in Queensland since October after its two sitting MPs, Alex Douglas and Carl Judge, quit the party. 'Campbell Newman and his government have failed Queensland and Queenslanders,' Mr Bjelke-Petersen said. 'It is time that Queenslanders were represented by a government focused on building the state's economy, creating jobs and providing opportunities for local industries.' Mr Palmer will be hoping Mr Bjelke-Petersen can turn around the fortunes of the Queensland arm of his party following the embarrassing defections by Dr Douglas and Mr Judge. Dr Douglas, the Queensland PUP's inaugural leader, quit in August citing concerns over the way candidates were being selected in what he termed an 'old boy's club'. Yeerongpilly MP Mr Judge only lasted two months as state leader before also leaving the party in October, saying he felt he could better serve his constituents as an independent. Mr Palmer had previously said he was seeking a 'strong character' to lead his party in Queensland and believed Mr Bjelke-Petersen was the best man for the job. 'Mr Bjelke-Petersen is just the person the party needs, he is a real leader who will be able to deliver real results for all Queenslanders,' he said in a statement. Mr Bjelke-Petersen's father, Sir Joh, was Queensland's longest-serving premier, holding office from 1968 to 1987. Mr Palmer served as the campaign director of the National Party when Joh Bjelke-Petersen was returned as Queensland premier in 1983 and 1986 and it's widely thought that Sir Joh's politics also influenced the mining magnate. Sir Joh's time in office was considered highly controversial and ended in shame, with state ministers and Queensland's police commissioner jailed for corruption offences after the high-profile Fitzgerald Inquiry into police corruption. Mr Bjelke-Petersen quit the Liberal National Party in 2013 citing his disgust at a perceived lack of support by the Newman Government for regional Queensland. Clive Palmer is hoping John Bjelke-Petersen can lift his party's flagging fortunes in Queensland . Kingaroy on May 3, 2005.

He then stood in the 2013 federal election for Mr Palmer in the seat of Maranoa, claiming more than 13 per cent of the primary vote, ultimately losing out to LNP MP Bruce Scott. His appointment as leader comes a month after it was announced he'll stand against incumbent and Queensland deputy premier Jeff Seeney in the seat of Callide at the upcoming state election. It's been a few months of dissent among the ranks and major dilemmas for Clive Palmer. Among them, his media adviser appearing in court over the alleged kidnapping of a bank boss, the defection of outspoken Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie and allegations he used Chinese government money to fund his political campaign.","Clive Palmer hopes to lift flagging fortunes of his PUP team in Queensland .

"Miranda Hart's height has caused her TV character no end of trouble – even earning her the nickname Queen Kong. But one disgruntled viewer has complained to the BBC that Miss Hart's sitcom ridicules tall women ... despite the fact that it is written by its 6ft star. The bizarre comment was revealed by the BBC Trust in a report containing some of the oddest complaints it received last year. The BBC has been accused of showing bias against tall women - such as six-foot tall Miranda Hart - and promoting a 'gay agenda' One complaint to the BBC accused the corporation of unfairly ridiculing tall women in its programmes . Agenda? Three complaints were made against BBC One show Doctor Who, accusing it of 'promoting homosexuality' Three concerned the family favourite Doctor Who, accusing it of 'promoting homosexuality'. Peter Capaldi's Doctor and his assistant, played by Jenna Coleman, are occasionally joined on their adventures by a lesbian lizard-woman, Madame Vastra, and her human wife Jenny. Others were concerned by the lack of happy marriages in other BBC dramas, while Americanisms, poor grammar and the use of metric instead of imperial measurements also raised the audience's ire. The return of Jonathan Ross to Radio 2, six years after the Sachsgate affair, prompted ten complaints – while on Radio 4, The Archers was deemed too 'unrealistic'. Even The Great British Bake Off was condemned, for an inappropriate use of the Hallelujah Chorus, while the stars of Last Tango in Halifax were castigated for taking their eyes off the road while driving. Some perceived 'religious bias' in BBC sports coverage which showed footballers crossing themselves. Others took issue with Match of the Day's alleged preferential treatment of Manchester United – with the programme also accused of being anti-Stoke City. A 'lesbian' encounter between a lizard and a woman in Doctor Who was broadcast earlier this year . Misery: Popular soap EastEnders was in the firing line by viewers who complained about it having 'man-eating characters' Peter Jones should not have called an entrepreneur a 'numpty' on Dragons' Den, one complainant said . A further complaint was lodged against the show by a viewer who thought it should not have aired footage of a supporter falling over. Concerning strong language, one Dragons' Den fan was moved to write in after Peter Jones mocked an entrepreneur – by calling him a 'numpty'. Of the 13,688 complaints made to the BBC between last February and this September, 12,000 were serious enough to go through a formal internal process – but hundreds were dismissed at an early stage. The trust said this occurred when there was a lack of evidence – or the complaint in question was deemed too trivial. A BBC spokesman said: 'The complaints framework that the BBC Trust put in place in 2012 allows the BBC to close down, after an initial response, complaints that for example are hypothetical, use abusive language, fail to cite any evidence or breaches of the BBC's editorial guidelines. 'Only about 10 per cent of complaints fall into this category and if complainants are unhappy they can appeal to the BBC Trust.'","Furious BBC viewers complained about Doctor Who having a 'gay agenda'

"White House Press Secretary Jay Carney wound up with egg on his face Monday as he told reporters that President Barack Obama first learned from a TV news report that his Veterans Administration was denying medical care to vets with secret off-the-books-waiting lists. But new evidence emerged this morning that his transition team was notified five years ago about how VA medical centers' official wait-list times bore little resemblance to reality and risked denying military heroes critical health care. The Washington Times reported . Monday that waiting times at veterans' medical facilities were known to . be wildly inaccurate at the end of the George W. Bush administration. By the time Obama's transition team got a post-election briefing from . the VA at the end of 2008, scheduling failures were already reaching a . critical point. The newspaper received a copy of that briefing through a Freedom Of Information Act request. Obama has come under fire before for saying he was made aware of scandal-worthy shortcomings in his own administration by watching television, including the IRS tea party-targeting scandal that rocked Washington 12 months ago and the Operation Fast and Furious saga that has tainted his Justice Department for years. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that the White House 'learned about' the growing VA scandal 'through the reports' in the news, contrary to a report released on Monday that shows Obama has known about the scandal since he was elected . First of many flashbacks: Facing revelations that his IRS had played political favorites and intentionally hamstrung tea party groups, Obama said that he 'first learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this.' That was also the White House's excuse today for not acting to improve veterans' care sooner . The American Legion and other veterans advocacy groups are hopping mad about an under-the-table waiting list scandal that appears to have cost dozens of lives in just one Phoenix medical center . Suicides: Psychiatrist Margaret Moxness told Fox News on Monday that she believes a West Virginia VA hospital?s appointment system was so dysfunctional that at least two veterans took their own lives . A CNN reporter asked Carney on Monday when the president was 'first made aware ... of these fraudulent lists that were being kept to hide the wait times' at VA medical centers. 'You mean the specific allegations,' Carney asked, 'that I think were reported first by your news network out of Phoenix, I believe?' 'We learned about them through the reports. I will double check if that is not the case. But that is when we learned about them and that is when I understand Secretary Shinseki learned about them, and he immediately took the action that he has taken.' After the Operation Fast and Furious scandal broke, Obama responded to national outrage in an interview broadcast by CNN's John King on October 12, 2011, similarly saying he was out of the loop until he turned on his television. 'There have been problems, you know,' the president said then. 'I heard on the news about this story that – Fast and Furious, where allegedly guns were being run into Mexico, and ATF knew about it, but didn't apprehend those who had sent [the guns].' A few months into his presidency, Obama's White House approved an unannounced New York City  flyover by Air Force One, with a fighter jet following closely, in order to capture a photograph of the iconic plane over the Statue of Liberty. Some buildings were evacuated and emergency phone lines were jammed as panicked New Yorkers feared a terror attack was imminent. 'It was a mistake,' the president said on April 28, 2009, the day after the flight. 'It was something we found out about along with all of you. And it will not happen again.' Last year on May 14, Carney told reporters that Obama had learned about his Department of Justice seizing two months' worth of Associated Press journalists' phone records 'from news reports yesterday, on the road.' 'We don't have any independent knowledge of that,' Carney insisted. That punt came just one day after Obama himself told the Washington press corps during a joint press conference with UK Prime Minister David Cameron that he was in the dark – until it hit news reports – that the Internal Revenue Service had targeted . conservative nonprofit groups for special inquisitions when they applied . for tax-exempt status. 'I first learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this,' he said in the East Room of the White House on May 13, 2013. 'I think it was on Friday.  And this is pretty straightforward.' 'I've got no patience with it,' Obama said moments later. 'I will not tolerate it. And we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this.' Human face: This month Army veteran Kryn Miner was buried in Essex, Vt. His widow Amy Miner, third from left, believes the Veterans Affairs health system should have done more to help him as he struggled with PTSD. He was shot to death by one of their children in April after he threatened to kill the entire family . In 2011 Obama told CNN that he first 'heard on the news about & Operation Fast and Furious, where allegedly guns were being run into Mexico, and ATF knew about it' The president told reporters in 2009 that he found out along with reporters that his administration has approved an unannounced Air Force One flyover in NYC that spooked commuters and lit up 911 phone lines with terror-attack fears . White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer told Sunday . morning talk show audiences the following weekend that Obama was first informed 'when it came . out in the news.' A year later, accused IRS targeting instigator Lois Lerner has been held in contempt of Congress and her fate rests with Attorney General Eric Holder. A criminal investigation in the  Department of Justice, which has issued no findings, is being managed by an attorney who donated thousands of dollars to Obama's political campaigns. Obama's reputation for using the news media as his own coal-mine canary reached comic proportions that week when 'The Daily Show' host Jon Stewart carped that 'I wouldn’t be surprised if President Obama learned Osama bin Laden had been killed when he saw himself announce it on television.' Some Republicans are fearing déjà vu as the VA medical scandal gathers steam. 'This is becoming a pattern,' a senior Republican Senate aide told MailOnline on Monday. 'The president supposedly learns about it while channel-surfing, tells us how outraged he is, and then what? Buries it?' Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki is under fire as his agency's health system seems to be coming apart at the seams and the White House claims it didn't know . 'That might wash with the tea party, but not with veterans. No one around here is inclined to let that happen.' The Veterans Affairs Department briefing given to Obama's transition team after his first presidential election victory warned specifically that its own medical appointment scheduling practices were putting lives in danger. 'This is not only a data integrity issue in which [Veterans Health Administration] reports unreliable performance data,' the transition report read; 'it affects quality of care by delaying – and potentially denying — deserving veterans timely care.' It also recommended a series of tests that would compare doctor appointments in veterans' official medical records with appointment times recorded in the VA's computer system. As the VA scandal gathers momentum, doctors are beginning to put a human face on the tragedy. Dr. Margaret Moxness, a whistle-blowing psychiatrist, told the Fox News Channel on Monday that she believes a West Virginia VA hospital where she once worked had an appointment system so dysfunctional that at least two veterans took their own lives. Bureaucrats, she said, 'don't really experience what the doctors and nurses are experiencing, which is the suffering and the pain and the death.' Moxness explained that her patients often had to wait months for follow-up appointments after she prescribed antidepressant medications that require check-ups after 10 days. Some couldn't wait out their psychological pain and committed suicide. VA Undersecretary for Health Robert Petzel resigned on Friday a day after telling a congressional committee that he was aware of a 2010 memo warning about the problems, which materialized in a Phoenix, Arizona VA medical center when as many as 40 veterans died while awaiting critical care. Computer records indicated that the vets were not on a waiting list at all. Carney hinted Monday that Obama is likely to address the new scandal. 'I'm sure you'll hear from him at some point on this issue soon,' he said.","White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the president didn't know about explosive Veterans Administration scandal until he saw news reports .

"A campaign group in a village that was split over noisy church bells branded 'prejudicial to health' believes it has come up with a solution - a device to make them ring more gently. The bells at St Mary's Church in Ashwell, Herts have been chiming every 15 minutes for around 118 years. But a row broke out in the village after some families complained when the bells started again after being silenced for repairs two years ago. Device: Chairman of Ashwell Parish Council Mark White confirmed that Save Ashwell Church Chimes had raised £3,000 funds for the new device for St Mary's Church (pictured) Following an investigation by North Herts District Council it decided the chimes were 'prejudicial to health' with some villagers claiming they couldn't get a good night's sleep. Last December Ashwell Parish Council stopped them chiming every 15 minutes between 11pm and 7am to avoid being issued with a noise abatement notice, but they could still ring on the hour. Chairman of Ashwell Parish Council Mark White confirmed that Save Ashwell Church Chimes had raised £3000 funds for the new device. A Diocese of St Albans spokesman said the clock chimes are the responsibility of the parish council, but the chancellor of the diocese would have to give permission for the device to be fitted. After the decision by the council, campaign group Save Ashwell Church Chimes called for a referendum and it was given 'at least six months' to find another solution. The group said it believes it has now found a compromise . Wayne Francis, of Clockwise Restorations designed a hammer device to control the volume of the chimes overnight. Francis, who has an engineering background and has worked on church bells before, contacted Brown to offer the solution. He plans to fit a different hammer which will produce a softer sound when it strikes the bells. The hammer will be controlled by a timer already fitted in the clock tower to switch off the chimes at night. Noise: Wayne Francis, of Clockwise Restorations designed a hammer device to control the volume of the chimes overnight . The device is adjustable so he can ensure the chimes are below the level deemed acceptable by the World Health Organisation . Campaigner Maria Brown said everyone who had seen the prototype was impressed and the disagreement 'should be resolved soon'. The mother-of-two said: 'We worked so hard to save the chimes and find a solution to please as many people as possible. 'This device is really good news. I hope there are no objections and we get good new on January 13 as it is also my birthday.' Brown, who now lives in St Neots, Cambs added: 'When we would go out as teenagers we would listen for the chimes so we knew when we had to be home. 'People who live in towns might not understand it, but the chimes are part of village life. It was such a shame a minority felt they had to spoils it for everyone else. But there were people having disturbed sleep. 'No one wanted to lose chimes all together - even the people who could not sleep.' But Gwen Pack, 80, who has brought up her children in the village, said she has become 'disillusioned' by the ongoing row. The retired post office worker said: 'I don't know why people move into a village knowing there are bells and country smells and then moan about it. 'I have lived here very many years and I miss the chimes when they are not working. It is part of village life. 'I am so disillusioned about it. My son and I have stopped talking about it.' The bells, which chime through St Mary's clock mechanism, have been ringing since around 1896. Grade I listed St Mary's church was built during the 14th century and its tower is the tallest in Hertfordshire with its wood and leaden spike rising to 76 ft (53.6m). The church was presented with a three-faced clock by Mr J Westrope in 1896. It is said the side facing The Bury was left blank so that the Bury and Brewery workers would not be clockwatchers. Brown added: 'It's an unbelievable device, because unlike others that churches have used, it doesn't muffle the hammer, which quietens the bells 24/7. 'Perhaps with a mechanism like this, maybe other churches around the country may one day see the end to Noise Abatement Order on their bells.' She added: 'If this device is installed and solves the problem then we plan to approach other churches where bells have been silenced.' St Mary’s is one of a number of churches to have been silenced in recent years following bell noise complaints. In September, St Martin’s Church in Liskeard, Cornwall, was at threat of being silenced after a complaint from a resident who lived 300 yards away. Graham Dutnall, 60, recorded the bells' sound at at 85 decibels, as loud as passing traffic, and told the council they were 'destroying his peace and quiet'. Last year, meanwhile, the bells of All Saints’ Church in Croxley Green, Hertfordshire, were silenced from 11pm to 7am after a single complaint from a resident whose sleep was being disturbed. But church leaders said the automated system, which meant the bells went off once an hour, could not be set to operate at specific times and so would have to be deactivated. A month before this, an environment protection team suggested St Andrew Blackadder Church, in North Berwick, East Lothian, silenced its bells between the same hours. This again stemmed from a single complaint. In 2011, a pensioner confronted a group of six professional bell-ringers before locking them in a church tower after the noise took its toll. The unknown elderly man swore at the group having climbed the narrow staircase to the belfry of St John the Evangelist Church in Sharow, near Ripon, North Yorkshire. After protesting to the bell-ringers - who had travelled from the south of England especially - and threatening to damage their cars, the man then closed the door to the tower and wedged it shut with a piece of wood, leaving the half-dozen musicians, aged between 46 and 65, trapped. They were shut in for half an hour on Sunday before being freed by a member of the church who heard banging from the trapdoor when she went to lock up.","Clockwise Restorations designed a hammer device to control the volume .

"British tourists  were among thousands stranded in the French Alps today as heavy snowfalls left roads impassable and caused at least one fatality. Worst hit was the Savoie region in south east France, where up to 15,000 people were estimated to be affected. A 27-year-old man died when his car fell into a ravine in the Belledonne mountain range. Temporary shelters have been set up in sports centres and town halls in 12 towns to cope with those who were forced to abandon their cars. Scroll down for video . Around 15,000 vehicles were stuck in the French Alps today as heavy snowfalls left roads impassable . Hundreds of British holidaymakers travelling from the Channel ports to ski resorts were among those caught up in the chaos. France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said those considering driving should 'exercise the utmost caution' and only travel 'if absolutely necessary'. Edward Moss, who was travelling from his home in north London to a resort in Switzerland, said: 'Traffic stopped moving as we approached the mountains. Cars were skidding, and the situation became extremely dangerous. 'We checked into a hotel early on as the advice was that we shouldn't take any risks.'

'No emergency services to be seen whatsoever or anyone handing out hot drinks and food to weary drivers, many of whom are with small children en route to their holidays, stuck on the road in freezing temperatures. 'The situation is very frustrating. The biggest drama of all is of course most people's phones have run out of battery so they are getting anxious about other friends who are also travelling at this time, and letting family know they are fine.' A spokesman for France's meteorological centre said more snow was expected and 'significant re-freezing'. The country declared an orange weather alert - one step under the maximum red alert - in 19 departments. Storms packing gusts of up to 160 kilometres per hour forced the temporary closure of France's port of Calais on the English Channel and the suspension of car ferries to and from Britain.

"Bill Cosby has refused to address the scores of rape allegations that have been hurled at him in recent months, but that doesn't mean he isn't working to clear his name. The comedian is allegedly paying private investigators six-figure fees to dig up dirt on the more than two dozen women who have come forward to accuse him of rape, according to a report in the New York Post. A source told the paper that Cosby has hired a Glendale, California, firm to discredit his many alleged victims' stories. Scroll down for video . Hitting back: Bill Cosby has allegedly hired a team of private investigators to dig up dirt on the many women accusing him of rape . Cosby allegedly spoke with his legal and public relations teams about the sex scandal, and his response to it, at a recent meeting. 'If you’re going to say to the world that I did this to you, then the world needs to know, ‘What kind of person are you? Who is this person that’s saying it?’ ' Cosby said, according to an anonymous source who was present at the meeting. 'You can’t say that I put something in your coffee, threw you in a cab and then you go on and live a high-profile life, a famous life and you never complain. You mean you never reported it to the police? You never tell anyone?' Cosby continued, referring to one of his accusers, Beverly Johnson. Johnson claimed that Cosby raped her after slipping a drug into her cappuccino during a visit to his home in the 1980s. Another source who says they have worked with Cosby for at least a decade confirmed the tactic and said it has already been successful in finding information to discredit both Johnson and another alleged victim, Katherine McKee. Inconsistencies: A source says the tactic has already been successful in turning up evidence to discredit claims made by Beverly Johnson (left) and Katherine McKee (right) The team discovered that Johnson's live-in boyfriend at the time only heard her say nice things about Cosby and that McKee, an ex-girlfriend of Sammy Davis Jr, wrote posts praising the comedian online after the alleged rape, according to the Post. In a published interview, McKee also once said she is 'used to lying'. McKee, now 65, is the latest woman to publicly come forward to accuse Cosby, saying the comedian raped her in a Michigan hotel room in the early 1970s after inviting her to a party on a boat in Detroit. The former actress, who appeared on Sanford and Son and even The Bill Cosby Show, never spoke of the incident in public before last week. 'It was a rape, but it seemed so strange to call it that. We think of rape as a stranger who attacks you in a parking lot,' McKee, now a casting agent, told the New York Daily News. 'I chalked it up to another powerful person in Hollywood who just felt he could take what he wanted from women.' Cosby's attorney Martin Singer would not confirm whether the comedian had hired any private detectives.","The comedian has allegedly hired a firm in Glendale, California to discredit the women accusing him of rape ."
"As King's Cross reopened today, disgruntled passengers forced to cancel their journeys yesterday were outraged when crammed services were held outside the station for up to an hour due to signal failure. Scores took to social media to share their fury after being held outside Finsbury Park station - where hundreds flocked after King's Cross closed yesterday - because of the technical fault. After waiting outside the north London train station for up to an hour, passengers were then not allowed to disembark as trains were shunted onto another line to make their way to Kings Cross. Elsewhere those travelling on cross-country services had to stand in carriage aisles for up to five hours after losing seat reservations in yesterday's disruption. Engineers were forced to use red and yellow flags to signal trains in and out of the station today as the chaos at King's Cross station continued . Passengers complained of being held outside King's Cross at Finsbury Park for up to an hour today . The Office of Rail Regulation has launched an investigation into why engineers were able to continue working on the tracks yesterday, cancelling the journeys of hundreds of passengers. Trains were leaving Kings Cross today again as planned, though several others were held for up to an hour at nearby Finsbury Park while waiting to arrive at the central London station. Engineers were forced to use red and yellow flags to manually wave trains in and out of the station this evening as tensions flared. East Coast trains told customers to expect delays of up to 20minutes, though passengers said delays were closer to an hour. 'So close and yet so far...10 mins away but now in a queue to get in to King's Cross due to signal failure at Finsbury Park,' said one Twitter user, while another angered: 'Now stuck at Finsbury Park, waiting for our train to be shunted onto another track. 45 minutes, and counting.' Yesterday's planned improvements on tracks leading into the station overran, scuppering the journeys of hundreds of people. 'The immediate priority is for Network Rail to ensure disrupted parts of the railways are back up and running again for passengers as soon as possible,' a spokesman for the ORR told MailOnline. Passengers on trains to Edinburgh from London, one of the worst affected routes yesterday, complained of overcrowding as they were forced to stand in aisles and sit on the floor despite purchasing tickets . 'Network Rail, working with the rest of the industry, must learn lessons and prevent problems like this happening again. 'ORR is investigating overrunning works. We will also be reviewing the standard of passenger information during disruptions - with a focus on whether passengers have been adequately informed to make alternative arrangements to their journeys or claim compensation.' 'When we got to Finsbury Park it was absolutely, utter chaos, the staff were rude, and nobody had any information.' Jane Hurn, 51, in central London . 'Any civil engineering contractor would have realised probably weeks ago that they were going to overrun and they must have realised they would be fined...there are a lot of vulnerable people here.' George Hallam at Finsbury Park . 'It is dangerously overcrowded. In health and safety terms this must be well against the law. There is not an inch of room.' Lindesay Irvine, 45, on a train from Paddington . 'The overcrowding is horrendous. There is no way of getting any food or water. It is dreadful.' Lynda Pollard, 62, on a train from Paddington . For those whose trains were cancelled yesterday East Coast invited them to join services leaving King's Cross today. But with many of services sold out, passengers who previously held seats were forced to stand in the aisles and vestibules. One family, which spent £500 on First Class tickets from Norwich to Edinburgh for a Christmas holiday, was forced to squeeze into the train's vestibule for the journey to Scotland after their train was cancelled. 'The best advice we can give customers is to look online at our delay, repay service. Under the terms of that those delayed by more than two hours can claim a full refund. 'We'll look sympathetically on them when processing refunds,' a spokesman told MailOnline. Meanwhile, angry passengers on board services into London Paddington have hit out at train operators after claiming they were packed into carriages 'like a sardine can'. Gillian Mayer, 75, from East Ham in London slammed First Great Western calling its service 'diabolical' and has vowed never to make the same journey again. She said: 'I'm absolutely fuming, the prices are astronomical and people buy the cheap tickets online beforehand but I don't have access to the internet. They've reserved the seats online so I have to go for whatever is left. 'It's absolutely diabolical. I was suppose to get the 12:42 from Newton Abbott in Devon but I got there early and asked the man what platform the train was on, and he said he didn't think a train was running at that time, so it didn't exist. 'Luckily the 12:29 was running late, so I managed to get on that. But if I hadn't turned up early for this other phantom train, I wouldn't have got on any train at all. 'It was packed, it was like a sardine can. I had a seat but I had somebody else's face four inches from mine.' She added: 'I paid £57 for my ticket, because I have my discount card, but my son paid £87 because he doesn't have a card, and it goes up every year. I do this journey every year, and each year it has been getting worse, I don't think I'm going to do that journey again, I think I'm going to find a different way from now on.' Another rail passenger, who asked not to be named and refused to say where he had travelled from, said: 'I managed to get a seat but still the service you get for the price you pay is an absolute joke, it's really not worth it. 'I may have had a seat but it was still crammed on that train, it wasn't enjoyable that's for sure.' Services between Paddington and Reading were cancelled yesterday but resumed today, with delays expected. First Great Western warned that delays of up to 15 minutes could be expected on some journeys between Paddington and Reading and Paddington and Hayes, until the end of service today, due to over-running engineering works. Heathrow Connect services have also been cancelled by the company, which was unavailable for comment when contacted. Grant Hardy and his family of four paid £500 for First Class tickets from Norwich to Edinburgh. The family were forced to stand in the vestibule of a crowded train instead (pictured) Network Rail yesterday apologised for the chaos on its website, with managing director Robin Gisby telling passengers: 'I'm deeply sorry for the delays, upset and upheaval caused today to passengers impacted by our overrunning improvement work outside King's Cross.' The company's chief executive Mark Carne did not answer when contacted at Hampshire home today. A Network Rail source told MailOnline that questions will be asked over why it was decided to divert hundreds of people to the significantly smaller Finsbury Park station. 'Yesterday was an extraordinary situation and it put a huge amount of pressure on Finsbury Park with the closure of Kings Cross. 'This will form part of the investigation, what initially went wrong at Kings Cross and also the contingency plan that was in place,' a spokesman for Network Rail said. Finsbury Park was forced to close yesterday after crowds flooded the station in a frantic bid to get home. Women and children were left crying on the station's platform with journeys to Peterborough, normally a 90minute trip, taking more than five hours. While East Coast passengers can use their tickets until tomorrow, critics said the company should refund passengers immediately for the hassle caused by delayed rail improvements. 'This is not the time for private rail firms to hide behind the usual byzantine rules covering refunds. 'They will be paid millions for these delays by Network Rail and they must ensure that their frustrated passengers do not end up with just pennies after the horrendous delays of the past few days,' said Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the rail union TSSA. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin yesterday described the situation as 'totally unacceptable', . 'The situation on the railways this weekend has been totally unacceptable. 'Passengers must be able to trust that vital engineering works on the rail network will be completed on time. Passengers deserve no less. 'I will be asking Network Rail to set out what went wrong and how they can learn lessons, but its priority must be to get services running into King's Cross as well as Paddington.' East Coast today said it would be 'sympathetic' to passengers claiming refunds for disruption yesterday. 'We're hopeful everyone'll get to where they need to go today. We are carrying more people today as those who chose not to travel yesterday can use tickets today and tomorrow. Hundreds flocked to Finsbury Park which was forced to close down due to overcrowding as a result .

"Immigration is now consistently the most important political issue of concern to voters, pollsters have revealed. Over the past year it has moved ahead of the economy as the British public’s top priority, according to YouGov. Since May, voters have put it above or tied with the economy in every survey conducted by the organisation. At one point, in September, it was selected by 58 per cent of voters as one of the three most important issues for the country while only 48 per cent had the economy in their top three. Immigration is now consistently the most important political issue of concern to voters. Pictured: Migrants try to board a lorry near Calais . YouGov chose ‘Immigration becoming the public’s most important issue’ as one of its top five public opinion trends of 2014. Will Dahlgreen, from YouGov, said: ‘From May to December immigration was seen as the most important issue facing the country, except for on three occasions when it was tied with the economy. ‘Although immigration began to narrow the gap at the end of 2013, 2014 is the first year since 2010 when the economy has not been the top issue. ‘Immigration had an average lead of one point over the whole year, compared to a deficit of 18 in 2013 and 32 in 2012.’ Polling data also showed Europe has increased hugely as an issue of concern over recent years, from just 7 per cent of voters choosing it as an issue in June 2010 to 25 per cent in October this year. In recent months, as both immigration and Europe have soared as issues of concern, Ukip has moved up in the polls. In May it triumphed in the European elections, winning 4.3million votes and beating Labour into second place and the Tories into third. Ukip has also won two House of Commons by-elections in Rochester and Clacton after MPs Mark Reckless and Douglas Carswell defected from the Conservatives. David Cameron has responded to the rise of Ukip by promising to stop EU migrants from claiming a raft of in-work benefits, including tax credits, until they have paid into the system for four years. Over the past year, immigration has moved ahead of the economy as the British public’s top priority, according to YouGov . Both David Cameron and Ed Miliband have responded to the rise of Ukip by strengthening their positions on immigration . Ed Miliband has also attempted to toughen Labour’s line. But the party was embarrassed recently when an internal party document emerged which told activists to ‘move the conversation on’ when voters ask them about immigration. Crossbench peer Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of the MigrationWatch think tank, said: ‘These are remarkable findings. It’s simply not possible for the political class to remain in denial any longer. ‘Suggestions that those who are canvassing should simply change the subject are now clearly absurd. The public want effective answers on immigration and will see through attempts to dodge the issue.’ Labour MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk said politicians have been too slow to recognise immigration as an issue. He said he would like to see a stronger line from Labour on border controls and lowering migrant numbers. He said: ‘People have been mentioning immigration to me a lot on the doorstep, people from all different backgrounds including ethnic minorities, working class and middle class people. People feel strongly about it.’ The polling data shows how other issues have risen up the polls in the past four years. Welfare did not feature as a significant issue in 2010, but by October this year was chosen by 25 per cent of voters. Health has increased significantly as a concern to voters, while crime has declined sharply. Other trends highlighted by the pollster were the rising support for the Greens who finished the year tied with the Lib Dems on 7 per cent. It also pointed to Ed Miliband’s falling support, with one poll at the end of October registering him as less popular than Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg. YouGov also found that voters’ perceptions of how well the economy is doing peaked in August.","Immigration is the most important political issue to voters, pollsters say .
Public are more worried about Britain's borders than finances, YouGov say .
It's the first time since 2010 that the economy hasn't been the biggest issue .
Europe also soared as an issue for concern as Ukip moved up in the polls ."

"Eurostar has banned Daniel Confino for life after he was kicked off a train for complaining about the strength of his cup of tea . Eurostar has banned a passenger for life after kicking him off a train for complaining about the strength of his cup of tea. Daniel Confino, a financial expert who was instrumental in saving the foundering Eurotunnel project in the Nineties, now intends to have the ban ruled illegal at the High Court. The 56-year-old was furious to be told by email that he will never be allowed back on a Eurostar train unless he proves he can be ‘courteous and polite’. Last night the father of four described the ban as ‘ridiculous, repugnant and ‘draconian’ after trying to buy another ticket and having it cancelled. The row began when he was returning with a colleague to St Pancras on September 6 after a conference in Paris. In the buffet car he ordered two teas at £2.20 each – and asked for an extra bag so he could have a strong cuppa. However, when he was charged £2.20 just for the third tea bag, he complained. Staff refused to back down and after a heated row he left the untouched teas and extra Duchy Organic tea bag on the counter and walked off mouthing the words ‘idiotic bitches’. But the buffet car staff said they felt threatened and the train made an unscheduled stop at Ebbsfleet in Kent where Mr Confino was bundled off by police, accused of trying to steal a tea bag. Mr Confino, of Brockley, south-east London, only found out he had been banned for life after buying a single to Calais to pick up his car from a house he owns in northern France on December 3. Two days before travelling, he received an email from Eurostar telling him the ticket had been cancelled and he was banned. After calling Marc Noaro, Eurostar’s service and people director, Mr Confino emailed him to claim he was being punished for complaining about service. An hour later, he received a reply stating: ‘We have decided you should not be permitted to travel on Eurostar services. Any other booking made by you will be cancelled. The above decision is final.’ The email added that the firm would only reconsider if Mr Confino apologised in writing to the staff he rowed with and can convince them his behaviour will be ‘courteous and polite’ in future. Mr Confino was told that he will never be allowed back on a Eurostar train unless he proves he can be ‘courteous and polite’ The row started when Mr Confino, a financial expert who was instrumental in saving the foundering Eurotunnel project in the Nineties, asked buffet car staff for a an extra tea bag (file picture) Mr Confino had already threatened Eurostar with legal action over the original row, claiming he had suffered ‘degrading treatment, mental distress and anxiety’. Last night he said: ‘I am being blackmailed into making an apology and dropping my case. They are just bullies, abusing their monopoly and using brute force to require me to drop my claims. And despite all this they haven’t even changed their policy on their tea.’ Ironically, Mr Confino helped to keep the Eurotunnel dream alive when it looked as if it might fail. In 1993, when he worked at the bank Hill Samuel, the Department for Transport called him in to advise on the project as costs spiralled. He and his team managed to get extra bank funding to keep it on track. Last night, Mr Confino, who part owns the tea firm Yumchaa, said: ‘When I have a builder’s tea I like a proper stand-up job. ‘In every other situation where I have asked for an extra bag everyone has agreed – apart from Eurostar. Now they ban me. Anyone who believes in the rule of law will see this is repugnant.’ Eurostar declined to comment last night. This is an extract from the email sent to Mr Confino on December 1 by Marc Noaro, Eurostar director of service and people: . Dear Mr Confino, following our telephone conversation earlier today I confirm Eurostar’s decision not to permit you to travel on Wednesday 3 December. Eurostar will not in any way tolerate abuse of its staff. As a result of your behaviour on 6 September and your subsequent emails we have decided that, in accordance with Eurostar’s Conditions of Carriage, you should not be permitted to travel on Eurostar services. Any other booking made by you will be cancelled. We will review our decision when: . 1. You provide a written apology to the members of crew working on the 20:13 train from Paris on 6 September; and . 2. We are confident that your behaviour towards Eurostar personnel will be appropriately courteous and polite. The above decision is final.","Eurostar kicked a man off a train for complaining about strength of his tea .

"A surfer has been airlifted to hospital after being attacked and bitten by a Great White Shark off the coast of California. Kevin Swanson of Morro Bay was on his board near the Montaña de Oro State Park which is 200 miles north of Los Angeles when he was bitten by the 10ft animal. It had swum underneath the 50-year-old's board, dug teeth into his hip and then dragged him under the water. Kevin Swanson, pictured being treated by medics, on his board near the Montaña de Oro State Park which is 200 miles north of Los Angeles when he was bitten by the 10ft animal . The shark had swum underneath the 50-year-old's board, grazed his hip and then dragged him under the water. A picture of his board shows bite marks next to the tail fins . Mr Swanson was submerged for a several seconds, a witness told The Tribune, before managing to resurface. He then yelled 'shark attack' and frantically paddled back to the shore with the rest of the group. Andrew Walsh, who was surfing with Mr Swanson at the time, said when he reached the beach managed to create a tourniquet for his leg using the leash on his surfboard. He told the paper: 'It was really radical. I was about 10 feet from him, and it was absolutely quiet. … (The shark) came straight up out of the depths and got him and took him under the water. That was the amazing part: this big giant side of the shark just curving up out of the water. 'Two doctors who happened to be walking along the beach at the time ran over to help before more medical assistance arrived. Mr Walsh added: We're really blessed that he was still able to get himself to shore. I was a few feet behind him, and we grabbed him and got him out of the water, obviously, up on the sand, and very quickly these doctors where there, helping out and calling 911.' He was then airlifted to the Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center in San Luis Obispo with lacerations to his hip. Officials at the hospital said he was in a 'fair' condition as of 3pm Pacific Time. The authorities did not close the beach as a result of the attack, but instead sent out notifications to others in the area.

"An Islamic State commander offered to free James Foley in exchange for $750,000 but the US government refused, it has emerged. The general was reportedly rebuffed because America refused point blank to negotiate with terrorists - and did not even want to hear the details of his offer. A report in the New York Times also claimed that after a botched raid to free Mr Foley in July ISIS sent an envoy to Turkey to meet an American intelligence officer to discuss a deal to free him and other American hostage. But the officer refused to even meet with him even though he was told it would 'end very badly' if he did not. The disclosures will deepen the pain for the family of Mr Foley, who was executed by ISIS militants in August a video that was shared on social media. They have questioned the refusal of the US government to pay ransom demands and for threatening them with prosecution if they tried to raise the money themselves, a warning they ignored. Victim: Mr Foley was executed by ISIS militants in August a video that was shared on social media . By contrast, European governments do pay ransoms and as a result their hostages are more often returned home safely, a practice America feels encourages kidnapping. Mr Foley is thought to have been kidnapped near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Thanksgiving Day in 2012. He was not seen again until the summer when he appeared wearing an orange jumpsuit in two videos posted online by ISIS, the first threatening to kill him and the second showing his execution. The New York Times reported that a general who defected from the Syrian Air Force and now works with rebels in the country was approached in February by an ISIS commander because he wanted to leave the group. The commander said that he could get to the prison in Raqqa where Mr Foley and other American and British hostages were being held. In exchange for his assistance he wanted $750,000 and asylum in the US. According to the New York Times, the general sent an aide with this information to the US Embassy in the Turkish capital, Ankara, but he was rebuffed. The general said: 'They didn’t even want to hear the details; they rejected the proposal outright. The Americans just keep on saying, ""We don’t negotiate with terrorists.""' The Times also reported on a separate missed opportunity to free Mr Foley a few months later. After the failed American raid to free the hostages in July, ISIS sent an envoy called Sheikh Abdullah al-Jarrah al-Nasir to the Turkish city of Gaziantep where he met a US intelligence official they knew as Darren. A fighter who accompanied the Sheikh said: 'I met Darren, and he came out, but he refused to meet Sheikh Abdullah. 'I told him: ""The sheikh is here to negotiate."" Darren blamed me and said: ""We don’t meet with terrorists."" 'I told him, ""If you don’t meet with ISIS and deal with them as a state, this will end very badly."" Hostage: Mr Foley (seen in 2011) is thought to have been kidnapped near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Thanksgiving Day in 2012 . Mr Foley’s parents have openly called into question the US government’s policy of not negotiating with terrorists, which was brought in by George W Bush in 2002 in the wake of 9/11. The presidential decree also prohibits the use of intermediaries such as Qatar, a tactic that has been used by some European countries. In an interview on CNN after her son’s death, Diane Foley said: 'We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow miraculously, and he wasn’t, was he. 'I pray that our government would be willing to learn from the mistakes that were made and to acknowledge that there are better ways for American citizens to be treated.' Among the other missteps the US government made was failing to interview other hostages held with Mr Foley who had been freed and could have provided intelligence as to their whereabouts. Relatives of Peter Kassig, a humanitarian worker who was also among the hostages, were forced to try and negotiate with ISIS on their own after the US government refused. They sent a family friend to meet a man calling himself Sheikh Mohamed who said he was there to negotiate. He demanded $100,000 before talks went any further - the Times reported that they would have sought a total of $20 million. The Kassigs said that without proof of life they would not pay anything because it would involve mortgaging their house, words which enraged the sheikh. He told the family friend: 'Tell the family they will see their proof of life on TV.' Eleven days later Mr Kassig appeared in a video wearing an orange jumpsuit with a militant holding a knife next to his throat - and was later executed.","A general who defected from the Syrian Air Force and now works with rebels in the country was approached in February by an ISIS commander .

"When the car in front is driving you mad, a short sharp beep on the horn is sometimes irresistible. But Paul Samara will be thinking twice before doing that again. After sounding his horn at a police van which was moving slowly and repeatedly braking in front of him, he was handcuffed, thrown into a cell, and had his fingerprints, DNA and mugshot taken. The 34-year-old train driver, who has never been in trouble with the police in his life, was accused of abusive and threatening behaviour and charged with a public order offence. After sounding his horn at a police van which was moving slowly and repeatedly braking in front of him, Paul Samara was handcuffed, and thrown into a cell by Lancashire police . The incident led to a six-month ordeal with the threat of a conviction hanging over his head until the Crown Prosecution Service decided to drop the case just before he was due to face magistrates. While Mr Samara is relieved at the outcome, he is appalled at the way he was treated and has lost all faith in the police. ‘They were very heavy handed,’ he said. ‘I’ve never been into a police station before that night, let alone a cell, so to have my fingerprints taken and to be charged for something I hadn’t done was very upsetting. ‘For six months I was worried I would end up with a criminal conviction, that it would affect my chances of getting a job and ultimately my livelihood – it made me anxious and ill. ‘The police officers were obviously annoyed and determined that I would spend a night in the cells. They acted like bullies.’ Mr Samara, who has a partner, a five-year-old step-daughter and a baby on the way, was driving home to Blackburn after finishing his shift at Blackpool railway station at 11pm when the drama unfolded in May this year. He had pulled behind the police van, which was driving slowly through a Blackpool street, when it stopped suddenly several times, causing him to brake sharply. He had pulled behind the police van, which was driving slowly through a Blackpool street, when it stopped suddenly several times, causing him to brake . Each time, Mr Samara said, he beeped his horn instinctively. ‘For a train driver, especially because we have no brake, using the horn if there is danger is just a natural thing to do,’ he said. On the last occasion the van stopped and a policewoman got out and challenged him. ‘I didn’t shout or swear or wind my window down, but I did tell her the manner of her driving had caused me to slam on the brakes,’ Mr Samara said. He said the policewoman told him she was out looking for a missing child. She was upset about his attitude and told him: ‘When you have a problem don’t come to us as we won’t want to know.’ Mr Samara told her he was going to make a complaint about her. Then her male colleague joined her, ordered him out of his car and handcuffed him. Mr Samara was arrested and taken to the police station where he was left in the cells for two hours and eventually charged. He appeared at a preliminary court hearing but prosecutors dropped the case last month after CCTV obtained from the police station contradicted the officer’s evidence that he was threatening and abusive. He appeared at a preliminary court hearing but prosecutors dropped the case last month after CCTV obtained from the police station contradicted the officer’s evidence that he was threatening and abusive . At one point she admitted that she had lost her temper with him. Last night his solicitor, Mark Ellis, of James Murray Solicitors, said the case should never have come to court. ‘Mr Samara was simply trying to make his way home when he ran into these police officers who took umbrage at him for sounding his car horn,’ he said. ‘The CCTV we obtained clearly contradicts their account that he was shouting and being threatening. Despite this, the CPS seemed determined to take the case to court and it wasn’t until a week before the trial – after six months of anxiety for Mr Samara – they realised there was no case.’ A CPS spokesman said the decision to bring a charge had been made by Lancashire police. He said the case was reviewed, as is normal, and the CPS decided there was ‘not a realistic prospect of a conviction’. A spokesman for Lancashire police declined to comment. Mr Samara said: ‘I’m just relieved it’s all over and life can go back to some sort of normality.’","Paul Samara was handcuffed and had his fingerprints and DNA taken .

"A police force has raked in over £270,000 in the past year by selling confiscated goods on the online action website ebay. Leicestershire police became the first force in the country to use ebay to sell the seized assets of criminals which included flashy sports cars and designer jewellery. The items that were auctioned off included luxury cars, computers and clothing which the courts confirmed had  been paid for with criminal cash. Haul: Detective Inspector Paul Wenlock at Police HQ holds up a stunning Rolex watch that was auctioned off on ebay . Online store: The unusual ebay shop opened in September 2009 and the total raised since then is more than £1.2 million. Motor: This flashy silver Bentley continental GT auto 2006 sold for £32,875,00 on the online site . All the money the site generates will go back to fund crime-fighting work. Leicestershire police said it hopes it will prevent criminals from benefiting from their loot. Many of the items were confiscated thanks to tip-offs from the public, who became suspicious of people who were living the high life despite having no obvious legitimate income. Some of the items included high-powered sports cars for tens of thousands of pounds, others included designer jewellery and DVDs. The unusual ebay shop opened  in September 2009 and the total raised since then is more than £1.2 million. In the past year, it has sold an Aston Martin DB9 car for £63,000, an Audi A5 for £29,500 and a Range Rover for £15,500 and a Mercedes car for £7,751. Meanwhile, police sold a Rolex watch online for more than £13,000 and a signed autograph by legendary crooner Frank Sinatra was snapped up for £260. Paul Wenlock, head of Leicestershire Police's economic crime unit, said the site had been a 'huge success'. Watch: This rose gold Versace ladies watch with mother of pearl dial and three part rotating face had a white satin over leather strap and sold for £320 in 2011 . Diamonds: This Tiffany diamond set key pendant with a heart motif was 18 carat white gold, the pendant is suspended from a 46cm long fine chain necklace with a bolt ring clasp and sold for £621 . Loot: Detective Inspector Paul Wenlock, seen here, stands beside a crook's £95,000 car in the Highcross shopping centre, which was eventually auctioned off online . He said: 'The site is also a daily reminder we will take civil as well as criminal action to ensure criminals do not benefit from their crimes. 'In some cases, we have been able to seize goods and sell them where we have not managed to secure a criminal conviction. 'All the money the site generates goes back to fund crime-fighting work. 'Often the inquiry starts from information from members of the public. 'If you know anyone who appears to be living a lifestyle beyond their visible means, we would like to know. We can take both civil and criminal action to be sure they do not benefit from these activities.' Everything the force has sold had been seized and formally confiscated by the courts under the Proceeds of Crime Act after officers proved they were bought with criminal cash. Handbag: This leopard print Prada handbag sold for £511 and was just one of many luxury items on ebay . The cash is used to fund further crime-fighting, while some is donated to good causes, including organisations which support victims of crime. And thankfully the force's eBay seller rating – which reflects its customers' satisfaction levels – is 99.8 per cent . Police officers also use eBay to sell other items in its possession - they made £39,209 by selling surplus police equipment and £24,050 on unclaimed lost property. It's not known whether other police force's intend to follow suit.","Leicestershire police became the first force in the UK to sell goods online .

"The parents of a 21-year-old Australian jihadi bride who ran off to Syria to marry a playboy turned extremist claim she has been ‘brainwashed’. Zehra Duman, from Melbourne, reportedly married Mahmoud Abdullatif on December 11 with the pair announcing their marriage on social media with the hashtag #TheIslamicState, the Herald Sun reports. ‘She’s been brainwashed, she wasn’t like this three or four months ago,’ her father Davut Duman told the paper. Scroll down for video . Zehra Duman, from Melbourne, was reportedly just a 'normal' Turkish girl from Melbourne four months ago . The pair sickeningly showed of a gun as part of their mahr (dowry) for the bride and Duman is now believed to be living in the murderous Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa. Abdullatif fled Australia five months ago, turning his back on the nightclubs, flash cars and motorbikes that he and his friends used to enjoy. Just four months ago, Duman is said to have been a ‘normal Turkish Melbourne girl’ but she’s now reportedly spouting hate against non-Muslims on Twitter and Facebook, the Herald Sun reports. Her parents are working with authorities to try and bring her home. Her new husband, Abdullatif, has continued to use social media from Syria, since leaving his old lifestyle behind in Melbourne and regularly posts smiling selfies on Facebook. She reportedly married Mahmoud Abdullatif on December 11 with the pair announcing their marriage on social media with the hashtag #TheIslamicState . Mahmoud Abdullatif has continued to use his social media accounts since fleeing Melbourne to join the Islamic State in Syria . The jihadist’s page also features his name spelled out in bullets, a photo of a dead child’s hand and a message encouraging people to burn their passports and join IS. One bloody image accuses the US and Israel of being ‘child killers’. In August, his friend posted on old photo of them together as children, dressed up for a family wedding. ‘Remember this pic makes me laugh everytime. Hope ur safe and hope to see u soon inshallah. (""""Wait for me at da gates"""") love u kuzzii [sic],’ he wrote. Another friend commented: ‘Missing you Mahmoud Abdullatif xox.’ Back in February, when he is still believed to have been living in the Melbourne suburb of Coburg, Abdullatif commented on a photo of his friends dressed in suits for a wedding. As the men stood by a white Maserati sports car, Abdullatif wrote: ‘Thanks sis, I need a wife! Lol [sic].’ Abdullatif has only recently changed his name on Facebook and limited who can see his profile. It's believed Abdullatif and Duman met via social media before she ran away to Syria to be with him . Before he freely posted under his real name to his 1,042 friends on the site. Even now, despite being in Syria, he is still adding new friends. He belongs to trance night clubbing groups on Facebook and a group called ‘i wonder if i've ever aten a Mcdonalds burger that has been spat in [sic]’. His ‘likes’ include a page about Swedish girls and one that says ‘Turkish girls are gorgeous’, a page called ‘Trying to convince all 46 b**ches you talk to that you're not a player’ and ‘If She Roll A Good Blunt, Wife That B**tch.’ He’s also a fan of the sexist page ‘High heels were invented so women could put away dishes on the top shelf’. At some point this year, Abdullatif’s thoughts turned from women and partying in nightclubs to joining the murderous Islamic State group in Syria. The former playboy continues to post smiling selfies on social media . A friend told the Herald Sun that they believe he was indoctrinated via social media and that the family didn’t know about his extremist views until he got to Syria. One post on his Facebook page shows the type of social media propaganda that he has been influenced by. Taking aim at the 'Kuffar', the Arabic word for 'nonbelievers', one of his profile picture says: 'When you're against a group of Muslims and the Kuffar are against them too, then know that you've aligned yourself with the Kuffar against your own brothers. 'And know that if that's the case, there is definitely something wrong with your view.. 'If you want to see where the most righteous of Muslims are, then look at where the arrows of the Kuffar are pointing.' His family and friends have reportedly tried to persuade him to come back but they don’t believe he is actually fighting in Syria yet. In one of his posts his name is spelt out in bullets next to a gun . ‘He is always with little kids there. If you were fighting there would not be little kids, maybe the gun is a protection thing but everybody has guns over there,’ the friend said. Abdullatif’s Lebanese family reportedly live near the Syrian border and have witnessed the country’s brutal civil war. Meanwhile, his uncle by marriage is a former Operation Pendennis terror suspect who attempted to sue the Victorian Government because of the way he was allegedly treated while he was held in a maximum security jail. Hany Taha was acquitted of a plot to blow up the MCG stadium and the Crown Casino in Melbourne after being charged with being a member of a terrorist group and attempting to make funds available to it. He was held on remand from November 2005 to September 2008.","Zehra Duman, from Melbourne, has married extremist Mahmoud Abdullatif .

"The discovery of the bodies of two women in an abandoned Atlanta house have police there searching for a possible serial killer. Nicole Startell's remains were found  'badly decomposed' and stuffed inside a closet. Police believe the 31-year-old was killed months ago. Heather Camp's body was discovered tucked under a sheet. The 33-year-old had only been dead a few days when officers found her. Both slayings are believed to have taken place inside the home, which is reportedly used by squatters. The killings have also been described as 'definitely connected' by an Atlanta police captain, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Scroll down for video . Gruesome: The body of Nicole Sartell, pictured, was found in a home on Madrona Street in Atlanta, Georgia, December 19. Also found was the body of 33-year-old Heather Camp . Authorities first found Camp's body hidden by a sheet in a bedroom - and Sartell's stashed in the bedroom closet as police executed a search warrant, WXIA-TV reported. Sartell disappeared in August and the closet containing her body was nailed closed, according to WSB-TV. Both slain women were later identified by the medical examiner's office, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. A neighbor of Sartell  named Charles Freeman told WSB-TV last week 'I put out posters on her with a reward with anybody that knows her whereabouts and we never had heard anything.' 'I wish I knew for sure if it was [Sartell] because it would ease my heart,' he also said at the time. 'She was like my daughter and I loved her very much.' Another neighbor, Larry Powers, told WSB-TV of the house 'Unfortunately there's a lot of wrong activity over there and the door won't lock. It's basically easy for people to come in and out.' Scene: Capt. Paul Guerrucci has said that the murders took place inside the home . Investigation: Authorities are seen at the Madrona Street home where the bodies of Heather Camp and Nicole Sartell were found . At the time, Capt. Paul Guerrucci with the Atlanta Police Department told the affiliate station 'The body [found inside the closet] was badly decomposed, but the house, in general, was not in good order. 'There appears to be people living in the house. There's no running water or electricity, so it looks like they might be squatting in the house.' WSB-TV reported that in 2014 'police have been called to the house 14 times for prostitution, drugs and fighting.' Speaking to WXIA-TV, Guerrucci said 'We're still in the beginning stages.

"Sitting by a bin and puffing on a cigarette, it is hard to believe she is normally a byword for glamour. But this was model turned actress Jerry Hall yesterday as she arrived for work at the Richmond Theatre in South West London. Miss Hall, 58, wore heavy make-up, fur-lined coat and boots – and what appeared to be an engagement ring. Formerly married to Mick Jagger for nine years, she has been dating evolutionary biologist Armand Leroi, 50. Miss Hall had been single since splitting from Australian multi-millionaire Warwick Hemsley, 61, in 2012. Scroll down for video . Jerry Hall was pictured puffing on a cigarette as she arrived for work at the Richmond Theatre in London . Miss Hall is back in her role as the Wicked Queen in Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs after missing several shows since December 21. She took the pantomime role in a blaze of publicity and was watched by her former husband and three of their four children – James, 29, Georgia, 22, and Gabriel, 16, although eldest daughter Lizzie, 30, could not be there. But some fans criticised her on social media, unimpressed by her no-show. Fiona Adams wrote on Twitter: 'Arrived @richmondtheatre to see jerry hall as the evil queen and find she's 'indisposed'. Boo, hiss... maybe the dwarves got her.' Two days later, Susie Davidson Powell, from Brent, London, added: 'Panto time at Richmond Theatre! Jerry Hall suddenly indisposed? Bah humbug. The cast still sparkled!' Laura Garnham wrote: 'No Jerry Hall was a shocker.' Miss Hall is back as the Wicked Queen in Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs after missing several shows . But her agent said Miss Hall was struck down with flu. 'She has had a really bad virus,' Jonathan Phang said last night. 'It has been really upsetting for her as she has never missed any performances before in her career. She is not 100 per cent but she is working so hard and she is battling through.' Mr Phang said Miss Hall was ordered to rest by her doctor, who signed her off for two weeks – but she insisted on returning much sooner. 'She is doing two shows a day. It is a gruelling schedule. She didn't want to contaminate the cast,' he said. Miss Hall, a patron of Richmond Theatre, had faced criticism for her performances after members of the audience noticed she was miming her musical numbers. The production team confirmed a backing track was used, saying it was 'common practice'. The theatre said: 'Jerry Hall was advised by her doctor to rest... but returned fit and well on Boxing Day with performances as good as ever.'","Jerry Hall pictured sitting by a bin, puffing on a cigarette in Richmond .

"A couple who met and fell in love while playing the roles of Grumpy and Dopey in a production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs have become parents. Baby Nathan was born last month and his parents, who have returned to the stage for this year's pantomime season, couldn't be more delighted. Lisa and Nathan Whitfield have also begun to prepare their son for a life on the stage, with the baby cared for backstage during performances. Delighted: Nathan and Laura Whitfield, with their baby son Nathan, met while starring in a pantomime . But it hasn't all been easy for the couple, who come from Sunderland, after Nathan Junior was initially diagnosed with two forms of dwarfism - a UK first - while Mrs Whitfield was still pregnant. So severe was the initial diagnosis, she was advised to have a termination. Luckily, when the baby was born he was healthy and doctors say he will lead a normal life. 'We are so lucky,' his delighted mother said in an interview with the Sun on Sunday. The couple have now reprised the roles they were playing when they first met, although Mrs Whitfield, 24, says she has far fewer nerves than the first time around. Worrying: Their son was initially diagnosed with two types of dwarfism but will live a normal life . Relieved: 24-year-old Laura says she is 'so lucky' to have her husband and baby son . Adorable: Tiny Nathan Junior is currently spending his days watching his parents in action . Back in action: The couple (left, pictured with fellow cast members) have reprised their roles this year . Indeed, Mrs Whitfield was so shy, she was afraid to even speak to her 35-year-old future husband - despite the instant attraction. 'When I first saw Nathan playing Grumpy, my heart skipped a beat,' she revealed. 'I'd never seen anyone so handsome and I instantly fancied him. 'I got butterflies in my stomach the first time I went into rehearsal and saw him.' Luckily for the enamoured Mrs Whitfield, now husband Nathan felt the same way and the couple got engaged in April last year. 'I never imagined he would look twice at me,' added a thrilled Mrs Whifield. 'We are so lucky.'

"Dairy farmers will be forced to turn raw milk unpalatable or treat it safe for human consumption when tough new laws come into effect on New Year's Day. Following the death of a toddler who died after allegedly consuming raw cow's milk labelled as 'bath milk', the Victorian Government announced the new regulations on Sunday. Raw milk producers who breach the new rules will be slapped with hefty fines of $17,700 and could lose their license to produce dairy products, the Herald Sun reports. Scroll down for video . Dairy farmers will be forced to turn raw milk unpalatable or treat it safe for human consumption when tough new laws come into effect on New Year's Day . Victorian Minister for Consumer Affairs Jane Garrett said the changes will help protect consumers from the serious risks of drinking raw unpasteurised milk. 'Unfortunately we have seen over the last few weeks some young children become severely ill through the consumption or raw milk and the consumption of raw milk has been linked to the tragic death of a young child,' she said. 'The packaging and sale of raw milk as a cosmetic bath product is causing some confusion among consumers. 'Raw milk may be sold for cosmetic use as 'bath' milk and can appear similar to other milk products, but it must carry warning labels.' A three-year-old allegedly recently died after drinking Mountain View Organic Bath Milk . It comes after Mountain View Farm voluntarily pulled its range of organic bath milk products off the shelves of heath food stores after the milk was linked to the death of a toddler in Melbourne. Earlier this month, a three-year-old from the Mornington Peninsula, south-east of Melbourne, died after allegedly drinking the bath milk. Mountain View Farm issued a statement on its Facebook page on Friday telling customers the product was being voluntarily recalled following a request from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). 'We have been asked by the ACCC to do a voluntary recall,' the statement said. 'If anyone has purchased Mountain View Bath Milk, please either dispose of the container or return to the place of purchase for a refund.' Victoria's health department has warned people against drinking raw milk after the three-year-old died. Four other children under the age of five fell seriously ill after it's believed they drank raw milk. Unpasteurised cow's milk has been banned in Australia for more than 70 years but manufacturers can sell it as a cosmetic product rather than food. The product is advertised on the family-run company's website as 'amazing fresh 'raw bath milk'… dropped off to the farm store every Thursday for pick up'. ACCC deputy chair Delia Rickard urged consumers not to drink the milk. 'The message from health agencies is clear: do not drink unpasteurised milk,' she said. 'If you have this product, do not drink it in any circumstances.' Regulators are considering whether raw milk labels mislead consumers, with the product often sold alongside consumable milk products. Chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester said some people were choosing to drink rawmilk because they believed it was healthier than pasteurised milk. Mountain View Farm owner Vicki Jones told the Herald Sun her company always advised people not to drink the product. 'What people do with milk when they take it home, I can't tell them what to do,' she said. Ms Jones said the company already labelled their milk with warnings that it was not for consumption, in accordance with health department regulations, but was happy to make any recommended changes. 'We've told them we're happy to add extra labelling and warnings to the milk,' she said. 'We're happy to comply with whatever they request.' The raw milk is often sold in fridges near to the pasteurised drinking milk and its packaging looks similar to that of regular milk. There has been a resurgence in people wanting to drink raw milk as part of a belief that raw and unprocessed food is healthier. They claim it is more nutritious, easier to digest and contains probiotics - and that it's better for cows and farms. Dr Rosemary Lester (left) from Victoria's Department of Health has issued a health warning. The raw milk is often sold near pasteurised milk (right) However, Dr Lester warned that raw milk can affect the kidneys and the bloodstream and cause watery diarrhoea. In addition 'only a small number of these pathogens are needed to cause illness,' Dr Lester said. She said unpasteurised milk could make anyone sick but risks were greatest for young children and elderly, pregnant or otherwise unhealthy people. 'Since the 1940s, it has been compulsory to pasteurise cow's milk in Australia,' Dr Lester said. 'Milk is heated for a very short period of time, effectively destroying any disease-causing bacteria which may be present in raw milk.' Dr Lester has referred the matter to Consumer Affairs Victoria and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), saying bath milk packaging was very similar to drinking milk and they could be easily confused. Consumer Affairs Victoria director Dr Claire Noone says the watchdog will review the marketing of raw milk and work with the ACCC to establish whether there had been a breach of consumer law. 'In Victoria it is illegal to package, deliver or provide raw milk for human consumption. However, it still may be labelled and sold for cosmetic use,' she said in a statement on Thursday. An ACCC spokesperson said the commission would consider the adequacy of labelling but urged consumers to follow safety instructions on product packaging. The State Coroner will investigate the child's death. Dr Lester says on the Department's website: 'The Department has been notified of a number of illnesses including three cases of Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) and two cases of cryptosporidiosis. All cases have consumed unpasteurised (raw) milk which is sold as 'bath' or 'cosmetic' milk in Victoria.' She explained: 'Cryptosporidiosis is a parasitic infection that commonly presents are gastroenteritis with watery diarrhoea. 'HUS is a rare condition which can be caused by shiga toxin and verotoxin producing E.coli that affects the kidneys and the bloodstream. Children are most susceptible to contracting HUS, which begins with abdominal pains and bloody diarrhoea which can last for about a week. 'Serious cases of HUS can lead to renal failure and death. Only small numbers of these pathogens are needed to cause illness.' Because the products are classed as cosmetic and are marked 'not for human consumption' the department has no power to recall them. Dr Lester said: 'In Australia, the sale of unpasteurised (raw) cow's milk for human consumption is illegal. In Victoria, it is also illegal to package, deliver or provide unpasteurised (raw) milk for human consumption. Unpasteurised milk is sometimes labelled and sold for cosmetic use only. 'Packaging of unpasteurised milk is often very similar to other milk products. 'Unpasteurised milk should not be consumed.'","Dairy farmers must turn raw milk unpalatable or consumable for humans .

"An Ohio man bought $650 worth of movie tickets for a showing of 'The Interview,' with the intention of scalping them and making a profit, but his plan backfired and now, he wants his money back. Jason Best, bought 50 tickets for a showing of 'The Interview' at Esquire Theatre in Clifton, Ohio. When Best learned that a local theater was among the 331 playing the controversial movie -- Esquire  playing it as a 'special event' --  he devised a plan, according to WPTV. Scroll down for video .

Illegal: Officials of the Esquire Theatre in Clifton, OH (photographed) have refused to refund Best saying that what he tried to do with the tickets was illegal . 'I saw all the hype about 'The Interview' on the 23rd and thought, 'hey, folks are selling these tickets in other cities and it seems like that's the thing to do right now, so why not give it a shot so see how it goes?' Best told WPTV. Best spent more than $600 on the tickets, priced at $13 each, according to WCPO, expecting to get his money back when he sold them online for more than face value. However, Best wasn't expecting what happened next: Sony released the film on streaming services like Google Play and YouTube on Christmas Eve. The controversial movie sparked a buzz due to Sony, the film's distributor, canning its release after an alleged cyber threat from North Korea. Controversial: 'The Interview' sparked a buzz due to Sony, the film's distributor, canning its release after an alleged cyber threat from North Korea . The movie grossed more than $1 million nationwide at the box office Thursday. With the film now available on people's home televisions, laptops, and even phones, Best realized his plan wouldn't work. So he did the next best thing: he tried to return the tickets, asking for a refund, WCPO reports. 'I thought I'd get my money back because the theater's website very clearly said the tickets were refundable,' Best said. Allyson Duncan, the theatre's head manager, told WCPO that though  tickets are refundable, the theatre does not give refunds for 'special events.' Duncan also said that Best would not be receiving a refund because he was trying to scalp the tickets at a higher price, 'which is illegal.' A company official told WCPO that because Best tried to scalp the tickets, he is not considered a customer. The official described Best as a 'business man' who was trying to regain the money he lost at the theatre's expense. The official did, however, offer to donate the $650 to charity to show that the money is not the issue. But Best said he is not financially able to donate the entire amount to charity but would, instead, donate $100 of it in the theatre's name. The issue has not been resolved.

"A surge in the number of flu cases is threatening to push the NHS ‘over the edge,’ doctors warned last night. Latest official figures show a four-fold increase in the number of flu cases during December, with GPs, facing an extremely busy post-Christmas week at their surgeries, amid fears that hospitals will become log-jammed if the outbreak continues to gather pace. Medical experts are worried a resurgence of ‘Hong Kong flu’ – a strain known as H3N2 and blamed for the deaths of more than a million people worldwide in the 1960s – could make the situation worse by putting thousands of sufferers into hospital, with the elderly in particular at risk. Medical experts fear that a resurgence of 'Hong Kong flu' could put thousands of sufferers into hospital (file picture) Britain has not had a bad flu winter in four years, as more people have developed resistance to the H1N1 swine flu virus, dominant in recent years. However, scientists say ‘nasty’ H3N2 flu has taken its place – with virulent vaccine-resistant strains also in circulation. Dr David Mant, professor emeritus of general practice at Oxford University, said: ‘There is good reason for anxiety that this will be a bad winter for flu. 'This will place extra demand on an already over-stretched NHS. Many hospitals are already working at very high bed occupancy rates and emergency departments are experiencing record numbers of attendances.’ At the start of December, there were an estimated 3,500 new flu cases per week, according to data published by Public Health England. At the start of December, there were an estimated 3,500 new flu cases per week but by Christmas it had jumped to 13,500 cases . 'But by Christmas that had jumped to 13,500 new cases a week – an almost four-fold increase. Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctor Association, said a major flu outbreak would put ‘immense pressure’ on A&E departments and hospitals generally. Dr Richard Vautrey, a Leeds GP and a senior member of the British Medical Association, added: ‘The system is running hot at the moment and you only need a little bit of extra pressure to push it over the edge.’","Figures show there has been a four-fold increase in flu cases this month .

"The United States and NATO formally ended their war in Afghanistan on Sunday with a ceremony at their military headquarters in Kabul after 13 years as the insurgency they fought for more than a decade remains ferocious and deadly. The low-key ceremony was arranged secretly due to the threat of Taliban strikes on the Afghan capital, the target of repeated suicide bombings in recent years. The symbolic ceremony marked the end of the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force, which will transition to a supporting role with 13,500 soldiers, most of them American, starting January 1. Scroll down for video . Ceremony: Photographed, Commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Gen. John Campbell, (right), and ISAF Gen. Hans-Lothar Domrose (left) attend a ceremony at the ISAF headquarters in Kabul, Afghanistan Sunday announcing the official end of the 13-year war in Afghanistan . Attention: Photographed, Afghan and international soldiers stand at attention during the low-key ceremony which was arranged secretly due to the threat of Taliban strikes on the Afghan capital, the target of repeated suicide bombings in recent years . The more than 13,000 soldiers will not be involved in direct fighting as they remain in Afghanistan, but will support the Afghan army and police as they fight the Taliban, who ruled from 1996 until being unseated in the 2001 invasion following Sept. 11 attacks. Gen. John Campbell, commander of ISAF, rolled up and sheathed the green and white ISAF flag and unfurled the flag of the new international mission, called Resolute Support. 'Resolute Support will serve as the bedrock of an enduring partnership' between NATO and Afghanistan, Campbell told an audience of Afghan and international military officers and officials, as well as diplomats and journalists. He paid tribute to the international and Afghan troops who have died fighting the insurgency, saying: 'The road before us remains challenging but we will triumph.' From Jan. 1, the new mission will provide training and support for Afghanistan's military, with the U.S. accounting for almost 11,000 members of the residual force. 'Resolute Support:' Photographed,  Gen. Campbell opens the 'Resolute Support' flag during the ceremony announcing the transition of more than 13,000 troops from fighting to 'supporting' the Afghan army and police . Case: Here, Gen. Campbell (center) and Command Sgt. Maj. Delbert Byers (center right) case the ISAF flag duringthe ceremony . President Ashraf Ghani, who took office in September, signed bilateral security agreements with Washington and NATO allowing the enduring military presence. The move has led to a spike in violence as the Taliban have claimed it as an excuse to step up operations aimed at destabilizing his government. ISAF was set up after the U.S.-led invasion as an umbrella for the coalition of around 50 nations that provided troops and took responsibility for security across the country. It ends with 2,224 American soldiers killed, according to an AP tally, out of a total of some 3,500 foreign troop deaths. The mission peaked at 140,000 troops in 2010 with a surge ordered by U.S. President Barack Obama to root the insurgents out of strategically important regions, notably in the southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar, where the Taliban had its capital from 1996 to 2001. Obama recently expanded the remit of the U.S. forces remaining in the country, allowing them to extend their counter-terrorism operations to Taliban, as well as al-Qaida, and to provide ground and air support for the Afghan forces when necessary for at least the next two years. Afghans have mixed feelings about the drawdown of foreign troops, many believing that with the deteriorating security situation their presence is needed to back up the Afghan effort to bring peace after more than three decades of continual war. 'At least in the past 13 years we have seen improvements in our way of life — freedom of speech, democracy, the people generally better off financially,' said 42-year-old shop keeper Gul Mohammad. 'But we do need the foreign troops to stay here at least until our own forces are strong enough, while our economy strengthens, while our leaders try to form a government,' he said. Birthday: Gen. Campbell claps to celebrate the birthday of Gen. Hans-Lothar Domrose during the ceremony . Deployment and Casualties: This graphic charts US troops deployment and casualties in Afghanistan since 2001 . NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said that Afghanistan's 350,000-strong security forces are ready to take on the insurgency alone, despite complaints by officials that they lack the necessary assets, such as air support, medical evacuation and intelligence. In a statement on Sunday, Stoltenberg said that ISAF's mandate was 'carried out at great cost but with great success.' 'We have made our own nations safer by denying safe haven to international terrorists. We have made Afghanistan stronger by building up from scratch strong security forces. Together we have created the conditions for a better future for millions of Afghan men, women and children,' he said. As Afghan forces assume sovereignty, the country is without a Cabinet three months after Ghani's inauguration, and economic growth is near zero due to the reduction of the international military and aid juggernauts. The United States spent more than $100 million on reconstruction in Afghanistan, on top of the $1 trillion war. Hug: Gen. Campbell (center) hugs Gen. Domrose, as Command Sgt. Maj.  Byers watches them during the ceremony . This year is set to be the deadliest of the war, according to the United Nations, which expects civilian casualties to hit 10,000 for the first time since the agency began keeping records in 2008. It says that most of the deaths and injuries are caused by Taliban attacks. In the latest insurgent violence in eastern Wardak province, two teenage boys were killed late on Saturday, when a rocket was fired near a children's volleyball match in Nirkh district, an official said. Another five children, aged between 11 and 14 years old, were wounded by shrapnel, said the governor's spokesman Attaullah Khogyani. He blamed the Taliban. In Kapisa, also in the east, Governor Abdul Saboor Wafa's office said eight insurgents were killed on Saturday night in an army counter-insurgency operation.

Most of those deaths, or around 3,200, have been policemen, according to Karl Ake Roghe, the outgoing head of EUPOL, the European Union Police Mission in Afghanistan, which funds and trains a police force of 157,000. Roghe said that while the Taliban have stretched their presence, the methodology has not changed, indicating a lack of insurgent military capacity despite the rise in attacks. 'They make a lot of damage, they send gunmen and suicide bombers to blow up the front wall and then they are immediately killed, so they achieve nothing,' he said.","The United States and NATO formally ended their 13-year war in Afghanistan on Sunday with a ceremony at their military headquarters in Kabul .

"Glamorous in a red silk shirt and cosy fox fur stole, Pamela Paquin might look like your typical fashion fan - but in fact, she's anything but. Instead of faux fur, Ms Paquin's collar is made entirely from roadkill - and she has now set up a business producing everything from collars to coats using mangled mink and squashed foxes. But her unusual designs don't come cheap, with garments such as stoles costing, on average, £640 ($1,000) each. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: A model poses in a Petite Mort red fox neck muff designed by Pamela Paquin . Love: Paquin grew up on a farm and the resulting passion for animals led to her business idea . Nevertheless, Ms Paquin, who lives near Boston in Massachusetts, says she expects the range to prove popular among ethical fur fans who don't want to see animals killed purely for their pelts. 'I’ve always loved animals and have always worked on a farm,' explains the 39-year-old designer. 'There’s a lot of roadkill in America - a lot more cars and a lot more animals than many other countries. 'I knew the idea would be popular but I didn’t know when it would take off - they are a real statement piece.' Every piece made for her company, Petite Mort, is created using animals killed on the road, with most supplied by the Highway Department and Animal Control who are licensed to collect them. The animals are then skinned, frozen and sent to a taxidermist before the fur is tanned and sewed in a lengthy process that takes up to 20 hours. Each piece contains a silver badge detailing the type of creature involved in its manufacture, certification that the animal was made from roadkill and information on where it was found. But while Ms Paquin has had an overwhelmingly positive response to the furs, not everyone has welcomed the roadkill range. Stylish: Paquin strikes a pose in a shawl from Petite Mort, which was made from a roadkill coyote . Lengthy process: Creating the garments takes up to 20 hours each and they cost around £640 to buy . Particularly concerned are the anti-fur community with whom the designer initially tried to work before receiving a slew of negative responses. One particular complaint is that they encourage more fur in society despite being ethically made - unlike the regular variety. Nevertheless, the majority of responses to the range have been positive, according to Ms Paquin, who adds: . 'People are mainly grateful somebody is doing something respectful with animals.' Chic: A model poses in a handwarmer made from a black bear that was killed in a traffic collision . Cosy: A model poses in red fox gauntlet gloves (left) and a furry neck muff (right) Controversial: Some in the anti-fur lobby say Paquin's efforts encourage fur wearing .","Pamela Paquin uses roadkill to make everything in her fashion range .

"The distressing disappearance of AirAsia Indonesia flight QZ8501, en route from Indonesia to Singapore on Sunday, is the latest installment in Indonesia's checkered airline history which has recorded the deaths of almost 650 people in two decades. The nation has struggled with its air safety record over the past two decades as the airline market in Southeast Asia has faced unparalleled demand for low-cost flights from a rapidly expanding population. While Indonesia has benefited economically from the growing market, it is struggling to meet safety standards, unable provide enough qualified pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers and updated airport technology to ensure safety. Scroll down for video . A man pointing at an electronic display showing the arriving flights with the missing AirAsia flight QZ8501 at the Changi Airport in Singapore . Despite 30% of plane crashes around the world occuring as a result of weather conditions, ground-based wind-shear detection systems introduced to notify plane crews to issues are absent in many airports around Indonesia. The nation of over 250 million people is set in a region which 'needs to look at improving air infrastructure and pursue an open skies policy,' Mr Niemeijer told Quartz. The Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation recorded a 20% increase in seat volume between 2012 and 2013, totalling 5.6 million passengers on flights in the region. The figures are expected to increase, with 70% of the world's busiest routes travelling through Southeast Asia, and 30% of the world's aircraft passengers expected to travel to the region in 2014, reported Orient Aviation Journal. Willem Niemeijer, co-founder of Khiri Travel Group, said that 'increasing air traffic means crashes will increase as well.' The distressing disappearance of AirAsia flight QZ8501, en route from Indonesia to Singapore on Sunday, is the latest installment in Indonesia's checkered airline history . In the past 20 years 532 people have died in crashes in Indonesia, and 116 people have been presumed dead. In 2014 so far there have been five major plane crashes in Southeast Asia, including the doomed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 en route to Kuala Lumpur, and the disappearance of MH370 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. There has been one major flight incident in Indonesia annually for the past three years, including the disappearance of the AirAsia Indonesia flight on Sunday which was carrying 155 passengers and seven crew members on board. April 2013: Boeing 737-800 crash . The plane carrying more than 100 passengers and crew overshot a runway on the Indonesian resort island of Bali on Saturday and crashed into the sea, injuring nearly two dozen people on April 13, 2013, officials said . A brand new Boeing 737-800, operated by Indonesian budget carrier Lion Air, crashed off the coast of Bali, missing the runway and slamming into the ocean while attempting to land in the rain. While all 108 people on board the plane survived, it was the seventh accident for the airline since 2002. May 2012:  Russian-made Sukhoi Superjet-100 crash, 45 killed .

January 1995: Merpati Nusantara Airlines flight disappearance, 14 people presumed dead . A de Havilland Twin Otter 300 operated by Indonesia-based Merpati Nusantara Airlines disappeared over open water while flying between islands in Indonesia.

"Neil deGrasse Tyson has hit back at criticism that he is 'anti-Christian' after he posted a series of tweets on Christmas Day that left him facing accusations that he had deliberately 'trolled' the Christian holiday. The astrophysicist's tweet commemorating the birthday of Isaac Newton on December 25 has since been retweeted more than 70,000 times, making it his most popular tweet ever and also his most controversial.

Neil deGrasse Tyson has hit back at criticism that he is 'anti-Christian' after he posted a series of tweets on Christmas Day that left him facing accusations that he had deliberately 'trolled' the Christian holiday . The astrophysicist's tweet commemorating the birthday of Isaac Newton on December 25 has since been retweeted more than 70,000 times, making it his most popular tweet ever and also his most controversial . The TV personality followed it up with another tweet that also inflamed conservative Christians: 'Merry Christmas to all. A Pagan holiday (BC) becomes a Religious holiday (AD). Which then becomes a Shopping holiday (USA).' Earlier in the day, he had also tweeted, 'QUESTION: This year, what do all the world's Muslims and Jews call December 25th? ANSWER: Thursday.' Sure enough, Tyson found himself on the receiving end of a Twitter backlash from Christians who found his gentle mocking too much to take. 'This is disrespectful to Christians. Jesus created the science you cherish so much. Everyone finds God eventually, you will too,' tweeted one user. Another tweeted: 'Looking fwd to witty jabs during the spiritual days of Islam, Buddhism, Judaism etc. Or is it reserved for the easiest target?' 'Overly reductive, deliberately cynical and unnecessarily provocative,' tweeted another person who had taken offence. Tyson posted a series of Christmas-related tweets on December 25 and the next day responded to accusations from conservative Christians that he was 'anti-Christian' Tyson expressed his surprise at how popular the tweet had been and denied that he was 'somehow anti-Christian' While elsewhere he was accused of 'trolling Christmas today to show you how smart he is.' Tyson responded to the accusations the next day with another tweet: 'Imagine a world in which we are all enlightened by objective truths rather than offended by them.' Later on Friday evening he posted a longer message on Facebook entitled 'My Most Retweeted Tweet' in which he expressed his surprise at how popular the Newton tweet had been. 'My sense in this case is that the high rate of re-tweeting, is not to share my enthusiasm of this fact, but is driven by accusations that the tweet is somehow anti-Christian,' he wrote. 'If a person actually wanted to express anti-Christian sentiment, my guess is that alerting people of Isaac Newton's birthday would appear nowhere on the list.' Tyson also went on to address criticism that according to the calendar in use during Newton's time, his birthday would fall on January 4, 1643. 'One last bit of historical fact. All of England was celebrating Christmas the day Newton was born. But the Gregorian Calendar (an awesomely accurate reckoning of Earth's annual time), introduced in 1584 by Pope Gregory, was not yet adopted in Great Britain. 'To do so required removing ten days from the calendar — excess time that had accumulated over the previous 16 centuries from the mildly flawed Julian Calendar, introduced by Julius Caesar in 46 BC. 'These remnants of the turbulent schism between the Anglican and Catholic churches meant that Catholic Christendom was celebrating Christmas ten days earlier than anybody was in England.' Tyson ended his note with holiday wishes and a warning that he'll be tweeting about Earth's perihelion in the New Year. 'Just a head's up in case people want to avert their eyes over that one.' He signed off with: 'I am, and always will be, a servant of your cosmic curiosity.'","The astrophysicist's tweet commemorating the birthday of Isaac Newton on December 25 has since been retweeted more than 70,000 times .

"Sophie Wessex cut an elegant figure in a pretty powder pink coat as she joined the rest of the royal family at Sandringham today. The Countess of Wessex, who celebrates her 50th birthday this year, has been lauded for her increasingly chic dress sense in recent months - as well as for her devotion to charity work. With her was her daughter Lady Louise Windsor, 11, who was well wrapped up against the chill in a bright green scarf. Scroll down for video . Elegant: Sophie Wessex, who celebrates her 50th birthday this year, cut an elegant figure as she arrived . Along with Prince Edward, the family has spent the last five days at Sandringham where they celebrated Christmas with the Queen - who has long been close to Sophie. The monarch, 88, was also at the service, although unlike the rest of the family, she chose to be driven to the church of St Mary Magdalene on the edge of the 20,000 acre estate. Resplendent in a gold and cream tweed coat and a matching hat, the Queen appeared to be in good spirits as she arrived, beaming broadly at the crowd of 1,000 well-wishers who had gathered to see her. The Duke of Edinburgh, who walked to the church with Princess Anne, also stopped to say hello as did a cheerful Prince Charles who arrived with his nephew Peter Phillips and his niece-in-law Autumn Kelly. Glamorous: Sophie has been lauded for her increasingly glamorous sense of style in recent months . Cheerful: A smiling Prince Charles arrived with Autumn Kelly and his nephew Peter Phillips . Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose to stay away, however, with William and Kate thought to have remained at their Norfolk home Anmer Hall with the Middletons. Other absentees included Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, the Duke of York and the Duchess of Cornwall, who also missed the Christmas day service. During the service, prayers were said for the suspected victims of the missing AirAsia flight, as well as for the victims of conflicts in Syria and Iraq and the families of those who lost loved ones in the Boxing Day tsunami a decade ago. Afterwards, the Queen  left children in the crowd disappointed by leaving church without stopping to collect flowers from them. But several bouquets were collected on her behalf by Prince Charles and Sophie Wessex as they walked back to Sandringham House. Charles also stopped to speak to some members of the crowd, greeting Nicky Bantoft, 36, by saying: 'Good morning, you must be cold'. Good form: The Queen arrived by car for the service, while the Duke of Edinburgh chose to walk . Taking it easy: The Queen chose to be driven to church for the second year in a row . Family affair: Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex and his daughter Lady Louise Windsor, 11, arrive at the church . Mrs Bantoft of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, who was outside the church with her children Hannah, ten and Jack, eight, said: 'We replied, ""Yes, we have been wiggling our toes to keep warm"".' Michelle Sparrow, 42, of Helensville, Auckland, New Zealand, and her children Jack, 12, and Isabel, ten, attracted the attention of Prince Philip who spotted their New Zealand and All Blacks flags. Mrs Sparrow who is staying with her husband's family in Mildenhall, Suffolk, said: 'He said, ""Have you come a long way?"" Then he saw our flags and asked if we were from New Zealand. 'When we told him that we were over here on holiday, he said: ""I hope it's worth it"". Edward also spoke to us and asked if we were finding it cold.' Cold or not, Charles in particular had reason to be cheerful after it was revealed that the running of the Sandringham Estate has been turned over to him by the Duke of Edinburgh. The job includes overseeing the Estate's arable, livestock and fruit farms, property and a 240-acre country park. Prince Philip, 93, is currently responsible for several estates, including Balmoral, Windsor and, until recently, Sandringham. Well wrapped up: The Princess Royal had dressed for the cold in a furry hat and sheepskin boots . All smiles: Both the Princess Royal and the Prince of Wales stopped to greet well-wishers outside the church . Local sources say Prince Philip started to pass control of Sandringham’s 20,000 acres to Charles this year. The Duke will continue to be consulted over changes, but Charles will have a more hands-on role. ‘We understand Prince Philip has handed the management over to his son,’ a source told the Mail on Sunday. ‘Charles is now taking a very close interest in the estate and its running. He has excellent ideas and we are expecting to see different things happening.’ Estate workers say they expect to see more of the prince in the coming months as he implements changes, such as more organic farming. Sandringham has been a private home for British monarchs since 1862. As well as being the Queen’s country retreat, it is a successful commercial estate. The property will join a number of others under Charles' management, among them his 900 acre Highgrove Estate in Gloucestershire, and Birkhall, his Scottish home on the Balmoral Estate.

"Michelle Seddon, 28, (pictured with partner Ben) decided to go to the opticians after experiencing excruciating headaches. As soon as she sat in the chair she was advised to rush straight to hospital . A woman's life was saved after a routine eye test revealed she had a potentially fatal brain condition. Michelle Seddon, 28, decided to go to the opticians after experiencing excruciating headaches. Thinking it was nothing more serious than a sign she needed a new set of glasses, but as soon as she sat in the optician's chair she was advised to rush straight to hospital where she was diagnosed with a severe condition that can be fatal if left untreated. Ms Seddon had received a letter from her optician reminding her to make an appointment, but she decided to put it off because she was saving up for her wedding. But within weeks the mother-of-two from Chorley, Lancashire, began suffering from an excruciating headache and noticed her eyesight was deteriorating. Ms Seddon, who normally wears glasses for driving and watching TV, said: 'I had been putting off going for an eye test because my partner Ben and I were saving up for our wedding. ' It had been two years since my last test. 'I started having an awful headache that was so painful it made me vomit, but I had suffered from migraines a lot when I was younger so I just put it down to that. I just took paracetamol and migraine relief tablets. 'Then a week or so later I was driving around town and I noticed that when I turned to the right it was taking my eyes a couple of seconds to focus. My eyes had definitely started to deteriorate, so I decided to make an appointment at Specsavers in Chorley. Michelle Seddon with Specsavers store director Rizwan Iqbal.  She was finally told she had been suffering from intracranial hypertension, a condition which causes high pressure behind the skull . 'The optician took a photograph of the back of my eyes and straightaway he looked at me, looked at the photograph and asked me what my plans were for the rest of the day. 'I told him I was going to pay off the rest of my wedding and he said: 'I'm really sorry, but you're not going to be able to do that today. I need you to go to Royal Preston Hospital as soon as possible.' 'Then he started writing out a letter and said I had to take it with me to the hospital and show it to the doctors. I was really confused about what was going on. My headache had subsided by then and I felt fine in myself.' Ms Seddon went to hospital where she was given further eye tests, a lumber puncture and a CT scan. Four days later she was told she suffering from intracranial hypertension - a condition which causes high pressure behind the skull and can lead to blindness, a stroke or even death. Ms Seddon, who is getting married later this month, was discharged from hospital and given medication which she will have to take for the foreseeable future . The tests showed that the arteries behind her eyes had thinned so the blood couldn't get through, creating a build-up of pressure. Ms Seddon said: 'I couldn't believe what they were telling me. I had never heard of the condition before and when they told me it can be fatal I couldn't believe it. The nurses told me if I'd left it any longer I could have gone blind or the worst case scenario would be the very worst case scenario imaginable. 'They could see from scans that I had already lost quite a lot of visual field on my right hand side but I've been told that will come back over time. 'The neurologist explained that my week-long headache was a symptom of the condition. The whole thing was really frightening. 'For all the time I was in hospital I felt absolutely fine. I felt like a fraud but they wouldn't let me go home because it was too dangerous.' Ms Seddon, who is getting married later this month, was discharged from hospital and given medication which she will have to take for the foreseeable future. She said: 'That one trip to the opticians saved my life. I dread to think what could have happened if I'd put the appointment off any longer.'","Michelle Seddon, 28, went to the opticians after experiencing headaches .

Friends had warned her it might not be him but she still fell for it, even after searching for pictures of the real footballer on Google. Writing on Twitter at the time she said: 'I feel so dirty, ashamed and devastated. I've been completely manipulated by a man for 18 months pretending to be a Premiership footballer.'

She has split the cost of the £300 DNA test between two of the men, with the footballer impostor refusing to give a sample, and says if they aren't the father they will get their money back. Miss Cunnigham was seen two weeks ago walking through Leeds with her new boyfriend, named by a source this as Andrew Goy, pushing a pink pram and holding coffee cups. Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. She later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. She made headlines again when she said she now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother-of-two later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. She made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It came after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. Josie, from Leeds, made headlines after having £4,800 breast enlargement surgery paid for by the NHS . As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont). 'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice. Earlier this month, the mother-of-two stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job. Josie had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. But, using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. The mother-of-two had earlier spoken of her devastation when doctors told her she was having a third boy. She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'. Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl.","Josie Cunningham gave birth in September but doesn't know who father is .

"A Maryland woman and two teens are facing multiple charges for attacking the woman's ex-boyfriend with a tire iron after he complained about the trio having a threesome in his home, police say. Glenda Rodriguez, 32, and Luis Figueroa, 18, of Silver Spring are facing a slew of felony charges including attempted first-degree murder and first-degree assault for the early December attack on 32-year-old Andres Hernandez. An unnamed 16-year-old, Figueroa's girlfriend, has also been charged. Attack: Glenda Rodriguez, 32, (right) and Luis Figueroa, 18, (left) are facing a slew of felony charges including attempted first-degree murder and first-degree assault for the brutal attack on 32-year-old Andres Hernandez . Days prior to the brutal attack, the victim caught Rodriguez having sex with the two teens in his home, according to ABC 7. Enraged, Hernandez began bad-mouthing Rodriguez and the two teens, who had been living in the home as well. The three lovers were so offended by Hernandez's words that they devised a plan. Rodriguez lured Hernandez to a location offering him sex, ABC reports, while the two teens hid in a nearby porta-potty with a tire iron. Porta-Potty: As part of their plan, Rodriguez lured Hernandez to a location near a porta-potty (photographed) offering him sex, soon, the two teens jumped out of the portable bathroom and attacked Hernandez with a tire iron . Caught: Days before the brutal attack, Hernandez caught Rodriguez and the two teens having a threesome in his Maryland home (photographed) Cousin: Hernandez' cousin, Miguel Ortiz (photographed), said the teens repeatedly hit his cousin in the head because they 'wanted to kill him' When the two had finished, Figueroa and the 16-year-old exited the porta-potty and attacked Hernandez leaving him unconscious, with four deep lacerations to the head. 'They only hit him in the head, nowhere on the body, because they wanted to kill him,' Miguel Ortiz, the victim's cousin, told ABC. The trio then got into Rodriguez's car and sped away. Paramedics took Hernandez to Suburban Hospital in Bethesda where he required a lot of staples and stitches. He is expected to make a full recovery, ABC reports. If found guilty, Rodriguez and Figueroa could face a sentence of life in prison, FOX 45 reports. The 6-year-old's records are sealed because she is a minor. 'All we want is justice, because there was no reason for them to do what they did to him,' Ortiz said . 'There was no reason to do it.' Rodriguez and Figueroa will return to Montgomery County District Court for their next hearing in January.","Glenda Rodriguez, 32, Luis Figueroa, 18, and Figueroa's 16-year-old girlfriend have been charged with first-degree attempted murder for attacking Rodriguez's ex-boyfriend with a tire iron .

"Ministers are considering draconian plans to prevent a flood of money and people heading to Britain from Europe if the ailing single currency collapses. Experts fear that the collapse of the euro would lead to the widespread movement of both people and money – with potentially damaging consequences for Britain if left unchecked. The Treasury has drawn up contingency plans to prevent investors shifting huge sums of cash from the Eurozone to Britain – amid fears it could lead to a surge in the value of the Pound. The Treasury has drawn up contingency plans to prevent investors shifting huge sums of cash from the Eurozone to Britain . And it emerged yesterday that Britain’s borders could also be temporarily sealed against economic refugees from Europe if the collapse of the euro sparks widespread civil unrest on the Continent. The Foreign Office is also working on contingency plans for the emergency evacuation of thousands of British expats and holidaymakers from stricken countries. Officials insist the plans are being . drawn up as a precaution – and do not indicate that the Government . believes the collapse of the single currency is imminent. Despite repeated attempts by Eurozone . countries to prop up the single currency, many experts believe the . 17-member currency cannot survive the coming year intact. British . officials believe that one or more countries, such as Greece and . Portugal, could be forced to drop out of the single currency in order to . tackle the dire problems in their own economies. Ministers . fear the break-up of the euro could have a devastating effect on . Britain, dashing hopes of a recovery and sending the economy back into . recession. Anecdotal reports suggest some . wealthy investors and individuals from countries like Greece are already . moving money to the UK and buying property in London. The . Treasury, which has a central role in drawing up contingency plans for . the euro’s collapse, believes a break-up could send international . investors scrambling for a safe haven. The . transfer of huge sums of money to London could send Sterling soaring – . threatening to crush the fragile recovery in exports which is central to . the Coalition’s plans to ‘rebalance’ Britain’s economy. Earlier this year the Swiss . government was forced to intervene after nervous investors transferred . cash there from the Eurozone, sending the value of the Swiss Franc to . unsustainable levels. The Swiss authorities moved to peg the currency to the euro. Desperate banks have stashed record amounts of cash in the European Central Bank amid fears they could be hit by a Eurozone breakup. Institutions across Europe ploughed 412billion euros into the deposit facility which is seen as a safe heaven during economic turmoil. The ECB gives a paltry interest rate of just 0.25 per cent  - meaning that many banks are making a loss on their cash. It is a further sign of the anxiety in the financial system, coming just days after 520 banks borrowed 489billion euros from the ECB. The three-year loans were aimed to reduce fears over the banks access to capital during the crisis. Banks had previously been lending to each other on the international markets but levels have slumped in recent months. A fall in Italy's borrowing costs eased fears about the eurozone debt crisis today and helped London's leading shares index push back into the black. The successful Italian bond auction saw the debt-ridden nation's borrowing costs fall back from the unsustainable levels of seven per cent seen months earlier, as market confidence grew in its ability to pay its way. In November there were fears that it would breach the level after it hit 6.504 per cent. Today's rate, however, was 3.251 per cent. Silvio Berlusconi's replacement by Mario Monti as prime minister in November has helped calm nerves although there is still concern about the impact on the economy of a draconian plan of tax increases and pensions adopted this month. The . Treasury is planning a different approach which will impose strict . limits on the amount of money that can be moved in or out of the UK. Treasury officials are also drawing . up plans to deal with the impact on Britain’ s major banks, which have a . combined exposure of £170 billion to the troubled economies of Greece, . Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain. Elsewhere . in Whitehall there are fears that a collapse of the euro could lead to . widespread civil unrest – and even spark a flood of economic refugees. Some . countries are expected to ground all flights and effectively seal their . borders to prevent the flight of people and money. British officials . are said to be considering contingency plans to seal the UK’s borders in . a worst-case scenario – although any attempt to prevent the free . movement of people is illegal under EU law. Despite repeated attempts by the 17 eurozone countries to prop up the single currency, many experts believe the euro cannot survive the coming year intact . The Ministry of Defence has also been put on standby to help rescue British nationals stranded in countries that are plunged into chaos. Other EU countries are also drawing up contingency plans. Earlier this month reports in Portugal said the country’s borders would be temporarily sealed if the country drops out of the single currency. Strict limits would be imposed on cash withdrawals and euro notes would be stamped with an escudo mark until the new currency was printed and distributed. A poll of Conservative Party members has found that most Tories want Britain to pull out of the European Union. The party asked its members on its website if they would favour ending Britain's EU membership and signing up to a free-trade agreement. It found that 54 per cent would back pulling out. A quarter said they wanted a more flexible relationship while 10 per cent would keep the status quo but ignore laws that were not in the national interest. Five per cent said the UK should leave without seeking new agreements and three per cent said they were happy with the current relationship but with no further integration. Two per cent said they wanted more involvement while one per cent wanted to join the euro. Baroness Thatcher is the politician whose views they most closely indentified with, followed by London mayor Boris Johnson and former US president Ronald Reagan.

"A protester who advocated for peaceful demonstrations in Ferguson was charged Saturday with setting fire to a convenience store in a neighboring suburb. A St. Louis County jail official said Joshua Williams, 19, of St. Louis, was being held on $30,000 bond. He is charged with arson, second-degree burglary and stealing less than $500. Williams, who was frequently quoted and photographed protesting Michael Brown's death, is accused of using lighter fluid to set multiple fires inside and outside a QuikTrip in Berkeley. Court records said Williams confessed in a videotaped interview, and that his actions were captured by surveillance video and by news media. Joshua Williams poses for a booking photo, in St. Louis after being charged with arson, burglary and theft. The 19-year-old is a protester who advocated for peaceful demonstrations in Ferguson following the death of Michael Brown . The QuikTrip was looted after a white Berkeley police officer shot and killed Antonio Martin, a black 18-year-old, late Tuesday at a nearby gas station. Separate surveillance footage appeared to show that before the shooting, Martin pulled a gun on the unidentified 34-year-old officer. St. Louis County police spokesman Shawn McGuire said it wasn't immediately known if Williams had an attorney. Williams didn't immediately return a phone message. Williams has been arrested at least twice during Ferguson-related protests for unlawful assembly as well as refusal to disperse. An MSNBC profile of Williams in September quoted him as saying, 'We have to come together as one and show them we can be peaceful, that we can do this. If not, they're going to just want us to act up so they can pull out their toys on us again.' During a Ferguson Commission meeting earlier this month, Williams said black people should be able to walk into stores without being followed around like thieves. 'When the police go out there in their uniforms, they don't see nothing but thugs,' he said. 'All they see is targets in the streets.'

"A majority of air travellers who have experienced flight delays of more than three hours are not claiming the compensation they entitled to, new research has revealed. A survey conducted by Which? Travel found that in the last two years more than a fifth of UK air travellers have experienced flight delays that qualify for compensation under EU rules. But only 38 per cent of them have claimed compensation to which they were entitled to, according to the poll of more than 7,729 people. Scroll down for video . More than a fifth of UK air travellers in the last two years have been delayed by at least three hours . Thomson lays claim to the worst-delayed route – Orlando's Sanford Airport to London Gatwick Airport . Passengers hit by delays of at least three hours while flying with an EU-based airline or from an EU airport can claim between €250 and €600 compensation (approximately £200 to £450), unless it was due to an 'extraordinary circumstance' – such as severe weather or a security risk – beyond the airline's control. Which? Travel editor Jill Starley-Grainger said: 'Nobody wants to be held up by flight delays so airlines must do everything in their power to ensure they fly on time. 'If you've suffered a flight delay of more than three hours you could be entitled to compensation.' Only 38 per cent of those who qualified have applied for compensation, according to a poll by Which? Travel . The research showed that 37 per cent of Which? members had suffered a flight delay in the last two years, with 21 per cent being held up for more than three hours. Of those polled, as many as 44 per cent said they would be happy to pay up to £50 more for a £250 flight if the airline had an excellent rather than average punctuality record. Gill Coombes, 40, who left Edinburgh to go skiing in Austria, said she believes busier skies translate into longer delays. She said: 'It's inevitable that as air travel grows, so too will the delays. 'I'm sceptical about compensation. Airline companies will just inflate their prices elsewhere to make sure they're not left out of pocket.' The study found that 20 per cent of flights failed to arrive within the industry standard of 'on time' A separate Which? Travel study analysed Civil Aviation Authority data on flight delays for nine of the busiest UK-operating airlines for the 12 months ending August 2014. The figures revealed flights to major cities including Glasgow, Edinburgh, London, Manchester and Newcastle were routinely affected by hold-ups. Based on arrivals at UK airports, the study found that 20 per cent of flights failed to arrive within the industry standard of 'on time', which is defined as early to 15 minutes late. Thomas Cook and Monarch Airlines were the only two that failed to meet the on-time standard, with average delays of 18 minutes and 17 minutes, respectively. Passengers hit by delays of at least three hours can claim between €250 and €600 compensation . A spokesman for Thomas Cook said: 'While there any many factors that can delay flights - such as weather and strikes - we work hard to ensure our customers depart for their holiday, and return home, on time. 'Unlike some airlines, we never cancel flights and this can skew such figures, but we always ensure our customers reach their holiday destination and look after them during any delays.' A spokeswoman for Thomson said: 'The vast majority of our flights depart on or very close to the scheduled time, but on rare occasions circumstances outside our control can cause delays. 'We'd like to reassure customers that in the event of a delay we do everything we can to minimise the disruption, as well as providing assistance and updates.' Ryanair flew seven of the ten least-delayed routes to the UK while Flybe was the least delayed overall . Surveyor James MacBryde, 54, of Keswick, Cumbria, flew to the Canary Islands last week for a Christmas holiday. He said: 'I'm travelling with two teenagers and my wife and there's nothing worse than having to hang around an airport waiting for a flight. 'The CAA should come down harder on airlines who routinely operate delayed flights.' Flybe was the least delayed of the airlines looked at, with average postponements of 10 minutes. Thomson Airways' average delay was 14 minutes, but the airline was responsible for flying seven of the ten most-delayed routes to the UK. Thomson lays claim to the worst-delayed route – Orlando, Florida's Sanford Airport to London Gatwick Airport – which had an average delay of 68 minutes. Compensation cannot be claimed if a delay was due to 'extraordinary circumstances' such as severe weather . Next was a Jet2 route, from Chambery, France to Manchester, which was delayed on average 67 minutes, followed by a Thomson route from Montego Bay in Jamaica to Gatwick (65 minutes). Europe's largest budget airline, Dublin-based Ryanair, flew seven of the ten least-delayed routes to the UK, all of which were from European destinations. Least delayed were a Thomson flight from Marrakesh in Morocco to Birmingham (average delay of less than one minute), a Ryanair service from Sandefjord in Norway to Edinburgh (less than one minute) and a Birmingham-bound service by Monarch from Split in Croatia (one minute on average). In an additional survey based on the experiences of 11,396 Which? members flying in economy class, Swiss was voted the best short-haul airline with a customer score of 82 per cent, while Thomas Cook came last with a score of 38 per cent. Singapore Airlines topped the table for best long-haul carrier with a customer score of 87 per cent, while American Airlines appeared at the bottom of the table with a score of 37 per cent.

"Retailers are reporting a 45 per cent increase in sales of Prosecco compared to sales figures last year . Once reserved for special celebrations it seems we no longer require an occasion to pop open the bubbles. Retailers are reporting a 45 per cent increase in sales of Prosecco compared to sales figures last year. Marks & Spencer confirmed yesterday that they had sold 1.6million bottles of the sparkling wine compared to 1.1million over the same period last year. More than that the store’s most popular brand of Prosecco – Conte Priuli priced £12 a bottle – has seen a sales increase of 268 per cent. Another more affordable brand, the Prosecco Masottina which sells for £10 a bottle has seen an equally impressive sales jump of 55 per cent on last year. As a result the supermarket has rushed to launch its first ever Prosecco Magnum in time for the holiday season, priced £20 a bottle. Some wine experts believe the bubble boom has happened as shoppers increasingly look for something more special when purchasing a bottle of wine. But M&S winemaker Jeneve Williams, said she believed the real reason behind the change is the great improvement in good quality affordable sparkling wines. She said: ‘As our customers enjoy Prosecco more often and become increasingly knowledgeable they are seeking out better quality versions, which we believe is behind the great success of the Conte Priuli Prosecco this year. ‘This wine offers customers the opportunity to taste a great quality, delicious Prosecco, with elegant peach and honeysuckle aromas.’ But it’s not just M&S that have seen sales soar. Research from drinks industry experts published earlier this year found that the UK sparkling wine industry as a whole saw sales shoot up by £70million last year making it by far the fastest growing sector in the drinks market.

The figure means that globally sales are now overtaking Champagne for the first time last year . Dror Nativ, M&S Wine Buyer, said: ‘The ongoing Prosecco boom has of course been fuelled by the affordability and approachability of this wine, but what is most interesting is the new trend for enjoying Prosecco as an everyday drink rather than solely on celebratory occasions. ‘Our customers are enjoying Prosecco midweek, at dinner parties with friends, or simply as a treat, and sales show no sign of slowing down.’","Marks & Spencer confirmed yesterday that they had sold 1.6million bottles .

"Spending by overseas visitors to the UK is expected to hit record levels next year with London leading the way as one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations. According to forecasts from VisitBritain, the national tourism agency, spending is likely to reach £22bn in 2015 and will likely top out at £21.3bn in 2014 after passing £20bn for the first time in 2013. As tourists spend more money across the UK, the number of overseas visitors is expected to rise to 35.1 million next year, up 2.5 per cent on 2014.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said: ‘The tourism sector is driving economic growth for Britain. The Olympic Games and Diamond Jubilee gave us a great platform to showcase the best of Britain but we didn't stop there and have kept up the momentum in the last two years. ‘Britain has so much to offer tourists with our stunning countryside, great heritage and world-class sport and culture.

"The Al Qaeda operative dubbed ‘Lady Al Qaeda’ bragged to her student friends at the age of just 21 that she would be proud to be on the FBI’s Most Wanted list. Aafia Siddiqui, who was a biology major at MIT, said in 1993 that she wanted to do ‘something to help our Muslim brothers and sisters’ even if it meant breaking the law. She jumped to her feet and ‘raised her skinny little wrists in the air’ in a display of defiance that shocked her friends. An in-depth account of her journey to infamy also reveals that she took a National Rifle Association shooting class and persuaded other Muslims to learn how to fire a gun. Siddiqui lied to her husband and after they wed over the phone he was stunned to discover she was just marrying him for his family’s connections to better enable her to wage jihad. Aafia Siddiqui, the Al Qaeda operative dubbed ‘Lady Al Qaeda’, bragged to her student friends at the age of just 21 that she would be proud to be on the FBI’s Most Wanted list . Siddiqui, 42, a mother-of-three, eventually got her twisted wish and became the most wanted woman in the world by the FBI. She was arrested in Afghanistan in 2008 by local forces who found her with two kilos of poison sodium cyanide and plans for chemical attacks on New York’s Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire State Building. She was handed to the Americans and convicted of attempted murder two years later in a U.S. court. But her hatred for the U.S. was so strong that during her interrogation she grabbed a rifle from one of her guards and shot at them shouting: ‘Death to Americans’. The Boston Globe profile of Siddiqui’s time in Boston seeks to answer what happened during her 11 years as a student in the U.S. Something happened to radicalize an intelligent and devout woman who not only graduated from MIT but also got a doctorate in neuroscience from Brandeis University. Siddiqui's husband Mohammed Amjad Khan said she lied and only married him for his family’s connections to better enable her to wage jihad . Siddiqui was sent by her neurosurgeon father from Pakistan to study in the U.S. on her own and won a partial scholarship to study at MIT in Cambridge, MA. She arrived there in 1991 having been living with her brother in Texas, for a year where she studied at the University of Houston and gave regular speeches on Islam. During one she told the crowd: ‘The hijab is not a restriction. It allows a woman to be judged by her content, not by her packaging, by what is written on the pages, not the pretty artwork on the cover’ At MIT she made few friends and was remembered as intelligent, driven and a regular at the Prospect Street mosque, which would later be attended by alleged Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev. She wore long sleeves and the hijab and was seen as ‘very sweet’ for a former roommate at her all-female dorm. The focus of her life was the Muslim Student Association but things appear to have changed with the start of the Bosnian War, which seems to have been the beginning of her radicalization. She was arrested in Afghanistan in 2008 by local forces who found her with two kilos of poison sodium cyanide and plans for chemical attacks on New York’s Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire State Building . Siddiqui became involved with the Al-Kifah Refugee Centre, a Brooklyn-based organisation which is thought to have been Al Qaeda’s focus of operations in the US. Terrorism expert Evan Kohlmann said: ‘Aafia was from a prominent family with connections and a sympathy for jihad. She was just what they needed.’ In 1993 as she and some friends debated how to raise money for Muslims being killed during the Bosnian War, one of them joked that they didn’t want to go on the FBI’s Most Wanted List. Waqas Jilani, then a graduate student at Clark University, said: ‘She raised her skinny little wrists in the air and said: ‘I’d be proud to be on the Most Wanted list because it would mean I’m doing something to help our Muslim brothers and sisters’ ‘She said we should all be proud to be on that list’. That same year Siddiqui did a 10-hour NRA shooting course at Braintree Rifle & Pistol Club on her own and urged other Muslims to join her. At MIT Siddiqui made few friends and was remembered as intelligent, driven and a regular at the Prospect Street mosque . Jilani added that Siddiqui said in her speeches that Muslims should ‘get training and go overseas and fight’. He said: ‘We were all laughing like, ‘Uh-oh, Aafia’s got a gun!’ ‘Part of it was because she was such a bad shot, but also because she was always mouthing off about the U.S. and the FBI being so bad and all.’ Siddiqui married Mohammed Amjad Khan, the son of a wealthy Pakistani family, in a ceremony carried out over the phone before he flew to Boston. But upon arrival he discovered that far from being the quiet religious woman he had been promised, her life was very different. He said: ‘I discovered that the well-being of our nascent family unit was not her prime goal in life.

In 1993 Siddiqui did a 10-hour NRA shooting course at Braintree Rifle & Pistol Club, pictured, on her own and urged other Muslims to join her . Khan said: ‘Invariably this would lead to unpleasantness, so I decided to keep my work separate.... ‘...By now, all her focus had shifted to jihad against America, instead of preaching to Americans so that they all become Muslims and America becomes a Muslim land’. The breaking point was the September 11 2001 attacks after which Siddiqui, who was by now dressing in all black, insisted they return to Pakistan and got a divorce. American officials suspect she remarried Ammar Al-Baluchi, the nephew of 9/11 architect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, though her family deny this. Siddiqui and her children disappeared in Karachi, Pakistan in 2003 shortly after Mohammed was arrested. The following year she was named by FBI director Robert Mueller as one of the seven most wanted Al Qaeda operatives, and the only woman. What happened in Pakistan before her arrest is unclear and even during her U.S. trial judge Richard Berman said he did not know what she was doing. But even now such is her importance as a symbol of defiance to the West that Islamic State fighters publicly stated they wanted to swap her for James Foley, the American photojournalist they executed earlier this year. Siddiqui declined to be interviewed when approached by the Boston Globe at the Federal Prison in Fort Worth, Texas, where she is being held.","During her 11 years as a student in the U.S., biology major Aafia Siddiqui become the Al Qaeda operative dubbed 'Lady Al Qaeda'

"An alcoholic with a history of violence escaped prison by apologising to his wife for brutally attacking her – then beat her to death weeks later. Now police forces have been ordered to stop the practice of ‘restorative justice’ because of fears that domestic abusers have such control over their victims that they can force them to accept an apology. The Mail on Sunday can reveal the new guidelines were brought in after the horrific case of Charles Forster, who was violent towards Susan, his wife of 28 years. New guidelines have been brought in after the horrific case of Charles Forster (left), who was violent towards Susan (right), his wife of 28 years . Forster had been visited by Durham Police four times but was never prosecuted. On April 20, 2011, officers visited the couple’s home near Bishop Auckland after one of their children reported her mother had a badly bruised face. Mrs Forster, 51, tearfully told a female constable that her alcoholic husband had pushed her during an argument, causing her to bang her head. But she did not want to press charges, and as Forster appeared to be ‘remorseful’ police dealt with the incident by way of restorative justice. But just 27 days later, Forster murdered his long-suffering wife, who worked as a carer. A neighbour heard him shouting ‘Get up off the floor’ and ‘I’m going to f****** kill you’. Through a window, the neighbour saw him hitting her with his metal walking stick. Mrs Forster was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene on May 17, and was later found to have suffered 11 broken ribs as well as 21 injuries to her head and neck. Forster, then 63, was given a minimum jail term of 13 years. He died behind bars last month. Forster, then 63, was given a minimum jail term of 13 years at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured). He died behind bars last month . The Independent Police Complaints Commission investigated and although it did not blame any officers for what happened, it made a series of national recommendations to ensure nothing similar could happen again. Commissioner Cindy Butts said last night: ‘It was of significant concern to us that there was a conflict in two force policies that allowed restorative justice to be used to deal with the assault claim made a month before Susan Forster was murdered. ‘I hope this national recommendation will allow forces to learn lessons from this.’ All forces were told by the Association of Chief Police Officers last year that ‘restorative justice should not be used as an alternative to prosecution until alternative ways of dealing with domestic abuse have been thoroughly evaluated’. But HM Inspectorate of Constabulary reported this year that some forces were still ‘routinely’ allowing wife-beaters to get away with saying sorry. Durham Police said: ‘This incident is still subject to a serious case review. It would not be appropriate to comment.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘It is not acceptable to use restorative justice in cases of domestic abuse.’","Charles Forster escaped prison by apologising to his wife for attacking her .

"Sally Fitzgibbons admits she is far more at home on a surfboard than on a yacht, unable to enjoy her experience in the Sydney to Hobart race as she spent much of the journey with her head in a bucket. Although it seems logical that the surfing champion would be well-accustomed to the ocean, the 24-year-old admits her experience on board supermaxi Perpetual LOYAL was less than desirable as she was struck down with debilitating seasickness. Her face was a shade of green as she stepped off the boat in Rose Bay, confessing that she had struggled to find her sea legs. The athlete spent the trip in her bunk, 'holding my bucket - everything was coming up,' she told SMH. 'I feel like I've been run over by a boat,' she confessed on Sunday to News Limited. Scroll down for video . Surfer Sally Fitzgibbons admits that she struggled to find her sea legs, spending most of the journey 'with her head in a bucket' The 24-year-old was on board the Perpetual LOYAL, which was forced to turn back to Sydney after suffering damage when it 'ran into something' The vessel sustained damage to its hull and started taking in water and was forced to pull out of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race . 'I was originally on deck and going great guns and then — whack — I started to feel it. My head just started spinning on my neck and that was it.,' she told Fox Sports. The crew on board Perpetual LOYAL were forced to return to Sydney less than 24 hours into the race after it 'hit something', hearing 'a couple of massive thuds' which caused hull damage. Wild Oats XI claimed lines honours for a record eighth time, completing the race in two hours, three minutes and six seconds. The crew motored back to Sydney from the South Coast, off the coast of Eden, and the celebrity crew, including Fitzgibbons, boxer Danny Green and former rugby player Phil Waugh, arrived at Rose Bay Marina on Sunday morning. Before the race, Fitzgibbons explained how excited she was to be a part of the crew and described her involvement in the race as 'a dream'. Although she loved the comradery of the crew, the self-confessed competitive athlete vowed to return to finish the race, despite her unexpected and extreme sea sickness.

Bell said he was 'disappointed' the Perpetual LOYAL had to retire, adding: 'We're all gutted.' He told reporters after docking the yacht seemed to have had 'some sort of collision'. 'It was very a tough call to make [to retire], especially when the crew dug in that first part of the race,' Bell told Channel 9's Today. 'I was so proud of the guys. We just ripped in and really gave it our all.' The extent and exact location of the damage is yet to be seen. 'It's actually more underneath the boat… suggesting something just under the water line was probably the cause of it,' he said. One of the many celebrities on board was Australian champion sailor Tom Slingsby who echoed Bell's disappointment. 'It is disappointing but safety first. It is a dangerous sport and you're dealing with Mother Nature, you're out in the ocean and you can't see land, if things go wrong they can go really wrong.' he told Channel 7's Weekend Sunrise.

"Michael Sam dismissed the thought that his sexuality has cost him a spot in the NFL. 'I don't like to think that way,' Sam said in an Oprah Winfrey Network documentary that aired Saturday night. 'But I do believe I'm a very talented football player and I'm going to continue working hard and try to get that opportunity to play in the league.' The first openly gay player drafted in the NFL has no regrets. Interview: Michael Sam spoke about his experience in the NFL draft in an Oprah Winfrey interview . 'I did everything I was supposed to do. I did everything right,' Sam said. 'I am proud of how I handled things.' Sam said coming out was the right thing to do. He would have preferred the news come out after he informed the team that drafted him, but he feared it would be revealed and felt pressure to control the situation. 'It didn't need to be public,' Sam said. 'Why do gay people have to do it?' The production was billed as the player's first TV appearance since being cut by the Dallas Cowboys in mid-October and played like a personal 'Hard Knocks.' The 90-minute program was followed by a one-on-one with Winfrey, who asked Sam whether he believed sexual orientation is hurting his chances, and how long he'd keep trying. 'As long as I can,' Sam replied. The documentary details countless anxious hours during the NFL draft, which Sam called 'the longest three days of my life.' The New York Jets telephoned his agents to say they weren't interested, and the Cowboys texted to say they were out, too. 'I did everything I was supposed to do': Michael Sam, the first openly gay man drafted by an NFL team, said he is proud of his decision to come out . Sam, who rose to stardom after a difficult childhood in tiny Hitchcock, Texas, asked that the sound on the TV be turned down at one point before the St. Louis Rams took him late in the seventh round. 'Am I going undrafted?' a frustrated Sam asked agent Cameron Weiss. 'This phone still has not beeped.' Sam said the reassuring hand of his boyfriend, Vito Cammisano, on his shoulder during the wait to get picked affirmed the decision last February to reveal his sexual orientation to the nation. He informed Missouri coaches and players before his senior season and was the team MVP and SEC co-defensive player of the year. 'In that moment, I was like ""I don't care what happens. I made the right choice to come out,""' Sam said. Sam broke down in sobs when Rams coach Jeff Fisher telephoned just before the team made him the 249th pick of the 256-pick draft. He had been projected to be chosen as early as the fourth round. Sam kissed and hugged Cammisano and then the two smashed cake in each other's faces as a national television audience looked on. 'Some say the kiss, the cake, it was all just too much,' Winfrey said in the voiceover prom for the program. 'Some say he wasn't good enough. Others say he should have never come out, one saying during the introduction to the program that he would be the mother of all distractions.' Sam called it the 'infamous kiss.' He said it was spontaneous and added he'd thought the cameras had been turned off. 'Everyone made a big deal out of it,' Sam said. 'It's just a kiss. Did you forget that I was gay? Should I be kissing a woman instead?' Sam was among 21 players waived by the team to reach the 53-player limit before the season opener. Echoing his remarks after making the pick, coach Jeff Fisher said several times it was purely a football decision. The Rams were well-stocked with pass rushers, and undrafted Ethan Westbrooks grabbed the final defensive end spot. 'I will tell you this: I was pulling for Mike,' Fisher said then. 'I really was, and I don't say that very often. Mike came in here and did everything we asked him to do.' On Twitter, roughly an hour after he was cut, Sam thanked the Rams and the city of St. Louis. He also wrote 'The most worthwhile things in life rarely come easy, this is a lesson I've always known. The journey continues.' Sam spent seven weeks on the Cowboys' practice squad before being released and is currently a free agent.","Michael Sam said he stands by decision to come out in Oprah interview .

"The highly-publicized corruption case against former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife has torn their family part, as evidenced by a recent letter written by their oldest child. In September, the McDonnells were both found guilty of taking bribes to promote a vitamin company and currently face up to 30 years in prison for their crimes. But daughter Jeanine McDonnell Zubowsky believes her mother Maureen is mostly responsible, and is one of more than 400 people who have written letters asking for lenient sentence for her father - who was once on the short list to be Mitt Romney's vice presidential candidate. Dad's girl: Jeanine McDonnell Zubowsky (left) has written a letter to the court, asking for a lenient sentence for her father, former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell (center), who was found guilty in September on corruption charges. Pictured above walking him into court with brother Bobby McDonnell (right) Mom's fault: In the letter, Zubowsky puts most of the blame on her mother Maureen (pictured) who she believes may be mentally ill . 'My mom ... has always been concerned about getting discounts or freebees [sic],' Zubowsky wrote in a letter to the court. 'She hid her coordination with people for free or discounted things or services and she didn’t communicate with my dad because she knew he would not approve. ... The testimony about my mom ... unfortunately, was the reality.' Zubowsky added that she believes her mother suffers from mental illness, and that her father planned to address her health after leaving office last January. He never got the chance, since both were indicted just days after he stepped down. The governor's eldest daughter is just one of 440 people who wrote letters asking for a lower sentence for McDonnell including Hose Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and evangelist Pat Robertson. McDonnell's lawyers asked a judge Tuesday to order three years of community service for his federal corruption convictions while prosecutors recommended a prison term of at least 10 years. McDonnell will be sentenced January 6 for promoting a dietary supplement in exchange for more than $165,000 in gifts and loans. His wife, Maureen, also was convicted and will be sentenced Febuary 20. During the trial, McDonnell said he was innocent and that his wife took the brides behind his back, when they grew estranged. 'This offense is a total aberration in what was by all accounts a successful and honorable career,' McDonnell's lawyers wrote. 'Moreover, the conduct that led to this conviction is far outside the 'heartland' of public corruption cases. No public official has ever before been convicted of federal or state corruption charges on the basis of similar conduct.' The attorneys said a sentence of '6,000 hours of full-time, rigorous, unpaid community service at a remote location served over three years' would be appropriate. That amount of hours would be about three years of working 40-hour weeks. Prosecutors argued McDonnell's offense 'was neither isolated nor the product of a single criminal choice. Rather, the defendant has been convicted of a bribery conspiracy that lasted nearly two full years, and the defendant repeatedly made conscious decisions to continue that conspiracy time and again.' Promoters: The McDonnells were indicted a year ago on charges of taking more than $165,000 in cash and gifts to promote Jonnie Williams' vitamin company. Williams pictured above with Maureen McDonnell . Up in the air: Bob McDonnell will be sentenced on January 6, while his wife will be sentenced on February 20. Both face up to 30 years in jail . Going for a spin: Williams told prosecutors that he lent the McDonnells his Ferrari, among other favors . Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams testified under immunity that he spent freely on the McDonnells in order to secure their help promoting his supposed cure-all, the tobacco-derived anti-inflammatory Anatabloc. Among the gifts were: . Nearly $20,000 in designer clothing and accessories for Maureen McDonnell . A $6,500 Rolex watch for her husband . $15,000 in catering for one of their daughter's wedding . Free vacations . Free golf outings . Free spins in Williams' Ferrari . Williams also provided three loans totaling $120,000 . McDonnell's attorneys provided a detailed account of his life and career sprinkled with laudatory quotes from many of the hundreds of friends and associates who wrote letters urging leniency. The government asked U.S. District Judge James Spencer to impose a sentence within a guideline range of just over 10 years to a little less than 13 years. That range was calculated by the U.S. Probation Office based on a number of factors, including McDonnell's background and the seriousness of the offense. It includes an obstruction of justice enhancement based on what prosecutors say are lies in McDonnell's testimony. McDonnell's lawyers are challenging the guideline calculations, arguing that the range should be 33 months to 41 months. They wrote that a prison term of any length, 'much less one of ten years or more,' would be too harsh. Judges usually issue a sentence within the guideline range, but they are not bound by it. Supporters: House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (left), Virginia Senator Tim Kaine (center), and evangelist Pat Robertson (right) were three of the 440 people who wrote letters asking for a lenient sentence for McDonnell . Jeff Bellin, a professor at the College of William and Mary Law School and a former federal prosecutor, said McDonnell is looking at many years in prison. 'The judge would have to have a pretty good explanation why the former governor is getting such favorable treatment,' Bellin said. Defense lawyers said several charitable and religious organizations have offered a volunteer position to McDonnell. They specifically mentioned two: Operation Blessing International and the Catholic Diocese of Richmond. Operation Blessing offered McDonnell jobs heading its hunger relief program in Appalachia or working at its orphanage and fish farm in Haiti. 'As with his volunteering during Hurricane Katrina, Bob has shown an authentic willingness to serve others no matter how difficult the task,' group president Bill Horan said in a statement. Virginia Beach-based Operation Blessing was founded by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson. McDonnell is a graduate of Robertson's Regent University law school. Robertson is one of 440 people who wrote letters supporting McDonnell and filed with the court as an appendix to the sentencing brief. The Catholic Diocese offered to make McDonnell its regional coordinator in southwest Virginia, where he would coordinate prison ministry workshops and migrant worker outreach, defense attorneys said.","Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell was found guilty on corruption charges in September, and will be sentenced on September 6 .

"A new theory has surfaced that downplays North Korea's involvement in the Sony hacking scandal and suggests the people responsible are actually Russian, based on a linguistics study of the leaked emails. Security experts believe the origins of the now-infamous Guardians of the Peace are Russian after analyzing about 1,600 words attached to the Sony emails the hacking group leaked to a variety of media outlets. The words were investigated by Seattle-based cyber security firm Taia Global. 'Our preliminary results show that Sony's attackers were most likely Russian, possibly but not likely Korean and definitely not Mandarin Chinese or German,' the company wrote in a Christmas Eve blog post, according to The New York Daily News. Scroll down for video . New theory: Linguists at Seattle-based cyber security firm Taia Global studied 1,600 words in the 'Guardians of the Peace' emails and postings, and believe the native language of the hackers is Russian. Pictured here is the Red Square in Moscow . The firm deducted that while the analysis did not clear North Korea of any involvement in the hack, it was unlikely. That is based on the phrasing and language used by the hackers, who communicated in English. The Taia Global study determined 15 out of 20 phrasings in the emails matched the Russian language. Nine matched Korean, and none were Mandarin or German. President Obama and the FBI have accused North Korea of being behind the hacking saga in response to the Sony film The Interview, which features a mock death of the country's leader, Kim Jong-un. The government have not released the sources that lead them to direct blame at North Korea. Jong-un has denied any involvement, and accused the United States of temporarily shutting off its internet this week. Earlier this week, Guardians of the Peace failed to deliver a much-hyped 'Christmas gift' they claimed would destroy Sony. 'We are preparing for you a Christmas gift,' the group posted online in mid-December. 'The gift will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting. The gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put Sony Pictures into the worst state.' Yet days later a letter released by the hackers on December 18 said that Sony had 'suffered enough.' People wait in line on Christmas day to watch the first screening of the controversial movie The Interview  in Atlanta, Georgia. The promise of more Sony secrets being revealed has so far failed to materialize . Since then the hackers appear to have turned their attention to the FBI and on December 21 they posted a message which cynically 'praised' the FBI's investigation into the hack, with a link to a video that repeated the phrase 'You are an idiot' repeatedly. On Christmas Day, people flocked to the 300 or so cinemas showing The Interview, saying they are taking a stand for freedom. While the Guardians of Peace may be done, a new hacking group has already stepped in and taken their place, managing to shut down the company's PlayStation network at the worst possible time - Christmas Day. According to Deadline, a group called Lizard Squad is taking credit for the hack, which managed to put the network out of commission for hours not just once, but twice during the holiday. They are also claiming to have done the same to Xbox Live. This hack pales in comparison however to the damage inflicted on Sony and its employees as a result of the Guardians of Peace hack. Game over: The Sony hack that resulted in the leak of thousands of emails exchanges between Hollywood heavyweights including studio head Amy Pascal (right) and Scott Rudin (left) seems to be over . No backlash: This despite the fact that Sony decided to reverse their decision made last week to shelve the film following threats of a terrorist incident . And of those employees, no one has had to endure more than studio head Amy Pascal, whose work emails were released on a near daily basis. The hackers began their reign of terror on November 24 by hacking into employee computers and displaying a flashing skull with a cryptic message informing workers 'we've obtained all your internal data.' The computers would remain down for over a week, and a few days later the hackers deliver their first of many shocking dumps when the leak the Brad Pitt war drama Fury as well as unreleased studio titles including Annie, Mr. Turner, Still Alice and To Write Love On Her Arms online. It was around this time in late November that speculation began to mount that North Korea was likely behind the hack, a claim that seems to be based on nothing other than the fact that the country's UN ambassador Ja Song Nam wrote a letter to UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon taking issue that a film that depicts the assassination of a sitting world leader was allowed to be made, let alone released. And although the Guardians fail to even address these claims, or make any demands of Sony, until well into December, the story continues to grow and is accepted by many as fact long before the FBI claims to have actual proof of the country's involvement. Deny: Following an FBI report that North Korea was behind the attack, King Jong-un (above) released a statement denying the allegation and attacking the United States . It is in December that the hackers really turn things up, dumping an astonishing amount of information in the first two weeks of the month. Salaries of the company's top executives become public, the script for the new James Bond film is leaked, and then there are the emails attacking an assortment of A-list actors, writers and directors, along with a racist exchange between Pascal and her frequent pen-pal in many of these leaked emails, producer Scott Rudin, in which the two mock President Obama by listing what his favorite movie might be. The two would later release individual public apologies for their comments. This racist exchange is still being addressed by Pascal, who flew to New York to meet with Al Sharpton and has given the go ahead to a new program dedicated to promoting racial diversity in film. Pascal does however manage to come off as respectful and understanding when speaking about many of Hollywood's biggest stars, save one incident in which she labels Adam Sandler an 'a**hole' not once, but twice. Rudin on the other hand seems to have no problem talking about the talent behind their back, particularly Angelina Jolie who he labels 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in one email, and in another exchange actually removes from the chain in order to tell Pascal that the actress is 'out of her mind.' During this time the group also starts dumping employee medical records, and most notably there letter on December 8 demanding that Sony stop the release of their upcoming Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview. Then, on December 13 with the scandal at near fever pitch, the group announces plans for their upcoming 'Christmas gift' which they say will put Sony 'into the worst state.' Then things go quiet until December 16, when the group follows up their demand by threatening a terrorist attack of any movie theater set to play The Interview when it is released on December 25. Everywhere: The film has now been released across three viewing platforms - theaters, on demand and online . By day's end, the four largest theater chains in the country announced they will not show the film, and the following day Sony cancels the film's release. It is then that the Guardians release the aforementioned December 18 letter saying the Sony has suffered enough. Things finally turned around on Wednesday however for Sony, when Christmas came exactly one day early and the studio was able to declare victory over their hackers by releasing The Interview online. Making the release even sweeter for Sony was the massive outpouring of public support for the film, with thousands turning out for Christmas Eve midnight screenings across the country and tens of thousands of Americans streaming the film online. And as an added bonus for Sony, the studio will now go down in the history books for becoming the first studio to release a major motion picture online, as well as being the first studio to simultaneously allow for the viewing of a film across three different platforms - theaters, online and video on demand. 'It has always been Sony's intention to have a national platform on which to release this film,' Sony Pictures chair and CEO Michael Lynton said in a statement. 'We chose the path of digital distribution first so as to reach as many people as possible on opening day, and we continue to seek other partners and platforms to further expand the release.' Even more impressive however is how quickly the studio managed to pull this all together after initially deciding to hold off on distributing the film last week. Sony only announced on Tuesday that the film would play in selected theaters and be released to video on demand on Thursday. As for the big online announcement, that was confirmed less than an hour before the movie appeared on Google Play, YouTube, Microsoft Xbox Video and a Sony website created for the film, with the option of renting the film for $5.99 or downloading it for $16.99. There are still questions as to just who was behind the hacking as well, with many experts in the cybersecurity field questioning an FBI report that they say proved North Korea's government masterminded the attack. The experts all firmly believe the hack had to be an inside job.","Seattle-based cyber security firm analyzed 1,600 words attached to the leaked emails and postings of Guardians of the Peace .

"A former Seventh Day Adventists pastor who has lived a year without religion has revealed that he no longer believes God exists. Ryan Bell, 43, made headlines in January when just days into his 'intellectual experiment' to explore atheism he was fired from his two teaching jobs at Christian schools near Los Angeles. Bell was left struggling to support his two young daughters, aged 10 and 13, until an atheist blogger set up an online fundraising site and helped raise over $27,000 to help him support his family. But after 12 months he has admitted that 'looking at the majority of arguments... I don't find there to be a convincing case in my view.' Despite his change in views, Bell insists he is still the same person 'deep down' and thinks atheism is an 'awkward fit'. Scroll down for video . During his year without God, Ryan Bell has found love with Rebecca Pratt, who is a devoted Christian . After a year of living without religion, the 43-year-old has revealed that he no longer believes that God exists . Bell believes that atheism is an 'awkward fit' while his Christian friends are still adapting to his changed views. Talking to NPR he said the main lesson he took away from his experiment was 'that people very much value certainty and knowing and are uncomfortable saying that they don't know. He added: 'I think before I wanted a closer relationship to God and today I just want a closer relationship with reality.' For 19 years Bell had been a pastor, most recently the senior pastor at the Hollywood Seventh-day Adventists Church. Then in March 2013 he resigned his position due to differences over his liberal views - including campaigning against the same-sex marriage ban for gay and lesbians - that didn't go down well with the church. With his 17-year marriage also headed for divorce, Bell suffered a crisis of faith and in January 2014, he began a yearlong journey to explore the limits of theism and the atheist landscape in the U.S. He decided to write a blog about that experiences called Year Without God - A Former Pastor's Journey Into Atheism. 'For the next 12 months I will live as if there is no God,' he wrote in his first entry. 'I will not pray, read the Bible for inspiration, refer to God as the cause of things or hope that God might intervene and change my own or someone else's circumstances. (I trust that if there really is a God that God will not be too flummoxed by my foolish experiment and allow others to suffer as a result).' With his 17-year marriage also headed for divorce, Bell suffered a crisis of faith and in January 2014, he began a yearlong journey to explore the limits of theism and the atheist landscape in the U.S. The past 12 months has proved many testing times for Bell, but he tells the L.A. Times that his also life has started to feel good again. Bell got a job teaching life skills at PATH, a nonprofit helping the homeless, and has also started dating again. His girlfriend, Rebecca Pratt, is - ironically - a devoted Christian but has been open-minded about his journey to live without religion for a year. As the months have progressed, Bell says he has became more and more comfortable with his new life. He currently describes himself as a 'weak atheist' and says he is comfortable with not having all the answers about the meaning of life and why we are here. Bell was left struggling to support his two young daughters, aged 10 and 13, until an atheist blogger set up an online fundraising site and helped raise over $27,000 to help him support his family . Over Christmas, Bell says he has no plans to attend any church services, although the former pastor he still loves the rituals. Then on January 1, his journey will be over and he is expected to make an announcement on his blog about if he is to remain an atheist or return to God. 'I do think I've now seen both sides of the coin,' he told the L.A. Times. 'Being with the atheists, they can have the same sort of obnoxious certainty that some Christians have, and I don't want to be a part of that. It feels like I'm stuck in the middle. 'I want to be for something good, but I don't want boundaries, and religion just feels like a very bounded thing. 'The question I am asking right now: Why do I need religion to love?'

"Owners of nursing homes which offer 'shocking' standards of care will be prosecuted, a Liberal Democrat health minister has pledged. Norman Lamb said the Government is introducing 'fundamental standards' in April next year to ensure there is 'no hiding place' for care home which mentally and physically abuse residents. He highlighted Merok Park home in Banstead, Surrey, which was closed earlier this month after inspectors found distressed residents 'crying out for help' and branded the place 'dangerous'. In chaotic scenes, pensioners were carried out in the freezing night to waiting ambulances after they were deemed 'at significant risk of harm'. Health minister Norman Lamb said owners of nursing homes which offer 'shocking' standards of care will be prosecuted and highlighted Merok Park home in Surrey (pictured), which was closed this month . 'The conditions at Merok Park were really shocking,' Mr Lamb told the Sunday Telegraph. 'Those responsible for such shocking standards have no place in care. There must be no hiding place for poor care and we must ensure that people are held to account if that ever happens. 'It's vital that people have confidence that the place where their loved one is being cared for is safe and provides compassionate, kind care.' He said that when care home companies fall short of standards 'in a serious way' which leads to suffering, the company and 'culpable directors' can be prosecuted. Gladys Wright's son captured her abuse on CCTV. Daniel Baynes was jailed for four months after he was caught abusing the 79-year-old dementia sufferer . Directors of care homes will be given a 'fit and proper person test' in an attempt to drive out those responsible for the worst scandals. All care workers will be required to undergo training under a new care certificate scheme from next year, which Mr Lamb described as 'pretty close to compulsory minimum training standards'. Norman Lamb said the Government is introducing 'fundamental standards' in April next year to ensure there is 'no hiding place' for 'shocking' care home . This comes after figures revealed that 522 care homes and services helping elderly and disabled adults with tasks such as dressing, and preparing meals, did not have adequate staffing figures. Care home watchdog, the Care Quality Commission said this equated to one in 10 of all the elderly services inspected during the course of the year. 'If nine out of 10 are capable of doing it then 10 out of 10 are able to do it,' Mr Lamb said. Families worried that their elderly relatives are being abuse by care home staff are soon to be given official advice on how to secretly install CCTV cameras. The CQC will issue guidance in the New Year explaining how to best monitor staff. Mr Lamb also warned that local authorities, which commission care services must be held to account and said the public had to decide whether they are prepared to spend more on care as the population ages . Last week Andrea Sutcliffe, the head of adult social care inspections at the CQC, warned that Britain did not care enough about elderly people to be able to guarantee them dignified support. In June Daniel Baynes was jailed for four months after he was caught abusing 79-year-old dementia sufferer Gladys Wright on a hidden camera installed by her son James. He and two colleagues, Tomasz Gidaszewski and Janusz Salnikow, were captured swearing at Mrs Wright and manhandling her at Granary Care Home, in Wraxall, North Somerset.= . Dementia sufferer and former nurse Mrs Rees was left with bruises after the ill treatment at the NHS Mary Seacole Nursing Home in Hoxton, east London. She was secretly filmed being abused by Faderera Grace Bello, 54, a staff nurse at an NHS care home and died in May aged 92 following the mistreatment. Gloria Foster, 81, died when she was left without food and medication for nine days after her care provider, Carefirst24, was shut down by immigration officers. Faderera Grace Bello was jailed for carer ill treatment and wilful neglect after Veronica Davis secretly filmed Bello poking her mother Bridget Rees in the face .","Lib Dem Norman Lamb said there will be 'no hiding place' for care homes .

"She has turned her work with crime into sexually explicit novels with a dark twist. Former Sydney police officer, Trish Ingham switched her career path around to do quite the opposite – she is now an international best-selling author of ‘mummy porn’ romance novels. From a Russian ballerina working as a sex slave to escorts and prostitutes falling in love, the 34-year-old writes hardcore sex scenes but leaves her readers at the edge of their seats. Former police officer Trish Ingham is an international best-selling author of 'mummy porn' romance novels . Written under the pen name T.J Hamilton, the mother of two has published five novels after her first release in April last year. ‘When I worked with the police force, I wrote a lot of stories every day and I usually don't see crime but I had to collect a lot of evidence and present them in court,’ Ingham told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I had a lot of contact with women escorts and prostitutes so I guess that's how my novels  unfolded. ‘My first three novels were inspired by true events that I thought were interesting. It’s an insight into a world that not many people know about, and it’s definitely a story to be told.' Her latest novel, which debuted at No.2 on Amazon, Death’s Shadow, tells a story about a young Russian ballerina, who is owned by the mafia and abused and used as a sex slave. ‘It’s a cross between Kill Bill with a mix of romance involved. It’s a dark  read but I’ve included a warning at the front because it’s quite detailed and graphic - it's a romantic thriller,’ she said. The mother of two keeps herself busy with writing and looking after her children - April, 2, and Declan, 11 . The stay-at-home mother from Hervey Bay, north of Brisbane said she is quite open and honest about her career choice. 'I’m not afraid to tell people I am a writer of smut,' she laughed. ‘It’s not something I find embarrassing because I’m proud of writing raunchy sex scenes in my novels. It doesn’t faze me and sex happens all the time and I’ve embraced that in my novels. But Ingham does admit she kept her book career under wraps when she first started. ‘I didn’t really tell many people because it’s an avenue that not many women go down but after my first release, I have had a huge amount of support from my family and friends. ‘It’s funny because when I wrote my first book, I put on the acknowledgement “I hope mum never reads this” but now she’s one of my biggest fans. ‘Some of my 11-year-old son’s teachers at the school all know what I do so it’s certainly not something I’m hiding. And Declan is at an age where he’s aware of the content and knows that they’re for adults. Written under the pen name T.J Hamilton, Ingham has published five novels after her first release in April last year, with her latest Death Shadows (far right), which debuted at No.2 on Amazon . The international best-selling author at her own book signing earlier this year during an Author book tour . While her novels are soaring in popularity with women who want to indulge in the saucy content, Ingham's female readers range from all ages. ‘I had a 70-year-old woman, who is married for 40 odd years, contact me to say that my books put a spark back into her marriage. It’s delightful when people reach out to me and tell how my novels have affected them,’ she said. ‘My books are targeted for women – for the average mum at home with kids who are searching for that escapism in my books. ‘These books go to another place – It’s that little bit of escape and daily grind for the readers who normally wouldn’t imagine these fantasies in their own mind.’ The 34-year-old (pictured with her husband Matt, 39) writes sexually explicit novels with a dark twist . As she continues exploring the world of writing, Ingham is set to release new and exciting novels in 2015 . Ingham, who has worked with the intelligence and the Middle Eastern crime squad, said the best part about writing a novel is the moment she pens ‘the end’. ‘It’s the best part but it is a flood of emotions when I get to the end of the book. I don’t like to say goodbye because the characters become a part of my life and I’ve also cried at the end. As she continues to explore the world of writing and is set to release new novels in 2015, Ingham said she doesn't plan on returning to the police force any time soon. 'There have been many days where I've missed the police force and just seeing the events unfolding in Sydney recently and my workmates on TV - it's different watching it from the outside,’ she said. 'Parts of me want to be there again to help but I think my family comes first and I've found a passion in writing so I couldn't imagine doing anything else but this.’","The former police officer is now an international best-selling author .

"For the man who is synonymous with the vacuum cleaner, it is his crowning glory. After making billions as Britain’s best known engineer, Sir James Dyson has become one of the biggest private landowners in England, surpassing even the Queen. His latest acquisition is the 3,000-acre Cranwell and Roxholme estate in Lincolnshire, bought from the Crown Estate. New direction? There are reports that James Dyson could look into new innovations in farming technology . Home: The entrepreneur has lived for a decade in a manor at Dodington Park, Gloucestershire (pictured) The 67-year-old inventor now owns around 25,000 acres – 5,000 more than the Monarch does in her own right with her 20,000-acre estate in Sandringham. According to Kevin Cahill, author of Who Owns Britain and Ireland, Sir James’s recent purchase has seen his vast estate dwarf those of many members of the aristocracy. He owns almost double the land of the Duke of Bedford, who has an estimated 13,000 acres in Bedfordshire and neighbouring counties, 14,000 acres more than the Duke of Marlborough’s 11,000-acre Oxfordshire estate based at Blenheim, and more than three times the Duke of Wellington’s 7,000-acre Hampshire estate. Sir James, best known for the bagless vacuum cleaner, has declined to reveal how much the land in Lincolnshire cost. Dodington Park's impressive entrance hall - the 18th century Georgian manor boasts 51 rooms in total . Extensive: The Queen's estate at Sandringham, Norfolk (pictured) is among few lands to be owned outright by her in a similar way to a private citizen, while the rest of her land is managed by the Crown Estate . Sprawling: The Sandringham estate. Together with the Balmoral estate, it is privately owned by the monarch . But his Beeswax Farming, believed to be wholly owned by him or his family, is estimated to have land, machinery and property worth £217 million. ‘I grew up in agricultural north Norfolk,’ Sir James, whose fortune is estimated at £3 billion, told The Sunday Times. ‘As a schoolboy and college student I used to spend my holidays working on local farms harvesting potatoes, sprouts, parsley and blackcurrants. 'I’m enjoying farming in Lincolnshire, which is similar to Norfolk.’ His Nocton and Carrington estates are also in Lincolnshire. Sir James’s main home for the past 11 years has been Dodington Park, an 18th century Georgian manor with 51 rooms in Gloucestershire near the headquarters of his engineering firm in Wiltshire. He helped to remodel the 300 acres of parkland and expand its formal gardens. He and his wife Deirdre Hindmarsh also have a £3 million château in France, and a town house in Chelsea. The entrepreneur, who recently announced a £1.25 billion investment drive in new products, including robots which can clean floors and do other chores while homeowners are out, says he hopes Dyson technology can also be harnessed to revolutionise farming techniques.","Incredible feat made possible because Queen owns little land outright .

"An Alaskan man is extremely lucky to be alive after being forced to spend three days in the wilderness battling not only sub-zero temperatures but also the advances of a hungry wolverine. Craig Johnson from Barrow was halfway through an 80-mile trek through remote Alaska to visit family for the holidays in Wainwright when his snowmobile fell through the ice on December 15. As his snowmobile sank, Johnson, 38, was submerged in freezing water up to his chest before he managed to crawl back to a thicker part of the ice. Scroll down for video . Craig Johnson, 38, is extremely lucky to be alive after being forced to spend three days in the Alaskan wilderness battling sub-zero temperatures and the advances of a hungry wolverine . Johnson sought refuge from the subzero conditions and the wolverine by climbing inside this wooden box . 'I almost gave up... But I couldn't give up. I had to do it for my boys, my family,' he told ABC News. 'I think it's a miracle that I'm alive.' In his frozen clothes and enduring subzero temperatures with a windchill estimated at 35 below zero, Johnson walked 30 miles searching for help before a wolverine started to stalk him. 'You could hear it on the ice, just playing with me, toying with me,' he said. After failing to shoot the animal and then running out of bullets, Johnson was forced to use a stick to defend himself. Fortunately Johnson stumbled upon a wooden box that he was able to use as shelter. Unfortunately the down side of being stuck in the box was that it made it even more difficult for several rescue helicopters that flew past to try and find him. For more videos, please go to ABC GMA . After failing to shot the wolverine with his gun, Johnson was forced to use a stick to defend himself . 'That third night when they passed right by me - not even 200, 300 yards - that's when I lost hope,' Johnson said. 'I just laid back down in that box I was in. It just felt like that was an open grave for me.' With temperatures of -35 degrees, a search team led by Johnson's cousin desperately hunted for him. The wind and snow had erased almost all signs of Johnson and was only rescued when his cousin heard his desperate screams. 'I've never heard someone yell like that anywhere,' said Benson. 'If Clifford didn't saw me, that was going to be my last night,' said Johnson. They were going to bring me home in a body bag.' Johnson, who suffered severe frostbite, hypothermia, dehydration and internal injuries from the snowmobile crash, is currently recovering at an Anchorage hospital. He said his will to survive was partly fueled by his father's death in 1998 when he had fallen through the ice and drowned.","Craig Johnson, 38, is extremely lucky to be alive after being forced to spend three days in the Alaskan wilderness battling sub-zero temperatures .

"It was first used in the 1800s to ridicule eccentrically-dressed men and was later consolidated into American teen speak through 80s cult movies. But although it is still the most common way to refer to your friends, it seems the word 'dude' is actually far more popular in certain parts of the U.S. than others. According to new data, the term of endearment - made popular through the likes of Wayne's World and Bill and Ted - has been replaced with bro, buddy and fella in many parts of the country. Dude is still the most common term of endearment in the U.S and is mainly used by those in the southwest . In the north of the country, the most popular moniker appears to be 'buddy', according to this map . Although it is still the dominant force in the southwest, those in the deep south of the U.S tend to use the word 'bro' to refer to their friends. Meanwhile, those in the north of the country prefer to use 'buddy', while 'pal' is almost exclusively used in the northeast. 'Fella' - one of the least popular vocatives - is more scattered around the country. The research, published by Quartz on an interactive map, was put together by Jack Grieve, who analysed billions of tweets which had been collated by Diansheng Guo from the University of South Carolina. The linguist identified different monikers used across the U.S, before grouping them together depending on the geography of the tweets. The word 'bro' tends to be reserved for those living in the south, according to data taken from Twitter . Meanwhile, the word 'fella' tends to be more scattered around the country, but is not as popular . The research, by linguist Jack Grieve, shows the word 'pal' is most popular in the north of the country . He found that there were certain areas of the map where certain words were used more than others. One common word not included in the data was 'man'. Mr Grieve said the word is used in too many other contexts to be able to be accurately included. Quartz also said most of the tweets had been sent by white men, which it said showed the bias of the English language against women and those of other races.","'Dude' is still most popular term to call friends in the U.S, research shows .

"Two-thirds of Australians failed to keep their New Year's resolution this year, with most breaking their commitments in the first three months. A survey by financial comparison website finder.com.au found that the most popular resolution for 2015 is to improve health and fitness, followed by money-related goals and resolutions relating to relationships. The research found that the first three months of the year are critical to success, with 80 percent of people who failed saying they did so in the first three months. Scroll down for video . Krystle Keller, 30, from Glebe in Sydney wants to get fitter, more toned and lose weight in 2015 . CC Thornley, 40, a banjo player from Victoria, tried to quit smoking in 2014 and plans to quit again in 2015 . Of those who failed at their 2014 resolution, 35 percent said their goal was too unrealistic and 33 percent did not track their progress. Almost a quarter percent said they forgot about their New Year's resolution and one in 10 said they made too many resolutions. CC Thornley, a professional banjo player from Torquee in Victoria, tried to quit smoking in 2014 but ended up taking it up again after six months. 'I progressively cut back in the middle of the year, and went without, but around the end of this year there were quite a few parties and it just sort of happened, you just think one won't hurt,' Mr Thornley said. Mr Thornley, 40, is planning to quit again in 2015. 'It's about fitness more than anything else because I surf a fair bit, so my resolution is to keep active and keep surfing more.' Renee Molony, who works in insurance, set out to buy an investment property in 2014 but ended up buying a house with her father.

The 33-year-old, from South Plympton in Adelaide, already owns a unit but wants to start a property portfolio so she can eventually own a large property in the country. 'I saved up during the year and then about October I found somewhere and I couldn't get the loan on my own,' Ms Molony said. 'It was either go halves with dad or not do it at all.' She cut back on spending drastically and made extra cash by participating in paid surveys and collecting bottles and cans. In 2015 Ms Molony's resolution is to renovate her unit, and she plans to use the same tactics to achieve her goal.

Krystle Keller, who is doing a PHD in marine biology, can't remember her 2014 resolution but wants to get fitter and lose weight in 2015. 'I want to be able to do racing and triathlons and stuff – I've got a lot of friends who are really fit want me to join them and I want to get to the level where I can do that,' Ms Keller said. 'Women often have bigger thighs and bigger bellies and I just want to get rid of that.' The 30-year-old, from Glebe in Sydney, said she sharing her New Year's resolution with people to help her stick to her goal. 'I'm telling a lot of my friends and family and trying to get them to encourage me – it helps to stay motivated,' Ms Keller said. The first three months of the year are critical to success, with 80 percent of people who failed saying they did so in the first three months . Almost three-quarters of the more than 2000 people surveyed did not tell anybody what their New Year's resolution was. Of those who did share their goals and ended up achieving them, 76 percent said talking about it helped. The majority of people who were successful in achieving their goals took more than six months to achieve it. Finder spokeswoman Michelle Hutchison said the best way to achieve your goals is to make a clear plan and don't overload yourself. 'Be realistic with what you can achieve and don't set too many goals,' Ms Hutchison said. 'It's OK to set more than one goal but if they are simple and obtainable they will more likely be reached.' Ms Molony already owns a unit but wants a property portfolio so she can eventually buy property in the country . Her other tips include: . Share your goals: 'Let your family and friends know about your resolutions - this can help you be accountable for your goals, help you commit to them and create a support network around you that can help you.' Keep track: 'Use an online tool or set yourself reminders to ensure you keep track on your progress.' Make it happen: 'Don't just set some goals then forget about them. If you are planning to save for something like a holiday, you'll need to review your finances, start researching the costs, set yourself a budget and work out how much you will need to save each month to reach it.' Set small goals throughout the year: 'If you have one big goal you set out to achieve, it probably won't happen all of a sudden by the end of the year. Most goals need small steps to reach the end goal.' On Monday, Finder launched an online tool which allows people to select their goal for 2015, share it on social media and receive email reminders to help stay on track.","Two-thirds of Australians failed to keep their New Year's resolution in 2014 .

"At six-and-a-half years old, Denise Sumpter’s daughter is the oldest child still breastfeeding in the UK - and her mother has no plans to stop any time soon. Instead Ms Sumpter will let Belle decide when it’s time to quit. Currently, the Year Two pupil asks for a feed when she is tired, ill or simply wants some bonding time with her mum. The frequency varies. The little girl sometimes asks to be fed as much as twice a day or as little as once a week. Healthy: Denise Sumpter, 44, says extended breastfeeding has left her daughter Belle happier and healthier . Sometimes she feeds on her own, and other times she latches on alongside 18-month-old brother Beau. And Ms Sumpter, 44, insists she will continue until Belle decides it is time to stop. 'I’ll feed Belle as long as she asks,' she says. 'I don’t know how long that will be. It will be the same with Beau. I don’t think there’s anything weird about it. I feed both children on demand - whenever they want it.' Belle is a head taller than most of her classmates and is rarely ill. Her mother puts this down to her 'mama’s milk', which she also says is responsible for the confidence of her clever daughter - a talented violinist, singer and dancer who is top of the class in most subjects. Ms Sumpter, a PhD student of ancient science, says: 'I have two healthy, bright, confident children who I truly believe have benefitted from breast milk, and continue to do so.' She also has the backing of partner Jules Deering, 47, a technical director at a university drama department. 'Breastfeeding hasn’t impacted my sex life in any way,' she adds. 'It hasn’t ruined my breasts.' In fact she credits it with helping her keep her figure and her health, saying: 'I’m protected from various cancers and can eat what I want without gaining weight.' But she insists that the benefits it gives to her children are the driving force. 'Mothers who feed for longer are often accused of being selfish,' she says. 'There are things I get out of it - like calm, happy children. But I can say with certainty I’ve done this entirely for the benefit of my kids. 'When Belle finishes I’ll be sad but it’s a natural progression. Her milk teeth are going and I get the impression she won’t be feeding for much longer. But she can take her time.' Benefits: Denise has also benefitted and says continued breastfeeding means she stays slim with ease . Ms Sumpter admits her choice has raised eyebrows, saying: 'I used to get the odd comment from relatives who’d say ""here we go with the milk thing again"". 'But I think because people know I’m confident in my decision they let me get on with it.' However, Belle no longer feeds from her mother in public. 'I will sometimes tell Belle no,' says Ms Sumpter. 'She hasn’t asked to be fed publicly since she was about four or five. Luckily, I haven’t had many negative responses.' Despite her insistence on the benefits of breastfeeding long term, Ms Sumpter says she never planned to continue breastfeeding for so long. When Belle was a newborn, she expected to feed her for six months to a year at the most - but when the time came she began to change her mind. 'I heard women talking about tricking their babies to stop breastfeeding, or simply taking it away,' she says. 'Belle seemed so tiny and she really needed her milk.' Once she started to look into the subject, she discovered baby-led weaning. 'It became clear that the norms in this country aren’t necessarily correct or what is best for children,' she says. 'The World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding up to two years and beyond. I decided to let nature play its course.' Ms Sumpter, from Islington. North London, found help and advice through groups such as breastfeeding support organisation La Leche League. 'Having a strong support network is really important,' she says. 'I try to help parents with the information I have as it saves lives, empowers women and makes children happy. Weaning: Denise says her children will decide when to stop breastfeeding themselves . 'When mums are told to cover up while breastfeeding in Claridge’s or ignorant politicians like UKIP leader Nigel Farage tell nursing mums to ""sit in the corner"", it only does harm. 'What we need is more openness and more truth so mums can make informed decisions.' She adds: 'There are so many myths about breastfeeding it’s unreal. People argue that after a certain age breast milk has no nutritional benefits but that’s nonsense - there is not a single food source that suddenly stops being nutritious. 'My children have hardly been ill. Beau came down with something the other day and because I nursed him through it he was better in 24 hours. 'I’ve had similar with Belle. If they’re upset it calms them. It helps them sleep.' She also says that accusations of fostering an unhealthily dependent relationship between her and her children are untrue. 'People think by feeding Belle this long I will stunt her confidence. But she is extremely independent - if anything, she can be too bolshy sometimes,' she says. 'Her teachers say she is mature for her age. She’s been away from me at her nan’s for a week and was fine.' She admits: 'If you’d asked me five years ago I never would have thought I’d still be breastfeeding Belle. However, it turned out to be one of the best things I could have done for my family.' And for little Belle and Beau, nothing could seem more natural. 'Belle understands not everyone breastfeeds as long as her, but she’s proud of it. 'She’ll pretend to breastfeed her dolls. The other day at playgroup Beau picked up a toy bottle and didn’t have a clue what it was. I was proud of that.'","Denise Sumpter, 44, is still breastfeeding her six-year-old daughter .

Hunter Kelly, joint administrator to City Link, said the company has incurred substantial losses over several years. 'These losses reflect a combination of intense competition in the sector, changing customer and parcel recipient preferences, and difficulties for the company in reducing its cost base,' he said. 'The strain of these losses became too great and all but used up Better Capital's £40 million investment, which was made in 2013 and intended to help to turn around the company. Union officials have been holding talks with administrators to try to save employees' jobs. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: 'RMT's objective now is to do everything we can to rescue jobs in the wake of the shock collapse into administration of City Link on Christmas Day. 'Despite the festive season there can be no delays in getting on with the rescue programme and we expect the Government through Vince Cable to take an active role right now. The thousands of workers caught in the middle of this crisis deserve full support from every quarter.' The union has demanded 'urgent talks' with Business Secretary Mr Cable and said it is disappointed the minister will not meet them until the new year. Retailers who used City Link, such as John Lewis and Amazon, have had to take emergency measures to ensure the delivery of parcels. Roger Sumner-Rivers, founder of London-based firm ParcelHero, said the firm's closure could have a major impact on the UK parcel market. He said there were now 'serious concerns as to how the carriers left in the market are going to be able to absorb the estimated 76 million additional parcels City Link delivered each year'. 'The companies will all require immediate service, which will put a huge burden on every carrier's infrastructure, from the sales department right through the network to the delivery couriers at the other end,' he added.","Courier firm City Link went into administration on Christmas Day .

"A Zambian citizen jailed for setting alight council buildings during the 2011 London riots has won his battle to stay in the UK on the grounds he 'would not be welcomed' in his homeland. Joseph Janbazian Zulu, 20, was sentenced to four and a half years for arson and violent conduct for his part in the riots. He was to be sent to his homeland of Zambia but an immigration tribunal overturned the decision. Joseph Janbazian Zulu was sentenced to four years for arson and violent conduct for his part in the riots . Janbazian got involved in the 2011 riots and set fire to the offices near his home in Haringey, north London . Conservative MP Philip Hollobone said he was disgusted by the decision. He told the Sun on Sunday: 'This is unacceptable. The human rights act needs to be replaced. 'Any foreign national convicted of a crime should be deported and banned from ever returning.' Janbazian moved to the UK from Zimbabwe in 2003 to join his mother and was granted indefinite leave to remain in 2010. He has two older brothers who also live in the UK and two younger half siblings whose father is a Nigerian national now married to his mother. Janbazian got involved in the riots during the summer of 2011 and set fire to the offices near his home in Haringey, north London. He denied arson and violent disorder but was convicted by a jury. He was ordered to return to his homeland and was told he could keep in touch with his relatives via phone and internet. However he said it breached his right to family life and an immigration tribunal allowed him to remain in the UK. Tory MP Philip Hollobone said he was disgusted by the decision and that it was 'totally unacceptable' At the tribunal, he said he had never lived in Zambia and had no friends, relatives or contacts there. He added he would have no employment, accommodation and prospects and would be forced to live on the streets. Janbazian, who now lives in Wolverhampton, said he would be unfamiliar with the culture in Zambia and would be at a 'significant disadvantage' because he was mixed race and did not have the 'facial characteristics or skin colour' of many Zambians. In his witness statement he said: 'I would have nowhere to live and would not be able to support myself. 'I would be homeless and living on the streets. I feel that as a mixed race person, I would be subject to attack and fear for my personal safety.' His mother, in her witness statement, added: 'I do not have any family in Zambia. Joseph does not know anyone in Zambia; he would have nowhere to live and would end up on the streets. 'He would have difficulty fitting in to any local community. He is of mixed race ethnicity. I do not have any home town I belong to in Zambia.' An appeal judge backed his case and also said he had 'expressed remorse for his crimes, has not committed any other crimes, had disassociated himself from his friends in his neighbourhood and had matured.' He also pointed out that the claimant would 'not be welcomed (in Zambia) by either the authorities or those in the community given his criminal record.' The judge concluded that  the effects of deportation 'would be unjustifiably harsh.'","Joseph Janbazian Zulu, 20, sentenced to four and a half years for arson .

"Ed Miliband faces humiliation in Scotland after a poll revealed Labour could be left with just three Scottish MPs after next year’s general election. The Scottish National Party is now on course to secure more than 50 seats in May, meaning Alex Salmond could hold the balance of power at Westminster. Such a dramatic collapse in Labour’s support in Scotland could easily offset any gains made in England and Wales and destroy Mr Miliband’s hopes of getting into Downing Street. Ed Miliband faces humiliation in Scotland after a poll revealed Labour could be left with just three Scottish MPs after the General Election . The prediction of a Scottish wipeout comes as it was revealed Mr Miliband was barred from speaking at a key event in the referendum campaign because he was seen as a liability north of the border. The Guardian/ICM poll of Westminster voting intentions put the SNP on 43 per cent in Scotland - nearly double its 2010 general election performance. Labour fell by 16 percentage points to 26 per cent, with the Conservatives on 13 per cent, Ukip on seven per cent and the Lib Dems on six per cent. Based on the overall poll figures, Labour would get ten of the 59 Scottish seats, compared to 45 for the SNP, three for the Liberal Democrats and one for the Conservatives. But when trends for each region are taken into account, it reveals there has been a bigger 22 per cent swing towards the SNP in ‘safe’ Labour seats. It indicates Labour will lose all but three of the 41 seats they won in 2010, with the Nationalists securing a commanding 53 seats, compared to just six now. Among the constituencies that would fall to the SNP under this forecast is the new Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy’s East Renfrewshire seat, which he has held since 1997. Leading polling expert Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University said: ‘There is no reason to believe that the swing to the SNP does not extend to what are supposedly the safest Labour seats in Scotland. ‘If anything, the swing appears to be even greater in such seats. Mr Miliband was reportedly asked by former Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont (right): ‘Why are you here? You are not winning any votes’ ‘If we take into account the difference in the movement in different types of seats then the estimate becomes SNP 53, Labour three, and Liberal Democrat three - while the Conservatives emerge empty handed. ‘In short, pretty much every Labour seat in Scotland has to be regarded as currently at risk of being lost to the SNP.’ Yesterday it was claimed that Mr Miliband was stopped from speaking at a rally on the eve of the Scottish referendum. Mr Miliband was reportedly asked by former Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont ‘Why are you here? You are not winning any votes.’ Another Labour source described Mr Miliband as a ‘total liability’ who had a ‘hugely negative’ impact on the campaign and ‘didn’t win us one vote’. It was also claimed relations between Mr Miliband and his election co-ordinator Douglas Alexander have plummeted to a new low and they are barely on speaking terms. Mr Miliband allies have accused Mr Alexander of ‘sulking’ since Manchester Labour MP Lucy Powell was put in charge of day-to-day election campaigning. But Mr Alexander’s friends have hit back, claiming he is ‘frustrated’ by Mr Miliband’s ‘inability to act decisively’. Alex Salmond stepped down as First Minister following the Scottish referendum, but will stand for the SNP in the Gordon constituency at next May’s election leading to the possibility of a comeback at Westminster.","Labour could be left with just three MPs in Scotland after 2015 Election .

"The Empire State Building paid tribute to NYPD Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu on Saturday night with a red, white and blue light design. An official Twitter account for the New York City skyscraper said 'Our tower is lit in blue with a siren mast to honor fallen @NYPDnews Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.' The 'siren' was created using flashing red and white lights on the building. The Empire State Building featured the light scheme on Saturday, the same day as Ramos' funeral. Both Ramos and Liu were killed in a brazen daytime ambush one week ago. Scroll down for videos . Tribute: The Empire State Building remembered NYPD Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu on Saturday night with a red, white and blue light design . Honor: The Empire State Building featured the design on Saturday, the same day as Ramos' funeral . At least one NYPD precinct thanked the staff of the skyscraper for its light design, with the 10thPprecinct tweeting 'Once again, thank you Empire State Building for honoring #RafaelRamos and #WenjianLiu #GoneButNeverForgotten.' Tens of thousands of police officers, state troopers, sheriff's deputies and others from law enforcement agencies big and small across the country gathered at Ramos' funeral. The sea of blue uniforms stretched for blocks outside the Christ Tabernacle Church in Queens on Saturday, as police helicopters flew above in a missing-man formation and Ramos' body was carried by pallbearers in a casket draped in the New York Police Department flag. The NYPD estimates more than 20,000 officers attended. 'When an assassin's bullet targeted two officers, it targeted this city and it touched the soul of an entire nation,' Vice President Joe Biden said in his eulogy. But the somber day, reminiscent of the bond New Yorkers shared after the September 11 attacks and Superstorm Sandy, was not without tension. Victims: Officers Rafael Ramos (left) and Wenjian Liu (right) were killed last week in a brazen daytime ambush . Solemn: Thousands of police officers, state troopers, sheriff's deputies and others from law enforcement agencies big and small across the country gathered at Ramos' funeral . 'When an assassin's bullet targeted two officers, it targeted this city and it touched the soul of an entire nation,' Vice President Joe Biden said in his eulogy . During the eulogy, a few hundred officers outside the church turned away from giant screens showing de Blasio, who has been harshly criticized by New York police union officials as a contributor to a climate of mistrust that preceded the killings of Ramos and his partner, Wenjian Liu. Sgt. Myron Joseph of the New Rochelle Police Department said he and fellow officers turned their backs spontaneously to 'support our brothers in the NYPD.' In a statement, de Blasio's spokesman said: 'The Ramos and Liu families, our police department and our city are dealing with an unconscionable tragedy. Our sole focus is unifying this city and honoring the lives of our two police officers.' In his eulogy, the mayor said hearts citywide were broken after the December 20 shootings. Police Commissioner William Bratton, who said Ramos and Liu were targeted because they wore a uniform, was scheduled to appear on CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday. On Friday he made Ramos - who was studying to become a pastor and kept Bible study books in his locker - an honorary chaplain of his Brooklyn precinct. Police union officials in contentious contract negotiations with the city have faulted de Blasio for showing sympathy to protesters angry over the police deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner on Staten Island. At a hospital after the officers' slayings, the police union's president, Patrick Lynch, and others turned their backs on de Blasio. Lynch said the mayor had 'blood on his hands.' Mayor: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio attended Ramos' funeral at Christ Tabernacle Church . Carried: The body of New York City police officer Rafael Ramos is brought from  Christ Tabernacle Church after his funeral in the Glendale section of Queens . Family: Jaden Ramos, bottom right, bows his head as the casket of his father, New York City police officer Rafael Ramos, is put into a hearse. With Jaden are his brother, Justin Ramos, left, and his mother, Maritza Ramos . After the funeral, Lynch and de Blasio exchanged nods as they exited the church. Lynch refused to answer reporters' questions about officers turning their backs. Weeks before the shooting, Lynch had suggested officers sign a petition requesting that the mayor not attend their funerals were they to die in the line of duty. Since the December 20 shootings, de Blasio has stood firmly by police, calling on demonstrators to temporarily halt protests and praising the department after it arrested several men charged with threatening police. After the officers' deaths, the gunman, Ismaaiyl Brinsley killed himself. Police said he was troubled and had shot and wounded an ex-girlfriend in Baltimore earlier that day. In online posts shortly before the attack, Brinsley referenced the killings of Brown and Garner, both of whom were black, by white police officers. Ramos and Liu were the first officers to die in the line of duty in New York since 2011. Funeral plans for Liu haven't been announced. They have both been posthumously promoted to first-grade detective. Ramos, a married father of two, was buried at Cypress Hills Cemetery after the service. Officer Dustin Lindaman of the Waterloo Police Department flew from Iowa to attend Ramos' funeral. 'He's one of our brothers, and when this happens, it affects everyone in law enforcement - it absolutely affects everyone,' he said.","The Empire State Building featured a red, white and blue light design on Saturday night .

"It may well be the season of goodwill to all men. But that did not stop a mayor in south-west France installing metal cages over public benches to banish homeless people from the city. Xavier Bonnefont, Angouleme's 34-year-old Right-wing mayor, has been criticised for his lack of empathy and Christmas spirit. The mayor put up the cages on Christmas Eve in an effort to prevent 'drunk people' snoozing on the benches. Scroll down for video . Cages were installed around public benches to prevent homeless people sleeping on it during Christmas . The cages were inserted in Angouleme, in south-west France, to try and banish homeless people from the city . Joel Guitton, deputy mayor in charge of security, defended the move, saying the benches were 'almost exclusively used by people who consume alcohol on a regular basis'. The decision was taken 'in concert with local traders' who had complained to authorities that the drunken tramps' threatening behaviour was bad for business, he added. Regional daily newspaper Sud Ouest alleged the Champ de Mars square housing the benches had become the scene of fights between homeless people, often provoked by drugs and involving dogs. But the move sparked a wave of criticism, with people calling the measure 'abominable' and 'sickening'. 'What a shame, this is not France,' declared Guillaume Garot, a former Socialist MP and Bonnefont's political opponent. One commentator on Twitter even suggested the mayor will go one step further next year and 'electrify' the cages. Alexandre Chemetoff, the urban architect who designed the square, described the move as 'scandalous and inappropriate', telling Libération newspaper it was proof of 'political failure' as it suggested the 'only safe places left are private ones'. The decision to insert the cages was taken 'in concert with local traders' who had complained to authorities . In the wake of growing criticism, the mayor 'temporarily' removed the cages on Boxing Day saying they will return soon filled with pebbles to reflect the square's 'mineral aesthetics'. Earlier this year, anti-homeless measures were also seen in south London, where 19 metal spike studs were inserted outside a luxury development in Southwark near the entrance. The anti-tramp spikes were removed after images of them spread through social media, prompting the Mayor of London Boris Johnson to intervene. He tweeted: 'Spikes outside Southwark housing development to deter rough sleeping are ugly, self defeating & stupid. Developer should remove them ASAP. 'We've spent £34m on the likes of 'no 2nd night out, reaching 3/4s of rough sleepers, but must do more. Spikes are simply not the answer.' A row of one-inch spikes were also removed from outside a Tesco Metro supermarket on Regent Street in central London after activists protested against them. The move was reminiscent of the metal spikes that were installed outside a luxury apartment in Southwark . Away from the capital, Cardiff University came under fire for building a cage around a set of hot air vents to prevent homeless people sleeping on its campus. The move prompted complaints from students - but university insisted the cages were a health and safety measure to stop the homeless breathing in harmful boiler fumes including carbon monoxide. Only last week, a shop worker was reported to have hosed down a homeless man with cold water who was sleeping in the doorway of the Wilkinsons store in Canterbury, Kent.","Xavier Bonnefont, mayor of Angouleme, put up metal cages over benches .

Volunteers and hospital staff escort the unusual visitors, which are about the size of a large dog, straight into the young patients’ rooms, where they can momentarily forget their surroundings. Emily Pietsch, 17, meets Lunar, one of the horses involved in the hospital's therapy programme . The horses are part of a programme designed to bring comfort and distraction to paediatric patients . The visits are the brainchild of ex-nurse Jodie Diegel, who runs the Mane in Heaven therapy programme . On a recent visit, epilepsy patient, Emily Pietsch, found great joy nuzzling Lunar, one of the horses. The 17-year-old said: ‘They're so nice, and they don't judge, and they're so sweet.’ The programme is the brainchild of Jodie Diegel, a former nurse who owns the horses and runs an animal therapy programme named Mane in Heaven. She said: ‘We have been in nursing homes and homes for the disabled. So, we've been indoor in facilities, but this is our very first hospital visit. We are so excited.’ The visit went so well that future trips with Lunar and Mystery are planned. Volunteers escort the unusual visitors through the halls and into the young patients’ hospital rooms .

"Sir Cliff's calendar has dropped out of the top ten best-seller list for the first time, figures from online retailer Amazon revealed . It has been a guaranteed stocking filler for his army of fans for three decades. But after years of winning the alternative battle for Christmas No.1 without contention, Sir Cliff Richard’s annual calendar has suffered a slump in popularity. For his traditional collection of portraits has fallen out of the top ten best-sellers for the first time. The pop star has had a torrid year in which he suffered ‘enormous, irreparable damage to his reputation’ after the BBC broadcast live footage of a police raid on his home. Despite varying fortunes in the pop charts, the 74-year-old’s calendar has remained a constant source of success and income for the singer. His position at the top of the chart has only changed in the last three years due to the huge popularity of boyband One Direction, who have broken Sir Cliff’s calendar sales record. Sir Cliff remained the second highest selling celebrity calendar behind the band last year but has fallen out of the top ten for the first time this Christmas. Figures from online retailer Amazon reveal Sir Cliff has once again been outsold by One Direction and fellow pop group 5 Seconds of Summer. Pop stars Cheryl Cole, Olly Murs and Robbie Williams have also sold more calendars than the veteran singer so far this year. Olympic diver Tom Daley and Hollywood star Benedict Cumberbatch usurped Sir Cliff as more popular choices on the walls of the nation, with the pop star languishing as the 11th most popular choice. Since his £3.1million Berkshire apartment was raided as part of a historic child sex abuse investigation, Sir Cliff also suffered a ‘significant drop’ in the number of times his songs were played on the radio. An analysis of radio airplay using figures from Radio Monitor earlier this month found that his airplay had dropped by around 65 per cent in the last three months. The research suggests his reputation has been damaged by the public revelations about the search but Sir Cliff has strongly denied the accusations as ‘completely false’.. His position at the top of the chart has only changed in the last three years due to the huge popularity of boyband One Direction, who have broken Sir Cliff’s calendar sales record . Although he was interviewed under caution, he was not arrested or charged and continues to deny any wrongdoing. Last year the so-called Peter Pan of pop suggested he might end the 35-year tradition of his annual calendar, prompting complaints from fans. 1) One Direction . 2) Olly Murs . 3) 5 Seconds of Summer . 4) Michelle Keegan . 5) Tom Daley . 6) Kelly Brook . 7) Cheryl Cole . 8) Robbie Williams . 9) Benedict Cumberbatch . 10) Kylie Minogue . 11) Sir Cliff Richard . Acknowledging that time was catching up with him, he said: ‘I think the reason why the rumours got out that I’m not going to do any more is probably because it’s true. ‘No, not completely. You have hit the nail on the head - how many shapes can I pull with this body?’ The 73-year-old appears relaxed and upbeat in the pictures, which show him enjoying a Summer Holiday lifestyle in Barbados, where he has a home. But he backtracked on the possible move and posed for a series of pictures in Barbados, where he has a home, in which he appears relaxed and upbeat. The singer has sold more than 1.5million calendars in the last three decades.

"Sony producers censored The Interview when they released the controversial movie last week, editing out at least on racy scene depicting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un participating in a gay orgy. The scene was described in a version of the  film's script, which was released online in a hack on the Sony production company, but did not appear in the film released online and in a few small movie theaters. The hack is believed to have been carried out by a group with ties to the North Korean regime, which threatened action against Sony if they released the movie critical of their leader. Scroll down for interview . Racy: A ten-minute gay orgy scene was edited out of the version of The Interview which was released last week. Above, a toned down version of the scene in which the television presenter played by James Franco (center) befriends North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (played by actor Randall Park, second right) Fears: Sony initially decided not to release the film, afraid of threatened '9/11-style' terrorist attacks on movie theaters. After a free speech campaign, they decided to release the film online and in limited theaters. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (right) condemned President Obama for encouraging the film's release . Sony staff who spoke with The Sunday Times called the version released last week a 'redacted version' and expressed hopes that the full unedited movie would be released on DVD in a 'director's cut version'. The movie stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as two hapless journalists tasked with 'taking out' Kim Jong-un after they secure a TV interview with the feared dictator. The attention brought to the movie over the hack and it's initial cancellation by Sony, drove traffic to independent movie theaters and online when the company changed their mind and decided to release it on Christmas Eve.  On opening day, the movie grossed $1million. Lining up: On opening day, the movie grossed $1million from viewers who went to independent movie theaters to see the film.

Seen with Evan Goldberg (in white shirt, left) who he wrote and directed the film with . Among other details edited from the film include North Korean military insignia, which was originally visible on soldiers' uniforms in the film. But the most controversial and wide-sweeping edit was the removal of a 10-minute scene depicting the aftermath of a gay orgy between Kim Jong-un (played by Korean-American actor Randall Park) and the television presenter Dave Skylark played by Franco. According to the leaked script, the scene was subtle. 'Dave and Kim are in a bed naked, with the four women,' it reads. 'They’re all playing MORTAL KOMBAT.' In the edited film, a more toned down scene involving the new friends shows them playing around with scantily clad women. Another scene that did not appear in the film was a conversation between Rogen and Franco about Kim Jong-un's sexual abilities. Erased: The edited version also saw North Korean military insignia on soldiers uniforms erased . 'Moreover, he is champion at fellatio,' says Rogen's character to Franco's character in the script. 'He can suck a 12 inch c**k while ice-skating backwards.' Over the weekend, the North Korean regime spewed racial slurs at President Obama as they blamed him for the movie's release. President Obama encouraged Sony to release the film in defense of free speech. 'Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest,' a spokesman for North Korea's National Defense Commission said in a statement. President Obama has promised retaliation for the hack against Sony, but it's still unclear what punishment will entail.","Gay-sex scene depicting North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un was included in the film's leaked script, but did not appear in film released last week .

Janelle Westfall, 19, (right) was propositioned by David Seastran, (left) the former police chief in New London, New Hampshire . Later that week Seastrand asked her to attend the police station and discussed punishment - such as community service. But they then went into the basement of the station. Seastrand told the Union Leader: 'He said he would grab the station's camera to shoot a series of nude photos of me, and then he'd hold it over my head for two years to be sure I didn't commit another crime.' 'That's when it was really chilling. 'He's standing there in uniform, he had his gun strapped on his side.' She told the newspaper that Seastrand had told her if she told anyone he would deny it. But the Colby-Sawyer student told a friend, as well as her family members who are police officers. Her father Todd Westfall told her to write down her account and he contacted police. Janelle Westfall, center, with her attorney, Richard Lehmann, (left) and her father, Todd Westfall (right) A month later Seastrand resigned as the New London police chief in April. Court documents say the town's insurance provider paid $70,000 to Janelle on behalf of the town and Seastrand. The attorney general's office said the allegations were disturbing, but did not rise to the level of criminal conduct. State prosecutors said Seastrand's actions were 'abhorrent behavior and unacceptable behavior for anyone in that type of a position,' but did not file criminal charges against him. Seastrand has been prohibited from ever serving as a law enforcement officer again. The Valley News reports  that the Seastrand did not admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.

The pair met in the summer of 1945 when she was 18-years-old, they married a year later and had their first child a short while after.  He died in 1986 after suffering attack in his family home. Gazing at the seven-inch silver bracelet as she took it out of the box, Mrs McCauley told NBC: 'It's unreal to hold it now. It's just so amazing.' Mr McCauley, an Army trombone player who won the Bronze Star, arrived with the 10th Mountain Division in the Italian town of Castel D'Anio in March 1945. Prior to that he had been part of a major counter-offensive that destroyed five German regiments on the Tuscan coast over a period of three months. In the town, parts of which doubled as a field hospital, they drank cognac and champage as the German's surrendered in May. Warren and Twila McCauley met in the summer of 1945 after he fought in the war and they married a year later . Mr McCauley passed away from a heart attack in their family home in 1986 . Bruna de Maria was an eight-year-old child living in the town which had been destroyed by war. Her father had hung a white sheet on their home saying it served as a field hospital and a canteen. There, when the Germans left, she found the silver bracelet owned by Mr McCauley and has kept it on her bedside table ever since. She told NBC: 'I just took it, I was very poor, so a bracelet for me was a treasure. 'I always asked myself, who does it belong to? But I never tried to find the man. It almost felt as if it were mine. Her son Stefano Sedda then got hold of it and said the previous owner should be discovered. He told the station: 'This bracelet made history. It belonged to an American soldier who came her to fight, to defend our country—that's why I thought of giving it back.' After trying to decipher what the name and serial number on it related to, he handed it to a dinner guest who then emailed an image to a lawyer named Carolyn Thompson. Through an NBC journalist they contacted Dennis Hagen, the official archivist for the 10th Mountain Division. His private search by the number of the bracelet produced a name, Warren D. McCauley. This led them to his widow Mrs McCauley. When she was first called about the bracelet, she said: 'I'm about to hit the floor. You know the Lord, He is really there—have you ever felt him close? I can feel him now.' 'He just had that great big beautiful smile,' Mrs McCauley added, 'and I remember him that way.' Mr McCauley was part of the 10th Mountain Division that defeated five German regiments in the space of three months along the Tuscan coast .","Twila McCauley, 85, met her late husband Warren in the summer of 1945 .

"Al-Qaeda has called for a new generation of 'lone wolf' terrorists to blow up American Airlines, United and Delta planes using bombs made in their kitchens. The chilling call to arms in the terror group's magazine, Inspire, says the high-profile airlines should be targeted in a bid to gain headlines and 'crush the enemy's economy'. Released on Christmas Eve, the disturbing publication names the four companies because of their size - including United, the 'world's largest airline with 86,852 employees'. Chilling:  Al-Qaeda's house magazine (above) calls for high-profile airlines British Airways, easyJet, AA, Delta, United and Air France to be targeted by bombers to 'crush the enemy's economy'. Police are investigating . American Airlines, United, Continental and Delta are also named in the magazine - despite the fact that Continental Airlines stopped flying planes under its name two years ago after merging with United . Also targeted are Air France and British carriers British Airways and easyJet - alongside high-profile U.S. figures Bill Gates and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. Continental Airlines is also singled out despite the fact that it stopped flying planes under its name two years ago after merging with United to form United Continental Holdings. The magazine praises Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called 'underpants bomber' who was jailed for life in 2012 after he tried to bomb a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. The 300 people on board were saved partly because the bomb sewn into his underwear failed to detonate fully, prosecutors said at the time. The latest edition has been published four years after the first issue of Inspire contained a notorious explosives guide called Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom. The guide was suspected to have been the template for explosives which killed three and injured more than 250 in last year's Boston Marathon bombings. Targets: The sick magazine picks out British Airways and easyJet as targets for would-be terrorists . Journal: The magazine has been connected to the Boston Marathon bombings in April last year . Its author was dubbed the 'Al-Qaeda chef', and an extremist assuming the same name was interviewed in the latest issue as it claimed the Boston attacks were a 'natural reaction' to the 'arrogance' of the U.S. He said the 'first priority' for any of his terrorists would be the U.S., 'then the United Kingdom, then France and so on.' And he called for the rise of the 'lone wolf' jidahist, saying: 'It is hard to uncover, because none knows him but Allah. He has no relationship with any group or any individuals.' The magazine also praised an axe attack on a group of New York city policemen in October as a 'splendid' example of a 'lone wolf'. U.S. Navy veteran Zale Thompson was shot dead in the street after the brutal hatchet attack, which the FBI confirmed last month it was considering as an act of terror. FBI director James Comey said Thompson had been watching Islamic State beheading videos and other radical jihadist material online, adding there is 'no doubt that played a role' in the attack. 'There is no doubt it was terrorism,' he added. Shock tactics: The magazine includes images of an airport departures board and, on its cover, a jumbo jet . Praised: The Boston bombings (left is suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev) and 'underpants bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab (right) are both mentioned in the magazine, whose possession in the past has led to arrests . The magazine is published by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and its possession by terror suspects has led to arrests in Britain. Belonging to Al Qaeda has been banned since 2001, and the 2000 Terrorism Act made it illegal to possess any document which could help someone 'prepare an act of terrorism'. Four men from Luton, Bedfordshire, were jailed for a combined 44 years in April 2013 after a court heard they had planned to follow instructions from  Inspire magazine to carry out an attack. Other terrorists were convicted under section 58 of the act solely for possessing the magazine. Those who are found guilty can be jailed for up to ten years. A British Airways spokesman said: 'The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority. We continue to work closely with airports and governments around the world.' He added: 'We never comment on matters of security.' An easyJet spokesman added: 'The safety and security of our passengers and crew is always our highest priority. We are unable to comment further on matters of security.' A spokesman for Britain's Home Office said: 'We are aware of this publication and the police and security agencies are taking appropriate action. National security and protecting the public is our priority. 'Our comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy includes measures to remove terrorist material hosted online, prevent radicalisation and protect the UK from acts of terrorism.'","Terrorists' journal Inspire calls for 'hidden bomb' attacks on key firms .

"A British show jumper was among hundreds trapped in the terror and chaos aboard a blazing ferry in the Adriatic Sea yesterday. Nick Channing-Williams, 37, was one of the 478 people who became stranded when a fire broke out on the car deck of the Italian-flagged Norman Atlantic off the Greek island of Corfu. Passengers, who were travelling from the Greek port of Patras to Ancona, Italy, became trapped on the top decks as gales and choppy seas hampered evacuation efforts.

A British show jumper was among hundreds trapped in the terror and chaos aboard a blazing ferry in the Adriatic Sea . Passengers, who were travelling from the Greek port of Patras to Ancona, Italy, became trapped on the top decks as gales and choppy seas hampered evacuation efforts . Nick Channing-Williams and his fiancée Regina Theoffili (together above) are among those on board the stricken ferry . Giovanni Pettorino, an Italian coastguard official, said one person had died while being rescued from the Italian-flagged Norman Atlantic. Authorities confirmed there were 423 passengers and 55 crew members on board and said more than half of them remain trapped on the ferry as the rescue operation is being hampered by choppy seas and bad weather. The fire broke out on the lower car deck of the passenger ferry, which was also carrying 222 vehicles,  just before 6am local time (4am GMT). Some passengers have reportedly been stranded on an upper deck of the ferry for more than eight hours, as they are unable to be lowered to lifeboats due to the high seas. Some called TV stations in desperation, saying: ‘We are burning and sinking, no one can save us,’ as the vessel was battered by 55mph winds. Others told how the blaze swept through the vessel, fuelled by vats of olive oil in trucks catching light. One passenger has died and another was injured while attempting to escape the ferry in stormy conditions . Passengers remain trapped on the blazing ferry, off the coast of Corfu, as gale-force winds and choppy seas hamper the rescue effort. The vessel caught alight at 6am local time with 478 passengers and crew on board . They also described how their shoes melted in the heat and the smell of plastic pervaded the corridors. On deck, passengers were battered by rain and lightning storms. As darkness fell last night, thick smoke engulfed the ferry, and passengers – among the 300 believed to be still on board – said the ship had begun to list to one side. Italian and Greek helicopter crews prepared to work through the night to airlift passengers in pairs as the ferry was being towed after it drifted in fierce winds into Albanian waters. ‘There’s a lot of smoke, we can’t breathe,’ passenger Nikos Papatheodosiou told Greece’s state-run Nerit television yesterday evening. ‘Panic, there’s panic,’ he said. A Greek government official said one man had died and, as night fell, authorities said 165 passengers had been rescued. The cause of the fire was not immediately clear but Greek media reported it may have spread because of the burning olive oil. Some passengers called TV stations in desperation, saying: ‘We are burning and sinking, no one can save us’ A liferaft from the stricken ferry  in the Adriatic Sea. Authorities said 117 people have  been rescued so far . Dorothy Channing-Williams last night said her son Nick, a competitive show jumper and trainer, and his Greek fiancée Regina Theoffili were still on board. She added: ‘There’s about 300 people still on board and it is the cold that’s most difficult.’ Mr Channing-Williams – whose late father Simon produced the Oscar-winning film The Constant Gardener and the Bafta-winning Vera Drake – is believed to be one of two Britons on board. A tearful Mrs Channing-Williams said her son first made contact at 4am but urged her not to worry. She said: ‘He said that he had been on the top deck for the last seven hours with rain, and thunder and lightning, but he was making light of it because he knew I would be so worried. They’ve apparently blocked all people’s mobiles because they thought it was hampering the rescue effort.’ The 70-year-old, from Newbury, Berkshire, added: ‘He called me to let me know that he’s okay and that Regina’s okay.’ Other panic-stricken passengers called TV stations and pleaded for help. Sofoklis Styliaras called Mega TV from his mobile, saying: ‘The fire is still burning. On the lower deck, where the lifeboats are, our shoes were starting to melt...there’s nowhere else for us to go.’ Italian and Greek helicopter crews prepared to work through the night to airlift passengers, who described their shoes melting in the searing heat . Another, Giorgos Stiliaras, said those on board were having trouble breathing with all the smoke. ‘We are outside, we are very cold, the ship is full of smoke,’ he said. ‘The boat is still burning, the floors are boiling.’ Speaking from a hospital in Italy, . Vassiliki Tavrizelou, who was rescued along with her two-year-old daughter, spoke to the media from her hospital bed in Lecce, southern Italy. She said: 'They called first on women and children to be evacuated from the ship. 'Ships could not approach us because of the rain and winds. We were at least four hours on the deck, in the cold and rain.' She recalled the ship alarm going off and seeing fire from her cabin. 'Then we heard explosions,' she said. A Greek coastguard spokesman said: ‘We are making superhuman efforts in this extremely difficult operation. Operations by air will continue throughout the night.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Two British nationals are believed to be on board. We are urgently seeking more information.’","Ferry carrying 423 passengers and 55 crew caught alight off Greek island .

"Its chimes counting down to each New Year are famous the world over. Now Big Ben will mark the date in another way – by appearing on a limited edition £100 coin. The coin, of which only 50,000 will be made, was unveiled by the Royal Mint yesterday and is Britain's first £100 coin. It is also the first time the Royal Mint has brought out a coin specifically for New Year. The UK's first £100 coins are pressed by Liam Oram at the Royal Mint at Llantrisant, in Wales . The coin, which is 40mm wide and contains 2oz of silver,  is expected to prove popular in Britain . Big Ben is pictured from street level to show it at its most familiar angle to visitors in the special coin .

And like regular coins, it features the Queen's head on the other side. Shane Bissett, the Royal Mint's director of commemorative coin, bullion and medals, said: 'The sound of Big Ben chiming in the Elizabeth Tower is one that will have become synonymous with Britain for millions of British citizens and tourists alike, particularly on New Year's Eve when the world listens for Big Ben, which marks Greenwich Mean Time, to chime in the New Year. 'So it is a fitting choice for the nation's first £100 coin, and this is a fitting time for us to reveal it.' The coin, which is 40mm (1.6in) wide and contains 2oz of silver, is expected to prove popular after the sell-out success of the first £20 coin, which was struck in honour of the birth of Prince George.

"The largest freshwater lake in China which covers an expanse twice the size of London has dried up because of an ongoing drought. Poyang Lake in rural Jiangxi province is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. But the combination of drought and a new water storage facility upstream at the Three Gorges reservoir - the world's biggest dam - has caused water levels to drop to dangerously low levels. Dry land: The pavilion and tower in the distance used to be based in the centre of China's largest lake which has dried up because of drought . Commuters ride across the dry lake bed which was under water just a few weeks ago . How it normally looks: The Poyang Lake pictured when water levels are at their usual height . Much of the 3,500 sq km lake's water has now completely disappeared meaning tourists can now visit a pavilion and tower situated in the middle by foot instead of by the traditional boat. The drought revealed an ancient stone bridge earlier this month which had been hidden underneath the lake's water. The 2,930-metre-long stone bridge, dating to AD1631, is made of granite and was one of around 1,000 similar stone bridges constructed during the Ming dynasty, the Beijing News reported. A cow lies down on the dry lake bed in Jiangxi Province after little rainfall and a new water storage facility caused it to dry up . The tower based in the middle of what was once the Poyang lake is still a big tourist attraction - but visitors can now walk to it instead of getting a boat . The drought has also affected the lake's wetland vegetation growth and taken a toll on its ecology. The region faces drinking water shortages and the local fishing industry has been decimated. The lack of fish means there is no food for the half a million migrating birds which usually break their journey at Poyang.

"The NHS plans to ease pressure on GPs ‘on the cheap’ by doubling the number of semi-qualified surgery assistants. The Health Service hopes to recruit more than 200 ‘physician associates’, who will undertake a two-year university course. Fully-fledged family doctors typically take ten years to train. The associates will be taught how to carry out tests, diagnose patients and decide whether they should see a specialist. The interminable wait: Dawn queue of shame at a surgery in Sunbury, Surrey, as people hope for appointment . They will then be allowed to take appointments themselves, but will mainly see younger, otherwise healthy patients – leaving doctors to see those with complicated, long-term conditions. The scheme is aimed at addressing a looming shortage of GPs, which comes as demand on surgeries increases due to our rising, ageing population. Last week the Mail revealed that desperate practices in Leicester and South Yorkshire are offering doctors golden hellos of £20,000 to fill empty posts, while patients at a surgery in Sunbury, Surrey, regularly queue in the cold from 6.30am to ensure they get a same-day appointment. The NHS already has 200 physician associates working in surgeries in the East and West Midlands, London, Somerset and Bristol. They are supervised by a GP who checks their patient notes, but are qualified to undertake most tasks, including examining patients, taking their medical history, ordering tests and referring them to specialists. They cannot prescribe new drugs, but may order repeat prescriptions. They earn between £24,000 and £38,000 a year, depending on experience – a fraction of the sums received by GPs, which range from £55,000 to £105,000 a year. The NHS hopes to recruit 200 'physician associates' who will undertake a two-year course and be able to diagnose patients and decide whether they should see a specialist, but will earn considerably less than GPs . Their training is also far cheaper than the £500,000 it costs for a fully qualified family doctor. Many associates previously worked as nurses, paramedics or physiotherapists, and every applicant for the two-year course must already have a science-based degree. The recruitment drive – which is being overseen by Health Education England, the Department of Health’s training wing – has prompted concern among NHS staff, who warn it could put safety at risk. One GP wrote on the website of Pulse, the doctors’ magazine: ‘When a role is created to essentially save money you must expect compromises. Here we are accepting compromises to care.’ Another said it was wrong to assume their work could be undertaken by ‘partly-qualified people’, while a nurse called it ‘medicine on the cheap’. Physician associates are a cross between doctors and nurses. They must already hold a science-based degree before undertaking another two years’ training to qualify. About 200 currently work in GP surgeries across Britain. They must operate alongside a qualified doctor, with the level of supervision depending on their experience. The role was created in the US in the 1960s to address a shortage of GPs in rural areas. America now has almost 70,000 of them – and some have already been imported to the UK. They added: ‘The Government want to do away with GPs and registered nurses and replace them with minimum-wage people with little training.’ One concern is that physician associates – also known as assistants – do not belong to an official register like doctors and nurses. This means they cannot be struck off for making serious errors. Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said: ‘Patients want and need more GPs and the priority must be to do all we can to recruit new GPs and retain those currently employed in the workforce. 'However, the current situation is so critical that any extra support for general practice is to be encouraged ... but the implications and practicalities will need to be carefully considered.’ Physician associates are also employed in some A&E units and operating theatres, where they undertake similar tasks to junior doctors. Professor Ian Cumming, chief executive of Health Education England, said: ‘With the appropriate training and supervision, they are a fantastic asset ... they are incredibly popular and the junior doctors find them fantastic members of the team to help share appropriate workload. ‘But these people aren’t doctors. They have a different skill set ... but used in the right way they are an invaluable part to providing the best possible care.’","NHS hopes to recruit 200 associates who will undertake two-year course .
