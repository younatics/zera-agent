"Scottish patients on the waiting list for vital transplants could be sent to the back of the queue if the country votes for independence. Department of Health officials today warned that the current system for treatment would have to be completely re-written in the event of a win for the Yes campaign. This mean patients currently on the waiting list could face an even longer delay for life-saving heart, lung and liver transplants. Scroll down for video . In a blow to Alex Salmond, the UK Government today warned Scottish patients on the waiting list for vital transplants could be sent to the back of the queue if Scotland votes Yes . Scottish patients are currently matched with any suitable organ available from anywhere in the UK, but the borders could have to be re-drawn if Scotland goes independent, reports The Times. A UK Government spokesman said: 'Scottish residents receive treatments in England including for a range of specialised services such as heart, lung and liver transplant procedures. 'It cannot be assumed that all existing arrangements between the Scottish NHS and the NHS in other parts of the UK would necessarily continue in their current form - for example, those whereby NHS Blood and Transplant allocates organs for transplant on a UK-wide basis.' Scottish residents currently have access to more than 40 specialist treatments in England for rare conditions. There are currently more than 500 Scottish patients awaiting a transplant. The future of the NHS has been one of the central issues to the debate over independence, with each side offering different visions for its future. Currently there are more than 500 patients in Scotland who need a transplant, and could face a longer delay if the country becomes independent . Labour leader Ed Miliband said this weekend that a Yes vote meant taking a 'risk' on the future of NHS services in Scotland . The Better Together campaign insists that funding from UK tax-payers is vital for the current level of service to be maintained, while the SNP dismiss this as scare-mongering and argue NHS services in Scotland as part of the UK would be vulnerable to cuts to services. Labour leader Ed Miliband this weekend stressed the impact independence could have on the NHS during a Better Together rally in Edinburgh. Mr Miliband claimed £1 billion could be slashed from its budget - the cost of employing 36,000 nurses - under independence. He said Alex Salmond's 'lack of a currency plan' could lead to £21 billion of spending cuts in an independent Scotland, according to Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. The Labour leader said: 'Be in no doubt what this means: Over £1 billion a year would be the NHS's share of those cuts, the equivalent of 36,000 nurses. That is the real threat to NHS. 'When better, faster, safer change is coming, that's not a risk anyone who loves the NHS should take.' Mr Miliband added: 'As we enter the last days of this campaign, the choice for the people of Scotland is clearer than ever before - change with No or huge risks with Yes.'","Scottish patients are currently matched with organs from across the UK .

"One of America’s most wanted terrorists has been killed in a gun battle in Somalia alongside a British bomb-maker who was on the run with the widow of a London 7/7 bomber, according to reports. Omar Hammami, 29, from Alabama - known for jihadi rap videos he posted to YouTube - and Habib Ghani, 28, are thought to have been after falling out with commanders from militant group al-Shabab. Ghani, who also called himself Osama al-Britani, was a key ally of Muslim convert Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, who was married to King’s Cross bomber Jermaine Lindsay. Killed: Hammami, right, joined al-Shabab in 2006. He is pictured with deputy leader of al-Shabab. Sheik Mukhtar Abu Mansur Robow, left, in 2011 but he went on the run after falling out with the group . Killed: Habib Ghani (left) is believed to have been shot dead in Somalia. He has been on the run with Samantha Lewthwaite (right) since 2011 . The so-called ‘White Widow’, who is the world’s most wanted woman, has been on the run in East Africa after police foiled a Christmas bomb plot against Western tourists in the coastal resort of Mombasa in 2011. Police believe the soldier’s daughter from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, had been working with Ghani for several years, although she was not thought to have been present when gunmen struck early yesterday. Ghani, from Hounslow, west London, and Hammami, also called al-Amriki (The American), are thought to have been shot by gunmen from al-Shabab, who overpowered their bodyguards in a village where they had been in hiding since fleeing the terror group in June. 'Dead': Militants in Somalia have claimed that . American jihadist Omar Hammami has been killed. In April, he tweeted . this pictured, right, following what he called an assassination attempt . as he was in a tea shop . Popular: Hammami was voted president of his Sophomore class and dated one of the most popular girls in school . Residents in al-Baate village in southern Somalia said their bodies were dragged away by rebels. ‘This morning al-Amriki and his comrades were attacked by well-armed fighters,’ said Hussein Nur. Convert: Soldier's daughter Samantha Lewthwaite pictured at school . ‘After a brief fight, al-Amriki and his two colleagues were killed. Several of their guards escaped.’ The al-Shabab gunmen struck at 5.30am, just after morning prayers, capturing the jihadists unawares. Sources said the gunmen had lain in wait for several days, posing as camel herders. Ghani and Hammami were allies of Somali Islamist Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, who split from al-Shabab in June, causing a rift in the group’s ranks. Since the split, al-Shabab has been hunting down and killing allies of Aweys. Al-Amriki - the son of a Christian mother and a Syrian-born Muslim father - was on the FBI’s Most . Wanted terror list and a $5million (£3.1million) bounty was offered for . information leading to his capture. He had been active on Twitter but his last post was on September 5 in which he said: 'I'm still a terrorist.' A . more prophetic Tweet came in April in which he said: 'May not find . another chance to tweet but just remember what we said and what we stood . for. God kept me alive to deliver the mssg 2 the umah'. Reports of Hammami's death crop up every few months in Somalia, only for him to resurface alive and well a short while later. But . a U.S. terrorism expert who closely follows the inner workings of . Somalia's al-Qaida-linked terror group says he thinks that the current . reports of the death are accurate. 'I think it's very likely true based on the sources I am seeing,' said J.M. Berger, who runs the website Intelwire.com. Ghani . was born in the UK to a Pakistani father and a Kenyan mother. According . to police sources, he left his home in Hounslow several years ago and . gained bomb-making experience in Pakistan. Last night details emerged about Ghani’s secret life in Somalia where he was also known locally as Sheikh Towfiq. Target: One of Americas most wanted terrorists, Omar Hammami (left), was killed alongside Ghani. Lewthwaite and Ghani had been on the run since 2011 when police swooped on another extremist, Jermaine Grant (right) Wanted: He ascended the ranks of Somalia's al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab high enough to attract a $5 million U.S. government bounty. This FBI listing shows their description of Hammami . The bearded Briton was living with his Somalian wife Habibo and two children, a boy aged three and a baby girl just a few months old, in the remote town of Hawalbarbar which has no electricity. He owned a small kiosk, where he charged phone batteries with his solar-powered adapter for a fee. Ghani and Lewthwaite were said to have fled Kenya in December 2011 as police swooped on a third and unconnected British extremist, Jermaine Grant, who was living on the other side of Mombasa. Police feared she and Ghani were planning to unleash a terror attack as the tourist season got under way but she managed to slip the net. Lewthwaite is believed to be a vital conduit between Al Qaeda groups in Pakistan and East Africa. White Widow: Samantha Lewthwaite converted to Islam and married 7/7 bomber Jermaine Lindsay (pictured) Slaughter: Shehzad Tanweeer, Jermaine Lindsay and Mohammad Sidique Khan with their rucksacks at Luton railway station while carrying out a dry run days before the blasts killed 52 . The mother of four converted to Islam at the age of 17 and married Lindsay in 2002 after meeting him on the internet. She was seven months pregnant when Lindsay, a Jamaican convert from Huddersfield, killed 26 people when he blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train in July 2005. Since her disappearance, Lewthwaite has been linked to a spate of grenade attacks in Mombasa, including one which killed three people. Ghani’s family, who live in a modest £270,000 terraced house in a quiet suburban street, refused to speak to reporters last night. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Somalia and are looking into this.’ Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, has been on the run for nearly two years. Lewthwaite is suspected of funding . terrorist groups in Kenya and was questioned by police in December 2011, . but she managed to slip away and has been on the run ever since. The mother-of-three was pregnant with Jermaine Lindsay's baby when he blew himself up on a tube at Kings Cross, killing 26 people. Fifty two people were killed and more than 700 were injured when four suicide bombers struck in London during the morning of July 7, 2005. Mohammad Sidique Khan killed seven people including himself on a train heading towards Paddington from Edgware Road. Shehzad Tanweer detonated a bomb aboard a train between Liverpool Street station and Aldgate tube station, killing seven.

"Proud Scot Susan Boyle today came out strongly against independence. The Britain’s Got Talent singer, who still lives in her hometown of Blackburn, West Lothian, revealed she will be voting No on Thursday. Miss Boyle, 53-year-old said you should not break what is ‘basically working’ Proud Scot Susan Boyle, seen here performing at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, has come out strongly against independence . Writing in the Sunday Mirror, Miss Boyle said: ‘Money that should be spent on hospitals, schools and vulnerable people will be swallowed up by bureaucracy. ‘If prices of essentials go up how will people cope? ‘And what will become of welfare? It helps many of the most vulnerable in society.’ Miss Boyle also said she had concerns over what would happen to the British military, in which her father ‘proudly’ served. She added: ‘Also what happens to our currency? Before you know it we will end up in a similar situation to Ireland. ‘But my biggest concern is the economic cost to the country and the proud Scottish people. ‘I don't feel reassured that the change will in any way make our already great country better. We should not be wasting money on this change - we should be putting it into areas that need it the most.' In a blow to First Minister Alex Salmond, Miss Boyle said she had fears over the economic future of an independent Scotland . Miss Boyle still lives in the same hpouse in Blackburn, West Lothian, where she grew up,  despite her global success, so unlike many high profile Scottish celebrities is entitled to a vote in the referendum . Earlier this week, Miss Boyle reaffirmed her commitment to Scotland by purchasing the property next door in Blackburn, which she refuses to leave despite her global success. She splashed out £110,000 on the semi-detached house, which was reportedly valued at £30,000 less, to ensure that she can build her dream home. It is expected the two homes will be combined to create a spacious six-bedroomed home. Russell Brand, pictured, thinks Scotland should vote for independence .

It could become a people-friendly society'. Mike Myers - NO - 'I love Scotland, I hope they remain part of Britain and if they don't I'll still love them.' Sir Sean Connery - YES - 'I've always been hopeful about Scotland's prospects. And I now believe more than ever that Scotland is within touching distance of achieving independence and equality.' Gerard Butler - YES - I don't see any reason why Scotland shouldn't be independent. It's a country with different attitudes, people and outlook.' David Tennant - NO - 'It would be very strange to have to present your passport to come over the border.' JK Rowling - NO - 'If we leave there will be no going back. This separation will not be quick and clean: it will take microsurgery to disentangle three centuries of close interdependence, after which we will have to deal with three bitter neighbours.'

"Even simple tasks used to be fraught with difficulty for Fraser Booth. The four-year-old, who is autistic, easily became overwhelmed by everyday events, resulting in tears and temper tantrums. Then Billy the stray cat came along. Abandoned by his previous owner and rescued from a boarded-up council house by a charity, he had not had the easiest start to life. Before Billy the stray cat came along, four-year-old Fraser, who is autistic, struggled with simple tasks . But since their first meeting, Fraser . and Billy have been inseparable – and the moggy has helped bring the . little boy out of his shell. Now, whether it’s playtime, storytime or bedtime, Billy is there to offer a reassuring paw. And he is the first to sense when Fraser is getting frustrated, calming him down with a cuddle or comforting purr. Fraser’s . mother Louise said: ‘If Fraser is around or playing in the garden, . Billy is never far away. It is like he is watching Fraser and calming . his behaviour. ‘He . always appears when Fraser is getting upset and offers his head close to . Fraser’s to reassure him and recently, when Fraser was poorly, Billy . sat on his lap all day. ‘They say animals can sense things, but Billy seems to know before anybody else if Fraser is going to get upset.’ Best friends: Billy the stray cat had not had the easiest start to life but he and Fraser, aged four, have found a special companionship in each other . Since their first meeting, Fraser and Billy have been inseparable ¿ and the moggy has helped bring the little boy out of his shell . Mrs Booth, who is a full-time mother . to Fraser and his 15-month-old sister Pippa, added: ‘It sounds crackers, . but it is like Billy is Fraser’s guardian. Their relationship is . something really special.’ Fraser . was diagnosed with autism when he was 18 months old after Mrs Booth, . 38, and her electrician husband, Chris, 43, noticed he was not . developing as quickly as other children his age. ‘It . was glaringly obvious to me early on that something was wrong,’ Mrs . Booth said. ‘Fraser would cry all the time and wouldn’t respond to me or . any toys we put in front of him.’ Since . his diagnosis, Fraser has been undergoing therapy. While he is able to . talk to his parents and run around like other children of his age, he . still struggles to cope with routine tasks, resulting in temper tantrums . and tears. ‘Every day life can be a challenge for Fraser because . ordinary tasks can be extremely difficult for him,’ added Mrs Booth, who . lives on the Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire. Fraser's mother Louise said: 'If Fraser is around or playing in the garden, Billy is never far away. It is like he is watching Fraser and calming his behaviour.' Whether he's needed for a cuddle or acting as a prop for a book, Billy is happy to be there for Fraser . 'Billy has made a complete difference to our family life, he's taken away the stress, he's added happiness and an air of calm, he's just been amazing.' ‘He is not trapped in his own little world – as most people assume with people with autism – he is a happy little boy, but he can become frustrated or upset easily at the drop of a switch. ‘For example, if he sees a character on television he doesn’t like, or if we try to get him out of the bath and he doesn’t want to, there is usually a meltdown.’ But the arrival of Billy from a Cats Protection shelter 12 months ago has changed Fraser’s behaviour. ‘The first time we took Fraser to see Billy, the cat went straight to him,’ Mrs Booth added. ‘Fraser sat down on the floor and Billy laid across him with his paws on his legs and just started purring. Fraser said “This is our cat, he can come live with us,” and that was that.’ ‘Billy has made a complete difference to our family life, he’s taken away the stress, he’s added happiness and an air of calm, he’s just been amazing. ‘We gave a donation of around £30 to the charity but for us he is priceless. He makes Fraser so happy all the time.’ To make a donation to the charity or to adopt a cat go to the Cats Protection website by clicking here.","Billy has made a complete difference to the family home, bringing happiness and an air of calm ."

"Microsoft probably didn’t have this in mind when they created the Xbox - but British researchers are to use the games console for parts when they send it up into space. They hope that the Kinect technology will allow the craft to ‘see’ another satellite they have are also planning to launch orbit and allow the two to dock. The team will also be putting a Google Nexus phone inside which will serve as its on board computer. Their craft is the STRaND-2, or Surrey Training Research and Nanosatellite Development, and is an attempt to use everyday electronics in space craft . The researchers are turning to the Xbox because they are cheap to use and Microsoft has already done the hard part of creating the technology. Their craft is the STRaND-2, or Surrey Training Research and Nanosatellite Development, and is an attempt to use everyday electronics in space craft. STRaND-1 is already completed and set for launch but both are smaller than a shoebox and cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, compared to millions for the full size version. They do not even have any rockets of their own so need to piggyback another craft to get into space. The Kinect technology would work in the same way that it does for Xbox games - by identifying players, or in this case another satellite, and tracking where they move. This would ensure they lock onto each other and dock smoothly, something which has not been tried with space ships as small as this. If it works, the technology could be used on bigger space craft and significantly bring down the cost of space travel. Everyday electronics such as the Kinect motion sensor from Xbox will be used for the hi-tech docking procedure . SSTL project lead Shaun Kenyon said that he hoped the satellites could one day make ‘grocery runs’ for other vessels in orbit by bringing them new computers or spare batteries, or doing other routine maintenance. He said he was inspired by the autonomous model helicopter that had been created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and asked himself: ‘Why has no-one used this in space?’ He said: ‘Once you can launch low cost nanosatellites that dock together, the possibilities are endless - like space building blocks’.STRaND-1 is due for launch later this year and STRaND-2 is currently under construction.","Xbox motion sensor used to steer satellites together .

"Read Martin Samuel's match report from Sofia . Brendan Rodgers is confident Liverpool will make home advantage pay and reach the Champions League knockout stage. Liverpool had a frustrating Wednesday night in Sofia after they were held to a 2-2- draw by FC Ludogorets. But they are still in control of their destiny and will progress from Group B by beating Basle on December 9, even though they were pegged back by Georgi Terziev's late header. Brendan Rodgers gives Liverpool's Champions League verdict the thumbs up . Simon Mignolet's early blunder gifted Dani Abalo the opening goal inside three minutes . The game started in the worst possible manner for Rodgers, after Dani Abalo was gifted a third minute opener by Simon Mignolet's error. Liverpool, however, responded with goals from Rickie Lambert and Jordan Henderson. It now becomes a question of whether Liverpool can hold their nerve and see off Basle, who were beaten 1-0 by Real Madrid. Rodgers, though, has no concerns and insists he would have been happy to be in this position when the group stages started in September. Rodgers said: 'We are very frustrated but we needed to come and put on performance to encourage us going forward and one that gave us chance of qualifying from group and had both of them. Rickie Lambert hauled Liverpool level in Sofia as the Reds were forced to settle for a point in Sofia . Jordan Henderson celebrates after putting the visitors ahead before Ludogorets hit back late on . 'The reaction to going behind was fantastic and we showed real character. We fell behind to team that's done really well here. 'But we showed spirit with the quality of goals. Of course, we are frustrated at the end because we had defended so well. We could have been two or three in front but we have come away with a point. 'Real Madrid beat Basle and I said at start it could come down to the last game. To have the last game at Anfield, needing to win to go through, I would have taken that.' Rodgers refused to point the blame at Mignolet, who had been earlier been criticised by former Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar. Rodgers has refused to blame Mignolet, despite his mistake that gave Liverpool an uphill task . 'Hopefully it is not an issue with his confidence,' said Rodgers. 'It was a disappointment for the team because we wanted a solid start and to go behind so early very frustrating. Thankfully it didn't cost us overall. 'The pitch was difficult for the outfield players and the goalkeepers; it was very bobbly, especially around the box. Thankfully it didn't cost us overall and the players showed great character to come back. 'We haven't been consistent enough in our performances and that's my responsibility. But in the Champions League, we still have it in our hands. It was always going to be a close group, Basle have experience in the competition. Lambert justified his inclusion in the starting XI with his second goal in as many matches . 'But thankfully we have had a good result. We would have liked to have won but we can't ask for more than having to win your last game at home, which I felt would be the case at the start of the competition. I will take that.' Lambert vindicated Rodgers' decision to start him after his goal at Crystal Palace and the England international believes this performance was a riposte for the criticism that followed the debacle at Crystal Palace. 'It was my first start in the Champions League and it was good to score,' said Lambert. 'We are devastated about the goal at the end but it was about the performance today - win, lose or draw - and the performance was better. 'We have answered some of our critics about Sunday against Crystal Palace. It was about the win and we almost got it. Now we have to go for an even better performance on Saturday.'","Reds denied victory in Sofia after Ludogorets grab last-gasp leveller .

"First Lady Michelle Obama had made it clear she has no interest in following in her husband's footsteps and running for office, yet an Illinois Senator is implying otherwise as a means to rustle up cash for reelection bid. Republican Sen. Mark Kirk sent out a fundraising email last week invoking Obama and claimed that 'press and rumor mills' say she's eyeing a bid for his Senate seat in 2016. 'I’m not one to believe rumors or engage in political gossip,' Kirk said, according to a news report published on Thursday in the Chicago Sun-Times, 'but when it comes to defending the Illinois Senate seat that I’m honored to hold, I take all potential threats seriously.' Michelle Obama is pictured here taking a service project at the Inspired Teaching School on Thursday to commemorate the September 11th National Day of Service and Remembrance. Obama has said that after she leaves the White House in 2017 she'll take on a 'mission-based' or 'service-based' role . Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, pictured here at a rally in Chicago in July, suggested in a fundraising email that Michelle Obama may change her mind and run against him in 2016 . The gossip columns were indeed abuzz earlier this summer with rumors that Michelle could make a play for her husband's former Senate seat next election cycle as their time in the White House comes to a close . But the president, first lady and a senior adviser to the White House have all denied that Michelle is interested in a political career of her own. 'No. I'm absolutely 100 percent positive that will never happen,' White House adviser and Obama confidant Valerie Jarrett said in June on NBC's 'Meet the Press.' 'One thing I can promise you is that Michelle will not run for office,' President Obama told ABC News in May. Michelle Obama herself told ABC in June that her next role 'will not be political.' 'It will be mission-based, it will be service-focused,' she said. The Obamas have also made a point of telling anyone who will listen how much Michelle dislikes her husband being on the road and how glad she is that November is his 'last election.' The first lady's aversion to campaigning has been well-documented throughout the Obamas time in the White House and national Democrats have complained in recent weeks about her unwillingness to hit the campaign trail for the party's Senate candidates this fall. If Obama really is planning to run for office in 2016, she's running the stealthiest campaign in modern politics. Even so, Kirk is contending that Michelle Obama may pull a Hillary Clinton and run for office anyway. 'The circumstances (and denials) are reminiscent of 1999 when First Lady Hillary Clinton was the subject of whirlwind speculation about a run for the United States Senate,' he states. 'Whether or not you choose to believe this most recent rumor, there is no doubt the Illinois Senate race will be one of the most closely watched and hotly contested races in the country in 2016,' he said before asking supporters to donate as much as $1,000 to help him keep his seat. The Sun-Times points out that as of June 30, Kirk had $1,419,695 in cash-on-hand more than two years out from his next election, which is a quite a large sum, even in the Chicago media market.","Obama has said her next role 'will not be political'

"Marseille has become the focus of emergency French government talks after the son of a football boss was gunned down in the street on Thursday in the city's latest gangland killing. Adrien Anigo - whose father, Jose Anigo, is the sporting director of Olympique Marseille - was the second person in a day to be killed in the region of the southern port city - and the 15th murder since the start of the year. The 30-year-old was shot dead in the middle of the day by two men on a motorbike while he was getting out of a rented Renault Twingo. Shooting: Police and forensic experts investigate the scene where Adrien Anigo was murdered . The killing is being seen as part of a worrying and increasing gangland culture in a city rife with drugs and political corruption - even in the year it holds the title of European Capital of Culture. Last month, French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault ordered . 130 extra riot police and 24 investigators to Marseille, which has France's second-biggest population and a . large immigrant community. Authorities say AK47s are available in the region for €500 each, and that execution-style killings - described by the state prosecutor as . Marseille's 'regrettable speciality' - are becoming increasingly common. Anigo, a restaurant owner, had been under investigation by police over armed robberies of jewellery stores and involvement in a local gang. Gunned down: The 30-year-old son of Olympique Marseille's sporting director was shot dead by men on a motorbike as he was getting out of his car . Investigation: Anigo was already under investigation by police and was due to appear in court over armed robberies of jewellery stores . Bloodbath: The men who shot Adrien Anigo fled the crime scene on a motorbike . He was due to appear in court, having been jailed in the past before being released because of a judicial error, according to French media. The father-of-two suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, as he was targeted by the men who fled the scene. His killing came hours after gunmen shot a 24-year-old as he arrived for work in the town of La Ciotat, some 20 miles from Marseille. Jose Anigo, the director of one of France's oldest and most popular clubs, grew up on a poor estate before becoming a player at Marseille. He has denied having any mafia or crime links of his own, telling the Journal du Dimanche two years ago: 'The street sucked in my son, but that's got nothing to do with anyone but the justice system.' Popular: Olympique Marseille, with players such as Andre Pierre Gignac, pictured left (with Eric Abidal of AS Monaco, right) is one of the best-loved clubs in France . Crisis: The incident, which took place in broad daylight in front of passers-by, was the second in a day - the first involving a 24-year-old man gunned down by masked motorbike men at La Ciotat just outside Marseille . Tourist numbers have risen sharply in Marseille in the past six months, with the city aiming to attract 10 million visitors this year as it holds the Capital of Culture title. Officials have had some success at cracking down on drug-smuggling, particularly the heroin trade, but it is still a hub on the cocaine route through Europe from Africa. The death toll has not reached last year's total of 24 gang killings in the Bouches-du-Rhone area including Marseille. However, unemployment remains above the national average, with more than 20 per cent of Marseille residents below the poverty line and more than 40 per cent youth unemployment in some parts of the region. Marseille's right-wing major Jean-Claude Gaudin has accused politicians in France of 'Marseille-bashing'. Crackdown: A suspect is led away by police as part of an anti-drugs operation in the city, which has seen the deployment of around 150 extra officers, including riot police . 'Chicago of the South': High unemployment, particularly among young people, is blamed for the persistent drug trade in the city . Dead end: Poor housing estates are said to be focal points for an underground economy of drug deals between youths with few prospects . French interior minister Manuel Valls called on political parties to unite to solve this crime issue in the city. He said: 'I understand the anger of the Marseille people but we need time [to act] against drug-trafficking and daily delinquency.' Marie-Arlette Carlotti, a government minister competing in the Socialist primary race to choose a Marseille mayoral candidate next year, said 'real mafia networks' must be neutralised. 'We have to find out where the money is, the white collars, because there are bosses in all this, even if the mafia is less well-organised than it was in the past,' she said. 'We have to look at exterior signs of wealth, trace the networks to their bank accounts in protected places.' Marseille's drug trade became famous . in the 1971 Hollywood film The French Connection, named after the . postwar heroin gangs in the city. By the late Sixties, about 80 per cent of heroin in the US was trafficked from Marseille. Enforcement: Government officials hope a heavy police presence will neutralise mafia-like networks in the southern French port city .

"Fury: Lord Dannatt has been criticised for citing fallen soldiers to argue against independence . Military veterans have hit back at the suggestion that voting for Scottish independence is disrespectful to dead soldiers after a former head of the Army sparked a political row by urging a No vote in Thursday's referendum. Lord Dannatt said yesterday that if Scotland left the UK it would be 'letting down' Scottish soldiers who died fighting in Northern Ireland. But today a group of pro-independence veterans called his comments 'outrageous', saying that by invoking the memories of fallen troops he was 'taking their sacrifice in vain'. The intervention by Lord Dannatt, who was chief of the general staff between 2006 and 2009, came as the polls showed Yes and No neck-and-neck in the lead-up to the vote this week. However, his pleas to keep the Union together for the sake of the dead soldiers' memory were quickly disowned by other unionists. Now a group of 18 veterans of the armed forces - including a 102-year-old Desert Rat - have spoken out against the former general. 'As former UK armed forces personnel, we take the strongest possible exception to the outrageous statement by Lord Richard Dannatt implying that our fallen comrades died in support of a No vote in a Scottish independence referendum. 'How dare he take their sacrifice in vain and try to turn it to political advantage - particularly having presided over the destruction of Scotland's historic regiments. 'People who serve in the armed forces and veterans hold a variety of different views on Scotland's future. We are all voting Yes on Thursday, others will vote No. 'It is that freedom to decide matters democratically which our service men and women have helped safeguard for generations - it is not about bolstering the position of a self-serving Westminster establishment - and the people of Scotland will choose on Thursday.' Veterans: Jimmy Sinclair, left, and Keith Brown, right, are among the former members of the military who have spoken out against Lord Dannatt's comments . Debate: Alex Salmond has previously been accused of jeopardising the UK's defence capabilities . The signatories include Second World War veteran Jimmy Sinclair, former Royal Marine Keith Brown, who is now a minister in the Scottish government, and ex-intelligence officer Colin May. Lord Dannatt wrote in the Sunday Telegraph: 'Do the families of Scottish soldiers who lost their lives between 1969 and 2007 to preserve the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom now just say, ""Well, it no longer matters""? 'I cannot speak for them, but I wonder just how much thought, appreciation and recognition is given to the memory of those who have fought and brought this United Kingdom of ours to where it is today, and where it could be in the future. 'And I really worry on behalf of the wives, mothers and friends of those Scottish soldiers who died to keep Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. 'I worry particularly about the extent that we will be letting them down if Scotland disappears from our country, just on the whim of a few thousand voters willing to gamble on an uncertain future rather than staying within the United Kingdom, whose track record is second to none in Europe.' Row: The iconic Scottish battalion the Black Watch marching through Aberfeldy (file photo) Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, who is campaigning against independence, distanced himself from the remarks. 'I am unyielding in my admiration and respect for the men and women of the British armed forces and the contribution that Scots have played and continue to play in those forces,' he told Sky News yesterday. 'But many British soldiers have given their lives over the years to defeat fascism and then to defend democracy and let's be absolutely clear: what we are witnessing here in Scotland on Thursday is an exercise in democracy. So I hold no brief for Lord Dannatt this morning.' The future of the UK's military has been a hot topic in the referendum campaign, with senior figures warning that Scottish independence would gravely weaken Britain's capabilities. The Scottish government has pledged to ban Trident nuclear missiles from sheltering in Scottish waters, as they do now.","Lord Dannatt wrote that Scottish independence would be 'letting down' soldiers who died in Northern Ireland .

"Brendan Rodgers hailed Raheem Sterling as a quick learner as the England winger showed he had reaped the benefits of shooting practice. The England winger showed great composure to score the only goal of the game at Turf Moor, rounding Burnley keeper Tom Heaton before sliding his effort into an empty net. In a similar situation at Old Trafford two weeks ago, Sterling missed a number of chances but, since then, the 20-year-old has scored three times in three appearances and Liverpool’s manager explained he has been doing intense training at Melwood. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers: Raheem Sterling is learning and adapting quickly . Raheem Sterling  celebrates after scoring the winner for Liverpool against Burnley . Rodgers said: 'It showed what a great learner he is. He is in a position now, he will receive a lot of opportunities in that kind of situation because of his pace. His pace will take him away from anyone and since that game he has gone away with the coaches and worked on that type of finish, both left side and right side. ‘He showed great composure and a great ability to learn, to beat the keeper and finished it really well. His development and ability to want to be better has got us the three points.’ Sterling slots the ball into empty net to give Liverpool the lead . Sterling was the match winner for Liverpool as they won at Burnley . Burnley were much the better side in the first half but when asked if Liverpool were fortunate, Rodgers said: ‘Not at all. I thought that in terms of our character and resilience in the game we showed outstanding qualities when needed. There weren’t many chances but the one clear one that came to us, we put it away. We deserved three points for the character we showed.’ Burnley boss Sean Dyche argued: 'We had our pocket pinched today with how they got away with a win. Brendan Rodgers was pleased to see Liverpool win away at Burnley . 'I don’t remember Tom Heaton making too many saves and I remember our back four being on the front foot. They have a group of very talented players. You look at the group, the signings they have made, you know it is a challenge.' Meanwhile, Simon Mignolet will return to Liverpool’s goal on Monday night after Brad Jones was injured during the game. Reserve keeper Danny Ward will be Mignolet’s deputy. Brad Jones - 5.5 . Replaced after a quarter-of-an-hour by Simon Mignolet. Little to do before picking up his injury, although he did stand helpless as a Danny Ings strike hit the post from distance. Kolo Toure - 5.5 . Substituted after 45 minutes. Struggled with the movement of Ings and Ashley Barnes. Martin Skrtel - 6 . Liverpool’s most confident and dominant defender. Had to organise well with Mignolet so nervy behind him. Mamadou Sakho - 6 . Powerful in the air but awkward in possession. Defended well, though, and that’s his job. Jordan Henderson - 6 . Typically industrious but he is not a wing-back. Looks like a square peg in a round hole at the moment. Lucas Leiva - 6.5 . Sluggish early on but grew in authority as the game went on. A useful foil for Steven Gerrard in the middle. Steven Gerrard - 6.5 . One super ball to release Adam Lallana in the first-half but found it difficult against an effervescent Burnley midfield. Adam Lallana - 6 . Should have done better when through on goal in the first-half and struggling to recapture the brilliance of his performances for Southampton from last season. Lazar Markovic - 5.5 . A few flashes but he needs to start doing more to justify the fee that brought him from Portugal to Merseyside. Philippe Coutinho - 7.5 . Magnificent piece of skill to set up Sterling goal. Drifts in and out of games but capable of decisive moments. Raheem Sterling - 7.5 . Tireless up front and produced a calm finish when Liverpool needed it. Still can’t help but feel his talents are wasted as a lone frontman. Still, needs must. Simon Mignolet (for Jones, 16) - 4.5 . Skewed clearances, one hit against Burnley forward Ings, and a lot of flapping from set-pieces. Rodgers simply must buy a goalkeeper in January. Emre Can (for Kolo Toure, 45) - 6 . Liverpool improved after Emre Can arrived in the second half. Good shift at centre half and used the ball well. Rickie Lambert (for Coutinho, 73) - 6 .

"A chorus of naysayers is emerging with predictions that President Obama's plan to 'degrade and destroy' the ISIS terror group will fail unless he abandons his pledge that avoid a ground war in Iraq and Syria. Rep. Buck McKeon, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Thursday that 'there is no way around it.' 'American boots will be standing on sand,' he told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute. 'Americans will be shot at, and they will be shooting back. There is simply no other way to do this.' Obama has already sent more than 1,600 military personnel into Iraq, but the White House and Pentagon refer to them as 'advisers' and 'security forces,' not soldiers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Air power alone won't get the job done in Iraq and Syria, argued House Armed Services Committee chairman Buck McKeon, a California Republican . Pledge: President Barack Obama said Wednesday that America ground troops would not be fighting ISIS . 'These American forces will not have a combat mission.' he president said during a prime-time speech Wednesday night. 'We will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq. But they are needed to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces with training, intelligence and equipment.' As the numbers of airstrikes and boots on the ground continue to rise, experts are wondering whether 'mission creep' will force Obama – sooner rather than later – to repeat the strategies of President George W. Bush, which he forcefully campaigned against in 2007. McKeon acknowledged that 'it is dangerous any time we have our sons and daughters take to the skies, the seas, or the shores to defeat an enemy.' But 'the only thing more dangerous is waiting.' He told the Orange County Register on Monday that the president should 'err on the side of more [troops] rather than less.' But he said successfully beating back ISIS wouldn't require tens of thousands of armed American combatants. 'This will take troops,' he said Thursday. 'It will not take divisions.' An army division consists of between 10,000 and 20,000 soldiers. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Obama's leading generals presented him with a plan this week that called for U.S. troops going into ground combat. U.S. Middle East commander Gen. Lloyd Austin advised the White House to 'send a modest contingent of American troops, principally Special Operations forces, to advise and assist Iraqi army units in fighting the militants,' the Post reported, citing two unnamed military officials. The word 'assist' is key. That would have involved embedding American soldiers with Iraqi government troops as they engaged ISIS and took fire. Obama ultimately decided to send 475 servicemen and women to Iraq, solely as advisers for training, intelligence and equipment. Writing under a pen name, a Defense Department official told The Daily Caller on Thursday that 'in both Iraq and Syria, the United States lacks a reliable, legitimate ground force that it can support with air strikes in order to defeat the Islamic State.' Obama's plan for airstrikes combined with support for Iraqi forces and the Free Syrian Army, the official said, 'is a foolish strategy that is unlikely to succeed.' ISIS, short for the self-declared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, has mounted a fearsome campaign of terror and mass-murder across about half of the combined territories of Iraq and Syria. The group aims to establish a global caliphate that would enforce a hard-line variation of Islam called Shariah law. It has already threatened to mount direct attacks in U.S. cities. Retired Gen. David Petraeus, who led the Iraq 'surge' of U.S. troops in 2007, cautioned on Thursday that the U.S. shouldn't 'overestimate' the strength of the terror group's standing army. 'ISIL in Iraq should not be overestimated,' he said in Denver during a speech about the 9/11 commemoration. 'This, in many respects, is a – it has nowhere near the roots, the numbers, and the structure that al-Qaeda in Iraq and the associated Sunni insurgents had' before the surge, he said. Cancer spreads: ISIS controls or is in the process of controlling wide swaths of territory across Syria and Iraq . Public enemy #1: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS . But the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency now estimates that ISIS may have as many as 31,000 fighters at its disposal. ISIS 'can muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across Iraq and Syria, based on a new review of all-source intelligence reports from May to August,' CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani said in a statement. The group's Syria contingent includes 15,000 foreign fighters – including 2,000 from Western nations. Those numbers are making some experts doubt that it can be defeated by airstrikes alone. Larry Johnson, a former CIA analyst and State Department counter-terrorism official, told The Washington Times that avoiding a ground game made Obama's strategy 'a waste of time.' ISIS 'is an army,' he said. 'The air power is not going to get the job done. Until you put troops in and kill these guys, they're going to continue.' An unnamed U.S. Army officer echoed McKeon's caution that a mid-sized contingent could get the job done. 'Air power alone cannot win wars,' the officer told the Times. '[Obama's] stated strategy ignores this widely accepted truth. But with troops on the ground, in very small numbers, we can team with Kurds and Shia to support those ground forces in rapidly defeating ISIS.' Retired Army General John Keane added that defeating the terror group 'requires a ground counteroffensive to retake lost territory.' His preference, however, would be to continue the current effort 'led by the Iraqi army and the Free Syrian Army [and] supported by close air support.'","Leading congressman calls on Obama to put 'boots on the ground' in the Middle East to stop the spread of ISIS .
'There is simply no other way to do this,' Rep. Buck McKeon said .

"The alleged leader of the Juarez drug cartel, Alberto Carrillo Fuentes, known as Ugly Betty, has been arrested. Alberto Carrillo Fuentes was captured in the western state of Nayarit, in the latest round of high profile arrests by Mexican police. The 47-year-old was arrested after being traced to a hotel where he was hiding alone, reported  Borderland Beat. Captured: The alleged leader of the Juarez drug cartel, Alberto Carrillo Fuentes, also known as Ugly Betty has been arrested (file photo) Found: Alberto Carrillo Fuentes was captured in the western state of Nayarit, in the latest round of high profile arrests by Mexican police . He faces charges of drug trafficking, murder and organized crime. Authorities have been waging an tough campaign against drug gangs with Carrillo Fuentes being the third alleged top cartel leader to be caught this year in Mexico. He is believed to have taken over the drug cartel named after Ciudad Juarez, the city bordering Texas, after his brother Vicente 'The Viceroy' Carrillo Fuentes gave up the job, reported AFP. The original group was founded by another brother, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who was nicknamed The Lord of the Skies - he died in 1997 as a result of undergoing plastic surgery to alter his appearance in an effort to avoid capture. The arrest on Sunday came a day before Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is due to give his state of the union speech. Up in smoke: A Mexican soldier stands by as piles of cocaine are burnt (file photo) Nearly half of Mexicans feel drug-related violence has increased since President Pena Nieto took office in December, according to a newspaper poll released on Friday, heaping pressure on the president who vowed to tame the gangs and restore order. The El Universal/Buendia & Laredo poll found that 49 percent of the 1,000 people questioned thought drug violence had worsened since December, up 9 points since February. A quarter of respondents felt security had improved while another 25 percent thought it had remained steady. The survey makes for mixed reading for Pena Nieto, who came into power vowing to break with his predecessor's military-led tactics and put an end to Mexico's vicious drug war. Nearly 80,000 people have died in drug-related killings since former President Felipe Calderon sent in the army to quell the powerful drug bosses, a policy Pena Nieto has criticised but found tough to break with. Increase: Nearly half of Mexicans feel drug-related violence has increased since President Pena Nieto took office in December . Pena Nieto has said he wants to take a different tack, lowering crime by targeting kidnapping and extortion. But earlier this week, Pena Nieto scaled back plans for his flagship security measure, a militarised police force that he hoped would gradually take the place of the army in the conflict. Pena Nieto had spoken of a 40,000-strong force, but it has now been cut to 5,000, leading some to question how different Pena Nieto's drug policy is from Calderon's. Critics point to a number of recent kingpin captures under Pena Nieto, including a suspected boss of the Gulf Cartel, in addition to the leader of the Zetas, Miguel Angel Trevino, and a suspected lieutenant of Mexico's most wanted drug lord, Joaquin 'Shorty' Guzman. Going after cartel bosses, which critics say only serves to splinter the gangs and increase the violence, was a hallmark of Calderon's drug strategy. Nonetheless, the poll indicates that most Mexicans feel Pena Nieto has changed drug tactics from his predecessor, with 59 percent seeing evidence of a new strategy and 24 percent saying they had not noticed a change. Furthermore, 34 percent of those questioned felt the current president's security strategy had made Mexico less safe, compared with 53 percent in May last year, the last few months of Calderon's term. The poll showed people were split on the best way to tackle Mexico's drug scourge. Twenty-seven percent of those interviewed said they thought the best tactic was to lower violence, while 24 percent wanted to see the cartels beaten. Only 10 percent wanted to see more arrests and trials of drug bosses. Pena Nieto, who has tried to shift public attention away from the violence toward Mexico's economic potential, has said the number of murders between December and July this year had fallen by 20 percent compared with the same period last year. Still, about 1,000 people have died each month in drug violence since Pena Nieto took office, official data show, and the army is still involved in clashes with the cartels across large parts of the country. According to the poll, 23 percent of people viewed the western Mexican state of Michoacan as the country's least secure, while 8 percent opted for the northern Mexican states of Tamaulipas and Sianloa, which house key drug smuggling routes to the United States.","Alberto Carrillo Fuentes was captured in western state of Nayarit .

"Paris St Germain had worked hard at turning this into a revenge mission, with an over-active social media campaign accompanied by the hash-tag slogan: 'A different story'. It was the sort of behaviour clubs usually shirk away from in fear of tempting fate. 'Revenge is a dish best served one year later,' read one pithy message from the official Twitter account, along with images of PSG scarves on a waxwork model of the Queen and a statue of Winston Churchill. This constant search for something new is what makes the world wide web go around, but what exactly had they hoped to change? Diego Costa pushes David Luiz during the second-half of a bad-tempered last 16 encounter . Luiz and Laurent Blanc look shocked as tempers begin to flare at the Parc des Princes . Costa collides with Thiago Silva during a bad-tempered game with no love lost between the two sides . Last year, Laurent Blanc’s side won 3-1 in the first leg and few who witnessed that game expected Chelsea to recover against this emerging new force in European football. At times, it seemed to be very much the same old story. The Londoners took the lead but were unable to kick on and PSG responded with great energy and desire, only to find this time, for all their pressure and clear opportunities, they could not establish a first-leg lead. The French champions still pose a threat at Stamford Bridge next month, but Jose Mourinho will have been perfectly content as he hopped back across the Channel with his away goal and scores level after a game he could easily have lost. Ultimately, the story was different in an important detail. Chelsea are stronger than last year and they resisted, with a bit of luck, the extra midfield muscle of Nemanja Matic and the authority of Thibaut Courtois, who returned to replace Petr Cech and confirm his status as No 1. Courtois was brilliantly composed and focused and made a splendid save from Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the final seconds. David Luiz attributed the 1-1 result to the goalkeeper, as teams often do when they are wasteful in front of goal. Thibaut Courtois was in impressive form and kept Paris-Saint Germain at bay with a string of fine saves . Costa takes on PSG right back Gregory van der Viel as he returned from a three-match suspension . Branislav Ivanovic hit the opener in the first-half to give Chelsea a precious away goal . Although rusty, Costa proved an effective weapon for Chelsea, putting a Didier Drogba-like performance . Cesc Fabregas worked hard in midfield and there was, of course, Diego Costa, returning up front, the £32million, 17-goal top-scorer, fresh from three weeks out, serving a hotly-disputed ban for violent conduct. Fabregas, who had been suffering from a cold and arrived at the ground wrapped up in woollens, ran miles but found it difficult to influence the game and Costa was off the pace, as Mourinho said he might be. There was zip in Costa’s legs; his touch was heavy and, as Chelsea were stretched defensively in the second-half there were repercussions for the man up front. Costa became more remote, with his role increasingly limited to irritating those in blue, helping out in defence at set-pieces and trying to stay alert for any scraps that came his way; the sort of performance delivered so many times by Didier Drogba. For Mourinho, however, regardless of his contribution on the ball, it was important to have him on field, a symbol of the fighting qualities this team boast, proving this squad is stronger and more capable of going all the way. If anyone expected Costa to keep clear of physical contact they do not know his style. Costa may have been caught on camera and banned for his stamp on Emre Can, but he was not about to surrender his chief asset. Jose Mourinho appeals for calm on the pitch immediately following Chelsea's opening goal . The Blues were pegged back after Edinson Cavani levelled with a thunderous headed effort . There was a sequence of minor fouls as he set out to make a nuisance of himself. He was late into challenges on Thiago Silva talked his way into a row which had nothing to do with him and pulled Luiz’s hair. When Mourinho bemoaned his lack of strikers after losing in Paris last season, there was more to it than goals. He also lacked the hardy front man, to carry the team forward when they needed a break. Chelsea have got rid of five strikers since they were last in the French capital, including Andre Schurrle, the winger who played up front in this fixture. Three have arrived but, not for the first time, it was Chelsea’s defenders scoring the big goals. Costa battles to win possession from Van der Viel and Ezequiel Lavezzi . Costa has not found the target in the Champions League since April when he scored for Atletico Madrid at Chelsea. It did not matter. The away goal is vital, and they have learned to appreciate its value over the years. It gave them hope in the epic fight-back against Napoli, three years ago, and when they overturned the first-leg deficit against PSG last year. And, no matter how little adventure they show, it is not often Mourinho’s team fail to find the net. The only time this season was back in November, in Sunderland. It is a valuable asset in Europe and Chelsea are seasoned campaigners these days. PSG are acquiring these skills. They may be learning, too, that to change the script it is more important to stop conceding goals at home than to stir up mischief and antagonise the opposition.","Diego Costa returned up front, fresh from three weeks out, as Chelsea drew 1-1 with Paris Saint-Germain .

"America's first Ebola victim Thomas Duncan is believe to have been visiting the U.S. for the first time, his girlfriend's ex-husband has said today. The 42-year-old Liberian is visiting Louise Troh and their son in Dallas, Texas, on a tourist visa, and entered the country on September 20. Mr Duncan began showing symptoms of Ebola 'four or five days' after his arrival, and was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Unlucky: America’s first Ebola victim Thomas Duncan, who has been hospitalized in Dallas, Texas, is believe to have been visiting the U.S. for the first time . Details of Mr Duncan's life and relations to the U.S. are few, however he is believed to hail from the Liberian capital Monrovia where he attended high school. His girlfriend Louise Troh also hails from Liberia, but it is not known how long the couple have been together, although they do have one son. On a Facebook profile believed to belong to Ms Troh, she has 'checked in' as being in the Liberian capital Monrovia as recent as August 11. Troh's ex-husband Joe Joe Jallah, who met with Mr Duncan before he was hospitalised, told the Wall Street Journal that believed that this was Mr. Duncan’s first trip to America. His partner, Ms Troh, a careworker, is in quarantine at the Dallas apartment she was sharing with Duncan, along with her 13-year-old son and two nephews, aged 23 and 28. The area of Dallas-Fort Worth in north-Texas has a thriving Liberian community of 5,000-10,000 members, a community now in shock at the news of Duncan's illness. The man opens the door for Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins (left) and two other women at the quarantined apartment where Thomas Eric Duncan was staying when he began suffering Ebola symptoms . A man peaks his head through the door of the apartment in The Ivy Apartments complex where the infected man started suffering the symptons before he was taken to hospital . Judge Jenkins is seen walking away from the front door on Thursday evening. He has come under fire for allowing the sweat-soaked sheets Duncan stayed in to be left in the apartment . Armed officers wait outside the building with a group of others for the visiting party to return from the property . Mr Duncan arrived from Liberia, an Ebola 'hot zone' in West Africa, on September 20. He began to develop Ebola symptoms - the point when the disease becomes contagious - on September 23. He was sent home from his first hospital trip with antibiotics despite telling two medical staff he had flown in from Liberia. His partner Louise said she doesn't believe he left the apartment in this time but she cannot be certain because she was at work. His condition deteriorated and he was rushed to hospital via ambulance on Sunday and quarantined. However it was alleged on Thursday that Mr Duncan lied on an airport questionnaire about not having any contact with an infected person, authorities said on Thursday. Mr Duncan filled out a series of questions about his health and activities before leaving on his journey to Dallas, Texas on September 19. On the form he answered no to every question. Among other questions, the form asked whether Duncan had cared for an Ebola patient or touched the body of anyone who had died in an area affected by Ebola. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Mr Duncan had helped carried a neighbor's pregnant daughter who was dying from Ebola. The Liberian government said on Thursday that it planned to prosecute Mr Duncan over the lies while the country's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told CBC today that she was 'very angry' that Mr Duncan had left Liberia after being exposed to Ebola and that his actions were 'unpardonable'. President Sirleaf also said that she hoped that no one else would contract the potentially deadly virus which has ravaged her country. The quarantined family members of Ebola sufferer Thomas Eric Duncan had tried to escape their Dallas apartment after being told they had to stay inside because they were at risk, having been around Mr Duncan while he was contagious . The four schools affected introduced safety measures on Wednesday including cleaning teams and extra nurses to monitor any students suffering from fever or flu-like symptoms . An unidentified man exits the apartment under quarantine for Ebola today to pick up food that was delivered by The Red Cross in Dallas, Texas. The young man is wearing a shirt that reads: 'YOLO, you only live once' On Thursday afternoon, it was revealed that four sheriff's deputies, a health director and a doctor, went into the quarantined apartment without protection, NBC5 reported. Two Douglas County Sheriff's Office patrol cars have now been cordoned off and the deputies have been told to seal their uniforms in bags and go home. Meanwhile, the number of family members who came in contact with Mr Duncan while he was contagious remains unclear, CNN reported. Louise's daughter, Youngor Yallah, who does not live at the quarantined apartment, was the person who called an ambulance for Mr Duncan on Sunday after she came to her mother's home to bring him tea and found him feverish and shivering. It is unclear if she traveled with him in the ambulance or came in close contact with the infected man. The family who are isolated in the apartment have been told they face criminal charges if they leave the apartment or accept visitors. An unidentified male peeks his head through a curtain inside the apartment where Ebola sufferer Thomas Eric Duncan was staying when he became contagious in Dallas, Texas . The Red Cross delivered boxes of food to the quarantined apartment in North Dallas, Texas on Thursday afternoon after Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan's partner, Louise, said the CDC had not informed her of the plan to look after them . A map of North Dallas in Texas reveals the proximity of where Mr Duncan was staying in relation to the hospital and schools as officials said today the Ebola patient may have come in contact with up to 100 people . Dallas Judge Clay Jenkins told ABC today that a legal quarantine order was placed on the home after the family tried to break out of the apartment. However MailOnline reported on Wednesday that three individuals - a man in his twenties with a roll of garbage bags and two women - came and left the apartment. Ms Troh said that she has been given no instructions by the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) on how to dispose of the contaminated bedding in the home or what the family would do for food. She said that two CDC workers who visited the home on Wednesday brought sandwiches but they had no other food. At a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Judge Jenkins was quick to respond to those claims, saying that several days supply of food was being delivered to the quarantined group and contaminated material would be removed by biohazard experts. He added that the family were being treated with the 'utmost respect and dignity'. Texas health officials said around 100 people may have come into contact with Mr Duncan and they are being questioned. Authorities have confirmed 12 people including five children had direct contact with Mr Duncan and are being closely monitored. Some parents have pulled their children out of four affected Dallas schools after learning that five students may have come into contact with Mr Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. School administrators appealed for calm as none of the children have shown symptoms and are being told to stay at home, where they will likely remain for three weeks.","Ebola victim Thomas Duncan is believed to be in the US on a tourist visa .

"Donald Trump has backtracked over a series of scathing tweets he wrote about President Obama as he secured a second term last night - hastily deleting messages calling for a 'revolution'. And when NBC's Brian Williams lambasted Trump's Twitter tantrum on his show, the outspoken business mogul turned his anger on the host and his 'boring' newscasts. Trump took to the social networking site after the president's victory was projected by several news outlets on Tuesday night, and claimed the re-election was a 'great and disgusting injustice'. After a barrage of outraged messages, Trump added: 'He lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election. We should have a revolution in this country!' Scroll down for videos . Spat: NBC's Brian Williams, left, criticised billionaire Donald Trump, right, after he went on a Twitter rant demanding a revolution after Obama's re-election. Trump has now hit back at Williams . Minutes later, he deleted the tweet - . perhaps aware of the potential legal ramifications of a remark seeking . to incite a revolution against the president. NBC's Brian Williams read some of . Trump's tweets on the air, while claiming he did so . reluctantly, as he declared that the TV personality - whose show, . Celebrity Apprentice, airs on NBC - had 'driven well past the last exit . to relevance.' 'This is, as they say, out there and . getting an airing tonight, so you might as well know about it,' Williams . groaned. 'Donald Trump, who has driven well past the last exit to . relevance and veered into something closer to irresponsible here, is . tweeting tonight. Here's a sampling...' Williams read several of Trump's tweets, which called the election a 'total sham and a travesty.' Litany: Trump later deleted parts of his rant, but has kept the majority of it, blasting the Electoral College and the direction of the nation . However, as it became apparent that former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney would not win the election, the Donald’s tweets became more enraged, and more hyperbolic. Trump began with: 'Well, back to the drawing board!' He . quickly followed up with a call to revolution. The Trump wrote: 'He . lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election. We should have a . revolution in this country!' - before deleting the tweet. But he was far from over. 'This . election is a total sham and a travesty,' he wrote. 'We are not a . democracy! He added America is in 'serious and unprecedented trouble like never before'. Priorities: Trump endorsed Romney last February in Las Vegas and has outspokenly objected many of Obama's policies . Bowed: Romney delivered his concession speech early Wednesday morning in Boston after he lost to Obama . The 66-year-old later went onto . attack the Electoral College, but offered a kernel of hope for the . still-Republican House of Representatives. ‘Hopefully the House can hold our country together for four more years,’ Trump tweeted. ‘House . shouldn’t give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare.’ He . did not tweet anything after Romney's gracious concession speech. But he didn't keep his anger quiet for long, unleashing yet more scathing remarks on Wednesday morning - this time against Brian Williams, who uses the Twitter handle @bwilliams. He wrote: '@bwilliams knows that I think his newscast has become totally boring so he took a shot at me last night.' Second rant: on Wednesday, Trump turned on Brian Williams who had criticised his previous messages . 'The only thing more boring than @bwilliams newscast is his show Rock Center which is totally dying in the ratings - a disaster!' he added, before asking him: 'Wouldn't you love to have my ratings?' He went on: 'If I'm ""well past the last exit to relevance"" how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night?' Trump’s attacks on Obama have been more frequent in the weeks preceding the election. Only . last week, he lashed out at the commander-in-chief for using Superstorm . Sandy to garner more votes and essentially buy the election. The billionaire’s grudge hasn’t gone unnoticed by the president. During . a recent appearance on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno, Obama quipped . that their rivalry began when the two were growing up in Kenya. ‘We had constant run-ins on the soccer field, he wasn’t that good,’ Obama told the NBC late-night host. Offer he could refuse: Ahead of the election, Trump offered to pay $5million to the charity of President Obama's choice if he released his college and passport records . Victory: President Obama waves as he walks on stage with first lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha at his election night party . Cheers: Obama and the family were met with cheering at McCormick Place in Chicago . Obama said on Leno that the two have never actually met. During a campaign stop in swing state New Hampshire last month, Obama again joked about his birth certificate. He joked that Mitt Romney had made it too expensive for him to get a birth certificate.'He raised fees to get a birth certificate which would have been expensive for me,' the president said. The . joke was met with laughter and cheers, and was a veiled reference to . so-called 'birthers' who doubt he was born in America and question the . authenticity of his Hawaiian birth certificate.","Trump ranted on Twitter when it became clear Obama would win election .

"Deal: British Prime Minister Tony Blair with Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev outside Downing Street, London . Tony Blair’s multi-million-pound deal to boost ‘good governance’ in Kazakhstan has resulted in civil rights and freedom of the Press getting worse, it was claimed yesterday. The former prime minister was accused of helping to preside over heavy reversals in human rights as he advised the Kazakh regime led by dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev. The two-year contract has come to an end but could still be renewed. Hugh Williamson, of Human Rights Watch, said Mr Blair’s main achievement had been ‘positive spin’ for the oil-rich regime. He added: ‘Blair says human rights issues are critical to his work but he has downplayed new limits on basic freedoms and widespread concerns on the rule of law and torture, in favour of focusing on economic and geopolitical achievements. ‘From what we know, he has been indifferent to those suffering abuses and has given a veneer of respectability to the authorities during a severe crackdown on human rights. Rights campaigners take issue with this positive spin.’ There had been curbs on peaceful public assembly and religious freedoms, the human rights group warned. There had also been the prosecution of journalists who dared to ‘insult’ officials, and torture in detention was common. Amirzhan Kosanov, the embattled Kazakh opposition leader, said there had been a ‘deterioration in the human rights and political freedoms situation’. He added: ‘Unfortunately, over the two years that Tony Blair has been a consultant, we haven’t seen any changes for the better or signals of movement towards democratisation.’ Former Prime Ministers: Tony Blair was stood alongside Gordon Brown at the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph . Oksana Makushina, a former deputy editor of a now closed-down newspaper in the country, said: ‘If Mr Blair was advising Nazarbayev on something, it definitely wasn’t freedom of speech.’ David Cameron raised the human rights situation with the president on his visit to the country in July. In December 2011, 15 civilians were killed when police fired on protesters. Opposition politicians were blamed and the party of alleged ringleader Vladimir Kozlov was closed down, along with newspapers and media outlets. Mr Blair recently added Mongolia and Albania to the list of nations whose leadership he advises, and is said to be in talks with Burma, Peru and Vietnam. His office insisted that the work he carried out helped Kazakhstan move in the right direction. Tony Blair Associates said the former premier’s work ‘focuses on social and economic reform and is entirely in line with that of the international community’. A spokesman said: ‘Of course the country faces challenges but that is precisely why we should engage and support its efforts to reform.’","Former PM's deal to boost 'good governance' in Kazakhstan has backfired .

"This is the shocking moment an alleged mistress was stripped naked and brutally kicked, punched and slapped in the street by a gang of ruthless stiletto wearing love rivals. The incident is the latest in a spate of copycat attacks in which young women have been beaten and stripped in a humiliating punishment for attracting the wrong man's affection. Sometimes the attackers are the wives of the men and at other times jilted former girlfriends who have either spotted their rival by chance, or else laid in wait and ambushed her outside homes or work. Scroll down for video . The woman desperately tries to hold on to her top as one of her fierce attackers moves in to rip it away . And most shocking is the fact that passers-by in almost every case do absolutely nothing - apparently believing the punishment of a woman who has an affair is justified, even if the person accusing her is a rival. In the latest attack, which happened in Jinan city, in eastern China's Shandong Province, three women, including two wearing stilettos, strip the clothes off the other woman and kick, punch and slap her while a fourth woman films the whole thing. At one point the young woman appears to give up trying to hold her tattered clothing and fights back, but has no chance against her three ruthless tormentors. Passers-by again refused to intervene after the three attackers shouted that the victim was a marriage breaker. They screamed that she deserved to be punished as they subjected to her to the ordeal, which lasted several minutes. At one point the victim, topless by this point, attempts to fight off her attackers but she is knocked back to the ground again after being overpowered and outnumbered . Locals on social media website Weibo, where the video was shared, have criticised the three women for their violent behaviour . But most of those who witnessed the event in daylight either ignored it or simply stood by and watched. One online commentator wrote: 'Who gives them the right to decide? 'For all we know the women attacking could be the mistress in the woman on the ground the wife!'

"Steven Gerrard called those long, lonely nights out on the left wing under former England manager Fabio Capello the graveyard shift.

"The number of British children groomed and trafficked for sexual abuse by gangs has soared by 155 per cent, figures show. In 2013, police identified 450 potential child victims who were either smuggled into the country or moved around by crime gangs, National Crime Agency data shows. Of those, 56 were British children suspected of being trafficked for sexual exploitation – more than double the number in 2012. Abuse: Cases of child sexual exploitation and trafficking have shot up in number (picture posed by models) The number of foreign children seen as at risk of sexual exploitation rose 11 per cent, to 88. Another 123 minors were thought to have been brought to the UK for forced labour, often in nail bars and drugs farms, a quarter more than the previous year. The report found that children from Vietnam were the most commonly targeted, followed by Albania and then the UK. The number of suspected trafficking cases involving Britons rose by 173 per cent, with 27 adult and 63 child victims. Forces have also seen a dramatic surge . in modern slavery cases, with 141 adults and 45 children identified as . potential victims last year. The new figures, which emerged just . hours after a British director called for modern slavery to be . eradicated at the Baftas, indicate that domestic servitude cases are up . 20 per cent. Ambivalence: Bafta-winning director Steve McQueen said on Monday: 'There are 21 million people in slavery as we sit here. I hope 150 years from now our ambivalence will not allow another film-maker to make this film' Steve McQueen, director . of 12 Years a Slave, which won best film at the Baftas, called for . action to tackle the scourge of the modern slave trade. He said: 'There . are 21 million people in slavery as we sit here. I just hope 150 years . from now our ambivalence will not allow another film-maker to make this . film.' According to the NCA report, human trafficking referrals increased by 47 per cent between 2012 and 2013, with a total of 1,746 suspected victims from 112 countries. Nearly two-thirds of those were female. Abuse: Child trafficking has increased (posed by model) Liam Vernon of the NCA said part of the rise was down to increased awareness of how to refer suspected cases in the fight against  ‘a criminal trade in human misery’. He added: 'Increased awareness, both of human . trafficking in its various forms and the obligation of first responders . to use the National Referral Mechanism, is a likely contributor to the . increased number of referrals in 2013. 'We know that this is a crime which affects some of society's most vulnerable people, and some victims will remain undetected. 'The NCA is committed to relentlessly disrupting what is a criminal trade in human misery.' The number of potential adult victims being trafficked into Britain by criminal gangs for labour exploitation has leapt by 89 per cent, with 511 being smuggled into the UK in 2013. Police have also seen a spike in women being taken here and forced to work as prostitutes, with 563 reported victims in 2013, up 53 per cent on the previous year. Immigrants from Albania, Nigeria and Vietnam were most common nationalities targeted. Many victims have been brought to the UK illegally with the promise of a job only to be forced into prostitution or cannabis cultivation. Modern Slavery and Organised Crime Minister, Karen Bradley, said: 'Today's figures are unlikely to show the full scale of modern slavery, nor the human suffering behind each statistic. 'That is why we are taking action on a number of fronts including raising public awareness. 'The National Crime Agency is leading an enhanced and coordinated response to targeting trafficking gangs, we are increasing protection for victims, and we are strengthening legislation through a Modern Slavery Bill.'","Rise recorded by National Crime Agency could be down to better awareness .

"He's previously caused a splash in the art world by creating a real life city of Atlantis, sinking a life-size sculpture of a Volkswagen Beetle and even a house. And now British sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor has unveiled his latest collection of sub-aquatic art - this time with a serious message. The 39-year-old has unveiled a new series of works in the Museo Subacuatico de Arte, the subaquatic museum he co-founded back in 2009 off the coast of Cancun, Mexico. The new pieces include the submerged cement heads of the anchors on American news show NBC Today, cast when deCaires Taylor appeared on the show, which sit eerily amid a bed of sea grass.

One of the sculptures, called No Turning Back, a cement cast of a hunched-over woman, alludes to the loss of Caribbean coral reefs, while Self-Immolation depicts a solitary burning figure - a reference to the practice of setting yourself on fire as a form of political protest. Made from black pH neutral marine cement, the work is augmented with stainless steel spines, and over time it will be overrun with fast-growing, bright yellow live fire coral which will mimic flames.

Another of deCaires Taylor's sculptures is Resurrection, a winged angelic-looking figure, which uses live purple Gorgonian fan coral, rescued after being displaced from the reef system and damaged during a recent storm. Strong currents around the museum meant that the sculptures had to be craned from a bridge into a nearby canal and then toed out to the site.

However, the museum has been a huge success, receiving 250,000 visitors each year, and deCaires Taylor is trying to secure funding to eventually expand it to include 8,000 figures - more than the famous Terracotta Army. He said: 'I'm leaving Mexico, but I've got this legacy here, that my daughter can come back in twenty years time and it will still be there.'

Bryan from Snake Catchers says it's common for them to remove snakes from suburban homes in and around Brisbane. 'We’ve had a few do that... if it's not entry via lighting or bathroom heaters, it's through the exhaust fans,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

"Awaiting sentencing for a murder committed in 2008 during a robbery of a Dunkin Donuts, a South Florida man took the stand and dared the judge: 'give me the death sentence because I'm innocent.' A jury convicted James Herard, 25, back in May of 18 felony counts related to a string of armed robberies committed in Broward County in 2008 that ended with the deaths of two men. According to the Sun-Sentinel, prosecutors said Herard shot 56-year-old Kiem Huynh of Fort Lauderdale in the back while he and four other men named as members of the Bacc Street Crips by investigators robbed a Dunkin' Donuts in Tamarac. Proclaimed innocence: James Herard, 25, dared a judge to give him the death sentence after being convicted of 18 felony charges, including charges related to a double murder . Another member, Tharod Bell, 29, allegedly shot a second victim, Eric Jean-Pierre, though Herard was implicated for encouraging the murder. NBC Miami reports that Herard was on the stand on Friday arguing that he wanted the judge to him the death penalty. 'I’m not asking you to spare me,' he told the judge. 'Go ahead and do what you gonna do. I pretty much dare you to give me the death sentence because I’m innocent.' 'I know the Supreme Court won’t allow me to die for something I didn’t commit,' he added. During a confession taped in 2008 and shown to jurors, Herard told an interrogator, about Eric Jean-Pierre: 'That's not my body, but you might as well give it to me, because he [Bell] wouldn't have pulled the trigger if I didn't provoke it.' Herard claimed in court that the six-hour confession was coerced. Local 10 reports during Friday's hearing, the defense called witnesses that attested to Herard's positive impact in prison, where he's acted as mentor and teacher, even helping other inmates write letters. Armed robbery: Security cameras in several Dunkin' Donuts captured footage of robberies committed by shotgun-wielding masked men . Gang activity: Police charge that the robberies were committed by Herard and four others while part of the Bacc Street Crips . Strange behavior: Herard played to courtroom cameras during his trial, and was shown barking at a judge during a hearing in 2008 . 'He helped me get in contact with my family,' testified inmate Angelo Coicou. 'He helped me far as -- I didn't know how to read, basically.' Herard is already serving numerous life sentences for crimes committed in Palm Beach County, where his crew left two men seriously disfigured during armed robberies. He has been prone to outbursts and strange behavior during the lengthy trial, even barking like dog at a judge in 2008.","James Herard, 25, was convicted of 18 felony counts in May, including charges related to two murders .

"A professor at a prestigious Ivy League university stripped down to his underwear in a packed lecture theatre in front of a screen playing footage of the 9/11 attacks.

'I've been tasked with the impossible challenge of having to teach you quantum mechanics in one hour - what basically the most brilliant minds, Einstein and so on, couldn't figure out working on it their whole life. 'So that's actually a bit of a big goal for today,' said Professor Hughes, before pointing out that all the students in attendance needed to pass quantum mechanics in order to gain their undergraduate degrees at Columbia.

"George Osborne is set to hand the gambling industry a multi-million-pound tax cut as part of an incentive to bring the offshore internet gaming business back to Britain. The highly controversial move comes the day after the Chancellor faced nationwide protests over  the Government’s failure to crack  down on massive corporation tax avoidance by companies including Starbucks, Google and Amazon. Last night, fair tax campaigners criticised any new tax concession  to the online gaming industry, which is linked to alarming increases in gambling addiction, with children suffering as families are plunged into debt. Controversial move: George Osborne is set to hand the gambling industry a multi-million-pound tax cut as part of an incentive to bring the offshore internet gaming business back to Britain . Britain’s biggest gambling companies moved their internet gaming operations offshore after Labour brought in a 15 per cent tax for all internet betting seven years ago. But The Mail on Sunday has been told the Treasury is considering slashing the gambling levy by a third to recoup some of the £2.1 billion in revenues that has been lost over the last seven years. Yesterday, tax avoidance campaigners said they were protesting at dozens of Starbucks cafes across the UK, despite the firm’s pledge to pay millions of pounds of extra corporation tax for the next two years. The organisers, UK Uncut, say the coffee company’s promise to pay £20million is ‘a desperate attempt to deflect public pressure’ from itself. Public protest: Tax avoidance campaigners have protested at dozens of Starbucks cafes across the UK, despite the firm's pledge to pay millions of pounds of extra corporation tax because they say it is 'a desperate attempt to deflect public pressure' A draft Bill published this week proposes a tax that will bring offshore gambling companies in line with bookmakers based and regulated in the UK. Opponents to the tax concession point out that other EU countries impose higher gambling taxes of 20 per cent and, in the case of Germany and America, have laws that greatly restrict all online gambling. John Christensen, a director of Tax Justice Network, said: ‘It really doesn’t make much sense to lower the rate of taxation to try to bring them back to the UK. The tax rate should remain as it is.’ Dr Mark Griffiths, director of the International Gaming Research Unit at Nottingham Trent University, said: ‘Online gambling exacerbates the problems associated with addictions because it is available 24/7 and 365 days a year.’ He added: ‘It is much more difficult to regulate and to make sure children don’t use online gambling.’ But a senior Government source says the Treasury is close to accepting the argument that the rate should be slashed by a third. Fair tax criticism: Campaigners criticised any new tax concession to the online gaming industry, which is linked to alarming increases in gambling addiction, with children suffering as families are plunged into debt . Eighteen of the 20 big betting companies who operate most of the 2,500 gambling websites in the UK use offshore bases like Gibraltar to market and operate their services. On the Treasury’s own estimates, a five per cent cut would save the companies nearly £100 million in tax each year. But a Government source said the argument for lowering gambling taxes from 15 per cent to ten per cent was almost won. ‘There are two separate arguments – what is the appropriate rate of tax and should people pay it?’ the source said. ‘On the second of those two questions, the answer must be a firm yes. ‘I’m all in favour of lower taxes but we have got to work out how it is going to be paid for. There is an argument that you should lower taxation in order to incentivise the firms to come back.’ The draft Bill focuses on online betting scandals, including potential match fixing, as justification for bringing the offshore companies under the tighter regulation controlled by the Gambling Commission. Minister for Sport and Tourism, Hugh Robertson, said of the new Bill: ‘These proposals will ensure that British consumers enjoy consistent standards of protection, regardless of where a gambling business is based.’","There has been nationwide protests over the Government's failure to crack down on massive corporation tax avoidance by some companies .

"George Osborne has moved his mortgage to an exclusive bank for the super-rich, it was claimed. The Chancellor is said to have cut his interest rate on the loan on his £4million house in Notting Hill, west London - which he rents out for £10,000 a month while living in Downing Street. Mr Osborne reportedly switched the loan on the house - which has doubled in value since he bought it in 2006 - from Barclays and C. Hoare & Co to RBC Europe, part of the Royal Bank of Canada. Change: Chancellor George Osborne is said to have cut his interest on the loan on the £4million house in Notting Hill, west London - which he rents out for £10,000 a month while living in Downing Street . RBC is a privately-owned firm specialising in super rich wealth management, reported The People. The 42-year-old is thought to be remortgaging to get a cheaper deal - and qualifies for RBC because he has excellent equity in his London home, and is wealthy enough to join a bank for the mega-rich. Ray Boulger, of mortgage firm Jon Charcol, told The People: ‘The rate will vary on the individual but someone like George Osborne is likely to pay 1 to 1.5 per cent above the base rate of 0.5 per cent. ‘You or me are not going to be going there (to RBC) - they are not in our market. I’m not sure what their minimum loan size is but it would be at least £500,000 or maybe £1million.’ A rate of 2 per cent is significantly lower than the average high-street mortgage - and Labour MP John Mann claimed Mr Osborne was ‘trying to get a cheaper rate than everyone else’. The Bank of England’s base rate has . been at 0.5 per cent since March 2009, but the economic revival had been . fuelling speculation it could be raised for the first time in nearly . seven years. Guidance: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said last week that he would not raise interest rates for some time, even as Britain's economy records the strongest growth in the developed world .

"Click here to find out more from our brilliant Match Zone service - including this heat map from Angel di Maria . Unless he takes drastic action it might prove rather difficult for Alejandro Sabella to stop his players relying too much on Lionel Messi. Dropping him is probably the only solution, such is the impact Argentina’s magical captain is beginning to have at this World Cup. After scoring the winning goal in his side’s first two Group F encounters, Messi was at it again here at a pulsating Estadio Beira-Rio. Only this time he struck twice before Marcos Rojo stepped forward to settle another utterly absorbing encounter and become only the second Argentina player to score at these finals. If anything, Sabella needs to focus his attention more at the opposite end of the field. He might concern himself with the fact that Sergio Aguero limped off the pitch in the first half with what looked like another muscle injury; a worry for Manchester City too given the problems their striker has endured this past year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch as the Argentina fans arrived for their side's third victory . Star: Lionel Messi (above) hit a brilliant double to help Argentina defeat Nigeria .

Goals: Musa 4', 47' Referee: Nicola Rizzoli . *Player ratings by MATT LAWTON at Porto Alegre . But Sabella should start to recognise the contribution of Angel di Maria in his side’s attacking play and demand that his defenders start to perform to the same high standard. As dramatic a game as this was, it exposed the defensive frailties we witnessed in Argentina’s first two games. The back four creaked against Bosnia and Herzegovina and owed much to the goalkeeping heroics of Sergio Romero to stop Iran from scoring. In Messi, of course, we have a player capable of doing for Argentina what Diego Maradona once did in Mexico 28 years ago. A player seemingly ready to display that remarkable ability on the grandest stage of all. He might have been a little slow to get going in this tournament but he is gathering momentum now and very much leading his team from the front. As well as being his fourth of the tournament thus far, Messi’s second was his tenth in eight international appearances and his 42nd in 89 in total; a better return and a better ratio than Maradona and second only to Gabriel Batistuta on Argentina’s all-time list. Messi might have scored more on Wednesday but Sabella took the sensible decision to take him off after 63 minutes. Jubilant: Messi (left), Di Maria (centre) and Marcos Rojo celebrate the opening goal . Double: Ahmed Musa (left) grabbed his first World Cup brace to give Nigeria hope . But . if a side that moves into the last 16 as group winners, with nine . points, is to make it all the way to Rio on July 13, Sabella needs to . apply some discipline to a back four that has a tendency to go missing a . bit. Inspired, no doubt, by a crowd dominated by the blue and white stripes of Argentina – apparently some 200,000 supporters have made the 500 mile journey from their border to the west of Porto Alegre – Messi struck after just three minutes. Racing onto a super pass from Fernando Gago, Di Maria unleashed a shot that hit the post and rebounded back against it after striking Vincent Enyeama on the back and then bounced into the path of the advancing Messi, who with his left foot simple drove the ball into the roof of the net. Timing: The bomb was an hour before Nigeria's football team (pictured) played in the World Cup, losing 3-2 . Lucky: Marcos Rojo (centre) managed to knee the ball home to put Argentina back into the lead . In the lead: Rojo (left) beats his chest after scoring for Argentina in the Group F match . Nigeria forward Ahmed Musa scored twice to give his side hope against Argentina - Click here to find out more from our brilliant Match Zone service . Strike: Ahmed Musa scored in the fourth minute to pull Nigeria back into the game . But within 60 seconds Nigeria had levelled to make this the first match in World Cup history to see both teams score inside the first five minutes. While it was a goal that was stunning in its execution, it also owed much to Argentina’s failure to close down their opponents. Michael Babatunde – who sadly would leave the field in the second half with what looked like a fractured arm after being struck be a fast-moving ball – surged forward unopposed before feeding a pass into Ahmed Musa, who in turn would be allowed to take a couple of steps inside before curling a stunning shot beyond the reach of a diving Romero. Other chances would then follow for Argentina, with Di Maria particularly impressive alongside the genius that is Messi. And after 37 minutes Aguero would drop to the ground with nobody near him, suggesting that he had indeed pulled something. Finish: Pablo Zabaleta (centre) is unable to stop Musa's fourth minute strike . Well done: The Nigerian players join Ahmed Musa in celebration after his first goal . Level: The Nigeria forward celebrates scoring his first goal of the game against Argentina . Argentina would continue to apply pressure, with the athletic Enyeama doing well to stop a Messi free-kick. But no sooner than his team-mates applauded him for that save than another Messi delivery would prove beyond him. A breathtaking dead-ball delivery. It amounted to a crushing blow to Nigeria, coming just moments before the break. But they responded brilliantly, Musa levelling just two minutes into the second half after accelerating onto a perfectly weighted, defence-splitting pass from Emmanuel Emenike. Again, however, Argentina’s defenders, in particular Federico Fernandez and Rojo, should have been more alert to the danger. Pain: Michael Babatunde was carried off on a stretched with an arm injury in the second half . Out: Michael Babatunde arm was heavily strapped as he was carried off the pitch . Sealed: Joseph Yobo gives Musa (right) a kiss on the forehead as his first goal of the game . My ball: Garay (left) Rojo (right) challenge Nigeria's forward Peter Odemwingie . So far, though, Argentina always seem to have an answer, their winner coming from a Ezequiel Lavezzi corner three minutes later. Ezequiel Garay got the flick on, with Rojo scoring off his thigh from close range. Musa, excellent here on Wednesday, would almost hit back for Nigeria, Pablo Zabaleta denying him his hat-trick with a goalline block. But in the end it did not prove too costly, Bosnia’s defeat of Iran meaning both these teams go through. All arms and legs: Vincent Enyeama does his best to stop a Higuain strike .

Bulimia, when someone tries to control their weight by binge eating and then deliberately being sick or using laxatives (medication to help empty their bowels) Binge eating, when someone feels compelled to overeatCauses of eating disordersEating disorders are often blamed on the social pressure to be thin, as young people in particular feel they should look a certain way. However, the causes are usually more complex. There may be some biological or influencing factors, combined with an experience that may provoke the disorder, plus other factors that encourage the condition to continue. Risk factors that can make someone more likely to have an eating disorder include: . If you or someone you love is suffering from an eating disorder, speak to your GP and visit support websites such as b-eat, eating-disorders, or the National Eating Disorder Association.","Jay Taylor, 24, died at home in Walker, Newcastle, on Monday .

"David Cameron is to force a major showdown with German leader Angela Merkel this week after claims that the man set to become the European Union’s most powerful politician is a ‘drunk who has cognac for breakfast’. He is to use a summit at Ypres to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First World War to try to stop Mrs Merkel’s ally, Jean-Claude Juncker, becoming President of the EU Commission. The Prime Minister’s tough stance comes amid new claims that Mr Juncker is unfit for the job because of his alleged ‘boozing’. 'Wrong man for the job': Jean-Claude Juncker tucks into his food - and wine - at a European finance ministers' meeting in 2011. A senior diplomatic source claims Mr Juncker 'reportedly has cognac for breakfast' ‘Most European leaders privately admit Juncker is the wrong man for the job,’ said a senior British source. ‘But they have given in to the Germans. Let them vote for him in public so we know who to blame when he makes a mess of it.’ The Prime Minister believes arch pro-European Mr Juncker will sabotage his bid to reform the EU, but is resigned to losing after France’s Francois Hollande and other Left-wing leaders backed him yesterday. Mr Cameron has warned that  if Mr Juncker gets the job, the UK will be more likely to vote to leave the EU. Senior Tory MPs backed their leader yesterday after a Mail on Sunday investigation uncovered a number of fresh reports about his drinking: . An EU envoy told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Juncker and his boozing is the worst-kept secret in Brussels. He is politically and personally unsuited to run the EU.’ His supporters, however, claim he is the victim of a dirty-tricks campaign. One said: ‘He has a proven track record in taking tough decisions.’ Mr Juncker’s father was injured fighting for Hitler, something he cites as one of  the reasons for his belief in the EU. He speaks fluent German, though his mother tongue is Luxembourgish. Both are official languages of his home country, as is French. Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine said: ‘The more often Juncker’s name is dropped, the more the question arises whether he would be sturdy enough for the office of President. Long-time companions report of human weaknesses almost unknown to a broader public.’ His drinking was ‘an open secret’ in Luxembourg, it said, claiming Juncker had ‘drunk too much for years’. The article even suggested he drank in secret, but would be unable to do so once he was  EU President. ‘He worked until official events were over and the doors closed behind him. Retreating from time to time would no longer be possible in his new top job in Brussels.’ Talking with Cameron in 2012: The Prime Minister believes arch pro-European Mr Juncker will sabotage his bid for EU reform, but is resigned to losing after Francois Hollande and other Left-wing leaders backed him . Claims about Juncker’s drinking first surfaced publicly last year following a Luxembourg spy controversy that saw him forced to resign as the country’s prime minister. A leaked report by former intelligence agent Andre Kemmer described a meeting he attended with Juncker and Marco Mille, the former boss  of the country’s intelligence agency SREL. Kemmer wrote: ‘Towards the evening, we . met in [Juncker’s] office… It had a smell of stale tobacco and there was . an ominous note of alcohol in the air. Half staggering, he came up from . behind his desk… Juncker was blind drunk. He ordered two espressos for . himself and asked us to take a seat. ‘Without any introduction, he started to lay into Mille. “I f*** where, who, and when I want – do you get me? You could f*** too, but you can’t even do that – your German correctness…won’t allow you to.”’ (It is thought that in this context, the f-word was used to indicate he was prepared to treat someone unfairly, rather than it having a sexual connotation.) Kemmer’s report continued: ‘For around five minutes, Juncker continued his diatribe against Mille, which I do not want to describe in more detail for moral reasons.’ Mr Juncker’s drinking has been questioned by Holland’s Jeroen Dijsselbloem, his successor as chairman of the  so-called Eurogroup – an informal body of EU finance ministers. Asked if smoking and drinking were allowed at Eurogroup meetings, Dijsselbloem replied: ‘It has always been prohibited. Only the former chairman did not abide by  it.’ Juncker was ‘a stubborn smoker and drinker’, he said. A furious Mr Juncker hit back: ‘I have no problems with drink, that’s enough! Leave me alone with allegations that are not true. I have no health problems. I find it offensive having to deal constantly with rumours about me.’ Britain’s Financial Times  said of Mr Junker: ‘The booze has always been a subject of Brussels gossip. He has proved his ability to sit through all-night Brussels haggling sessions, fortified by brandy and cigarettes.’ The newspaper joked: ‘Perhaps the next EU President could have one of those slogans on the office wall – “You don’t have to be drunk to work here, but it helps.” ’ Last week, it stated: ‘It is a commonplace observation among diplomats that Juncker drinks too much. He is the wrong choice.’ Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘Mr Juncker appears to  be drunk on power, or the prospect of power. We all knew Mr Juncker was on the gravy train; now it appears he is on the sauce as well.’ A spokesman for Mr Juncker said: ‘He will not engage on these topics.’ Additional reporting:  Peter Allen in Paris .","PM to use Ypres summit for last-ditch bid to block Jean-Claude Juncker .

"Hospitals across the country have been warned by the CDC about care methods regarding the Ebola virus, it has emerged. The  CDC has published both an 'Algorithm for Evaluation of the Returned Traveler,' as well as a 'Checklist for Patients Being Evaluated for Ebola Virus Diseasee (EVD) in the United States.' Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan arrived in Dallas on September 20 to visit and fell ill a few days later. His sister, Mai Wureh, identified him as the infected man in an interview with The Associated Press. Patient: Thomas Eric Duncan (right) arrived in Dallas on Sept. 20 to visit and fell ill a few days later . Guidelines: The CDC published an algorithm about care methods regarding the Ebola virus . Precautions: The CDC also published a checklist to help . A Dallas emergency room sent Duncan home last week, even though he told a nurse that he had been in disease-ravaged West Africa. However, he claimed he hasn't been around anyone who had been sick - despite riding in a taxi with a woman who later died of Ebola. The decision by Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to release him could have put others at risk of exposure to Ebola before he went back to the ER a couple of days later when his condition worsened. The man has been kept in isolation at the hospital since Sunday. He was listed Thursday in serious but stable condition. Liberia is one of the three countries hit hardest in the epidemic, along with Sierra Leone and Guinea. The hospital told CNN in a statement 'At that time, the patient presented with low-grade fever and abdominal pain. His condition did not warrant admission. He also was not exhibiting symptoms specific to Ebola.' 'The hospital followed all suggested CDC protocols at that time,' the hospital also said. 'Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas' staff is thoroughly trained in infection control procedures and protocols.' Neighbors in the Liberian capital believe Duncan become infected when he helped bundle a sick pregnant neighbor into a taxi a few weeks ago and set off with her to find treatment. However, it was not clear whether he had learned of the woman's diagnosis before traveling. The case has raised questions about whether a disease that has killed 3,300 people in West Africa could spread in the United States. U.S. health officials say they remain confident they can keep it in check. Danger: The Ebola virus has already killed over 3,000 people in West Africa . Four members of a family Duncan was staying with were confined to their Texas home under armed guard Thursday as the circle of people possibly exposed to the virus widened, while Liberian authorities said they would prosecute the man for allegedly lying on an airport questionnaire. The unusual confinement order was imposed after the family failed to comply with a request not to leave their apartment, according to Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins. Texas State Health Commissioner David Lakey said the order would help ensure the four can be closely watched, including checking them for fevers over the next three weeks. 'We didn't have the confidence we would have been able to monitor them the way that we needed to,' he said. The family will not be allowed to receive visitors, officials said. Authorities were also concerned about the cleanliness of the home and hired a cleaning service, Lakey said. 'The house conditions need to be improved,' he said. A woman who lives in the apartment, Louise Troh, said she has been quarantined with her 13-year-old son and two nephews. 'Who wants to be locked up?' she said in an interview with The Associated Press. Troh said she was waiting for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect a bag of the bed sheets and towels Duncan used. Visitors from the American Red Cross were seen Thursday bringing food to the apartment door. The North Texas Food Bank said it sent three days of cereal, tuna, produce and other supplies. Outside the apartment, the management of the 300-unit complex in northeast Dallas was passing out flyers about Ebola to neighbors. Private security guards and local sheriff's deputies blocked off the entrance to dozens of reporters. Casualties: Deaths related to the Ebola virus have mainly been seen in Liberia . Form: Duncan filled out a series of questions about his health and activities before leaving on his journey to Dallas. On a Sept. 19 form, he answered no to all of them . Apartment manager Sally Nuran said employees were power-washing sidewalks and scrubbing common areas, though she believed Duncan had not visited most of the complex in his short time there. Elsewhere, Texas health officials expanded their efforts to contain the virus, reaching out to as many as 100 people who may have had direct contact with Duncan or someone close to him. None of the people is showing symptoms, but public-health officials have educated them about Ebola and told them to notify medical workers if they begin to feel ill, Erikka Neroes, a spokeswoman for the Dallas County Health and Human Services agency, said Thursday. The group will be monitored to see if anyone seeks medical care during the three weeks immediately following the time of contact, Neroes said. The at-risk group includes 12 to 18 who came in direct contact with the infected man, including an ambulance crew and a handful of schoolchildren, plus others known to have had contact with them, she said. 'This is a big spider web' of people involved, Neroes said. The virus that causes Ebola is not airborne and can only be spread through close contact with someone who has symptoms. People must come into direct contact with the patient's bodily fluids - blood, sweat, vomit, feces, urine, saliva or semen - and those fluids must have an entry point. Ebola dried on surfaces can survive for several hours, according to the CDC. For example, people might get infected by handling soiled clothing or bed sheets and then touching their nose, mouth or eyes, or if they are not wearing gloves while doing those tasks and have a cut on their hand. 'If you sit next to someone on the bus, you're not exposed,' CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said. In Liberia, authorities announced plans to prosecute Duncan, alleging that he lied on a form about not having any contact with an infected person. Duncan filled out a series of questions about his health and activities before leaving on his journey to Dallas. On a Sept. 19 form obtained by The Associated Press, he answered no to all of them. Among other questions, the form asked whether Duncan had cared for an Ebola patient or touched the body of anyone who had died in an area affected by Ebola. 'We expect people to do the honorable thing,' said Binyah Kesselly, chairman of the board of directors of the Liberia Airport Authority in Monrovia.","Hospitals across the country have been warned by the CDC about care methods regarding the Ebola virus .

"Whoopi Goldberg is rising to Bill Cosby's defense as claims he raped more than a dozen women begin to mount. The View star expressed skepticism today about allegations by Barbara Bowman that the 77-year-old comedian drugged and sexually assaulted her in 1985. Ms Bowman said that she went to a lawyer, who laughed at her when she tried to say that Cosby had sexually assaulted her multiple times when she was an aspiring actress and model. Goldberg asked why Ms Bowman didn't go to the authorities for proof that she was raped. Scroll down for video . Whoopi Goldberg expressed skepticism of rape claims against Bill Cosby and wondered why accuser Barbara Bowman never went to the police . 'Perhaps the police might have believed it. Or the hospital. Don't you do a kit when you say someone has raped you?' she asked. 'But there was a settlement,' co-host Rosie O'Donnell said, referring to a suit brought by another woman, Andrea Costand, in 2006. 'So that's the thing that's curious.' Ms Bowman said she didn't tell anyone, including the police, about the alleged sexual assault for years because she believed that Cosby was too famous and too powerful for anyone to take her seriously. She said she couldn't even tell her mother about what allegedly happened. Last month, she told MailOnline in excruciating detail how Cosby allegedly drugged her after he went to his New York home and had a single glass of wine as an impressionable 17-year-old in 1985. She passed out and came to wearing only a man's t-shirt and her underwear, certain that she had been sexually assaulted. She claimed he also pinned her down and tried to rape her in his hotel suite in Atlantic City in 1987. She also said she has never asked for, nor taken money from Cosby. CelebrityNetWorth.com pegs the former 'Cosby Show' actor's wealth at $400million. Cosby, 77, has stayed literally silent about the allegations - refusing to even speak when asked about them on NPR over the weekend . Barbara Bowman told MailOnline in excruciating detail how she was allegedly drugged and assaulted by Bill Cosby as a teenage model nearly 30 years ago . Goldberg said she doesn't buy the story: 'Quite honestly, look, I'm sorry, having been on both sides of this where people allege that you do something - it doesn't matter now. The cat is out of the bag, people have it in their head. I have a lot of questions for the lady, maybe she'll come on.' In November 2006, Bill Cosby settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who claimed he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Her lawyers said they had the names of 13 other women who had come forward voluntarily with similar accounts of drugging or abuse at the hands of Cosby - but the settlement was reached before the other women could testify. Last month, Barbara Bowman revealed to MailOnline that she had been drugged and raped by Cosby in 1985, when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. She was one of the 13 women willing to support Constand in 2006. Joan Tarshis has become the latest woman to accuse him of raping her. On Sunday, she revealed she was working as a writer for Cosby in 1969, when he drugged and sexually abused her on two occasions, she said. She appeared to sympathize with Cosby, saying it was 'awkward' when celebrities were falsely accused of crimes. 'I hope that there is justice for this lady. I hope somebody gets to the bottom of this, but I’m going to reserve my judgment because I have a lot of questions, as I said. It’s crazy, but I have a lot of questions, because I know we all have friends who have gone through this.' Co-host Nicolle Wallace responded to Goldberg: 'It’s more than awkward, it’s a tragedy!' 'Either 13 women were raped by someone too powerful to face the criminal justice system or an innocent man is being falsely accused.' Thirteen women signed on to a 2005 lawsuit brought by Andrea Constand alleging sexual assault. Ms Bowman said she testified as part of that lawsuit but never received a payout after Cosby settled out of court. Cosby's lawyer has denied the new round of claims and has said that the 77-year-old wouldn't 'dignify' the claims with a response. When asked by NPR over the weekend, Cosby smiled and refused to respond. Cosby has never been charged with any crime relating to the allegations now swirling around him. Goldberg said she is not convinced by the claims against Cosby. And the fact that he settled a 2005 lawsuit brought by another sex assault accuser, should not be seen as an admission of guilt. 'You have to really take a minute and follow the evidence - follow what happened,' she said. 'We'll know when we know. That's what I know.'","Whoopi Goldberg wondered on 'The View' why Cosby accuser Barbara Bowman never went to the police .

"Heroic: Aaron Edson, 37, rushed to the rescue of his five-year-old stepdaughter in Sandy, Utah, in the early hours of yesterday morning . This is the heroic step-father who rescued his five-year-old daughter from the clutches of a brazen kidnapper who snatched her from her own bed in the middle of the night. Aaron Edson, 37, awoke to find Troy Morley, 46, carrying his daughter across his front lawn at 4:30 yesterday morning in quiet Sandy, Utah, police say. 'What are you doing, that’s my daughter, you’re not taking her!' the father screamed. Morley, who is 5-foot-11 and 250lbs, put the girl down without struggle. He fled and was eventually caught in another house after a police dog subdued him. On Friday night, the 911 call made by the girl's mother was released by KSL.com. In the footage, Edson's wife, Stephanie, can be heard telling the dispatcher: 'There was a man in my home and he took my five-year-old daughter. 'And I happened to wake up and he had my daughter outside, and my husband ran out there and got him. But he took my five-year-old daughter.' The family say that they've never seen Morley before and they have no idea what he planned to do with the little girl if he had escaped with her. Edson's identity was revealed yesterday when a family spokesman praised his quick action and said the family were seconds from losing the daughter. Miles Holman, a local attorney, told MailOnline: 'Fifteen seconds later, the guy would have been 50 yards outside the house, he would have been gone.' 'I've been calling it a miracle. Nobody around Sandy expects anything like this - it is a quiet, middle-class neighborhood, not a dangerous place to live'. He also said that the family is now fine, despite their 'very traumatic day'. The nightmare incident evoked the 2002 abduction of 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart, snatched from her bedroom in Salt Lake City. She was held captive for nine months by Mormon street preacher Brian David Mitchell before she was found and rescued. Scroll down for video . Home safe and sound: The five-year-old victim of an attempted kidnapping rests safely with her mother after a home intruder snatched her out of her bed Friday morning . Troy Morley, 46, is seen here being led in the jail after he was released from the hospital Friday afternoon. He was bitten on the shoulder by a police dog before his arrest . Police say Morley had been wandering through the neighborhood trying to find open doors and windows to break into a home. He entered the house through an unlocked side door . The suspect in this case entered the home through an unlocked side door in the middle-class suburb south of Salt Lake City, Police Sergeant Dean Carriger said. He was in the family's basement rummaging through their belongings  when he came upon the girl sleeping in her bedroom, Carriger said. The suspect took her out of bed and carried her upstairs. The father told police that he awoke to the sound of creaking stairs and the front door being unlocked and opened. Neighbors told the Deseret News that they heard the girl screaming 'No! No! No!' as Morley tried to carry her away. After Morley fled, officers set up a perimeter, and with the help of police dogs, launched a search. The suspect went into a second home, where the residents heard him and called police. Police captured Morley, shirtless, outside that second home thanks to a police dog that bit the suspect in the upper shoulder, Carriger said. Police don't know yet why the suspect was in the house, whether he knew the girl was there when he broke in or if he had a planned to take her, Carriger said. Morley's last known address was in Roy, Utah, 45 miles north of Sandy. He has two two drunk driving arrests from 2009 and 2011 but no other significant Utah criminal history, the Deseret News reports. He has been through two divorces in the last four years - once in 2010 and the second was finalized just last month after he filed for divorce in June.

Morley was taken to hospital to be treated for dog bites, and has now been booked into the Salt Lake County jail for  investigation of child kidnapping, burglary, trespassing, interfering with an arrest and failing to stop at the command of a law enforcement officer. Carriger said the family is doing pretty well considering what happened. They have declined to speak to reporters. 'It obviously was a very scary, traumatic situation,' Carriger said. 'The sanctity of our home is huge and for somebody to enter that and grab your child, it's got to be one of the worst nightmares a parent could face. . .

"A champion boxer faces 26 years in prison after prosecutors charged him with allegedly shooting his cousin at his Arkansas home in August. Jermain Taylor, 36, faces charges of first-degree battery and first-degree terroristic threatening after police say he opened fire on Tyrone DaWayne Hinton on August 26 - wounding his 41-year-old relative.

"Katie Couric has launched a bitter attack on her former employers at CBS and claimed that she felt ‘liberated’ after leaving the TV network. In an interview Couric said that bosses made her five years working for the company a misery because they were ‘projecting their own issues onto me’. She said that anchoring CBS Evening News left her feel ‘constrained’ and that only by biting her her tongue and just getting on with it could she deal with the poisonous atmosphere. Projecting: In an interview, Couric said that bosses made her five years working for the company a misery because they were 'projecting their own issues onto me' Couric’s comments are a rare glance behind her steely and well maintained public image and give a revealing insight into how angry she feels at her treatment. She is also the second prominent female TV personality to speak out after former Today show anchor Ann Curry claimed NBC fired her because of her bad fashion sense. Couric - who has now moved to rival broadcaster ABC - left CBS last year having hosted its Evening News and hosted current affairs programme 60 Minutes since 2006. She was the first woman to anchor a network TV news show in America having taken over from Bob Schieffer. But after poor ratings - the show remained in third place behind evening news programmes on NBC and ABC - meant that behind the scenes there was on-going turmoil that left her feeling unwelcome. Even her controversial $15m a year salary which was blamed for forcing out a slew of CBS workers did not mollify the abuse. Hard work: Couric, pictured in 2010, spent five years as the CBS Evening News Anchor and Managing Editor . Light reading: Couric posted this picture of her reading her cover story on Instigram . September issue: The interview appears in the September 2012 issue of Good Housekeeping . Speaking to Good Housekeeping for their September issue, Couric said that since leaving she has been far more relaxed and that not having to put on makeup every day is a ‘Godsend’. She has also been using the time to ‘recalibrate’ and ‘re-evaluate’ her life and find more of a balance from her ‘overscheduled’ days. But turning to her former bosses at CBS, she said: ‘I’m really proud of the work I did. I had an ultimate sense of satisfaction but I was not ambivalent about feeling this wasn’t the place for me for the rest of my career. ‘It wasn’t the right environment for me. In terms of the atmosphere, it wasn’t a good fit for my sensibilities and my personality. 'I'm not a quitter. There were times when I thought to myself, Gee do I need this? ‘But I thought, you know what? I can do this job as well as anyone. ‘If people are projecting their own issues onto me, that's not my problem. I resolved to do the best job I could and focus on the business at hand'. CBS Evening News under Couric was critically acclaimed and won a string of awards including four Emmys, two Edward R Murrow Awards for Best Newscast, the George Polk Award and the Walter Cronkite Award. Anchoring: The newscaster also anchored NBC's Today Show . In particular her interview in 2008 with Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin became an instant classic when the Alaska governor made a series of embarrassing gaffes. Same story: Couric's problems mirror those of Curry, 55, who was replaced by Savannah Guthrie, 40, after just one year as co-anchor on Today . She also asked New York Yankees baseball icon Alex Rodriguez if he had even taken steroids which he denied, though later admitted he had in fact done so. Couric, 55, is able to criticise CBS because she has now moved to ABC, which is reportedly paying her $40m a year. She is a special correspondent for network and filled in for Robin Roberts on Good Morning America when she was on holiday, helping it to beat Today in the ratings for the first time in 16 years. The mother of two is also set to host her own daytime talk show on ABC, called ‘Katie’, which will start later this year. Couric’s problems mirror those of Curry, 55, who was replaced by Savannah Guthrie, 40, after just one year as co-anchor on Today. In an interview with Ladies Home Journal the former foreign correspondent, who is remaining with NBC and making a return to hard news, claimed that she was fired because executives did not like her fashion sense. She said: ‘One day I wore a multi-coloured dress and someone asked if I was trying to be Toucan Sam. ‘But I chose it because I thought, this will perk up America. ‘I’m encouraged by my bosses to wear these ridiculously high heel shoes because women say: ‘I love your shoes!’ So if it makes women happy, I’ll wear them. But I’m still going to be me’. Following publication of the interview Curry has reportedly been told by NBC to watch what she says in future.","Longtime CBS Evening News anchor spoke out about former employer .

"Golf's bad boy Dustin Johnson and his fiance Paulina Gretzky have had their first child, it was reported today. Paulina Gretzky - the daughter of NHL legend Wayne - gave birth to a boy on Monday just outside Los Angeles. However, the child's name is yet to be revealed, with the only detail known being that it starts with a 'T', it was reported by TMZ. It comes as 30-year-old Johnson hit back at claims he was twice suspended from golf for cocaine abuse and said he is turning over a new leaf. It was previously claimed the couple's baby was due next month after Paulina revealed on Christmas Day on her Instagram that she was having a boy. Scroll down for video . Paulina Gretzky announced over Christmas that she and fiance Dustin Johnson (left) were having a baby boy . Back in action: Dustin Johnson has been on an inexplicable five-month hiatus from the PGA Tour after he was rumored to have been suspended over drug use - something he denies . Johnson gave an extended interview to Golf.com in which he admitted he's working to clean up his act and 'simplify' his life since leaving the PGA Tour five months ago. He says he's been spending a great deal of time with Paulina's father - NHL legend Wayne Gretzky - who lives just half a mile down the road from Johnson's home on the Sherwood Country Club. Gretzky has been coaching Johnson, a kid from a divorced family in South Carolina, on how to cope with his fame and fortune - he's made more than $25million off PGA Tour wins alone. Golf.com previously reported that Johnson was disciplined three times by the PGA - twice for testing positive for cocaine and once for marijuana. The site reported that he is serving a six-month suspension from the PGA Tour as a result of his last drug test. When asked about the allegations, Johnson flatly denied them. 'I did not have a problem. It’s just something I’m not going to get into. I have issues. But that’s not the issue,' he said.

The talented golfer also denied reports that he had been to rehab - saying he hired a 'life coach' and a team of clinicians to hep him 'simplify' his life. However, he said he never underwent treatment for any addiction. Johnson revealed he's abstained from booze for January - ponying up $1,000 with Wayne Gretzky and several friends from the Sherwood Country Club as part of a bet to stay off alcohol for a month. He claims he's also selling his two Jet Skis, one of his boats and his $300,000 Aston Martin. He gave his souped-up 1976 Pontiac to his brother - all in an attempt to rid himself of distractions. Johnson says he plans to end his golf hiatus and return to the PGA Tour either at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, California, on February 5, or the following week at Pebble Beach.","Golf bad boy Dustin Johnson's fiance has given birth to a baby boy .

"A $5million order for custom crystal glasses and bar accessories was placed for American embassies on the day before the government shutdown. The State Department finalized the order for custom stemware on September 30, just hours before nearly one million federal workers were put on unpaid leave as a result of the on-going budget dispute in Congress. The contract was awarded to Simon Pearce, a Vermont stemware company that makes hand blown crystal that retails for up to $85-per-wine glass. Serving up contracts: A Vermont-based company called Simon Pearce was awarded a $5million State Department contract to produce stemware for American embassies and consulates . The order calls for more than 12,000 pieces of 20 different styles. 'We’re thrilled with the contract and will take great pride in having Vermont product in the hands of people around the world,' Simon Pearce CEO Clay Adams told the Valley News. Another stipulation of the order is that all of the crystal be made in the United States with the majority of the collection being made in the company's factory in Quechee, Vermont. 'Simon Pearce is a natural fit for this given its production in Vermont and Maryland,' Mr Adams said in a statement. Table diplomacy: American embassies host major political dinners and functions, like this one attended by then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in Tel Aviv in 2007 . The timing of the contract is problematic for the department as the GSA, which is the government body that handles the pricing out and awarding of contracts to small businesses, notes that the contract was finalized on September 25 and posted on the 30th. Pricey: This particular style of white wine glass sells for $85-per-glass . While this year's budget battle is unusual given the shutdown, it is not uncommon for ornamental orders to be placed during the last week of September because if it is not ordered before the cut-off, they will have to wait another fiscal year to do so, when more pressing items like paychecks and security costs take precedent. The State Department was far from the only offender during this year's so-called 'use it or lose it' week, as The Washington Post reports that the Department of Veterans Affairs spent more than a half a million dollars on artwork. The Coast Guard spent $178,000 repairing cubicle furniture, and the Department of Agriculture blew six figures on toner cartridges. This is the first time that Simon Pearce is the recipient of such an order, but that should also come as little surprise considering it had a well-connected friend vying for them. Senator Patrick Leahy, who represents Vermont, is the head of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees State Department funding, meaning that he was in a unique position to push for his local company. His pleas didn't fall on unfamiliar ears either, as Secretary of State John Kerry is from nearby Massachusetts. 'It is wonderful to have such an exquisite example of Vermont craftsmanship on display and in use in our embassies around the world,' Senator Leahy said in a statement. 'Marcelle [his wife] and I have visited many of those embassies, and knowing that Simon Pearce’s products will be there is something that all Vermonters should be proud of.'","Vermont-based crystal company Simon Pearce commissioned to make 12,000 pieces for American embassies .

"The model accused of bringing down Clippers boss Donald Sterling earned a living as a stripper, her former high school teacher has claimed. And V Stiviano – the girl at the center of a race scandal that has rocked the NBA this week – even bragged to football coach Javier Cid that she'd had a boob job aged just 17. Stiviano – who went by the name Vanessa Perez at Roosevelt High School in Los Angeles – was also nicknamed 'Barbie' by other students because she dressed flamboyantly in expensive clothes. Scroll down for video . Dark lady: V.Stiviano continues her bizarre parade in front of the cameras wearing her trademark visor on a trip to eat sushi in Los Angeles on Thursday night . Swelling with pride: Stiviano was 17 when she went running up to her high school's football coach and exclaimed 'Coach Cid, coach Cid, I've got my boobs done', he told MailOnline . Bling: Her high school teacher claimed that she rolled into high school in 2007 in a Range Rover which got tongues wagging . She later rolled through the school gates in a Range Rover – a lifestyle Mr Cid believes she paid for through her job as a pole-dancer. This comes as it emerged the 31-year-old's mentor is a notorious sex author who wrote a book called The Vixen Manual: How to Find, Seduce & Keep the Man You Want. Stiviano is close pals with Karrine Steffans, a former stripper who has also modeled in dozens of hip-hop music videos. She also revealed to Oprah Winfrey how she was sexually exploited to get roles in the videos. Steffans also briefly gained notoriety in the hip-hop world more recently for posting a picture to Instagram of her performing a sex act. Stiviano regularly gets Steffans tickets to Clippers games and the two often exchange messages on Instagram and post photos of them posing together. Stiviano's former teacher believes she was always destined to lead an extravagant lifestyle. Mr Cid said: 'Vanessa was a very confident, bold, outgoing girl. She'd roll in to school wearing $800 jeans. 'I always thought she was smart and very mature for her age and that she was just really into fashion and expensive things, maybe even borderline materialistic. 'But after she graduated I heard she had been working as a stripper and it all made total sense. 'She wasn't from a wealthy family and she was very independent, she made her own decisions in life.' Stiviano's lawyer Mac Nehoray denied his client was ever a stripper. Video courtesy of Extra TV . High life: Stiviano's former teacher, Javier Cid, pictured left and right, believes she was always destined to lead an extravagant lifestyle . From high school to the high life: Stiviano went to Roosevelt High School in east LA. Cid told MailOnline: 'After she graduated I heard she had been working as a stripper and it all made total sense. She wasn't from a wealthy family and she was very independent, she made her own decisions in life' He told MailOnline: 'That's not true. We vehemently deny that she ever worked as a stripper.' The teacher, who is 16 years V's senior, said he was most shocked when his former student told him she had had a breast augmentation when she was just 17. He said: 'I remember she told me she was thinking about having one done. Then a few months later I was talking to another teacher and Vanessa comes running over, she was like ""Coach Cid, coach Cid, I've got my boobs done."" 'I was very surprised, it was a little awkward. It's not the kind of thing you expect to hear from a female student.' The teacher of 24 years at the school in East Los Angeles' Boyle Heights said Stiviano was in his civics and economics class in her senior year. He said she dreamed of being a model and was interested in the media. 'Boyle Heights is not very far from Hollywood and she was affected by that, she was a young girl growing up, who wouldn't want to be an actress or a model,' he said. 'She wanted to be famous and I'm sure there's a lots of people who would want to be in her shoes with the life she lives now.' The teacher says that after seeing recent photos of Stiviano – snaps posted on her Instagram that emerged once the Clippers race scandal erupted - he was shocked by how much her appearance has changed since High School. Envious: Cid said that many people would want to be in Stiviano's shoes having seen the money and fame she achieved. Here she is pictured yesterday with a friend in the Ferrari bought for her by Sterling . Playful: Stiviano threatened to put icing on her 80-year-old lover's face at the party which was held in the Staples Center where the LA Clippers play their home games. Not long after a tape she recorded with Donald Sterling brought him down . Old and slow: Stiviano added to her performance in front of the photographers by taking her 'pet turtle' for a walk - was it a dig at 80-year-old Donald Sterling? Once a gold digger...: Cid said, 'She wouldn't date anyone in school, she was into older guys with a nice car' 'She was always a pretty girl but her nose is totally different now to how it was when she was a teenager, maybe she has had a nose job. 'Vanessa was certainly a very image conscious girl, the other kids would call her Barbie girl, she was that type, someone that wants to have the big car, the clothes, a nice house and designer clothes. 'She wore a lot of make-up and her image made her stand out, she liked being different. She was ahead of her time, very mature.' Despite her good looks at high school Stiviano didn't date any of the boys in the football team. Mr Cid added: 'She wouldn't date anyone in school, she was into older guys with a nice car, with money. I don't think Vanessa was hated, she got along with everyone, she was popular. 'She was a smart girl, spoke well and was eager about her future, I commend her for that.' Mr Cid said he last saw Stiviano at Roosevelt in 2007 when she came in to talk about her younger sister who wasn't doing well at school. By then Stiviano's wealth had grown substantially. 'She came in to see me and I asked her how she was, you know how she was getting on in life. 'I remember that she said: ""Oh, yeah, well I'm driving a Range Rover now."" I remember that very clearly. I said, ""Good for you.""' Mr Cid said he wished Stiviano all the best and said she had made a success of her life. He said: 'If you look at economics she has turned out to be very successful. If you look at the cars and the big house, she must have done something right. 'I can't say I have those things on a teacher's salary.' Friends: Stiviano, right, regularly gets Steffans, left, tickets to Clippers games and the two often exchange messages on Instagram and post photos of them posing together . Mentor: The 31-year-old's mentor Steffans, pictured far left and far right with Stiviano, is a notorious sex author who wrote a book called The Vixen Manual: How to Find, Seduce & Keep the Man You Want . 'She is a good communicator and can converse with sophisticated people she would have had to be like that to be able to hang out courtside with Clippers owner Don Sterling. She did not get by on her looks alone, she has a brain on her.' Meanwhile, Stiviano has been reeling from a number of sinister death threats made against her. Many of the threats have been made on social network sites. One chilling message posted on Twitter reads: 'V Stiviano gonna die in the next few weeks. Watch.' Another said: 'V Stiviano is a dumb ass B*tch ... She needs to die slow.' The brunette is believed to be seeing a counselor to help her deal with death threats – and the fallout from the scandal. She has scaled down her activities and aside from leaving her home in a red Ferrari yesterday to have her hair done – she has barely left her $1.8m luxury condo. Shaken Stiviano has also upped security at the plush duplex - on a quiet tree-line street near Beverley Hills - as a result of the threats. Yesterday there were several flag-posts on display on her front lawn - advertising that four different security companies were patrolling the property. A source said: 'V has been getting death threats and nasty messages ever since the racism tape came out. She is terrified so has hired security companies to patrol the home and even a bodyguard'. Brains and beauty: Cid said, 'She did not get by on her looks alone, she has a brain on her' Threats: According to unnamed sources Stiviano is now scared in the face of death threats made to her online . 'It's all started to take it's toll on her – she's too scared to answer her door and she has stopped going out as much as she used to – which is not like her. She's scared to leave home now.' Stiviano did not come outside when MailOnline called at her home - but instead choose to speak through the closed door. She said: 'I am making no comment, no statement, nothing.' Earlier this week, MailOnline revealed how Stiviano turned her back on her dirt-poor upbringing in San Antonio, Texas, where she was raised by a jobless Mexican mother convicted of using her own children to steal from a supermarket - to seek fame and fortune in Los Angeles. Once in LA she got herself noticed through modelling and has even been linked to Jerry Buss, the late owner of the LA Lakers and a pal of Sterling's. It also emerged that Stiviano, who was born Maria Perez, changed her name in 2010 in a bid to wipe out her past. Giving a reason for the name change Stivano claimed in the court papers she hadn't 'yet been fully accepted because of my race.' MailOnline has seen the documents but has chosen not to publish it due to its sensitive nature.","V Stiviano bragged to football coach Javier Cid that she'd had a boob job aged just 17, he says .

"The white supremacist accused of killing his 16-year-old baby sitter by giving her an overdose of heroin has been knifed by his own cellmate - who is a member of the same racist gang. Eric Millerberg, 37, was stabbed multiple times in his cell on Monday at the maximum security Uinta 2 prison and was treated at Utah State Prison and is expected to survive. Investigators strongly suspect Millerberg's fellow Silent Aryan Warriors cellmate is responsible for the attack as no one else had access according to a prison spokesman. Scary and unkempt: Eric Millerberg with his Death tattoo visible on the left side of his neck appears in court in April 2012 for his preliminary hearing . The Unified Police Department recovered a sharpened piece of metal believed to be the weapon from the cell and Millerberg is now back recovering at the prison infirmary where his condition is described as stable. Millerberg is charged with the death of Alexis Rasmussen and at his preliminary hearing last April, his wife, Dea Millerberg testified that her husband administered a fatal does of heroin and methamphetamine to the teen by injection in September 2011. Authorities say that when Rasmuseen died, the couple panicked and dumped her body in a remote part of Morgan County, Utah. The teens body was found five weeks after her disappearance. Dea Millerberg is also charged with desecration of a human body related to the 16-year-olds death. Eric Millerberg is awaiting the beginning of his trial on charges of first-degree felony child abuse homicide, obstruction of justice, desecration of a human body and having unlawful sexual activity with a minor. Last year, in April, it was revealed that Millerberg had altered a tattoo that once honored the wife who is now testifying against him. Instead of 'Dea', his tattoo now reads 'Death' - and it is unclear when he had the marking changed. Corrupted: Alexis Rasmussen, 16, reportedly asked the Millerbergs how to get meth and they started smoking the drug, along with heroin and marijuana, with the girl . Close up: Eric Millerberg appears before the Second District Court in Utah on Monday, April 9, with his changed tatoo 'Death' In April, his wife told a court in Utah that the couple . spent a weekend with the babysitter that involved drugs and sex. Alexis Rasmussen’s body was found near the Weber River in Morgan County in October 2011, about a month after her death. The couple got high and had oral sex with the teenage babysitter who died that night. Gang member Casey Peterson said Mr . Millerberg called himself a 'watcher of the flock' meaning that he felt . it important that he be the one to help teens do drugs 'so they wouldn't . go elsewhere and try it on their own'. Trouble: At the time of Alexis' death, Eric Millerberg was on parole for prior burglary and firearm charges, and he was also known to be part of the Silent Aryan Warriors, a white supremacist prison gang . Help: Police reportedly received a confidential tip about the whereabouts of Alexis' body by members of Eric Millerberg's gang . One of Alexis' friends, whose name was . not released, also testified in April last year that the two of them would go over to the . Millerberg's house to smoke drugs, and that the 36-year-old man was the . one to teach them how to smoke methamphetamine out of a light bulb. Peterson's statement, which was read . in court, confirmed the account of the night given by Mrs Millerberg, . saying that Alexis died in their home because of the drugs and they . could not revive her. The letter also detailed Mr . Millerberg's rehashing of he and his wife's sexual dalliances and drug . use with the teen prior to her death. 'I was paranoid and I did not want to be involved,' wrote Peterson, who is currently serving time for unknown charges. His motivation to help, however, was more personal: 'I have a 16-year-old daughter.' Peterson was not the only gang member . who found the Millerberg's behavior to be an affront, as Eric Smith has . been identified as the police informant who tipped them off to the . location of the body. Serious charges: Eric Millerberg, 36, is charged with far more involvement than his wife, and is said to be the one who actually killed the girl by injecting her with drugs . Dark side: During her testimony, Dea Millerberg said that Alexis asked the couple if she could have sex with them in August 2011- a month before she died- and also requested to be paid with meth instead of cash . 'I wanted the family to have closure,' Mr Smith said. 'Then again, they came at me and said they knew about my involvement in it and that they'd give me immunity if I helped them.' New details also painted a grizzly . picture of the body itself when it was finally found, as detective Mike . Tribe said that Alexis's corpse was found kneeling face down, covered in . brush in a rural part of Morgan County. He said that her neon toe nail polish, ankle bracelets and jawline helped identify her. Months . after the September 10 death of Alexis, the Millerbergs were charged . for their involvement in her death and Mrs Millerberg testified against . her husband in court on Monday after receiving immunity for any direct . involvement with the girl’s death. Mrs Millerberg faces one third-degree . felony charge relating to the disposal of Alexis’ body, but prosecutors . have called her overall involvement ‘minimal’ as compared to Mr . Millerberg’s, as he faces charges of child abuse homicide, unlawful sex . with a minor, the disposal of the body and obstruction of justice. The 39-year-old, who filed for . divorce from her husband after they were charged with the death of . Alexis, told the torrid story of how the couple befriended and corrupted . the young girl in the months leading up to her death. Mrs . Millerberg said that they started using Alexis- or Lexi as she called . her- as a babysitter for their two daughters in the spring of 2011. Accomplice: Dea Millerberg, seen here in an earlier court appearance in 2012, discussed how she helped her husband Eric dispose of Alexis Rasmussen's body . They . became friends and started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana with . the teen before Alexis began requesting that they try harder drugs like . methamphetamine and heroin. Eventually they even began paying Alexis with meth. One of their most raucous nights as a . group came in August, a month before her death, when Alexis reportedly . asked to become sexually involved with the married couple. 'Eric and I started kissing and having sex. Then Alexis jumped in,' Mrs Millerberg told the court. On . the fateful night of September 10th, the couple wanted Alexis to babysit . because they were going to go shopping for their daughter’s birthday. Neither babysitting nor shopping ended up happening. As . soon as Alexis arrived at the house, Mr Millerberg helped her get high . by injecting her with drugs- once with heroin and twice with meth- into . her arm and neck. Found: A full autopsy could not be performed because Alexis' body was so decomposed, but significant traces of heroin and meth were in her system . Then, . when she was ‘as high as she had ever been’, she and her husband . performed oral sex on one another. Mrs Millerberg says that she was not . involved in the encounter. A short while later, the drugs had a . negative effect on the teen and she started ‘freaking out’. She . reportedly felt disoriented and cold, so she asked if she could take a . warm bath in the couple’s master bathroom. After leaving her alone in the bath at . her request, the Millerbergs checked on her about 45 minutes later to . find that she was still cold, so Mrs Millerberg wrapped her in a blanket . and told her to lie down in another bedroom. The couple left her to go smoke some cigarettes, and returned about a half hour later to find her unresponsive. ‘She wasn't breathing. She had mucousy stuff coming out of the right side of her mouth,’ said Mrs Millerberg, who was a licensed nurse and tried to resuscitate the girl to no avail. They then tried to figure out what to do next. ‘It really was a panic. The idea of it was, we will lose our kids and go to jail, and there was nothing we could do to bring her back,’ she told the court. Mr Millerberg was on parole at the . time for prior burglary and firearm charges, and he was also known to be . part of the Silent Aryan Warriors, a white supremacist prison gang. Mrs . Millerberg, who also had outstanding court dates due to her involvement . with two unrelated prescription drug fraud and child endangerment . cases, says that she dressed the then-naked body of Alexis and put it . into a foot locker which the couple moved into a box in the trunk of . their car. Leaving their . 6-year-old daughter at home but taking their toddler with them, they . 'drove all over the place' disposing of any evidence that may connect . them to the crime. They . dumped her body in a remote area of Morgan County where Mr Millerberg . covered it with brush and shrubs so that it was hidden. Police only . found it six weeks after Alexis’ death with the help of a confidential . tip from Eric Smith, one of Mr Millerberg’s gang members. Moving . on to the remaining evidence, they left Alexis' purse in one dumpster . with the box that had held the body, then drove to a different dumpster . where they left the carpet from the car 'in case there was any evidence . on it'. Facing trial: Eric Millerberg is in prison awaiting trial and Dea Millerberg (right) is free on bail . Spot: The couple- along with their toddler- drove around extensively disposing of Alexis' body and all evidence. She was found here in Morgan County six weeks after her death . After filing for divorce from Mr Millerberg in February 2012, Mrs Millerberg is free on bail but police say that she will ‘not get a walk on all of (her) charges’.","Eric Millerberg, from Utah, a member of the Silent Arayan Warriors, was stabbed by a fellow gang-member and cellmate on Monday .

"The scheme is named after Clare Wood, 36, who was strangled and set on fire in 2009 by her ex-boyfriend who had a hidden history of abuse . Women have uncovered the abusive pasts of more than 1,300 partners under Clare's Law since it was introduced 12 months ago. The figures underline the shocking scale of abuse taking place behind closed doors across England and Wales. Police forces took action on more than one out of three occasions, passing on sensitive information 1,335 times out of 3,760 applications. Clare's Law was rolled out nationally in March last year, following a 14-month pilot in Gwent, Wiltshire, Nottinghamshire and Greater Manchester. It allows the police to disclose information about a partner's previous history of domestic violence or violent acts. The scheme is named after Clare Wood, 36, who was strangled and set on fire in 2009 by her ex-boyfriend who had a hidden history of abuse. Her father Michael Brown, 71, said he is 'quietly delighted' the law is being used, but fears the figures are only the 'tip of the iceberg'. He said: 'This is just people that are coming to the fore. This is only the tip of the iceberg. There's an awful lot of it not reported, people are frightened to come forward. 'We didn't have the lofty ambitions to do away with domestic violence – that would have been nonsensical. 'What we did was try to give ladies and gents who were in trouble another chink in their armour. I think we succeeded in that. 'This is just the start. This is what it is in just the first year, all these people know about Clare's Law, they're going to tell another five, another dozen, and next year this is going to snowball.' Michael Brown (second left), the father of murdered Clare Wood said he's 'quietly delighted' law is being used . Figures obtained under Freedom of Information laws revealed huge regional variations in the likelihood of information being released. Outside the four forces involved with the Clare's Law pilot, Lancashire had the highest number of disclosures at 146, while Norfolk had made five disclosures, the lowest level. Greater Manchester is the force most likely to reveal information, which it did in 60 per cent of cases, while in neighbouring Merseyside the figure is just 11 per cent. Miss Wood, 36, was strangled and set on fire by her ex-boyfriend George Appleton at her home in Salford, Greater Manchester. Appleton had a history of violence towards women and prowled dating websites, often using different aliases. He hanged himself six days later in a derelict pub. Other figures revealed the courts have granted 2,220 domestic violence protection orders, which can be used to protect victims. The orders were launched in the same month following a one-year pilot in West Mercia, Wiltshire and Greater Manchester. Salford and Eccles MP Hazel Blears, who campaigned for the law, said the figures show the scale of the threat of domestic violence. But she said she is concerned that the variations in disclosures suggest the law is being applied differently by forces. Last year, the police watchdog found thousands of domestic violence victims are being failed by police due to 'alarming and unacceptable weaknesses'. There were 269,700 domestic abuse-related crimes in England and Wales between 2012 and 2013, with 77 women killed by their partners or ex-partners in the same period. On average, the police receive an emergency call relating to domestic violence every 30 seconds and around 8 per cent of recorded crime is made up of abuse in the home. Polly Neate, of Women's Aid, said any woman who asks for help under Clare's Law should also be referred to support groups for help.","Clare's Law was rolled out in March last year following death of Clare Wood .

"The mother of a brain-dead pregnant . Fort Worth woman being kept alive by a ventilator has joined her . son-in-law's calls to end life support. Lynne . Machado says she was shocked to learn her state left the family . powerless to carry out their daughter Marlise Munoz's wish to never be . dependent on a ventilator because she is pregnant. Now Machado is lashing out against a Texas law she says has put her family through ‘pure hell.’ Tragedy: Erick found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor in late November. She'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain. She was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness . ‘The doctors told us that even if a pregnant woman has a DNR or a living will, the law supersedes that,’ Machado told NBC News. In Texas, doctors must take all life saving measures to preserve the life of an unborn baby. That’s even if, as in this case, the fetus is too immature to survive outside the mother. ‘My jaw hit the ground,’ said Machado, who hopes to go before the Texas legislature to petition them to change the law. It . was just the beginning of a hellish holiday season for Machado and her . family, one that began two days before Thanksgiving when Machado’s . son-in-law Erick Munoz found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor. Questions: In Texas, state law stipulates that, in cases of pregnant women, DNRs do not apply and all measures must be taken to save the life of the fetus. Meanwhile, it remains unclear how the fetus was affected when Marlise's brain was deprived of oxygen for an extended period . Normal heartbeat: For now, the baby in Marlise's womb has a normal heartbeat and could still potentially be carried to full term . Happier times: Erick Munoz (right, holding their 1-year-old son Mateo) says his wife Marlise (left) did not want to ever be kept alive with a machine. But because she is pregnant, Texas law requires she receive all life saving measures . Erick is a paramedic—as was . Marlise—and immediately performed CPR, but it was no use. At 14 weeks . pregnant with their second child, Marlise had been without oxygen for an . hour. ‘They did a CAT scan and an EEG and there was no brain activity,’ Machado said. ‘She was clinically declared brain dead. Marlise had suffered what was likely an embolism. She has been unconscious ever since and remains on a ventilator. Now 18 weeks into her pregnancy, the family has no idea whether the child sustained severe damage while deprived of oxygen. All they know is that they are powerless over their daughter’s fate or that of the unborn fetus. 'Knowing our daughter is not there, but her body is being kept alive, is hard to see,' Machado told CNN. Marlise must remain on life support until she miscarries the fetus or until the pregnancy reaches 24 weeks. ‘At that point they would decide . whether to start labor, do a C-section, or see if she could go to 34 or . 36 weeks when the fetus would be full term,’ Machado said. But . she and her family are horrified things even got this far. ‘No family . should have to go through this,’ she said. ‘It’s been pure hell.’ Neither . Machado nor her son-in-law have looked into hiring a lawyer and Machado . says it will be about a month before they know what the next step will . be. For now, the family is in total agreement. ‘I don't agree with this law,’ Erick Munoz told ABC News as he sadly browsed old photos of his wife and their 1-year-old son Mateo. Erick says he and his wife had seen enough in the line of duty to know what they would want in this situation. And this isn’t it. 'I don't agree with this law': Erick says he can't fulfill his promise to his wife because of the Texas law, which applies to all pregnant women, even those with do not resuscitate orders . 'We knew what her wishes were': Both Erick and Marlise were both paramedics. He found her collapsed on November 26 and initiated CPR, but it was no use. Erick says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they wouldn't want to be kept alive by machines . Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. ‘We . knew what her wishes were,’ Erick, who found his wife unconscious on . their kitchen floor and fought in vain to resuscitate her, told WFAA. Per Texas state law: ‘A person may . not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment under this subchapter . from a pregnant patient.’ The . couple had merely discussed their mutual desire to never be kept alive . by a machine and hadn’t actually signed a do not resuscitate order. But that wouldn’t have made a difference. Texas . gives rights to the unborn fetus over the mother’s wishes even when a . DNR has been signed, where the state’s form reads, ‘I understand under . Texas law this directive has no effect if I have been diagnosed as . pregnant.’ For now, doctors say the baby has a . normal heartbeat, though it remains unknown how it was affected when . Marlise’s brain was deprived of oxygen. ‘They . don't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen,’ Erick . told ABC. ‘But I'm aware what challenges I might face ahead.’ 'They don't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen,' Erick said . 'I'm aware what challenges I might face ahead': Though he doesn't agree with the laws, Erick says he's not interested in engaging in a long pro-life vs. pro-choice battle .","Erick Munoz of Fort Wort, Texas found his wife Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor on November 26 .

"It is one of Mexico's most active volcanoes and is aptly known as the 'Volcano of Fire'. But observers were still surprised this week when the Colima  peak erupted sending ash shooting 2.5 miles into the air. An amazing timelapse shows the unexpected eruption, captured by a camera set up to observe the volcano. The Colima volcano in western Mexico is one of the most active in the country . Located in the state of Colima, on Mexico's west coast, the volcano has long attracted geologists and scientists due to its constant rumblings. Each day, mini eruptions take place, sending small plumes of ash into the sky. However, this week's eruption is the largest in months. Volcano Disvoer reported a 'strong vulcanian-type explosion' at 9.15am local time on Wednesday. In its biggest eruption since last year, the volcano spewed an ash column 2.5 miles into the air . Volcanic matter rose more than 29,000ft into the air after the eruption in western Mexico . The mountain belched an ash column more than 2.5 miles above the summit, with volcanic matter rising to 29,000ft. The webcam focused on the active volcano captured the eruption perfectly as ash shot up into the blue skies above. The Colima volcano is located in the western Mexican Volcanic Belt and has had more than 30 periods of eruptions since 1585. The action was caught on camera by a webcam set up to monitor the volcano's activity . Ash fell on towns and villages as far as 15 miles away, but no properties were damaged . It had several significant eruptions in the late 1990s and continues to rumble on an almost daily basis. Towns and villages are located near to the skirts of the volcano, but despite ash falling as far as 15 miles away, no homes or properties were damaged. The footage was captured by a fixed camera set up by Webcams De Mexico after the last major eruptions in 2013 and 2014.","Colima volcano erupted at 9.15am local time on Wednesday .

"Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper has indefinitely delayed the execution of convicted killer Nathan Dunlap, saying that he had doubts about the death penalty, much to the dismay of victims' families and a furious district attorney. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, said he had . doubts about the fairness of Colorado's death penalty system and about . the state's ability to get the lethal drugs required for an execution. Dunlap, 38, is one of three men on the state's death row. He was sentenced to death in 1996, but the victims' families say they have been waiting for justice to be carried out for nearly 20 years. Write caption here . Dunlap has acknowledged fatally shooting four employees - three of them teenagers - who were cleaning a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant after hours in the Denver suburb of Aurora in Dec 1993 . Republicans have derided Hickenlooper's decision as no decision at all, with Attorney General John Suthers saying the reprieve guaranteed 'continued suffering and delayed justice' for families of Dunlap's victims. 'He took a coward's way out,' said Melinda Cromar, whose 19-year-old sister Sylvia Crowell was among those killed by Dunlap. 'I am just so angry.' A ‘very disappointed’ Bob Crowell, . whose 19-year-old daughter Sylvia was killed by Dunlap, said he didn't . think there would ever be total closure in the case, but believed the . execution could have demonstrated to other criminals that 'they will pay . the price with their lives if they perform an act like that in the . state of Colorado.' 'This whole scenario of having to . make us wait... it's like having a knife stuck in your back every time . somebody says or does something,' he told ABCNews.com. Dunlap's victims included Sylvia Crowell, 19, and Colleen O'Connor, 17 . Margaret Kohlberg, a 50-year-old mother, who was on her first day on the job when she was shot by Dunlap, as was Ben Grant, 17 . 'Today was the trump of all of that when the governor refused to carry out the execution, or refused to let it happen.' 'The majority of the families really did . feel that they would get closure from an execution. There were some . that expressed gratitude and even some form of relief, [but] I think the . majority were disappointed,' Hickenlooper said at a news conference. Dunlap, 38, was convicted and sentenced to die in 1996 for the ambush slayings of Crowell and three others in a Denver-area restaurant. Hickenlooper's action essentially guarantees Dunlap will survive through Jan. 13, 2015, the last day of Hickenlooper's first term. Hickenlooper plans to run for re-election, and the reprieve is sure to be a campaign issue. Dunlap, whose execution was scheduled for the week of Aug. 18, had requested clemency, which would have removed the possibility of execution and changed his sentence to life without parole. Dunlap could conceivably be executed one day if a Colorado governor lifts the reprieve. One victim was down on her knees and begging for her life when Nathan Dunlap shot her in 1993 . Nathan Dunlap, left earlier this year and, right, listening to pre-trial motions in his murder trial in Colorado Springs in 1996 . Hickenlooper's announcement frustrated and angered the current top prosecutor in the district where Dunlap was convicted. 'He could have made a decision I disagreed with. He could have made a decision I agreed with. But to not make a decision is an injustice,' District Attorney George Brauchler said. 'One person will go to bed with a smile on his face, and that's Nathan Dunlap, and that's due to one person,' Brauchler said. Madeline Cohen, one of Dunlap's attorneys, expressed relief. 'I'm very, very glad that the governor has decided not to go forward and has recognized how many problems there are in the system,' she said. Hickenlooper said he considered the decision carefully. A 'very disappointed' Bob Crowell, whose 19-year-old daughter Sylvia was killed by Dunlap, said he didn't think there would ever be total closure in the case . Hickenlooper's announcement frustrated and angered District Attorney George Brauchler, right, the current top prosecutor in the district where Dunlap was convicted . 'We heard a variety of sides and obviously this has weighed heavily on me for well over a year now,' he said at a news conference. Dunlap has acknowledged fatally shooting four employees - three of them teenagers - who were cleaning a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant after hours in the Denver suburb of Aurora. Dunlap, then 19, had recently lost a job there as a cook. On the night of Dec. 14, 1993, he hid in a bathroom until the restaurant closed, then shot and killed Crowell; Ben Grant, 17; Colleen O'Connor, 17; and Margaret Kohlberg, a 50-year-old mother who was on her first day on the job. Each was shot in the head. A co-worker Bobby Stephens, then 20, was also shot in the head, but he survived and testified against Dunlap. One victim was down on her knees and begging for her life when Dunlap shot her. The massacre scarred the people of Aurora, . Colo. long before shooter James Holmes opened fire in a crowded movie . theater on July 20, 2012. Holmes killed 12 and wounded dozens more. Hickenlooper told a news conference that the majority of the families had told them they felt that they would get closure from an execution . Dunlap lost his last mandatory appeal in February. His lawyers petitioned Hickenlooper for clemency and filed other lawsuits challenging the sentence and execution process. In his reprieve, Hickenlooper said Colorado's capital punishment system is flawed, citing a study that showed the death penalty was sought and imposed inconsistently across the state. He also said the state doesn't have the drugs in place to carry out an execution by lethal injection, and that many states and nations are repealing the death penalty. Hickenlooper's reprieve order mostly referred to Dunlap by his state prison number. 'I don't use his name. I haven't with any of these mass killings because I don't think he needs any more notoriety,' Hickenlooper said at the news conference. Nathan Dunlap is restrained by sheriff deputies in Arapahoe County court in Littleton, Colo., in May 1996 after being sentenced to death for the December 1993 slayings of four employees at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant . Dunlap's attorneys previously released a video and written statement in which Dunlap apologized. They also said he had undiagnosed bipolar disorder at the time of the shootings. 'Mr. Dunlap was grateful,' his attorney Philip Cherner said after Hickenlooper's announcement. 'His expressions of remorse were genuine. He is truly sad for what happened.' 'This is not a day to celebrate,' Cherner said. 'Mr. Dunlap faces the rest of his life in a cell that's about the size of two king-sized beds, and he gets out for about an hour a day.'","Nathan Dunlap killed four people working at a Chuck E.

"When firefighters in Norway were called out to tackle a car blaze, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. But the precarious positioning of the vehicle, at the top of a hill, soon caused problems.

Nothing appears to be out of the ordinary when firefighters arrive to put out the flames engulfing the car . One firefighter can be seen desperately trying to grab hold of the car by leaning inside the burning vehicle to grab the steering wheel. But he soon has to draw back as the car picks up speed and starts to roll down to the residential road.

"Change: Teachers who have been convicted of smoking cannabis, using amphetamines or shoplifting will not be banned from the classroom, state rules which have come to light . Teachers convicted of drug offences or theft are to be allowed back into the classroom. A criminal record for smoking cannabis, using amphetamines or shoplifting need not bar them from continuing their jobs, official guidance states. Certain gambling, alcohol and driving offences are also not enough to see a teacher removed from their post, the National College for Teaching and Leadership said. Last night campaigners said routinely allowing such offenders to continue to teach would set a bad example to their pupils. ‘The job of a teacher is not just to impart knowledge to learners, it is to give them moral guidance,’ said David Green, from the Civitas think-tank. ‘You can’t give moral leadership if you yourself don’t set an example. ‘If you’ve been found guilty of the possession of drugs, it implies you at least use them.’ The official guidance from the NCTL has been sanctioned by the Department for Education. It covers when disciplinary panels should issue prohibition orders, which bar teachers whose conduct has fallen below expected standards from working in any classroom. The guidance tightens the rules in some areas – making it clear that teachers guilty of sexual misconduct and/or any crime involving indecent images of children should be kicked out, as should those convicted of supplying drugs. But for other drug offences leading to a conviction or caution, teachers should not be prohibited from teaching unless class-A substances – such as heroin, cocaine and ecstasy – are involved, it says. Offences involving class-B and C drugs, including cannabis and speed, would not mean an automatic prohibition order. Last night, a Department for Education source said: ‘Obviously, teachers should be strongly disciplined if they have committed theft or used drugs. We are absolutely clear that teachers can be banned for life. Example: We need teachers to give moral leadership for children, which drug offenders cannot do, critics claim . 'Heads are responsible for considering whether a lesser punishment, such as suspension or dismissal, is more appropriate.’ A DfE spokesman said: ‘What is important is keeping children safe. But it is also important that cases are dealt with individually, based on the specific circumstances. 'We have tightened guidelines to make the system tougher than ever.' The spokesman added: 'It is wrong to say that teachers won't be barred for these offences.' But Mr Green said: ‘It would not be compatible with a teaching job if someone is found guilty of an offence of drug possession. It would imply that the teacher did not feel there was anything wrong in taking drugs, which hardly sets a good example.’ The same principle applied to theft, he said. 'You can't give moral leadership if you yourself don't set an example' - David Green, Civitas think-tank . Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, said: ‘Although a lifetime ban from teaching would in many cases be too severe a penalty for more minor offences, schools and professional conduct hearing panels cannot afford to turn a blind eye. ‘In order to safeguard the reputation of the teaching profession and to send a clear message to pupils that drug, alcohol and theft offences – no matter how minor – are not to be tolerated, some form of disciplinary action is called for.’ The NCTL guidance says each case needs to be considered on its merits, raising the prospect that teachers convicted of very serious offences could be allowed to continue to teach in some circumstances. Latest figures show that, in 2012/13, 98 prohibition orders were issued. Four years ago, an investigation found that dozens of teachers with convictions were being allowed to stay in the classroom. Some guilty of crimes including harassment, battery, assault, indecent exposure, indecent assault and possessing class-A drugs had not been banned.","Rules from National College for Teaching and Leadership passed by Department of Education allows cannabis and gambling criminal records .

"It seems the financial woes facing the owners of Downton Abbey are worse than anyone imagined.Cora, Countess of Grantham, has been reduced to wearing an outfit made out of a tablecloth - and her daughter Edith has a second-hand coat which is older than she is. In the new series, both of the characters have been seen clad in recycled costumes that have appeared in a host of other shows. Edith sported the garment as she travelled to London for a dalliance with her married lover (l) and The House of Eliott, 1994, costume seen on Louise Lombard as Evangeline Eliott (r) In the first episode, Edith, played by . Laura Carmichael, wore a coat that TV viewers first saw in the . Seventies.

The transformation of Edith from dowdy spinster to sexy socialite has been a key plot-line recently - as has her family's battle to stave off  financial disaster. Edith's coat was originally worn in 1974 . by actress Rosalind Ayres when she played Christable Carstairs in an . episode of The Father Brown Mysteries. Twenty years later the coat . appeared in the BBC drama The House Of Eliott. Actress Louise Lombard, who played Evangeline Eliott, wore it in an episode broadcast in 1994.

"Mohamed Hassan has been jailed for 16 years after an undercover officer was subjected to a vicious assault which forced him to jump from a window to escape . The leader of a drugs gang who subjected an undercover police officer to a vicious Reservoir Dogs-style attack has been jailed. Mohamed Hassan, 32, from Brockley, south London, launched the attack on the officer who jumped 12ft out of a first-floor window to escape the gang. In a scene reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film, the officer, identified only as Officer Deano, was attacked after a hidden recording device was spotted in his polo shirt during a crack cocaine and heroin deal at a drugs den in Basildon, Essex, in November 2012. Hassan, the leader of drugs gang ‘The Bush Boys’, was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment at Basildon Crown Court yesterday after he was found guilty of robbery of covert equipment, money laundering and conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Perry Bohm, 19, from Woolwich, who held the undercover officer during the attack, was sentenced to seven years in jail after he was also found guilty of robbery of covert equipment. He pleaded guilty to supplying Class A drugs at an earlier hearing. Judge Owen Davies QC told Basildon Crown Court: 'There was in operation a well-oiled machine which enabled drug users to obtain drugs 24/7, seven days a week, using a mobile telephone number. 'At one address, within yards of this court, the gang took up residence. 'The operation culminated in a dramatic incident on November 26, 2012, after the syndicate cottoned-on to the fact members were being arrested and there was suspicion the gang had been infiltrated. The officer jumped 12ft out of a first-floor window at this flat in Basildon, Essex, after he was attacked . 'Officer Deano found himself in a flat alone when Hassan turned up, confronted him, assaulted him while he was held by two others and robbed him of surveillance equipment. 'Deano was defenceless and cornered - he made the decision to jump out of the window before Hassan returned with a knife.' The Bush Boys - who were based in London - set up a sophisticated business operation offering Class A drugs from safe houses and hotel rooms across Basildon, Essex. A specific drugs hotline was manned 24/7 and advertised to addicts through brazen mobile phone messages bragging about the quality of their heroin and crack cocaine. Essex Police managed to infiltrate the gang but on November 26, 2012, gang leader Hassan confronted undercover officer Deano during a deal at a barricaded drugs den in Basildon, Essex, and discovered his recording device. Hassan and Bohm began kicking and punching the officer before Hassan left the room briefly to find a knife, loudly declaring: 'I’m going to shank the c***.' In a scene reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs, the officer, identified only as Officer Deano, was attacked after a hidden recording device was spotted in his polo shirt during a crack cocaine and heroin deal . In court the officer described the experience as the most terrifying of his career. Giving evidence from behind a screen to protect his identity, he told the court: 'I was terrified and in genuine fear for my safety and well-being. 'At that time I’d been an enforcement officer for 12-and-a-half years, involved in numerous frightening situations, but nothing compared to the fear I felt at that moment. 'Officer Deano found himself in a flat . alone when Hassan turned up, confronted him, assaulted him while he was . held by two others and robbed him of surveillance equipment. Deano was defenceless and cornered - he made the decision to jump out of the window before Hassan returned with a knife' - Judge Owen Davies QC . 'I was aware the front door was barricaded so the only exit I could reasonably consider was the window.' As Hassan went to collect a knife from another room, the officer shoulder charged his way through a first-floor window before sprinting to safety. A jury found Hassan and Bohm guilty of robbery of covert equipment following a three-month trial at Basildon Crown Court last summer. Hassan was also found guilty of money laundering and conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Bohm pleaded guilty to supplying Class A drugs at an earlier hearing. Thomas Symons was jailed for four years after admitting conspiracy to supply Class A drugs at an earlier hearing. The 19-year-old from Woolwich was however cleared by the jury of any involvement in the attack. CPS East of England Senior District Crown Prosecutor, Punam Malhan, paid tribute to the bravery of undercover officer Deano who risked his life to infiltrate the gang. The window the officer jumped out of was around 12ft above the pavement . She said: 'The dismantling of this gang was the result of a year-long police operation by the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate. 'In particular, one undercover police . officer put his life on the line when he was forced to jump out of a . window to save himself after the gang discovered his true identity. 'This officer gave compelling evidence in court of the gang’s activities and we would like to pay tribute to his bravery.' Hassan and Bohm were sentenced at Basildon Crown Court yesterday alongside a number of other lower level dealers involved with ‘The Bush Boys’. Outside the court, Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Superintendent Tracy Hawkings, said: 'Drug-dealing and substance abuse have a devastating effect on communities and are the predominant causes of other forms of crime. 'Drug addicts are often forced into committing crime in order to finance and feed their addiction. 'This has a huge impact on the local community who have to suffer drug-dealers operating in their neighbourhoods and be exposed to the associated intimidation and violence. 'I would like to pay tribute to the bravery of one of our officers who was seriously injured in the course of his work. 'He has now recovered but showed remarkable bravery in a situation I honestly believe he was lucky to escape from with his life.'","Mohamed Hassan launched attack on officer after recording device spotted .

"A new ruling of a controversial Montana judge who sentenced a rapist teacher to just 30 days in prison has been called into question. Gregory Todd Baugh has ordered a 27-year-old convicted killer who punched his girlfriend, fracturing her face in three places, to write 'boys do not hit girls' 5,000 times and send it to him. The bizarre Bart Simpson-style sentence comes just four months after Baugh ordered rapist Stacey Rambold to spend a month in jail because the teacher had 'suffered enough' and his victim was 'in control'. Montana District Judge Todd Baugh: The controversial judge ordered a man who beat his girlfriend to write 'boys do not hit girls' 5,000 times as punishment . The Billings Gazette reported Baugh on Monday ordered girlfriend beater Pacer Anthony Ferguson to number his list, sign it and mail it to him by May 23. He also sentenced Ferguson to six-months jail and ordered him to pay more than $3,800 in restitution for his victim’s medical bills. Ferguson, from Montana, beat his girlfriend on August 24 last year. The woman said she still suffers double vision when she looks up or down and that she has occasional pain and numbness in her face. A jury convicted Ferguson on the misdemeanor assault charge but acquitted him of felony aggravated assault and felony witness tampering, which would have attracted a five to 100-year prison sentence. Ferguson also appeared on Monday in a separate hearing before Baugh in relation to a sentence for a felony attempted robbery in 2003. In that case, Ferguson attempted to rob a man at knife point in a Walmart parking lot, according to court records. Todd ruled that Ferguson violated the terms of his release for the robbery multiple times, including with the assault on the woman. Pacer Anthony Ferguson: The 27-year-old has been sentenced to  six months behind bars for fracturing his girlfriend¿s face in three places . History of crime: When he was 13, Ferguson released a train car which rolled down the tracks and killed a man . Todd revoked Ferguson's prior . sentence and ordered him to spend eight years in the Montana State . Prison to run concurrent to his sentence for the assault. Chief . Deputy Yellowstone County Attorney Juli M. Pierce said after the . hearing that she respects the two sentences the judges gave Ferguson. Ferguson has spent the past decade in and out of jail, . ever since he was sentenced at 14 for releasing a train car that rolled . down the tracks and killed a man. He was 13 at the time of the incident. Baugh set off a public furor in August when he said 14-year-old rape victim Cherice Morales appeared 'older than her chronological age'. Teacher Rambold admitted to raping Morales when she was a troubled high school freshman at Billings Senior High School in 2008. She later committed suicide. While Baugh apologized for his comments, he maintains his sentence was appropriate. The state is appealing the sentence and women's groups are calling for Baugh's removal from the bench. Questionable judgement: Baugh was heavily criticized earlier this year for sentencing teacher Stacey Dean Rambold (left) to just 30-days prison for raping his student Cherice Morales (right) who later committed suicide .","Montana Judge Gregory Todd Baugh is known for his dubious rulings .

And according to reports, Weisskopf - who emigrated to America and changed his name to Whitehead - may have also been the first person to invent the flying car.

The journal claims that after studying evidence put forward by aviation expert John Brown in support of Whitehead: ' [Whitehead's flight], it must be stressed, was more than two years before the Wrights manhandled their Flyer from its shed and flew a couple of hundred feet in a straight line.

Although reports have both supported, and denied Whitehead's achievement since 1901, the claims in Jane's journal is the first time it has been officially recognised by such a widely-respected aviation body. Whitehead designed an aircraft in the . early 1900s that could be driven like a car, but was fitted with wings . that could be unfolded, turning the car into a plane. Whitehead then built his Condor aircraft, also known as No.21, based on this flying car model. The aircraft had two . engines; a 20 horsepower engine used to fly the vehicle, and a 10 . horsepower engine used for driving. The idea was that the pilot could switch between engines depending on whether they wanted to drive or fly the vehicle. Condor was also fitted with two propellers that were controlled and powered when the plane engine was selected. Reports in the Bridgeport Herald in . August 1901 claim Whitehead drove the Condor to a a field outside . Connecticut in the US, unfolded the wings and made two demonstration . flights. During the second flight, Whitehead is said to have flown for a mile and a half and reached a height of 50 feet. Further reports claim he updated the . model, called No.22, and made another demonstration flight on 22 January . 1902 in front of 17 witnesses. Gustave Whitehead emigrated to the States from Bavaria in the 1890s. He designed a 'roadable aircraft' that was small enough to fit in a garage like a car. Whitehead envisaged owners being able to drive the car to a field, or suitable runway and then unfold wings on the side of the vehicle that would then turn the car into a plane. He then built his Condor aircraft, also known as No.21, based on this flying car model. The . aircraft was fitted with two engines; a 20 horsepower engine used to . fly the vehicle, and a 10 horsepower engine used for driving. The . pilot could then switch between which engine they wanted to use, and . when the flying engine was turned on it would help power the craft's . twin propellers. A report in the Bridgeport Herald on 18 August 1901 details eyewitness accounts of Whitehead's flight, which took place in Connecticut four days earlier. The journalist confirms that the flight took off from Fairfield, flew for about a mile and a half, made two turns and then landed safely . Gustave Whitehead emigrated to the US from Bavaria in the 1890s. He was originally called Weisskopf but changed his name when he settled in Connecticut . Reports in the Bridgeport Herald in August 1901 claim Whitehead drove the Condor to a a field outside Connecticut in the the U.S., unfolded the wings and made two demonstration flights. The journalist who wrote the story is said to have witnessed the flight himself. During the second flight, Whitehead is said to have flown for a mile and a half and reached a height of 50 feet. Further reports claim he updated the model, called No.22, and made another demonstration flight on 22 January 1902 in front of 17 witnesses. If these reports are true, it means Whitehead beat the Wright Brothers to the record. Orville and Wilbur Wright designed and flew their Flyer plane in December 1903. Five people were said to have witnessed the flight including John T. Daniels who took photographic evidence. Claims that Whitehead beat the Wright Brothers to the record first emerged in 1937. Orville Wright is said to have called the story a hoax and chief aviation historian at the Smithsonian Institute, Tom Crouch, rejects the claims. Writing in a blog for the National Air and Space Museum, Crouch said that Whitehead contradicted himself when giving evidence of his flight: 'Over the next decade, as aviators in America and Europe took to the sky following the pattern established by the Wright brothers, Whitehead would continue to built aircraft for other enthusiasts. Not one of those powered machines ever left the ground.' Crouch then concluded: 'Either Whitehead had somehow forgotten the secrets of flight, or he had never flown a powered machine at all.'","Gustave Whitehead is believed to have flown his Condor plane in August 1901 - more than two years before the Wright Brothers' infamous flight .
Condor was designed to be part-car, part-plane and may have been the first flying car, according to the prestigious aviation journal Jane's ."
"The TSA officer shot dead by a gunman at Los Angeles International Airport earlier this month lay bleeding for 33 minutes before paramedics helped him, it has emerged. Law enforcement officials have revealed that paramedics were forced to wait just 150 yards from where Gerardo Hernandez was wounded because police had not declared the terminal safe to enter. The gunman, Paul Ciancia, was only active for five of the 33 minutes; after that there was no threat . as he had been shot and was in custody. Hernandez, who was only 20 feet from the exit, was eventually wheeled out by police to an ambulance - but the married father-of-two could not be saved. Scroll down for video . Questions: Gerardo Hernandez, 39, was left to bleed for 33 minutes after he was shot by the LAX gunman. Investigations are now underway to determine what conversations police and fire officials had . Officials are now examining what conversations took place between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe to enter the building following the November 1 shooting. They are also looking at whether paramedics could have gone inside earlier to help Hernandez, although it is not known if he would have survived after immediate medical attention. Formal conclusions may take months to reach, but what's known raises the possibility that a lack of coordination between police and fire officials prevented speedy treatment for Hernandez and others. The tragedy unfolded after Paul Ciancia, a 23-year-old unemployed motorcycle mechanic, entered Terminal 3 with a duffel bag, pulled out an assault rifle and started shooting, authorities said. They added that he had a note in his . bag that said he wanted to 'kill TSA' and that he wanted to stir fear in . them, criticizing their searches as unconstitutional. He fatally shot Hernandez and injured another officer, Tony Grigsby, who is recovering. Scene: Police stand by the scene of the shooting on November 1. For 28 minutes after the gunman was apprehended, the victim still lay on the ground as paramedics waited to enter . Chaos: After the shooting, paramedics were forced to wait outside - even when the shooter was in custody. Pictured, police officers and passengers wait outside the terminal following the gunfire . Ciancia was then shot by airport police officers four times, in the mouth and leg, before being taken into custody. He remains in fair condition in hospital and will appear in court when he is well enough. Suspect: Paul Ciancia, 23, allegedly targeted TSA agents for being 'unconstitutional' The Associated Press explained that paramedics did not immediately rush inside due to concerns there could be further threats inside - such as bombs or accomplices. After Hernandez was shot, officers from multiple agencies bent down to check on Hernandez before moving on, officials said. None administered first aid. Police broadcast over their radios that Ciancia was in custody at 9.25am, five minutes after Hernandez was shot in the chest. A nearly 26-year veteran Los Angeles police officer then checked on Hernandez several times, repeatedly telling officers who came by from various agencies 'he's dead', an official said. When Hernandez was finally taken to hospital, trauma surgeon David Plurad said Hernandez had no signs of life. Doctors worked for about an hour to revive him despite significant blood loss. 'When somebody is shot and they're bleeding to death, lifesaving skills need to be implemented immediately, in a couple minutes, and they're very simple, pressure dressings, tourniquets, adequate bandages to stop the bleeding,' said Dr. Lawrence E. Heiskell, an emergency physician for 27 years and a reserve police officer for 24 years who founded the International School of Tactical Medicine. Grief: Ana Hernandez, left, sits with her children Stephanie and Louis, right, during the public memorial service for her slain husband on Tuesday . Memorial: Attorney General Eric Holder walks past an image of Hernandez after giving remarks at the service . Responding to a situation with a shooter on the loose has changed since the 1999 Columbine school massacre, when officials huddled outside to formulate a plan while shooters continued firing inside and a teacher bled to death without timely treatment. Now police immediately charge in to stop the shooting as quickly as possible; officers are trained to step over the wounded and stop the gunman first, then tend to victims. During active shooter training last month with the LAX police and LAPD, Los Angeles city firefighters wearing ballistic vests and helmets dragged survivors to areas where they could provide treatment. Because police are often the first at the scene where there are injuries, California law requires officers receive first aid and CPR training in the academy and regular refreshers afterward. A recent audit by Los Angeles Police Commission Inspector General Alex Bustamante found that the LAPD had a zero percent compliance rate. Survivor: Injured TSA agent Tony Grigsby (center) gets a hug from a fellow agents at the service . Only 250-sworn officers in the Metropolitan Division out of the department's more than 9,900 sworn officers received the refresher training, it states. Airport police have the training. The Los Angeles . Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department and Los Angeles Airport . Police said they couldn't comment on the ongoing investigation until reports are finished. For now, TSA workers are left wondering if Hernandez could have been saved if he had been seen to earlier, said Victor Payes, . who works at the airport and is president of the local union. 'I . basically think there's a lack of coordination between entities at this . airport. That lack of coordination may have led to something that . shouldn't have happened,' Payes said.

"Rivals to Megaupload have seen a huge rise in traffic after file-sharing site Megaupload was shut down by the FBI and its flamboyant founder arrested in a high-profile raid. After the FBI shut down file-sharing site Megaupload and charged staff such as flamboyant founder Kim Dotcom - formerly Kim Schmitz - with copyright violations, users have flocked to rivals such as RapidShare, Hotfile and 4Shared. If the American authorities hoped that the move would dent the popularity of such 'cyber-locker' sites which are mainly used for sharing music and video for free they have been very much mistaken. Rapidshare, Hotfile and 4Shared, have reaped the rewards of the arrest of Megaupload's 'pirate captain' Kim Dotcom. One site, 4Shared, which has 2.5bn page views per month, is now twice the size Megaupload was before it shut down and the others have seen the numbers using their services nearly doubled. The high life: Dotcom, formerly known as Kim Schmitz and nicknamed 'Dr Evil', was arrested along with three other executives of Megauploads on Friday . Taken down: The Megaupload.com homepage boasted the endorsement of a string of high-profile celebrities . 4Shared is currently the subject of legal action in New Jersey, with a firm, Modulo Security Solutions, seeking to reveal the identities of individuals who uploaded and shared confidential documents. The 'cyberlocker' sites let users store large files and download them from anywhere. MegaUpload, which the U.S. government . shut down, was a Hong Kong-based ‘cyberlocker’ service that allegedly . allowed users to download pirated films, TV shows, music and e-books with . just a few clicks. It is accused of costing copyright owners £322million in lost earnings . and of making £113million by selling advertising and premium . subscriptions. A graphic created by web-monitoring firm Alexa showing the leap in traffic to 'cyberlocker' sites Hotfile, Uploaded.to, Depositfiles.com and Rapidshare.com . The traffic surge following Megaupload's closure is an embarrassment to many of the firms involved as it shines an unwelcome spotlight on how they operate. Such sites are keen to emphasise their legality in the wake of Megaupload's difficulties. 'This case has a great negative impact on file storage services and the . Internet overall,' a 4Shared spokesman said. '4shared has some of . the most strict house rules among all other file storage services and . there’s no need for any changes.' Cyberlocker sites are legal, and operate in the same way as YouTube - in that they take down illegal files whenever told to by copyright holders. As with YouTube, the volume of files means that every upload cannot be manually inspected. Megaupload is accused of knowingly violating copyright. Several Megaupload staff were arrested in New Zealand last week on copyright charges. The FBI also allege that the site was used for money-laundering. Its founder, 'Kim Dotcom' - formerly Kim Schmitz - owned a . £3million collection of 25 cars which was confiscated at the time of his arrest – mainly top-of-the range Mercedes with . number plates such as ‘STONED’, ‘HACKER’ and ‘GUILTY’ but also . including Maseratis, a vintage pink Cadillac and Dotcom’s runabout, a . £300,000 Rolls-Royce Phantom with the number plate ‘GOD’.

"A 19-year-old suburban Denver woman who federal authorities say intended to wage jihad has pleaded guilty to trying to help the Islamic State militant group in Syria. Shannon Conley pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court in Denver to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. She wore a black and brown headscarf with her striped jail uniform. She said nothing in federal court other than acknowledging that she understood the plea and its ramifications. She could face up to five years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine. Scroll down for video . Colorado teen Shannon Conley pleaded guilty to terror charges in Denver federal court today after her April arrest for trying to flee the country and join ISIS. Pictured above attending U.S. Army Explorers Camp . Ana and John Conley, parents of Shannon Conley, exit the U.S. Federal courthouse following their daughter's plea hearing on Wednesday . However, U.S. District Judge Raymond Moore ordered a psychological exam to be conducted before sentencing Conley. The agreement says she must cooperate with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies and provide information about people in Colorado and elsewhere looking to help terrorists abroad. If she cooperates, prosecutors promised to ask a judge to reduce her sentence. After the hearing, Conley's public defender, Robert Pepin, that she has been horrified by the atrocities committed by the Islamic State group and offered her condolences to those who have been caught up in its 'slaughter and oppression.' Those atrocities include the filmed beheading of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, who were hostages of the group. Happier times: Shannon, pictured in a circle, with her mother (bottom center) and three older sisters in 2012 before her conversion to Islam . 'The fact that she was arrested may very well have saved her life,' he said of Conley, whom he referred to as Halima, the name she adopted after her conversion to Islam. The certified nurses's aide was arrested at the Denver Airport in April, as she attempted to board a flight she hoped would get her to Syria. She intended to meet up with a Tunisian ISIS fighter she met online who asked her to marry her and join the jihadist fight. Authorities have said they are still investigating the suitor, identified in court documents only as Y.M. Documents say Conley told FBI agents that she wanted to use her skills as a nurse's aide to help the militants. She received military training by going to a camp run by the U.S. Army Explorers. Agents repeatedly tried to discourage her. Conley, who worried friends and family when she started wearing a head scarf and calling herself 'Halima', had raised suspicion with the FBI long before she tried to flee the country. Prior to her arrest, she stalked Faith Bible Chapel in her hometown of Arvada, where she lived with her parents . Conley also allegedly stalked the Faith Bible Chapel, showing up at the church often to sketch the building. The senior pastor there turned her into authorities for her unusual behavior. Conley started visiting the Faith Bible, just as they were planning to take a trip to the Holy land with a Jewish congregation, and would regularly visit the church to sketch the building. Senor Pastor George Morrison eventually asked her to leave, and informed authorities about her behavior, but says he only thought Conley was a 'terrorist wannabe'. Another student who knew her at Regis University says Conley tried out several different religions in a period of six months before finally settling on Islam. During a visit to the Denver field office in August, FBI Director James Comey said stopping homegrown terrorists who radicalize through the Internet is a priority for the agency. He called Syria a safe haven and training ground for Westerners, who emerge with ""the worst kind of relationships and the worst kind of training."" A Minnesota man recruited to fight for the Islamic State group was killed in Syria last month — five years after his high school friend died fighting for the terror group al-Shabab in Somalia. It is unclear how Conley became interested in jihad, or holy war. After her arrest, authorities say they found CDs by U.S.-born radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki among her belongings. Conley (pictured on the right, with a friend) tried out several different religions in college before selecting Islam .","Shannon Conley, 19, appeared in court on Wednesday after authorities arrested her in April trying to board a flight on her way to Syria .

"A husband killed his wife and buried her body at the side of a lay-by after believing she had become possessed by an evil spirit, a court has heard. Ahmed al-Khatib, 34, of Gorton, Manchester, said he has had visions of the demonic creature known as the ‘jinn’ since he was 16 and had even undergone an exorcism carried out by an Imam. But he believed the spirit - which took four forms including a white rabbit and a ‘devil dog’ - had ‘got inside’ mother-of-three Rania Alayed, 25, Manchester Crown Court was told. Trial: Ahmed al-Khatib (left), 34, believed the 'jinn' spirit, which took four forms including a white rabbit and a ‘devil dog’, had ‘got inside’ mother-of-three Rania Alayed (right), 25, Manchester Crown Court was told . In June last year she vanished after being lured to the flat of Al-Khatib’s brother in Salford, Greater Manchester. Her body was allegedly hidden inside a suitcase bundled into the back of a motorhome. It was then driven 87 miles to the A19 near Thirsk, North Yorkshire, where it is believed her remains were buried. They have never been found. Al-Khatib later claimed he had accidentally killed her during a row in which she stumbled and hit her head on a piece of furniture. He denies prosecution claims he murdered her because she had become ‘too Westernised’. Al-Khatib said: ‘I still love her now. She is the only love for me. The only woman. She is my love and life, she is everything to me. If you think this court can give me punishment then I don’t think so.’ He claimed the ‘Jinn’ - a demonic spirit in Islamic mythology - had taken on the shapes of relatives, animals and ‘a devil’, even leaving ‘fingermarks’ around his neck, and goaded him to commit suicide. The exorcism occurred when he was still living in his native Syria aged 21 and the spirit was ‘banished’ through his left foot. ‘When I was 16 years old I was seeing shadows and things and hearing voices,’ Al-Khatib said. ‘I couldn’t work from the ages of 17 to 21 and after that my dad took me to see an Imam - a religious man in our culture - because I was seeing the jinn and was talking to them and they were giving me orders and telling me to kill myself which I tried to do at the time. ‘I was talking in my sleep because I was scared. The jinn would change in form. Sometimes it was a devil. He was very shiny with four hands and sharp teeth and blood coming from the teeth and very long hair. Probe: In June she vanished after being allegedly lured to the flat of Al-Khatib's brother in Salford (pictured) ‘I still see it now. After I go to the Imam I didn’t see it for a long time but was still hearing the voices. ‘Sometimes it would visit me at my home and sometimes it would go inside people and inside animals. About three times it went inside Rania. He is just inside Rania and she would look like him. ‘If he goes inside dogs it will look like him. A devil dog with red teeth and blood coming out. When it goes inside her she has four hands and she can extend her hands, and red hair and very big eyes. ‘I would leave the house and she would . say ""you need help"" so I would need to go out and come back and she . would be back as my wife. The last time I saw her she said “you need . medical help”.’ 'When it goes inside her she has four hands and she can extend her hands, and red hair and very big eyes' Ahmed al-Khatib . Earlier the court heard how the couple married in Syria when she was 16 and he was 23. They fled Damascas initially for Greece but emigrated to the UK in 2004 and after living in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, for five years moved to Manchester. Al-Khatib said: ‘It was a nice life between me and Rania at that time. We used to go to the seaside and we were happy. I was never violent to Rania. They said I was a drunk man. ‘I don’t drink alcohol at all, I don’t even like the taste. We moved to Manchester when our third child was born because my mum and dad live there and I thought they could give us a hand with the kids. ‘But when she went to college she changed and didn’t spend as much time with the family. She would spend more time in the mirror and on the phone on Facebook and Whatsapp. ‘I wasn’t happy with it at all. I said you need to pay more attention to your children and your family. I was not happy like I had been before. Things had changed. I was happy because I loved her and wanted to see a smile on the face of her and the kids. Rania had plans to leave me. Movement: Her body was allegedly hidden inside a suitcase bundled into the back of a motorhome (pictured) ‘The first step was saying I was drunk but I never drank because of my religion. She said I was beating her. She said rape but how can I rape my wife? If I want to have sex with her and she said no then I would just wait until the next day.’ He claimed Mrs Alayed concocted a ‘plan’ to leave him by saying she was consistently beaten and even raped by her husband. On January 18 last year when Mrs Alayed called police to their home in Longsight, Manchester, following an argument over messages on her phone to another man which suggested they had been having an affair. 'The jinn would change in form. Sometimes it was a devil. He was very shiny with four hands and sharp teeth and blood coming from the teeth and very long hair' Ahmed al-Khatib . She left with the children and sought refuge in a hostel, before taking out a harassment order on Al-Khatib. She later filed for divorce. On February 18 last year, Al-Khatib was referred to a specialist mental health unit in Manchester by his GP after claiming the jinn had reappeared. A statement read to the jury from the hospital described his suicidal thoughts, constant apparitions and ‘dishevelled’ appearance, but he was discharged after three days. During his evidence, he said tablets provided by the hospital blocked out hallucinations of the jinn, but he was refused them once discharged and resorted to cannabis and banging his head to evade the thoughts. Al-Khatib and his brother Muhaned, 38, are said to have transferred Rania’s body from Muhaned’s flat to a motorhome before driving to the A19 near Thirsk where she was buried by the roadside. Al-Khatib and Muhaned deny murder but admit perverting the course of justice. A third brother, Hussain Al-Khatib, 34, has pleaded not guilty to perverting the course of justice over the alleged concealment of her body. The trial continues.

"For many British students, going to the pub is as much a part of university life as going to lectures. But conscientious Cambridge University staff are encouraging foreign students not to indulge in that particular aspect of local culture and have prepared a £3,000 video warning of the perils of binge-drinking. The video, commissioned by the Cambridge Colleges Senior Tutors Committee, will tell new international students that 'there might be rules and traditions, but you don't need to join in.' It comes less than five months after photographs of Cambridge students stripping off, vomiting and urinating in flower beds prompted concerns about drinking rituals enjoyed by undergraduates. Scroll down for video . Advice: A video, featuring this image of a man slumped on a night out, is to be shown to international students at Cambridge University, urging them not to indulge in the British binge-drinking culture . The video is presented by two students, who say: 'Being in Cambridge means you're going to be working hard and playing hard. 'But it's important to remember that playing hard doesn't necessarily mean drinking hard. 'Of course you're going to want to relax and let off some steam. But drinking too much can easily make a great night turn sour.' The boozy 'rules and traditions' to which the presenters refer may include the annual Caesarian Sunday event. More than 2,000 students descended on a public park for this year's event in May. Time at the bar: A scene from the video, which advises international students that they 'don't need to join in' some of the boozy rituals and traditions at Cambridge University . The student presenters offer plenty of sensible advice to the would-be students . Common sense: British students would be well advised to follow the video's suggestions . Parents with young children looked on appalled as girls downed port from condoms and acted out sexual positions with male students. Many of the students, both male and female, could barely stand by the end of the afternoon. The four-minute video for international students, which has also been posted on YouTube, includes contributions from police, NHS staff, and city clubs and pubs. Dr Adrian Boyle, of Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, says: 'It's a big problem for us. About 40 per cent of the people we see arriving after midnight at this hospital are attending because of alcohol bingeing.' Dr Boyle continues: 'We get people turning up not sure whether they had sexual intercourse last night because they were drunk. Stocked up: Students bring trolley full of alcohol into a public park during the Caesarian Sunday drinking event .

Rude tradition: Girls downed port from condoms and acted out sexual positions with fellow Cambridge University students in May . 'We saw somebody who fell over about three weeks before finals. They broke their wrist, they broke their right hand, they couldn't write.' In addition to raising concerns about drinking, the video also warns foreign students that wearing their college gowns out could make them an 'easy target'. The presenters say: 'Ditch the gown and the tux before you head out on the town. 'That way you won't stand out as such an easy target later in the night. 'And if you're still feeling threatened, head to any porter's lodge.' Keith Willox, domus bursar at Sidney Sussex College, said: 'The YouTube link makes it easy to get the message to new students before Freshers' week and they are far more likely to listen to this advice from fellow students rather than the college authorities.'

"Rescuers trying to salvage a submerged 'little ship' that was used in the Dunkirk landings were fearful today after the operation ran into problems. Some 600 stranded Allied soldiers were evacuated from France on board the Skylark XI during Operation Dynamo in 1940. But for the last two years, the vessel has been lying on the bed of the River Leven at Balloch, West Dunbartonshire. Submerged: A mission to rescue Skylark XI from the River Leven in Scotland has run into problems . A team of Royal Navy divers has spent two days trying to raise the boat, but the mission suffered a significant setback today. A water pump broke as the Skylark was being lifted, causing it to start sinking again. Dougie McCann, of the Leven Cruising Club, who organised the rescue, said: 'I’m absolutely gutted. 'We’ve . been working on this project since March and every time we think we are . getting somewhere, something goes wrong. It’s game over, I’m afraid. Rescue: Royal Navy divers approach the submerged vessel, which helped save hundreds of Allied soldiers during the Dunkirk landings in 1940 . Mission: Two Royal Navy experts take part in the salvage operation. The team has been using special buoyancy bags in an attempt to lift the vessel . Troubled: The Skylark has been submerged in the River Leven for two years. It foundered at its moorings only two days after the 70th anniversary of the Dunkirk landings . 'She has played her part in history and deserves a happy ending - not rotting at the bottom of a river. 'The boat is an important piece of British military and naval history and should not be allowed to just sink without trace. But it’s proved impossible to raise her.' The Royal Navy experts, based at Faslane on the Clyde, were using special buoyancy bags in an attempt to lift the vessel. Mr McCann said: 'We don’t know what’s going to happen now. There’s nothing more we can do without funding.' The Skylark was among the smallest of the 'little ships' flotilla from 1940 which responded to the urgent call from Winston Churchill to rescue the Allied forces. Setback: The salvage mission in the River Leven was hampered when a water pump broke . Her capacity was officially 90 passengers, but it managed to make four cross-Channel return trips carrying 150 exhausted and wounded soldiers each time. The 50-foot vessel was built in 1927 as a pleasure cruiser in Poole, Dorset. It then spent years ferrying trippers around Brighton harbour. The boat was commandeered after war was declared and it became a shallow water minesweeper. It was also used to place anti-invasion obstacles around Poole harbour. After the war, the vessel changed hands several times, moving gradually north before settling on Loch Lomond. Historic: Skylark XI was among the smallest of the 'little ships' flotilla from 1940 which responded to the urgent call from Winston Churchill to rescue the Allied forces . Operation Dynamo: Troops wade out to ships waiting to rescue them off the beaches of Dunkirk in 1940 . Sweeney’s Cruises bought the boat in 1972 and began operating it as a pleasure cruiser on the loch. The Skylark played a central role in annual ceremonies of the Glasgow and West of Scotland branch of the Dunkirk Veterans’ Association. But it foundered at its moorings and became submerged in 2010 - only two days after the 70th anniversary of the evacuation. Before the rescue operation began, Mr McCann said: 'I was on the point of giving up and having her broken up because I couldn’t get any help in saving her. 'We put her on eBay for £1 to no avail. After that, Boyd Tunnock of the famous teacake company rang and offered to help us. 'Luckily we’ve been donated the air bags and the Royal Navy have volunteered their services free, so we haven’t yet needed Mr Tunnock’s help.' Hailed by Winston Churchill as a 'miracle of deliverance', the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk is one of the best-known episodes of the Second World War. After British, French and Belgian troops became cut off by the advancing German army, some 850 ships sailed to France to rescue them. They included the 'famous little ships of Dunkirk', a flotilla of about 700 merchant marine boats, fishing boats, pleasure craft and lifeboats. Between May 27 and June 4, 1940, more than 338,000 soldiers were rescued, including almost 200,000 British troops. The mission, codenamed Operation Dynamo, incurred significant losses, however, and Churchill warned afterwards: 'Wars are not won by evacuations'. The British premier said there was not doubt in his mind that the Allied operations in Western Europe prior to the evacuation had been a 'colossal military disaster'. Nine Allied destroyers - six British and three French - were sunk during Operation Dynamo, and more than 100 RAF aircraft were lost in the fighting.","Skylark XI brought troops to safety from France during 1940 evacuation .

"With an economic mess so deep that rioters have taken to the streets in desperation, one would not have expected sports facilities to be among the Greek government's priorities. But ministers are pressing ahead with plans to build a new £75million motor racing circuit capable of hosting a Formula One Grand Prix. The move is likely to irk citizens across the eurozone, whose single currency has been brought to the brink of collapse because Greece failed to control its debt problem. Ambitious: Despite their country's economic problems, Greek ministers have unlocked funding for a £75m Formula One track . It may also surprise Greeks, who have been told they must accept austerity measures as their country heads for its sixth year in recession. Ministers have 'unblocked' £24million of funds to build the racing circuit on a site in Xalandritsa, near Patras. The total cost of the project is expected to reach £75million. It could mean that Greece joins super-rich Monaco, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi on the Formula One calendar. Details of the plan emerged only a week after hundreds of protesters hurled petrol bombs and clashed with riot police in Athens. Up to 100,000 took to the capital’s streets during the largest anti-austerity protest seen there in more than a year. Historic: The old fortress of Patras, on the west coast of mainland Greece.

As the rally ended, youths dressed in black threw stones, chunks of marble, petrol bombs and bottles at police, who responded with tear gas and pepper spray. The protesters were trying to force the government to reject demands for additional savings of £9billion in savings over the next two years, along with a further £1.5billion in taxes. Greece has promised the spending cuts and tax increases in an effort to secure its next tranche of aid from the EU and IMF. Politicians in Brussels warned on Tuesday that Europe faced 'economic and social disaster' if unemployment continues to rise among young people. Some 18.2million people are unemployed in the eurozone, the highest level since the euro was introduced in 1999. Unemployment in Greece is expected to rise to 27 per cent.

"The Boston police commissioner has . confirmed that the younger bombing suspect killed his own brother by . running him over with an SUV while officers were trying to arrest him. Ed Davis told CNN he believes Tamerlan Tsarnaev died from being hit and dragged 40 feet by his own brother Dzhokhar. Doctors revealed that Tamerlan had . been shot and appeared to have suffered a bomb blast, however his wounds . from the tires of his stolen SUV appeared the most severe. A medical examiner must still confirm the cause of death. Law enforcement sources told MailOnline Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were determined not to be taken alive. Suspects: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, left, was reportedly run over by his accomplice and younger brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, who was captured on Friday . Gun battle: The drama unfolded after the suspects allegedly gunned down a police officer for MIT at the school's Cambridge campus . Authorities are investigating whether Dzhokar, 19, ran over his brother as part of a . suicide pact so that neither of them could be put on trial. Later, as police closed in, Dzhokar reportedly put a gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. 'These guys did not have an exit plan . after the bombing, and from they way they have both ended up it looks . like they planned on never being taken alive,' said a law enforcement . source. 'Why else would this kid drive over . his brother? It does not make any sense until you realise he also tried . to take his own life. They had some sort of suicide pact worked out so . they would not be taken alive.' Offering the first detailed account . of the firefight, Police Chief Edward Deveau, of Watertown, . Massachusetts, where the drama had unfolded early Friday morning, has . revealed that 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev walked towards officers . firing a gun before he ran out of ammunition and was tackled to the . ground. 'He all of a . sudden comes out from under cover and just starts walking down the . street, shooting at our police officers, trying to get closer,' Deveau . said. Harrowing scene: Bomb disposal robots searched the suspects' vehicle early on Friday, with an eye witness saying a water bottle was removed . Violent moments: The scene of the shootout involving the Boston bomber suspects in Watertown, Massachusetts . Tense night: Police with guns drawn search for a suspect in the bombing after a shootout and carjacking . Nothing to lose: At one point, police say Tamerlan marched down the street toward police while firing a gun at them . 'Now, my closest officer is five to 10 . feet away, and they're exchanging gunfire between them. And he runs out . of ammunition -- the bad guy -- and so one of my police officers comes . off the side and tackles him in the street.' He was in the process of being . handcuffed by two or three officers when his younger brother, . 19-year-old Dzhokhar, jumped behind the wheel of a black SUV the two . hand allegedly carjacked earlier and barreled toward the group. Officers . who were restraining Tamerlan Tsarnaev got out of the way of the . speeding vehicle, which ended up driving over the wounded suspect, the . police chief told CNN. According . to Deveau, the 19-year-old suspect dragged his sibling’s body a short . distance down the street and drove off. He later ditched the SUV and . escaped on foot. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead at a hospital a short time later. An . alleged autopsy photograph of Tamerlan that was leaked Friday shows . multiple gunshot wounds and a massive open gash that spans from the . center of his chest to his back. Another smaller gash is located right below the larger wound. His right shoulder and his face show signs of hemorrhaging. Some of the injuries could have been sustained during doctors' attempts to revive him. MailOnline is not publishing the photo due to its graphic nature. The results of the autopsy have not been released yet, but the preliminary description of the injuries suggests that some of the wounds may have been caused by the vehicle operated by the suspect's brother. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured Friday evening following a tense standoff after he was spotted hiding in a boat parked in a backyard, bleeding profusely. Violence erupted in the early morning hours Friday when police received reports of a robbery of a convenience store in Kendall Square near MIT and a police officer was shot and ended up with a gun fight in a small suburban street as residents slept. Sean Collier, an MIT police officer, was shot multiple times while in his cruiser at Main and Vassar streets, near the Stata Center on the MIT campus. The 26-year-old officer was pronounced dead at Massachusetts General Hospital. A short time later, the two men carjacked a Mercedes SUV at gunpoint. Explosive: Police say the suspects opened fire on officers and lobbed makeshift bombs devices at them . Fire power: About 200 rounds were fired during the shootout in a matter of five-ten minutes . Chaos in the streets: Gunfire erupted in a quiet suburban neighborhood, setting off a massive manhunt . The hostage was then driven around for half an hour as the pair decided what their next move would be. As police moved in on the vehicle following reports of a carjacking, the pair decided to dump the driver at a gas station on Memorial Drive in Cambridge. The search for the vehicle led to a chase that ended in Watertown, where authorities said the suspects threw explosive devices from the car and exchanged gunfire with police. Hero: MIT Police Officer Sean Collier was shot and killed in an armed confrontation with the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing . Richard H. Donahue, 33,  a transit police officer was seriously injured during the chase. In Watertown, witnesses reported hearing multiple gunshots and explosions at about 1am Friday. Dozens of police officers and FBI agents were in the neighborhood and a helicopter circled overhead. Speaking to CNN following Dzhokhar's capture, Deveau said that a single officer was the first to encounter the two cars that Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were driving, just before 1am Friday. One of the vehicles was a Mercedes SUV the brothers had carjacked earlier that night.Before the officer could call for backup, the two cars came to a stop and the brothers got out. 'They jump out of the car and unload on our police officer,' Deveau said 'They both came out shooting -- shooting guns, handguns. He's under direct fire, very close by. He has to jam it in reverse and try to get himself a little distance.' Five others officers arrived on the scene in the middle of an intense shootout during which Deveau says over 200 rounds were fired in 5-10 minutes. The chief said that one of the suspected bombers lobbed an explosive at the officers, which later turned out to be a pressure cooker bomb like the ones used in the marathon attack Monday. The brothers also allegedly threw . other explosives at police, which Deveau described as 'very rough . devices.' Two of the bombs detonated and two did not. A sixth explosive . was later discovered in one of the vehicles. At . one point, the older brother came directly toward police, firing a gun . at officers as he inched closer toward him, but Tamerlan Tsarnaev's luck . ran out along with his ammunition, allowing one of the officers to . tackle him. Moments later, his younger brother ran him over while fleeing the scene in a black Mercedes.  Accord. Dr. David Schoenfeld, of the Beth . Israel Deaconess Medical Center, was the one who ended up treating the . fatally injured Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Hiding place: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was eventually discovered wonded inside a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown, Mass. 'There was some discussion of who's coming in,' Schoenfeld said of the patient. 'Is it the suspect? Is this a victim? Is it a police officer? 'Ultimately that discussion died down quickly, because it doesn't matter who's coming in,' he added. 'We're going to treat them as best as we can, because you really don't know who it is until the dust settles.' When the 26-year-old was brought in accompanied by a large police escort, he immediately went into cardiac arrest. CPR was performed until a team of doctors could attempt to revive him, inserting chest tubes to treat potential injuries and gain vascular access to give the patient what Schoenfeld described as 'massive blood transfusions.' Tsarnaev succumbed to his injuries at 1.35am. His body was turned over to law enforcement for examination to determine the source of his injuries.","Watertown Police Chief Deveau said Tamerlan Tsranaev, 26, marched towards police officers while shooting at them .

"A mother has revealed how her son's life-threatening brain tumour was spotted thanks to a routine eye-check up. Little Joel Sheldon was booked in to see a specialist about his rare condition called heterochromia, which causes both eyes to be different colours. But immediately after the appointment he was rushed to Birmingham Children's Hospital, as medics detected a large mass in the back of his head and he underwent a nine-hour operation to have it removed. Joel, aged seven, with mother Louise is now fully recovered after medics discovered he had a brain tumour . The surgery proved a success . and follow-up checks have since confirmed that . the cancer has gone. Mother Louise, 38, who works as a GP in Dudley Birmingham, said: 'Thanks to research into children's cancers, Joel is here today and . living a full and happy life like any other seven-year-old. 'We were devastated and shocked when we discovered that he had a brain tumour. 'You don't expect to be told something like that, it's difficult to put it into words how you feel.' Medics discovered Joel - who was born with one brown and one blue-coloured . eye - had a Medulloblastoma, a childhood tumour located in a part of the brain responsible for balance and other complex motor functions. Symptoms, usually due to increased pressure in the head, include nausea, vomiting, headaches and clumsiness. Family support:  Joel with his mother Louise, father Jason and sister Eve, 8 . Louise, married to photographer Jason, 41 added: 'It all happened so quickly. They told us it was a very big . tumour that had to be taken out very quickly. By that time, the . headaches were getting worse and he was unable to walk in a straight . line. 'We explained to him that there was something in his head which had to be taken out. He accepted it quite well and was very matter of fact.' As the the tumour affected the part of Joel's . brain controlling balance, he remains a little unsteady on his feet and . his speech is a little slow, but he is now back at school and his family are busy raising funds for Cancer Research UK. Less than 90 youngsters a year develop medulloblastoma in the UK, although it is still the most common malignant brain tumour in children.","Medics detect large mass at the back of Joel Sheldon's head .

"The ‘wild cat of Woodchester' was . feared to have struck again after the mutilated carcass of a second deer . was found in a country field. The savaged animal was found a few . miles from where the big cat is first believed to have struck in . Woodchester Park near Stroud, Gloucestershire. It was found by a woman on Tuesday as . she walked her dog between Whiteway and Rendcomb, near Cirencester – . around 10 miles from the scene of the earlier attack. She went home to get a camera - but . by the time she returned the deer had been stripped down to its spine, . and all its vital organs were missing – a similar state to the first . carcass. Is this it? This image of a large black animal was captured in a field in north-west Wiltshire and could be the beast that is stalking a Gloucestershire village . Big cat expert Frank Tunbridge, who was first on the scene of the first killing , said he believed the same animal is behind both attacks. Mr Tunbridge, 65, said: ‘I have seen pictures of this carcass and it is hard to asses because there is not much left. ‘But it has all the hallmarks of a big cat kill. The woman found it in a field but when she came back to take photographs, it was completely stripped out, with just its spine left. ‘I believe it could be the same cat that attacked in Woodchester because, in my experience, these animals usually have a territory of around 100 square miles. ‘Either that or it could be a relative or cub of this cat.’ The animal had been ripped open and was missing its heart, kidneys and liver, he said. Its snout was also missing - important because big cats clamp their jaws over the mouth, causing death by suffocation. Experts believe the deer was brought down and devoured by a large and powerful predator such as a puma, jaguar or leopard. Carcass: A picture of the second deer's body is shown on the laptop of big cat investigator Frank Tunbridge. It was found by a female dogwalker . Tufts of the animal's fur were also . found piled by the body - and such predators neatly pluck the hair from . the body before shearing their teeth into the flesh. Tuesday’s attack supports the theory of big cat hunters who are convinced a puma or panther is on the prowl. Investigation: Frank Tunbridge is looking into both attacks, which he thinks were carried out by the same animal . Earlier . this week a dog walker claimed to have seen a big cat in a field half a . mile from where a deer had been found on January 4. That animal was found by dog walkers with its abdomen torn open and major organs including the heart, kidneys and liver missing. The . woman, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It was jet black and at . least the size of a German Shepherd, very powerfully built and with . large paws, a long tail and a smallish head.’ A positive test result could provide more evidence of big cats living in the British countryside. Mr Minter, an expert on big cats in . England who examined the carcass of the six-month-old roe deer, said it . showed ‘hallmarks of a big cat attack’, adding: ‘The claw and teeth . impressions are indicative of big cat activity. ‘And the stomach was taken out and . discarded. Big cats are strict carnivores so they don’t want to eat the . grass-filled intestines.’ Mr Tunbridge added: ‘Big cats could . be thriving at the moment because there are plenty of deer around and . the winter weather creates more cover for them to hunt. ‘Hopefully the DNA test will prove what some of us have thought for years - that these creatures are roaming the countryside.’ Wilf Ashman, 72,  said he had seen a big black cat nearby seven times in the past ten years, most recently in 2010. Mr Ashman said: ‘It’s not a normal . feral cat, this is different and bigger.’ A large, panther-like animal . has been pictured in fields just over the county border in north-west . Wiltshire. Examination: A man completes a DNA test on the carcass of the deer. Experts said that the attack had the hallmarks of a big cat due to claw and teeth impressions . Other recent sightings include a ‘pure white predator’ spotted in nearby Nailsworth, just weeks before the deer was killed. Andy Todd, who said he saw the beast, added: ‘It was pure white. It almost looked like a polar bear.’ Dr Robin Allaby, an expert in . evolutionary genetics at Warwick University's School of Life Sciences, . is studying samples of DNA taken from the first carcass. He said: ""I'm prepared to believe in . the existence of big cats in the UK and we have a reasonable chance of . finding out if it was there. ""We are in the process of studying . samples of DNA taken from the deer and if its death was the result of a . big cat then we're hoping it left cheek cells and saliva. The DNA tests are expected to be completed later this month.","Expert says both maulings had hallmarks of a big cat attack .

"Accused: Francesco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia cruise ship, arrives at the Moderno Theatre in Grosseto for the second day of his pre-trial hearing . A device on the Costa Concordia that tracks water depth had been switched off before the cruise liner struck a rock and capsized, killing 32 people, a court heard today. A panel of court experts said that the echo sounder on the vessel was off at the time of the disaster, which happened off the Italian coast in January. The cruise liner's captain, Francesco Schettino, 52, who was nicknamed 'Captain Coward' following the tragedy, is accused of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship. He has admitted to making mistakes, but says he should not be the only one blamed. Evidence about the sonar device were given on the second day of a pre-trial hearing, which will decide whether or not the charges against Schettino should be proceeded with. If it is decided that the case against the captain should continue, it will go to a full trial, likely to be held next year. The pre-trial hearing is being held in a theatre in the Italian town of Grosseto. It is being heard behind closed doors because there is not enough room to accomodate all the media interested in the case. More than 4,000 passengers and crew were helped from the vessel during a chaotic night-time evacuation after it capsized close to the Tuscan island of Giglio in January. Thirty bodies have been recovered from the wreck and another two people remain unaccounted for. The ship itself remains on its side, balanced on a rocky shelf in full view of the harbour. Hundreds of divers and salvage engineers have begun the delicate operation of preparing the hulk for removal. Outside court: Francesco Schettino wore a suit and sunglasses as he attended the pre-trial hearing in Grosseto . Scrutiny: Francesco Schettino, pictured outside court (left) and talking to a navy officer (right), has admitted to making mistakes, but says he should not be the only one blamed . Capsized: A device on the Costa Concordia that tracks water depth had been switched off before the disaster, the court heard . The ship's operator, Costa Cruises, has placed the blame for the disaster squarely on Schettino. It told the hearing today that the ship had been equipped with more radar systems than needed, and that enough of them had been in operation to meet legal requirements. Codacons, a consumer rights group that has been closely involved in the case, said more information was needed about the state of the ship's equipment before the disaster. 'All these aspects, had they been functional, may possibly have made up for the negative effects of Captain Schettino's actions and helped avoid the loss of human lives, even if the ship might have sunk nonetheless,' said Giuliano Leuzzi, a lawyer for Codacons. Tragedy: Thirty bodies have been recovered from the wreck and another two people remain unaccounted for . The hearing has already been played black box recordings which reveal the captain saying he 'screwed up' and was 'dying' moments before the stricken vessel capsized. Survivors listening to evidence heard Schettino saying: 'Roberto, I f***** up. Look, I'm dying here.' Officers were also heard shouting contradictory instructions as the disaster unfolded. The black box identified him shouting ‘hard to port!’ just before the liner struck a rock in calm waters. At the same time his second in command yells ‘hard to starboard!’ Moments before the disaster Schettino is also heard saying: ‘Let’s go and do a salute (to Giglio).’ But as the ship goes close to the shore, he shouts at a helmsman to go to starboard to avoid catastrophe. After hitting the rocks, Schettino orders watertight compartments in the ship to be closed. He is heard asking: ‘So are we really going down? I don’t understand.’ Mistakes: The Costa Concordia's captain, Francesco Schettino, 52, is accused of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship .","Echo sounder, which tracks water depth, had been turned off, court hears .

"Move over Essex lion - there's a new big cat in town, and he's living in deep in the Gloucestershire countryside. That's what locals have claimed after seeing the hunt for a wild beast apparently on the loose in Essex hit the headlines nationwide over the bank holiday weekend. Police eventually called off the search for the elusive lion after 24 hours, but wildlife experts in the west country say they have uncovered their own shadowy beast and the authorities should investigate. 'Panther' sighting: This picture taken in February 2012 shows a furry black figure sprinting through woodland near Nailsworth, Gloucestershire . It comes after this blurry picture of what resembles a big cat prowling around a patch of countryside near Nailsworth emerged. The furry black figure was caught on a trip camera sprinting through woodland after apparently being spooked by a walker. Hunters reckon the beast could be the feared Five Valleys big cat spotted by numerous members of the public over the last year. Big cat tracker Frank Tunbridge believes this image gives further credence to his belief that big cats roam Gloucestershire and beyond . Big cat tracker Frank Tunbridge . believes this image gives further credence to his belief that the . animals roam Britain - after a lion was allegedly seen by holidaymakers at a caravan park near Clacton in Essex on Sunday night. Frank Tunbridge said: 'I knew it was a big cat straight away. It looks like it could be a puma or small leopard.' Following reports . of a wild animal on the loose, armed officers and two police . helicopters using heat-seeking equipment, which cost £880 an hour to . run, were scrambled. Workers . from nearby Colchester Zoo carrying tranquilliser guns scoured the . fields and residents were warned to stay indoors. Caravanners were . temporarily moved to a nearby garden centre. But the search was eventually called off after . 24 hours when officers found no trace of a lion. The witnesses . however stood by their claims, insisting that the animal they saw was . definitely a large cat. The culprit was believed to be a three-year-old moggie called Teddy Bear, owned by Ginny Murphy, who said he does look quite lion-like. A Maine Coon, which is the largest domestic cat breed and can weigh up to 25lb, Teddy Bear lives near the caravan park and likes wandering around in the field where witnesses claimed they'd seen the lion. Speaking about the image he uncovered in Gloucestershire, Mr Tunbridge, 65, said: 'I knew it was a big cat straight away. It looks like it could be a puma or small leopard. 'I . don’t know what sort of cat it is, but we have used the wooden steps in . the photograph to scale it and we believe it is around 42in long. 'You can see that it’s not a Labrador - it has a cat’s profile. There have been so many other sightings in that area.' The . blurry picture of the creature, which measures about 20in up to the . shoulder was snapped last week by a trip camera set up in a farmer’s . field. Mr Tunbridge took on the case after being handed the picture by the farmer, who does not want to be identified. The unnamed farmer, who set up the camera after previously spotting the beast, said: 'I saw it in the lane near where I live. Lion or tabby cat? Images similar to this one were handed to Essex police in August sparking a large-scale search for the 'Essex Lion' 'That’s why I put the camera up. It . was a bit of a surprise to see this when I checked the camera. I have . set up a video camera too now, but not had anything on it yet.' The . snap comes just months after footage, captured by Coryn Memory, was . released showing a 6ft-long beast stalking through fields close by. She . first spotted a large black animal crossing the field near her house in . Thrupp, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, in July 2009 and claims to have . seen it five times since. Earlier this year the devastated carcasses of three roe deer and three wallabies were found strewn across the county. Teddy Bear, the Maine Coon owned by Ginny Murphie, pictured, is believed to have been mistaken for the Essex lion after he was possibly spotted stalking around his home in Clacton, Essex on Sunday . Look like a lion? Teddy Bear stalking through a stubble field near his home yesterday. On Sunday armed officers and two police helicopters which cost £880 an hour to run, were scrambled after reports of a lion . DNA . was taken from the first deer, found dead by a dog walker at . Woodchester National Park - just three miles from Coryn’s house - on . January 4 this year. The body had all of its vital organs missing and had its snout severed - the hallmarks of a panther-like kill. But a team of scientists, lead by Dr Robin Allaby of Warwick University, failed to find any big cat DNA on the carcass. Searching: Police were seen patrolling areas around Earls Hall Farm in St Osyth (pictured), near Clacton, Essex . Police hunt: Armed police were hunting a lion which was spotted in fields near a caravan site in St Osyth, Essex (pictured) Mr Tunbridge, from Gloucester, believes a walker may have accidentally disturbed the Nailsworth creature, causing it to flee. He said: 'The route the cat was pictured on is a deer trail - which means the animal may have been hunting for food. 'This is just one of many sightings that get reported to me - I am getting around two-a-week at the moment.' The sighting follows an apparent close encounter with a 'panther-like creature' reported on Cleeve Hill, Gloucestershire, last week. Kieran Bourne, 30, believed he saw the animal in his headlights as he travelled to Cheltenham in the early hours of last Tuesday.","The black figure was caught sprinting through the Gloucestershire countryside after apparently being spooked by a walker .

"It is one of the most important weeks of the political calendar - a time when the Prime Minister must convince his party that he is taking Britain in the right direction. But David Cameron hardly seemed raring to go today as the Conservative party conference got under way. Rubbing his eyes and stifling a yawn, the Tory leader looked as though he might fall asleep as Foreign Secretary William Hague addressed delegates in Birmingham. Scroll down for video . Tough at the top: David Cameron looks exhausted as he rubs and closes his eyes during William Hague's speech at the Conservative party conference . Looking tired: David Cameron covers his mouth and narrows his eyes on the first day of the conference . Ready for a nap? The Prime Minister leans his head to one side as he listens to Foreign Secretary William Hague addressing delegates . Mr Cameron, who was sat next to Mr Hague's wife Ffion, is under pressure to reassure his grassroots activists without appearing to abandon the political centre ground. He is to present himself as the heir to Margaret Thatcher, vowing he is ‘not for turning’ on the need to tackle Britain’s debt. And the Prime Minister will go further, claiming to have done more to reform schools, pensions and the EU than the Iron Lady. Making clear his determination to . stick his economic plan, Mr Cameron said today: 'I want us to be the . party that actually levels with the British public and talks very . plainly and straightly about what needs to be done. 'The . fact is we have to find those spending reductions, and if we want to . avoid cuts in things like hospitals and school and the services that we . all rely on, we have to look at things like the welfare budget, where . we’re still spending, as a country, £80bn on working-age welfare. Positive: The Prime Minister manages a smile as he sits next to William Hague's wife Ffion on the first day of the Conservative party conference . Crucial week: David Cameron, pictured with William Hague's wife Ffion, is under pressure to reassure Tory activists without appearing to abandon the political centre ground . 'That’s not the pensions, not the disability benefits, but working age welfare,' he told BBC One's Marr Show. But Mr Cameron risks a row with his . Liberal Democrat coalition partners, after publicly ruling out their . idea of a mansion tax as an attack on people who work hard to buy their . own own. The Lib Dems want an levy on all homes worth more than £2million. But Mr Cameron today said: 'I don't . actually believe we should be a country where if you work hard, you . save, you buy yourself a house, you try and pay down the mortgage, you . save and invest into that house - I don't want to be a country that . comes after you every year with a massive great tax. 'So that is not going to happen. But we have put extra taxes where people buy expensive properties. 'We will always be fair and seen to be fair,' he told the BBC. In . a series of interviews today, the PM has admitted he must ‘raise his . game’ in order to avoid a repeat of the bungling u-turns which have seen . his personal ratings, and those of his party, nosedive. Samantha and David Cameron arrived at the ICC Birmingham today for the start of the Conservative conference where the Prime Minister unveiled a raft of policies aimed at boosting his opinion poll ratings . David Cameron told BBC One's Marr Show that he would would rule out the Liberal Democrat's mansion tax . An . Opinium/Observer poll today put Labour on 41 per cent, up to points, . with Tories on 30 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on nine. But . Mr Cameron will us the conference to insist he will not be diverted . from his austerity plans, demanding billions of pounds of public . spending cuts, in an echo of Mrs Thatcher’s famous ‘the lady’s not for . turning’ promise at the Tory conference in 1980. David Cameron and his ministers will use the Tory conference to unveil a raft of policies in an attempt to boost the party's opinion poll ratings. They include: . Ministers are buoyed by improving economic figures, but are anxious about being seen to publicly predict 'green shoots' of recovery. George Osborne, the chancellor, said he thought the economy was 'healing'. Today, Mr Cameron said he could not predict the next set of economic figures, but was confident that the economy was being rebalanced. But others are more publicly optimistic. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond claimed that the public would see real economic improvement by 2014, provided the Euro remained stable. 'You won't find anybody, hardly anybody in the business community or in the financial community, who thinks that the economy is doing right now what the data tell us it is doing,' Mr Hammond told The Observer. Both the Conservatives and Liberal . Democrats have made clear that their election prospects in 2015 will . depend on the state of the economy. He admits he must do more to ‘explain’ what the government is doing. ‘You spend a lot of time governing and deciding, and you don’t spend enough time explaining. ‘And I think conference week is a real opportunity to get out there and explain.’ But he makes clear there will be no deviation from the need for tough decisions on the economy. Mr Cameron said: ‘I think the British public are extremely fair minded. ‘I . think they know that Britain faces difficult circumstances, they know . the hole that we’re in is quite a deep one, they know it takes time to . get out,’ he told the Sunday Telegraph. ‘Of course, there are things that . we’ve done that they don’t like, of course there are things they wish we . had done differently. That’s in the nature of things But, the public . know this is difficult and tough, and it’s a five year parliament, and . my sense is that they’ll judge us at the end of it rather than half way . through it. ‘We’ve got a lot to prove and there’s no doubt that the mountain in front of us has got steeper and more difficult to climb.’ David Cameron used interviews today to insist he will not be diverted from his 'austerity' economic plan but promised help for homeowners and commuters . The sun shone on the first day of the Tory conference, as senior ministers struck a more upbeat tone on the state of the economy . The conference theme ‘Britain can deliver’ will focus on the economy and try to present a more upbeat vision of the future. As . delegates gather in Birmingham, the PM brushed aside claims he had . failed to take tough decisions and boasted that he had been bolder than . Mrs Thatcher. 'So have we dithered over educational reform? Mrs Thatcher never reformed public sector pensions. We have done that. ‘Mrs Thatcher never vetoed a European treaty. I have done that. ‘Capping welfare payments — no government has ever done that,’ he told The Sun. 'If we just wanted to be popular, we would not have targeted the deficit.' Strategists . hope that taking a tough line with Brussels will recreate the opinion . poll boost enjoyed by the Conservatives after Mr Cameron vetoed a new . treaty in December last year. The . PM today said he would block 'outrageous' attempts to increase the . overall EU budget in looming talks on spending for 2014 to 2020. 'If it comes to saying 'no' to a deal that isn't right for Britain, I'll say 'no',' he told The Sunday Telegraph. David Cameron claimed today that he had been bolder than Margaret Thatcher as he promised to block 'outrageous' EU demands for an even bigger budget . And he set out a 'bold thinking' idea which would split the EU budgets into one for the 17 eurozone nations and another for the 10 - including Britain - outside the single currency. In one of the most eye-catching announcements, Mr Cameron said the government would cap rises in rail fares. Train companies were going to be . allowed to raise the average price of regulated fares - which include . season tickets - by RPI inflation plus three per cent in January 2013 . and then again in January 2014. But . Mr Cameron said that the rise for the next two years will be limited to . RPI plus one per cent, or 4.2 per cent instead of the planned 6.2 per . cent. Some commuters will be over £200 better off over the two years. The PM insisted it was proof that he was not abandoning the political centre ground. 'Are the Conservatives deserting the common ground of British politics? Absolutely not. David Cameron announced that from January, season tickets will rise by 4.2 per cent, and not the planned 6.2 per cent . 'I think the common ground of British politics, right now, ought to be [doing] everything you can to fire up the engines of enterprise and aspiration to get the economy moving, while holding onto the things that people care about passionately, like the NHS. I think that is absolutely where we are.' But Mr Cameron ruled out cuts to benefits for wealthy pensioners. 'Let me be absolutely clear, . the promise that I made at the last election to Britain's pensioners . when I said we are not going to take away your winter fuel allowance, . your free TV licences, your free bus passes - that promise stands.' The Prime Minister also defended the decision to reduce the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p - seized on by Labour as a 'tax cut for millionaires'. 'The richest 10 per cent in our country are not only paying more in income tax, they are paying a greater percentage of the total income tax take than they ever did under Labour,' Mr Cameron said. But Labour's Michael Dugher renewed the attack on the Tories. 'David Cameron can't be a One Nation Prime Minister. He says one thing, but time and again does another,' Mr Dugher said. 'He says those at the top will need to pay more, but he is the man whose top priority is to cut taxes for millionaires, giving 8,000 people earning over £1 million a tax break of £40,000 this April.'","Prime Minister struggles to keep his eyes open as Tory conference begins .

"Celebrities, businesses and even the U.S. State Department have bought bogus Facebook likes, Twitter followers or YouTube viewers from offshore 'click farms,' where workers tap, tap, tap the thumbs up button, view videos or retweet comments to inflate social media numbers. Since Facebook launched almost 10 years ago, users have sought to expand their social networks for financial gain, winning friends, bragging rights and professional clout. And social media companies cite the levels of engagement to tout their value. But an Associated Press examination has found a growing global marketplace for fake clicks, which tech companies struggle to police. Online records, industry studies and interviews show companies are capitalizing on the opportunity to make millions of dollars by duping social media. Celebrities, businesses and even the U.S. State Department have bought bogus Facebook likes, Twitter followers or YouTube viewers from offshore 'click farms' For as little as a half cent per each click, websites hawk everything from LinkedIn connections to make members appear more employable to Soundcloud plays to influence record label interest. 'Anytime there's a monetary value added to clicks, there's going to be people going to the dark side,' said Mitul Gandhi, CEO of seoClarity, a Des Plaines, Illinois, social media marketing firm that weeds out phony online engagements. Italian security researchers and bloggers Andrea Stroppa and Carla De Micheli estimated in 2013 that sales of fake Twitter followers have the potential to bring in $40 million to $360 million to date, and that fake Facebook activities bring in $200 million a year. Big business: Indonesian students share a tablet computer to check their Facebook accounts at a hotspot in Banda Aceh, Indonesia . As a result, many firms, whose values . are based on credibility, have entire teams doggedly pursuing the . buyers and brokers of fake clicks. But each time they crack down on one, . another, more creative scheme emerges. When . software engineers wrote computer programs, for example, to generate . lucrative fake clicks, tech giants fought back with software that . screens out 'bot-generated' clicks and began regularly sweeping user . accounts. YouTube wiped . out billions of music industry video views last December after auditors . found some videos apparently had exaggerated numbers of views. Its . parent-company, Google, is also constantly battling people who generate . fake clicks on their ads. And . Facebook, whose most recent quarterly report estimated as many as 14.1 . million of its 1.18 billion active users are fraudulent accounts, does . frequent purges. That's particularly important for such a company that . was built on the principle that users are real people. Hotspot: Indonesian students check their Facebook accounts at a hotspot in Banda Aceh, Indonesia . Twitter's Jim Prosser said there's no . upside. 'In the end, their accounts are suspended, they're out the . money and they lose the followers,' he said. LinkedIn . spokesman Doug Madey said buying connections 'dilutes the member . experience,' violates their user agreement and can also prompt account . closures. Google and YouTube 'take action against bad actors that seek to game our systems,' said spokeswoman Andrea Faville. Dhaka, Bangladesh, a city of seven million in South Asia, is an international hub for click farms. The . CEO of Dhaka-based social media promotion firm Unique IT World said he . has paid workers to manually click on clients' social media pages, . making it harder for Facebook, Google and others to catch them. 'Those . accounts are not fake, they were genuine,' Shaiful Islam said. A . recent check on Facebook showed Dhaka was the most popular city for . many, including soccer star Leo Messi, who has 51 million likes; . Facebook's own security page, which has 7.7 million likes; and Google's . Facebook page, which has 15.2 million likes. In . 2013, the State Department, which has more than 400,000 likes and was . recently most popular in Cairo, said it would stop buying Facebook fans . after its inspector general criticized the agency for spending $630,000 . to boost the numbers. Growing industry: Indonesian youths browse their social media accounts at an Internet cafe in Jakarta, Indonesia, which has become a hotbed of so-called 'click farms' where fake Facebook likes are generated . In one case, its fan tally rose from about 10,000 to more than 2.5 million. Sometimes there are plausible explanations for click increases. For example, Burger King's most popular city was, for a few weeks this year, Karachi, Pakistan, after the chain opened several restaurants there. While the Federal Trade Commission and several state attorney generals have cracked down on fake endorsements or reviews, they have not weighed in on clicks. Meanwhile, hundreds of online businesses sell clicks and social media accounts from around the world. BuyPlusFollowers sells 250 Google+ shares for $12.95. InstagramEngine sells 1,000 followers for $12. AuthenticHits sells 1,000 SoundCloud plays for $9. It's a lucrative business, said the president and CEO of WeSellLikes.com. 'The businesses buy the Facebook likes because they're afraid that when people go to their Facebook page and they only see 12 or 15 likes, they're going to lose potential customers,' he said. The company official spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he recently moved his company offshore to avoid litigation or cease-and-desist notices. In Indonesia, a social media-obsessed country with one of the world's largest number of Facebook pages and Twitter users, click farms are proliferating. Social network: Teenagers browse their social media accounts at an Internet cafe in Jakarta, Indonesia . Ali Hanafiah, 40, offers 1,000 Twitter followers for $10 and 1 million for $600. He owns his own server, and pays $1 per month per Internet Protocol address, which he uses to generate thousands of social media accounts. Those accounts, he said, 'enable us to create many fake followers.' During an interview at a downtown Jakarta cafe, Hanafiah - wearing a Nike cap, blue jeans and a white T-shirt - said large social networks can boost a business' public profile. 'Today, we are living in a tight competition world that is forcing people to compete with many tricks,' he said. Tony Harris, who does social media marketing for major Hollywood movie firms, said he would love to be able to give his clients massive numbers of Twitter followers and Facebook fans, but buying them from random strangers is not very effective or ethical. 'The illusion of a massive following is often just that,' he said. The fake click market has generated another business: auditors. Robert Waller, founder of London-based Status People, helps clients block fakes. 'We have had a lot of people who have bought fake accounts, realized it's a stupid idea and they're looking for ways to get rid of them,' he said. David Burch, at TubeMogul, a video marketing firm based in Emeryville, California, said buying clicks to promote clients is a grave error. 'It's bad business,' he said, 'and if an advertiser ever found out you did that, they'd never do business with you again.'","Music companies make millions of dollars from duping social media .

"Saved survivor: Dawn Carter's  six-organ transplant surgery took 17 hours . It was an extraordinary operation – transplanting six organs into a 53-year-old woman in 17 hours of surgery. Dawn Carter, only the third patient in Britain to survive such a procedure, now has a new liver, kidney, pancreas, stomach, small intestine and colon. The procedure required four consultants – one to retrieve Dawn’s organs and three to perform the implants, which all came from a 20-year-old female donor. There were also two anaesthetists present, two operating department practitioners, two theatre nurses and two other theatre staff. Without the transplants, Dawn, an intensive care nurse from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, who was suffering from a serious liver disease, had been given just six months to live. Today, as she pats her three spaniels – Bonny, Skye and Jake – after their morning walk with her partner Martin Burch, she says: ‘I’m obviously meant to be here.’ Dawn’s problems started when she was . diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel complaint, at 19. A . decade later, she underwent an operation to remove part of her colon at . Leeds General Infirmary. However, . her problems continued and Dawn needed several more operations, which . eventually left her with just five per cent of her intestine. This meant . her only option was to receive all nutrition and fluids intravenously. For . the next 21 years, Dawn and Martin, who are keen motorsports fans, . travelled to various Formula 1 events and spent several holidays in the . United States. But in 2011, . she was told that her liquidised food had been damaging her liver and . she had end-stage liver disease. Referred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in . Cambridge, her only chance of survival was a multi-organ transplant. ‘It . never crossed my mind that I wouldn’t get a transplant,’ confides Dawn. And so it proved. Two days before Christmas 2011, she was told the . organs had become available. ‘I . didn’t hold any fear about the operation,’ remembers Dawn. ‘In the . anaesthetic room I thought, “This might be the last time I am alive”. But I felt fortunate I was getting this chance.’ Her consultant, Andrew Butler, says Dawn is one of three people in the UK to survive a six-organ transplant in one operation. The first survivor was Stephen Hyett, who received a new liver, kidney, stomach, duodenum, pancreas and small bowel in 1994. Careful timing: The procedure was carried out by four surgeons, two anaesthetists, two operating department practitioners, two theatre nurses and two other theatre staff . According to NHS Blood and Transplant, out of 88,052 transplants that have taken place in Britain, fewer than 30 have involved three or more  organs being transplanted at once. ‘The hard part is co-ordinating removing the old organs with the new ones arriving from another part of the country, as this all has to be done swiftly to ensure survival,’ says Mr Butler. ‘In Dawn’s case, the organs were implanted as one, with as few joins as possible.’ Dawn spent nine weeks on a ventilator in intensive care, with Martin, her mother Dorothy and her brother Larry by her side. Unknown to Dawn at the time, during her stay in intensive care she needed a further 12 operations to rectify complications, which included bleeding from her new liver and pancreas. She also required a 17-pint blood transfusion. When she became aware of her surroundings, she was being fed by tube into her stomach. ‘My fingers and toes were so swollen they looked like pigs’ trotters and my legs and arms were too heavy to lift,’ she says. By March, Dawn had to learn to walk again because her leg muscles were so weak and she also experienced depression. ‘I wasn’t well enough to read and I had no other patients to talk to,’ says Dawn. ‘I hadn’t expected to feel so ill for so long. I lost my hair and nails because all my blood flow was going to my new organs to help them. But I got some wigs and make-up. ‘With my old digestive system, I could eat anything, but my new one felt uncomfortable when I ate and I felt full for hours. I started to wonder if my donor had allergies and if I would crave strange things, but I haven’t.’ After more than five months in hospital, Dawn went home last May. She takes 18 tablets a day – immunosuppressant drugs, antibiotics, enzymes and multi-vitamins. She is now on a phased return to work. She is also setting up a multi-organ transplant support group at Addenbrooke’s Hospital. She says.‘There isn’t a day goes by without me thinking of that person’s gift to me. I sometimes joke that there’s more of her in me than there is of me.’","Dawn Carter, third person ever in Britain to survive such a procedure .

"Tory MP Peter Bone, who is a fierce critic of UK aid policy, branded the legal action as 'bizarre' and 'ridiculous' An Ethiopian farmer has won permission to use taxpayers’ money to sue the British Government ... for sending aid to his homeland. The case, branded ridiculous by MPs, will be funded entirely by the public even though the farmer has never set foot in this country. The 33-year-old Ethiopian – granted anonymity to protect his family – says ministers are funding a one-party state in his country that has breached his human rights. He says foreign aid helped the regime inflict ‘brutal treatment’ on thousands of farmers driven from their land, against the International Development Act 2002. Taxpayers will pay for both the farmer’s lawyers and a defence team from the Department for International Development, in a case that could cost tens of thousands of pounds. This is in addition to the £1.3billion Britain has sent to Ethiopia since 2010. The farmer lodged the court papers from Kenya, before Justice Secretary Chris Grayling introduced rules to prevent cases being brought by those who have never set foot in the UK. The changes, which come into force next month, will mean anybody seeking legal aid in civil cases must have been resident in Britain for at least 12 months. A Whitehall source said: ‘Whatever hardships this man has faced, the idea that someone without any connection to this country can get public money to sue the Government borders on the farcical.’ Tory MP Peter Bone, a fierce critic of UK aid policy, said the legal action was ‘bizarre’, adding: ‘This is a ridiculous case and it is ridiculous there is legal aid for it.’ However, he added: ‘If money is going to a corrupt regime and somebody is pointing that out then we should be taking note of it. That is the problem. A lot of the money goes on propping up corrupt regimes.’ It is not clear how the farmer, a father of six identified only as O, came to bring the case. Papers lodged earlier this year state he had to leave his family and flee to a refugee camp in Kenya after being beaten and tortured trying to protect his land. The UK has contributed to a £510million Protection of Basic Services fund which has allegedly ‘contributed’ to the programme of displacing the farmers. O is not personally seeking compensation, but wants the Government to change its aid policies and stop bankrolling brutal regimes. If he succeeds, ministers could be forced to review donations to other nations accused of atrocities, such as Pakistan and Rwanda. Leigh Day has earned vast sums in legal aid by bringing cases against the Government on behalf of overseas clients. Last year the firm won compensation worth almost £20million for 5,200 Kenyans who were tortured and abused during the Mau Mau rebellion in the Fifties and Sixties. It is also heavily involved in the Al Sweady Inquiry, examining claims that troops executed and tortured Iraqis at a camp near Basra in 2004. The hearings have already cost taxpayers £27million, despite evidence linking the men to a ‘terrorist organisation’. Ethiopia is Africa’s oldest independent country. Apart from a five-year occupation by Mussolini’s Italy, it has never been colonised. Drought, war and famine brought millions to the brink of starvation in the Eighties. This inspired rock stars to launch Band Aid. Now led by the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, its economy has grown rapidly since civil war ended in 1993. However, it is still one of Africa’s poorest states, with its population of  86.5million earning an average of just £240 a year. O is being represented by Rosa Curling of Leigh Day. Her law firm has already brought a string of human rights-based legal aid cases against the State on behalf of overseas claimants who say they have suffered ill-treatment due to government policies. Ministers had urged the High Court to reject the latest claim, but Mr Justice Warby said yesterday it was ‘reasonable’ for O to believe there was a link between the Department for International development handing aid to Ethiopia and alleged human rights abuses. He said O may launch a judicial review to argue the department had ‘failed to have in place any sufficient process to assess Ethiopia’s compliance with the express conditions for receiving UK aid – or to follow such process’. International Development Secretary Justine Greening, who is named as the respondent on the court papers, denies the claims. A department spokesman said: ‘The UK has never funded Ethiopia’s resettlement programmes. Our support to the Protection of Basic Services Programme is only used to provide essential services like healthcare, schooling and clean water.’","Ethiopian man launches taxpayer funded legal action against British Government despite never having set foot in the country .

Enza Fuschini, 58, of Dorset, claimed that Rafferty had given her three of his favourite guitars and that some of his other property was jointly owned by her. But she was left out of the musician's £1.2million will, and today a High Court judge decided that the items - which also included a piano, antique furniture and a Mercedes car - should remain with his family. Dispute: Enzina Fuschini (left) with Gerry Rafferty (right) at a birthday party in 2009. She has lost a court battle with the musician's family over his will . The case had been taken to court to by the will's executors - Rafferty's daughter Martha, of Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, and Russell Roberts, a lawyer and friend of the musician. The items will go to Rafferty's granddaughter, Celia. Ms Fuschini, who was not in court for the hearing, was ordered to pay legal costs. Ms Fuschini, an Italian-born artist, met the singer, originally from Paisley, near Glasgow, at a restaurant in London's West End about two years before his death at 63 in January last year. They hit it off immediately and he moved to Upton, near Poole, to be near the mother-of-three, before the couple moved into a large rented house together nearby. Court battle: Ms Fuschini claimed that Rafferty had given her three of his favourite guitars and that some of his other property was jointly owned by her . She said it was during the months . before his death that Rafferty, who had struggled with an alcohol . problem, made a series of gifts to her, as well as purchasing items for . their joint use. The items, which included three valuable guitars, a Steinway piano, electric keyboard, 13 Matisse lithographs, 22 Russian icons, antique furniture and a Mercedes car, were all kept at their rented home. Ms Fuschini said the gifts of the guitars and piano were made orally and that Rafferty had been teaching her to play in the months before he died. But Mr Roberts said that, after an admission to hospital, the songwriter had asked for some of the items to be returned. Claim: Ms Fuschini argued that a number of Rafferty's possessions should go to her, including a Steinway piano like the one in this photograph . He said that Rafferty, most famous for his 1978 hit Baker Street, had told him he had made no life-time gifts. It was also notable, he argued, that Ms Fuschini only made her claims after his death and had initially said she owned 11 guitars, before revising that down to three. A judge sitting at the High Court in London said there was no contemporaneous evidence of any of the alleged gifts having been made. In her ruling, the judge said: 'At no time did the deceased mention that he had gifted any valuable items to the defendant. 'Most importantly, the defendant herself made no such claim until after the deceased’s death, even at a time when he was asking for return of assets. 'I order formal release to the claimants of the items, together with appropriate declarations as to ownership. 'It seems to me that the defendant must pay the costs of this action.'","Enza Fuschini, 58, claimed musician had given her valuable guitars and artwork .

"Iraqi helicopter gunships struck suspected insurgent positions today in a Government offensive to retake the city of Tikrit from Sunni militants led by ISIS, officials said. The Iraqi military opened its campaign yesterday to wrest back Tikrit, Saddam Hussein’s hometown, with a multi-pronged assault spearheaded by ground troops backed by tanks and helicopters. The predominantly Sunni city, a hotbed of antipathy toward Iraq's Shiite-led Government, is one of two major urban centres that fell to insurgents during their lightning offensive earlier this month.

Local . resident Muhanad Saif al-Din said he could see smoke rising from . Qadissiyah, which borders the University of Tikrit, where troops brought . by helicopter established a bridgehead two days ago. He . added, by telephone, that many of the militants in Tikrit had deployed . to the city's outskirts, apparently to blunt the military attack. Military . spokesman Qassim al-Moussawi told reporters today that the military was . in full control of the university and had raised the Iraqi flag over . the campus. A provincial . official reached by telephone confirmed that the insurgents retained . control of most of Tikrit, and that the fighting was concentrated in . Qadissiyah. He also reported clashes northwest of . the city around an air base that previously served as a US military . facility known as Camp Speicher. The official spoke on condition of . anonymity. The .

The Iraqi army has launched a massive offensive to retake areas in the north that were seized by Islamist-led insurgents in a blitz earlier this month . The militants' surge across the vast Sunni-dominated areas that stretch from Baghdad north and west to the Syrian and Jordanian borders has thrown Iraq into its deepest crisis since US troops withdrew in December 2011. More ominously, the insurgent blitz, which prompted Kurdish forces to assert long-held claims over disputed territory, has raised the prospect of Iraq being cleaved in three along sectarian and ethnic lines. '[Sukhoi 25] jets will enter service within a few days - the coming three or four days - in order to support the units and to fight the terrorist ISIL organisation' Lt Gen Anwar Hama Amin, Iraqi air force commander . For embattled Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, success in Tikrit could help restore a degree of faith his ability to stem the militant tide. Mr al-Maliki, a Shiite who has been . widely accused of monopolising power and alienating Iraq's Sunni and . Kurdish minorities, is under growing pressure to step aside. But he appears set on a third consecutive term as prime minister after his bloc won the most seats in April elections. The . government received a boost in its battle with the militants with the . arrival in Baghdad last night of five Sukhoi 25 warplanes purchased . second-hand from Russia. The aircraft is designed to provide close air support to ground forces and to destroy mobile targets. Delivery: Russian soldiers unload a Russian Sukhoi SU-25 plane in al-Muthanna Iraqi military base at Baghdad Airport . Incoming: The first batch of Russian fighter jets arrived in Baghdad yesterday to help Iraqi forces battle ISIS fighters in the country's north . Ready: Iraqi Kurdish forces take position as they fight jihadist militants from ISIS today in the Iraqi village of Bashir . Preparations: Iraqi soldiers take up position on Friday at Arar town, near the Iraqi border with Saudi Arabia . Iraqi air force commander Lt Gen Anwar Hama Amin said the military is ‘in urgent need of this type of aircraft during this difficult time’. Hundreds of soldiers have been killed since the insurgent offensive began, according to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s security spokesman. The United Nations puts the overall death toll at over 1,000, mostly civilians, since the campaign was launched on June 9. International organisations have urged the establishment of humanitarian corridors to provide aid amid the fighting, with 1.2million people having been displaced by unrest this year in Iraq. World leaders have insisted on a political settlement among Iraq's various communities. And Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, revered among the country's Shiite majority, has urged political leaders to quickly form a government after parliament convenes on Tuesday. Mr al-Maliki has acknowledged that political measures are necessary, but politicians have nevertheless cautioned that naming a new cabinet could still take a month or more. ‘These jets will enter service within a few days - the coming three or four days - in order to support the units and to fight the terrorist ISIL organisation,’ he said, referring to Al Qaeda breakaway group ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant), which has spearheaded the Sunni militant offensive. The planes could be deployed in the fight for Tikrit, a predominantly Sunni city of more than 200,000 some 80 miles north of Baghdad, where anger toward Iraq's Shiite-led government runs deep. The Islamic State, which already controls vast swaths in northern and eastern Syria amid the chaos of that nation's civil war, aims to erase the borders of the modern Middle East and impose its strict brand of Sharia law. In Iraq, the group has formed an alliance of sorts with fellow Islamic militants as well as former members of former dictator Saddam's Baath party, with all of them hoping to overthrow al-Maliki's Shiite-led government. The militants have tapped into deep-seated discontent among Iraq's Sunnis, who largely dominated the country until the US-led overthrow of Saddam brought the Shiite majority to power. Since then, Sunnis have complained of discrimination and said they are unfairly targeted by the country's security forces.","Government offensive to retake Tikrit from Sunni militants led by ISIS .

"The estranged wife of one of three terror suspects accused of plotting a huge suicide bombing attack offered to be the group's 'fourth lion', a court heard today. Salma Kabal allegedly told her husband Ashik Ali, 27, that she could be the 'lioness' of the group - a reference to the black comedy film Four Lions, which concerns four incompetent jihadists. Ali, Irfan Naseer, 31, and Irfan Khalid, 27, are accused of planning an attack bigger than the London bombings which killed 52 people on July 7, 2005. On trial: . Irfan Naseer (left), Irfan Khalid (centre) and Ashik Ali (right) are accused of plotting a terror attack bigger than the London suicide bombings of July 7, 2005 . Woolwich Crown Court in London has . heard that the home-grown terror cell wanted to kill up to 2,000 people . by detonating eight rucksack bombs in crowded areas. Ms Kabal, who was trying to reconcile . her relationship with Ali, is not accused of being involved and did not . know what the group were allegedly planning as her husband repeatedly . withheld the truth from her, prosecutor Brian Altman QC told a jury. Ali told his wife he was planning on fighting jihad abroad and said he did not want to get her involved, the court heard. He said he still loved her but . repeatedly said they could not be together and warned her she would not . be able to adapt to fighting jihad abroad, making reference to the . threat of drone strikes, the hearing was told. Satire: The terror trial heard of references to the black comedy movie Four Lions, which concerns a group of incompetent jihadists . References to Four Lions and the . Olympics, were important as they suggested there were three people . involved in the plot and that the plan was to carry out an attack in the . UK, Mr Altman said. The three men are accused of engaging . in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, which they deny. They were . allegedly part of a plot involving 11 men. Naseer is accused of five counts of . the offence, Khalid four and Ali three, all between Christmas Day 2010 . and September 19 last year. For Naseer, from Sparkhill, Khalid, . from Sparkbrook, and Ali, from Balsall Heath, all in Birmingham, this is . alleged to have included planning a bombing campaign, collecting money . for terrorism and recruiting others for terrorism. Arrest: The house in Balsall Heath, Birmingham, where Ashik Ali, 26, was arrested. A jury heard recordings from police bugs in Ali's flat, which prosecutors claim would have been used as a  bomb-making factory . Naseer and Khalid are also accused of . travelling to Pakistan for training in terrorism, and it is alleged . that Naseer also helped others to travel to the country for the same . purpose. The trial continues on Friday. Today the jury heard a series of . secret recordings from Ali's flat - an alleged 'bomb factory' - in which . men could be heard branding westerners 'animals' who want to 'have sex . like donkeys on the street' before boasting: 'Why shouldn't we terrorise . them?' The group are also heard discussing plans to get 'three of four brothers' to do a 'second whack' after their deaths. No targets had been pinpointed and . police arrested eleven men and one woman in September last year before . the plan could be realised, the court heard. Naseer, who allegedly trained in terror camps in Afghanistan with Khalid, is heard talking about the first UK attack. In the dock: A sketch of terror suspects Ashik Ali, Irfan Naseer and Irfan Khalid appearing at court . He adds: 'And get another three of four brothers and do a second whack, you get me, later on. That's the thing, that's the one.' In the extracts the trio are also heard justifying their actions and referring to Westerners as 'animals'. The jury heard Naseer allegedly said: . 'They wanna have sex like donkeys on the street, they wanna club, act . like animals and why shouldn't we terrorise them, tell me that?' 'You think about it, if someone came . in your house yeah and started dancing and throughout the night and . started basically having orgies and smoking drugs and stuff...you would . terrorise them ainit.' Naseer also tells the others that to 'give your life' while carrying out a jihad was the 'greatest thing'. The men deny the charges and the case continues.

"The number of stay-at-home mothers is dropping at a rate of 450 a day and is about to fall below two million for the first time, official figures reveal. The Office for National Statistics said just 2.005million women are full-time mothers, compared to three million in 1993. Many say they have been forced to return to work by rising household bills at a time when their partner’s wages have been frozen, or have hardly increased, for six years. A thing of the past: The image of the house-bound housewife was once ingrained on the national consciousness, such as in this 1963 advert. Nowadays the number of stay-at-home mothers is falling rapidly . Meanwhile more women are employed than ever before, the ONS said, with 67.9 per cent of those aged 16 to 64 in a job. The figures represent an extraordinary social change. When ONS records began in 1971, only half of women worked. Lynne Burnham, of support group Mothers at Home Matter, said: ‘More than 80 per cent of parents recently cited financial difficulties as the main factor in pressurising them or their partner to return to work. ‘Current house prices and the high cost of rent are also factors pushing more stay-at-home parents back into the workplace.’ Family expert Jill Kirby said mothers 'would like to have more time for their families' The way in which the tax system recognises marriage has been the subject of furious debate at Westminster. A long-awaited tax break for married couples, which comes into force next April, will allow a parent to  transfer £1,000 of their personal tax-free income allowance to their spouse. Around 3.4million couples are expected to benefit, but it means a saving of only £200 a year, or £3.85 a week. David Cameron, who has promised a tax break for married couples since 2005, says he would like to make it more  substantial if he is re-elected. Next year, a far more generous perk is being introduced for couples who both work.  Parents will be able to get up to £2,000 per child off annual childcare bills. More than 14million women aged 16 and over have a job, and that number is growing by around 1,800 every day. For many higher earning families, the loss of their child benefit in January last year has added to the pressure on women to go back to work. Around 1.1million parents lost some or all of their eligibility for child benefit when the Government changed the rules. Many mothers opt for self-employment, which allows them to control the hours that they work and to fit them around family life, such as not working during school holidays. One mother on the Netmums website wrote of the emotional torture of working full-time with very young children. She said: ‘I work full-time and my daughter is in full-time  nursery 8am to 6am. Life is chaotic. I feel incredibly guilty. We spend the weekends not enjoying our time off, but trying to catch up on housework. It is not a life. ‘I get seriously stressed and then worn out and ill. It is horrible, isn’t it? But when you need to earn money to live, it is not possible to be at home.’ Jill Kirby, a family expert and the author of The Price of Parenthood, said recently: ‘The pressure continues to increase for mothers to work to support the family finances. Yet we know from so many surveys and studies that mothers would like to have more time for their families. ‘The Government and the Opposition are totally focused on childcare, but nobody stops to question if this is what women really want.’","More women are employed than ever with two thirds aged 16 to 64 in work .

"Cristiano Ronaldo has an irregular extra bone in his ankle - a condition that only affects 10 per cent of the population. The discovery was made when the Real Madrid striker, who has been talismanic for the Champions League holders, received treatment on an injury five years ago. Ronaldo went to doctors after suffering a knock while playing for Real against Marseille in 2009, as revealed in a new book CR7 - The Secrets of the Machine, written by Luis Miguel Pereira and serialised in the Sun. The Hulk: Cristiano Ronaldo was found to have an extra bone in his ankle by doctors back in 2009 . And that's sealed it! The Portuguese netted a late penalty in Saturday's Champions League final . Building: Ronaldo was caught in Sporting Lisbon's gym late at night in a bid to reach peak fitness . A course of physio sorted the extra bone out without the need of an operation. Fitness has always been a fascination for Ronaldo, who was caught using Sporting Lisbon's gym late out of night without permission. A security report stated at the time: 'We hereby wish to inform you the athletes Cristiano Ronaldo and Jose Semedo used, without permission, the main fitness and bodybuilding gym where they were found at 11.30pm by the security guard.' Youth coach Luis Martins said: 'I explained to Cristiano that he couldn't go further than what was prescribed to him because that would be harmful for his body and health.' The news hardly comes as a surprise, given the 29-year-old has always been slightly different to the norm. Ronaldo carried Carlo Ancelotti's side for large parts of last season and prised the Ballon d'Or off Barcelona's Lionel Messi. The former Manchester United man scored more goals than anyone else has done before in Europe and sealed the trophy in Lisbon on Saturday night against city rivals Atletico.","Discovery was found in Portugal striker's ankle back in 2009 .

"Britain’s top 10 benefits claimants were paid on average  more in handouts than someone earning over £85,000, it can be revealed. Average welfare payments to 10 families were worth on average more than £1,100-a-week before a cap on payments was introduced. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said he was determined to end the ‘ludicrous situation’ where people on benefits had a higher income than the average wage of someone who goes out to work. Latest figures show that between April 2013 and March 2014, 42,252 households were affected by the benefit cap, which limits welfare payments to £500-a-week . The figures mean the 10 highest benefits claimants an average each week - higher than the gross weekly pay of dentists, accountants and teachers and almost as much as a senior police officer . The benefits cap is set at £500-a-week, or £26,000-a-year - chosen by ministers because it is close to the average pre-tax wage of someone in work. The new figures relate to the amount households were able to claim before the cap was introduced. The largest sums are likely to have been driven by large claims for housing benefit. More than 42,000 households have seen their benefits cut since the cap came into force in April last year. Until now the Department for Work and Pensions had only said that 96 had been receiving more than £900-a-week. Officials has refused to release details of each of the highest claimants to protect their identity. But now ministers have confirmed that the average payment amount the top 10 claimants had been capped by was £607. This means that on average they were receiving £1,107-a-week, or £57,564-a-year. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the government was ending the 'ludicrous situation' of people on benefits receiving more than average workers' incomes . The benefits cap covers Housing Benefit, Income Support, Incapacity Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance. Severe Disablement Allowance Other payments included are Bereavement Allowance, Carer’s Allowance, Child Benefit, Child Tax Credit, most Employment and Support Allowance,Guardian’s Allowance, Maternity Allowance. With the data only providing the average for the top 10, the figure for the highest recipients is likely to be much higher. Someone on an annual salary of £85,000 would have take-home pay of only £56,444. According to the Office for National Statistics, a dentist's pre-tax pay is £972-a-week, a chartered accountant £716.90 and a secondary school teacher £644.10. Mr . Duncan Smith told MailOnline: ‘The benefit cap has addressed the . ludicrous situation we were in where people were receiving far more in . benefits than the ordinary hardworking family earns. ‘It is not right that before we introduced it some families could rake in more than double the amount that the average taxpayer takes home. ‘By limiting the amount any household can receive to £26,000 a year we are restoring fairness to the system. ‘Our reforms are helping people move off benefits and into work, and already we have seen that more than 100 people affected by the benefit cap have moved into work every week on average since its introduction.’ The benefit cap is set at £500 a week for couples, with or without children, and single parents. An adult living alone is limited to £350-a-week. Latest figures show that between April 2013 and March 2014, 20,088 families received between £500 and £550 in benefits, meaning they lost £50 under the cap. A further 11,583 were capped after receiving £550-£600 and 5,311 were given £600-£650. Overall 96 received £900-a-week or more, equivalent to £46,800-a-year. Earlier this year, MailOnline submitted a freedom of information request asking for the top 10 households by the amount they have been capped by per week, giving the amount each had been capped by and the region they live in. The figures show that most families hit by the benefits cap live in London and the South East . But the Department for Work and Pensions refused, insisting it is a ‘criminal offence to release Social Security information relating to an individual without lawful authority to do so’, even though the request had not asked for the names of the people affected. Since then Tory MP Charlie Elphicke asked a parliamentary question for the ‘highest amount is that a single household has been capped as a result of the benefit cap’. Employment minister Esther McVey replied: ‘Of the top 10 highest capped households at the end of March 2014, the average capped amount was £607 per week.’","Benefits cap set at average pay of £500-a-week or £26,000-a-year .

"Comedian Frankie Boyle was awarded more than £54,000 damages today after a High Court jury found he had been libelled by a newspaper which had described him as 'racist'. The jury concluded that Mr Boyle, 40, from Glasgow, had been defamed by the Daily Mirror. After the verdict, the comedian gave a V-for-Victory sign on the court steps and revealed that he would be donating the money to charity. 'Very happy': Comedian Frankie Boyle gives a 'V-for-Victory' sign as he leaves the High Court after being awarded more than £54,000 damages following his libel battle with the Daily Mirror . Mr Boyle said he had sued because he had always 'made a point' of being 'anti-racist'. He had claimed that a Daily Mirror article published on July 19 last year defamed him by describing him as 'Racist comedian Frankie Boyle' and saying he had been 'forced to quit' BBC panel show Mock The Week. Daily Mirror publisher Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) defended the article, arguing that the 'racist' description was either true or 'honest comment on a matter of public interest'. MGN also argued that the words 'forced to quit' did not mean that Mr Boyle had been sacked and were not defamatory. But jurors ruled in Mr Boyle's favour after a week-long trial in London. Action: Mr Boyle said he had sued because he had always 'made a point' of being 'anti-racist' They awarded Mr Boyle £50,400 damages for the 'racist' assertion and a further £4,250 in relation to the claim that he was 'forced to quit' the BBC show. Mr Boyle was also awarded legal costs, estimated to be in the region of £100,000. During the hearing, the jury was shown a series of the comedian's jokes from Mock The Week and his Channel 4 show Tramadol Nights. After the verdict, Mr Boyle tweeted: 'I'm very happy with the jury's decision and their unanimous rejection of the Mirror's allegation that I am a racist. Donation: In messages posted on Twitter, Mr Boyle said he was 'very happy' with the jury's decision and would be giving his damages to charity . 'Racism is still a very serious problem in society which is why I've made a point of always being anti-racist in my life and work and that's why I brought this action.' MGN lawyers had told jurors that Mr . Boyle was a 'racist comedian' who gratuitously exploited negative . stereotypes of black people for 'cheap laughs'. A barrister representing MGN, Ronald Thwaites QC, said the comedian was 'callous' and 'insensitive'. He . said jurors should not find in the comedian's favour but, if they did, . they should show their 'contempt' by awarding damages of 45p - the price . of a copy of the Daily Mirror. Mr Boyle denied 'punctuating' material with racist references or making 'gratuitous' use of black people. He told jurors that characters he played might express racist views, but he did not.

"A tourist had to be rescued from one of Scotland's highest mountains after attempting to climb the peak wearing flip-flops. The walker and two friends were exploring 4,006ft Aonach Mor in Lochaber near Fort William to ""see the snow"" when he slipped and hurt his ankle on Wednesday night. A team from Lochaber Mountain Rescue were called out and said they were ""amazed"" to see the casualty's choice of footwear. Painful lesson: The unnamed tourist, pictured left, had to be stretchered off the mountain by rescuers . They reported that one of the injured man's companions was bare-foot when they saw him and the other was wearing trainers. Members of Lochaber Mountain Rescue . stretchered the injured man to the mountain's gondola lift and then on . to a waiting ambulance which took him to the Belford Hospital at Fort . William. His condition is unknown. It is understood the trio had taken the gondola up the mountain - a sister peak of the UK's highest mountain, Ben Nevis - on Wednesday and then walked to the Goose area . which still has pockets of snow. Rescue team leader John Stevenson said: 'We . found them 20 minutes from the top of the gondola - which the staff . especially kept open for us to get up. The were on the grass. We don't . know if they actually had reached the snow or were on their way back . from it. There is still plenty of deep snow on the hill. 'But . they said they wanted to stand on snow in Scotland. We don't know if . they actually did. The grass was wet enough to have an accident - . especially in flip-flops.' Big draw: The group were exploring 4,006ft Aonach Mor in Lochaber near Fort William to ""see the snow"" Mr Stevenson said his team were amazed at the group's choice of footwear: 'People really need to wear the right shoes. It is still wet in places on the hill and ironically the chap who had bare feet was probably better off than his companions' 'One of our team members, John Macrae, actually . hurled one of the flips-flops and told the guy 'that's how much use they . are on the hill! 'He went and got it back for him but the bloke got the message. We believe they were from abroad and were tourists. 'I . know in some countries they wear flip-flops to climb hills but we told . them next time they come back to Scotland to stand on snow wear . something more appropriate - like a good pair of boots. 'They said they were sorry for 'all the fuss.'' Despite the onset of summer, a snow warning was issued to climbers and walkers on neighbouring Ben Nevis, Britain's highest mountain, and other Scottish mountains only two weeks ago. But the Mountaineering Council of Scotland warned that 'winter is still lingering on the roof of Scotland.' Team effort: Images on Lochaber Mountain Rescue's website show a rescuer carrying a stretcher and the rescue team's doctor, Brian Tregaskis, making their way up the mountain . Heather Morning, the Mountain Safety Advisor with the 12,000-strong MCoS, advised those heading to climb 4409-ft Ben Nevis to be aware of the late lying snow beds and ""be cautious."" 'Walking on snow in summer can really add to your day out on the hill and be a lot of fun if the snow is relatively flat. However, be warned: if you take a slip and start to slide - is there a chance that slide could take you over the edge?' she said. 'There are still large cornices - ledges of snow hanging over the edge of the cliff face - on Ben Nevis and many other Scottish Munros (mountains over 3000 ft). 'Care should be taken to avoid these and stay on the rocky terrain - particularly in misty conditions when it might be difficult to see the edge.' Ms Morning added that a particular risk was in the underfoot conditions. The Scottish mountains hold snow long into the spring and early summer. These snow patches will often be hard and located high up on the shady, north side of the mountain. Hill walkers are advised to treat these old snow patches with caution, particularly if the 'run out' below is over steep ground. Carey Davies, the British Mountaineering Council's hill walking officer, said: 'When spring arrives a lot of people feel the pull of the mountains and want to get outdoors again. But sometimes people get caught out at this time of year. While it may feel like spring has sprung at low levels, up on the mountain tops it can be a very different story. 'If you're going into the hills remember you may encounter the white stuff - anything from the odd patch to large areas. So be prepared!'","Walkers were exploring 4,006ft Aonach Mor .

"It claimed to anonymously expose the boorish and insensitive comments made by Goldman Sachs employees overheard in the firm's elevators. Indeed, so popular and damning was the @GSElevator Gossip Twitter account that an internal inquiry was set up to discover the name of the indiscreet employee who also found himself bagging a six-figure book deal based on the tweets. But now, the identity of this rogue trader has been revealed to be 34-year-old former bond executive, John Lefevre, who not only lives in Texas, but has never even worked for Goldman Sachs - much to their relief. Revealed: This is John Lefevre - who is living in Texas at the moment and who has never worked for Goldman Sachs. He has been exposed as the fake employee behind the @GSElevator Twitter account which lampoons Wall Street bankers . Outed after almost three years of off-color tweets purporting to expose Wall Street culture, such as 'I never give money to homeless people. I can’t reward failure in good conscience,' Lefevre has claimed in an interview with the New York Times that he knew that this 'day would come'. Claiming he was 'surprised it has taken this long', Lefevre, who graduated prestigious Babson College in 2001, said that he started the Twitter account 'as a joke to entertain' himself. Rumors that the author of @GSElevator was not even an employee of the Wall Street giant began months ago and Lefevre has assiduously tried to remove all mentions of his name and images from the Internet. Contacted by the New York Times a few weeks ago, Lefevre, who did admit to working for Citigroup for seven years, was slightly ambiguous about his connection to Goldman Sachs. 'To preempt what you’re about to say, legally speaking,' he said, 'I was never explicitly an employee of the firm.' The Twitter account was so popular that Goldman Sachs launched an internal inquiry to discover the identity of the indiscreet tweeter . He did admit that he was offered a job as head of debt syndicate in Asia at Goldman Sach's Hong King Office in August 2010. However, according to the New York Times this offer was revoked after his his employer at the time said that he could not leave because Goldman Sachs were a competitor. 'Things turned nasty with my old boss and he threatened a lawsuit against me and Goldman,' said Lefevre. Lefevre said that Goldman never withdrew their job offer, saying mysteriously, 'I don’t know how much I can talk about it. It wasn’t acrimonious.' He categorically denied ever trying to pretend he was ever an employee of Goldman or that he was motivated by anger at not being able to take on his job in 2010. 'This was never about me as a person,' he said. 'It wasn’t about a firm. The stories aren’t Goldman Sachs in particular. It was about the culture in general.' Poking fun: The tweets that Lefevre posted show a keen sense of how out-of-touch bankers can present themselves to the average-Joe on Main Street . Loud and boorish: The brash reputation of bankers is played up to on the GS Elevator Gossip Twitter feed . According to his limited professional profile's online, LeFevre works as a hedge fund manager for Amias Berman, which only has a dozen or so employees and is headquartered in London. For their part, Goldman Sachs declared themselves relieved that they do not have an internal leak. A spokesman said, 'We are pleased to report that the official ban on talking in elevators will be lifted effective immediately.' It seems that Lefevre's publisher, Touchstone, does not mind that he is not an actual employee of Goldman Sachs either. 'He’s been pretty straight with us the entire time, so this is not a surprise,' said the book’s editor, Matthew Benjamin, who bought the book without ever meeting Mr. Lefevre, according to the New York Times. Stark realities: The account purely played up to a sense of humor that those involved in huge international finance would share . Cutting: The humor and parody at the center of the Twitter feed caused a panic at Goldman Sachs when it was launched in 2011 . Despite tweeting on fictitious comments overheard in Goldman Sachs' elevators, Lefevre has a very real agent, who claims that everything in his upcoming book is true. 'What matters is that every story in the book is true. John’s material he delivered is hilarious,' said Byrd Leavell to the New York Times. 'The book isn’t going to live or die on whether he worked at Goldman Sachs for two months or not.' Lefevre said that he started at Citigroup in New York in 2001 following his graduation from Babson College business school. He spent stints in London and Hong Kong and decided to start the Twitter account in the fall of 2011. Inspired by an account called @CondeElevator - which reported on what was going on in the elevators of the parent company of Vogue - Lefevre said that he thought he could do better. Headquarters: Goldman Sachs Tower in Exchange Place Jersey City . 'I thought, ‘This is ridiculous that people are infatuated with Condé Nast. If they only saw the elitist, sexist and out-of-touch things bankers say.’ People had no idea what it is really like.' Despite still working in finance, Lefevre seems to have a healthy contempt for the more outrageous and out-of-touch comments he has overheard bankers make. 'Even socializing with them — going to bars and having guys buy girls drinks and then throw out a line like, ‘Don’t worry ladies, these drinks are on Goldman Sachs.’ He claims he picked on Goldman Sachs due to their fame, but that despite collecting all these stories for year - he does not want to mock his colleagues on Wall Street. 'I do not have an agenda to paint the people or this culture one way or the other,' said LeFevre to The New York Times. Claiming that his tweets have evolved over time, Lefevre said that like any good capitalist he wants the most people to read his posts so that they are re-tweeted prodigiously.","Man responsible for @GSElevator Gossip Twitter account revealed to be a 34-year-old former Wall Street banker living in Texas who has never worked for Goldman Sachs .

"Plans for a large, Muslim-only cemetery to be built on a plot of rural land have upset residents, who have publicly objected to the new development. People from Catherine-de-Barnes, near Solihull in the West Midlands, have objected to the 'major development', which will include space for 4,000 followers of Islam to be buried, and 75 parking spaces for visitors. As the latest census figures give the village's population as just 613, this means the cemetery could eventually hold six-and-a-half times as many people as Catherine-de-Barnes itself. Rural: Residents of Catherine-de-Barnes, in the West Midlands, have objected to a proposed Muslim-only cemetery . Objections: Letters submitted to the council say that the plans come too soon after other developments . In the rural settlements of Solihull, the most predominant ethnic group is White, with all settlements - apart from Dickens Heath and Catherine-de-Barnes - having a White population of between 97 per cent and 99 per cent. Census data from 2001 reveals that of the 11,654 population of the Bickenhill ward (of which Catherine-de-Barnes is part), 37 people registered their religion as Muslim. In mid-2009, it was estimated that there were 21,500 Black or Asian Ethnic Minority (BAME) residents in Solihull, equating to 10.5 per cent of the borough’s population compared with 12.5 per cent in England and 14.4 per cent of the West Midlands. By 2013, there were significantly more Muslims (+3,610, 221 per cent) than in 2001. The majority of Solihull residents describe themselves as Christian (65.6 per cent), with no religion the second largest group (21.4 per cent). The Asian population represents the largest proportion of BAME groups in the rural areas of Solihull, with the exception of Catherine-de-Barnes, where 'other' ethnic groups make up the greatest proportion of BME groups. The cemetery would be able to comply . fully with Sharia law - which stipulates a method of bathing and . shrouding the bodies of Muslims, before they are buried with their heads . facing towards Mecca. Solihull Council has received several letters of complaint about the plans, which were proposed by Mohammed Moosa. The objections focus on the size of the cemetery, and the decision to place the patch on fertile land in the green belt. One letter, from villager Karen Guest, 51, said: 'We are amazed at yet another planning application on this beautiful arable land following the recent dogs' home planning approval. 'If further applications are approved then sooner rather than later the whole acreage will be built up.' Another, from Pam Gibbins, said: 'I must protest vigorously. We are not talking about a small parochial cemetery, but a major development that will impact on the traffic system.' Letters have also been received in support of the venture. One, signed by five supporters, said: 'I agree that a Muslim cemetery would be preferred and beneficial for the Muslim residents in the borough of Solihull. 'I would like to confirm the need for a private Muslim burial ground, which adheres to all Islamic bereavement values and laws.' Slow down: One council member said the cemetery was not 'an appropriate development in greenbelt land' A planning statement from Cemetery Development Services said: 'Few burial authorities are able to facilitate full Muslim burials in accordance with the practice of Sharia Law.' Bob Sleigh, a member of the town council, said there is sufficient space already available at the borough's two main cemeteries. He said: 'The issue here is whether there is an over-riding need and I don't believe there is.' 'I do not believe this is an appropriate development in greenbelt land. Residents who have spoken to me, including the parish council and residents association, have concerns about the design and vehicles access. 'The access road is a dangerous road and residents have concerns over the increase in traffic this development will cause.' Dr Issam Ghannam, a Solihull Imam, said: 'We have a growing Muslim population in Solihull. We have also an ageing population and plots are filling up. 'The nearest Muslim cemetery is Handsworth and it can be extremely difficult for relatives to visit their loved ones.'","Residents of Catherine-de-Barnes, near Solihull, West Midlands, objected  to the huge development after realising it would be for 4,000 people .

"Shopper: A Muslim worker at a Tesco store refused to serve customer Julie Cottle (pictured) who was buying ham and wine because he said it was Ramadan . A Muslim cashier at a Tesco store refused to serve a customer buying ham and wine because he said it was Ramadan. The till operator told Julie Cottle he would not touch the items as they are considered forbidden by Islam and said she should use the self- service tills instead. When Miss Cottle, 43, from Neasden, north-west London, complained to the manager, he backed the worker’s right to refuse to serve her because it was the holy month of Ramadan and he was fasting. But Tesco has now apologised for Monday’s incident and said the worker had been ‘spoken to’. Miss Cottle said her treatment left her furious. ‘He pointed at the ham and wine in my basket and said “I can’t serve you that because I’m fasting”,’ she said. ‘When I told him he should be serving customers not turning them away he still refused, telling me to go to the self-service. ‘I know he has his beliefs – I’m a Christian myself – but he should be able to do his job properly. I’m disgusted. If he is refusing to do his job he shouldn’t be there.’ During Ramadan Muslims go without food and drink between dawn and dusk. The devout also refrain from smoking, swearing, arguing, listening to music and having sex to demonstrate their faith. Following the yearly ritual is considered as one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Miss Cottle, a mother of three, said she went to a Tesco Express to get two packets of ham for her children’s lunches. She also had three bottles of white wine among her shopping. ‘There was an Asian man at the till,’ she said. ‘He said he couldn’t serve me because he was fasting for Ramadan. He told me I had to use the self-service. ‘I started shouting and he went to the back of the shop. I asked to see the manager. He was a temporary manager and he said I had to use the self-service. ‘I was furious so when I got home I rang Tesco customer service to complain. Forbidden: The till operator at the store in Neasden told mother-of-three Miss Cottle he would not touch the wine and ham as they are considered 'forbidden' by Islam, and told her to go to a self-service till instead . Branch: Tesco has since apologised for the incident at this store in north-west London and said the worker has been 'spoken to' ‘All they said was “that does not sound right but if it is ok with the manager that’s ok”.’ Tesco has since apologised to Miss Cottle over the incident and a spokesman said the worker had been spoken to. ‘We’re . here to serve our customers the products they choose to buy,’ he said. ‘We don’t have a specific policy and take a pragmatic approach if a . colleague raises concerns about a job they have been asked to do. ‘We apologise to our customer for any inconvenience on this occasion.’ Location: The incident happened at one of the firm's many London stores, in the suburb of Neasden .","Julie Cottle, 43, tried to buy items during shopping trip in north London .

"Thousands of schoolchildren's education could have been threatened by a hardline Muslim plot to force out moderate school governors and heads and replace them with extremists. It emerged today that 25 Birmingham schools are now being investigated for links to the alleged radicalisation plot, and while Birmingham City Council has refused to name the schools, some of which have upwards of 600 students, it means that vast numbers of pupils could have been at risk. The number of schools allegedly involved rose today from 15 to 25 as Education Secretary Michael Gove is said to have told Ofsted inspectors to fail any school 'where religious conservatism is getting in the way of learning and a balanced curriculum'. This afternoon Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg backed the investigations, saying schools should not be allowed to become 'silos of segregation'. Scroll down for video . It emerged today that 25 schools in Birmingham, including Park View Academy, pictured, are being investigated by Ofsted over allegations that Muslim extremists were trying to force out moderate headteachers . As the scale of the alleged plot became apparent, Birmingham City Council appointed a new chief adviser, former head teacher Ian Kershaw, to handle at least 200 complaints received in relation to the 'Trojan Horse' alleged plot to take over primary, secondary, and community schools as well as academies in the city. The unsigned and undated Trojan Horse letter claimed that a small but radical group of Muslims was pursuing its own agenda in the classrooms, with uncooperative headteachers and governors forced out. It said that the plot had caused 'a great amount of organised disruption' in the city, crediting it with forcing a change of leadership at four schools. At the centre of the scandal is Birmingham’s Park View Academy, where it is alleged that £70,000 was spent on loudspeakers to call pupils to Islamic prayers. Birmingham City Council's investigation will run beside a separate inquiry by the Department for Education (DfE), and will report back on 15 schools initially next month, with a fuller report due in July. Headteachers and governors judged to be performing 'inadequately' in terms of pushing religious views to the detriment of children's education may be immediately dismissed. Since the appearance of the letter in March, anonymous whistle-blowers including former staff have come forward, making claims that boys and girls were segregated in classrooms and assemblies, and sex education was banned. It was also alleged that non-Muslim staff had been bullied, and in one case it was alleged that the teachings of a firebrand Al Qaeda-linked Muslim preacher praised to pupils. Investigation: Education Secretary Michael Gove, left, and Birmingham City Council leader Sir Albert Bore, right . Birmingham City Council today announced the six-month appointment of Mr Kershaw, managing director of Northern Education, to handle the investigation, and the council said it was also setting up a review group made up of MPs, councillors, police and faith groups. The council's leader, Sir Albert Bore, said the investigation was slowed by the two-tier school system, which meant that academies, which are at the centre of the allegations, were answerable not to the local authority but to the DfE, calling the situation 'frustrating in the extreme'. And Sir Albert suggested that the alleged Muslim extremist plot may extend beyond Birmingham, saying that his authority had spoken to councils in both Manchester and Bradford. He said: 'There are certainly issues in Bradford which have similarities with the issues being spoken about in Birmingham.' Fresh claims . have emerged in Manchester and at Bradford's . Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College and Carlton Bolling . College. An Ofsted spokesman said it had not begun inspections there, but did not rule it out. Sir Albert also said that West Midlands Police, which has reopened a fraud inquiry into one of the schools caught up in the allegations, was still looking into the authorship of the Trojan Horse document, the authenticity of which is still unclear. Lindsey Clark, the headteacher of Park View, said she would act against anyone plotting against the school . One of the schools being investigated over extremist infiltration cancelled its annual visit from Father Christmas last year.Teacher Vicky Hubble, who organised the event at the secular Ladypool Primary School, was allegedly told to cancel it by the new Muslim headmaster, Huda Aslam.He is said to have told her there would be no presents and ‘no mention’ of Jesus being the son of God.According to a fellow teacher, Mr Aslam wanted to reduce festivities to little more than sing-alongs to songs such as Jingle Bells, but was forced to reinstate the Christmas assembly by Birmingham Council. However, Santa remained banned. But a DfE official said yesterday: ‘Extreme religious conservatism often acts as an . entry to later problems. ‘A . child who is brought up age eight, nine, ten, believing that you should . segregate the sexes and hand out Islamic textbooks is more likely to be . radicalised in later life.’ David Cameron has promised ‘swift action’ to ensure schools are not used to spread terrorist ideology. Birmingham city council froze appointments of any new school governors last week. But MPs said change should have come sooner. Liam Byrne, Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, which covers several of the schools, said the probe was moving at ‘glacial’ speed. Birmingham . MP Khalid Mahmood said that the council has known of the claims for . ‘eight years at least’ but had failed to act for fear of ‘appearing . anti-Muslim’.","Plot against Birmingham schools was uncovered in document last month .

"Six thugs have been jailed for 36 years after battering two men almost to death because they were black and non-Muslim. Ringleader Abu Bakr Mansha - who was previously jailed under the Terrorism Act for plotting to kill or harm a decorated soldier - was with a teenage boy when the pair began the unprovoked attack at a busy Tesco store in Bow, east London. He assaulted the two victims before following them home to discover where they lived - then called four other thugs to help. Vicious: Abu Bakr Mansha, 30 (pictured), has been jailed for 10 years for launching a vicious, unprovoked attack on two men which began in a Tesco supermarket because they were black and non-Muslim . Armed with baseball bats, they beat the two men in a vicious attack which left both victims needing hospital . treatment for serious injuries. One of the victims, who were 40 and 49 at the time, suffered two broken wrists and a fractured skull. The Inner London Crown Court heard there was both a religious element and a racial element to the attack on the two men, who were black and non-Muslim. The vicious assault sparked an investigation by the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command. All six of the attackers, who the Met Police confirmed were Muslim, pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent. Judge Ian Darling said: 'Not only was there a religious aspect to this offence, but there was an undoubted racial element. Salim Jada, 32 (left) and Javed Patel, 29 (right) both of Newham, north London, were jailed for eight years each . 'Both . prior to and after the attack, Mr Mansha is heard to use language that . is foul, unacceptable and which reveals a degree of racial intolerance . that is worrying.' Ringleader Mansha, of Newham, north London, was jailed for 10 years. He had already been jailed under the Terrorism Act in 2005 for plotting to kill or harm a decorated British soldier who had served in Iraq. A court heard he had collected newspaper cuttings about the exploits of Corporal Mark Byles, who had been awarded the Military Cross after leading an attack in which five insurgents died. A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed the Abu Bakr Mansha jailed this week was the same Abu Bakr Mansha jailed over the plot in 2005. Of the others involved in the 2012 attack, the teenage boy - who cannot be named because he is currently 17 years old - was sentenced to an 18-month detention and training order. Salim Jada, 32, and Javed Patel, 29, both also of Newham, were jailed for eight years each.

'The . support and assistance of the local community was vital and illustrates . the refusal of the public to feel intimidated by such violent criminal . behaviour. 'The fitting sentences provide strong reassurance that we remain resolute in pursuing those who carry out acts of violence.' A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain said: ‘This was a criminal act and we condemn it unreservedly. Our thoughts and sympathy are with both victims and their families. 'Criminals are not motivated by anything other than their own base desires. If they claim they were motivated by faith, as some have reported, then they are surely misguided.'","Thugs jailed for 36 years for racist, religiously-motivated attack .

"The pub that helped inspire hit TV show Peaky Blinders could be sold for under £200,000 as it goes under the hammer next week. The Garrison in Birmingham is where Hollywood star Cillian Murphy and his criminal gang gather in a private side room to plan their nefarious criminal schemes in the BBC show. The watering hole - which could also have hosted the real Peaky Blinders gang - has been closed for two years. A steal: A pub featured in hit BBC gangster drama Peaky Blinders is up for sale for under £200,000 . The series features Inception star Cillian Murphy as Thomas Shelby and Sam Neill as Chief Inspector Campbell . The gang earned its chilling nickname through the practice of sewing razor blades into the peaks of their flat caps, so that they could blind rival gangsters by headbutting them. Despite being put up for sale last year, the Victorian drinking den failed to sell and it is hoped the historic pub will be resurrected by a bidder at the auction. For the guide price of £160,000 - £175,000 plus VAT a buyer could get their hands on the three-storey building near Birmingham City Football Club, which includes a six-bedroom living quarters. The show’s creator Steven Knight said his grandfather used to drink at The Garrison and that he took Cillian Murphy on a day long research trip there before filming began so he could perfect his Brummie accent. Den: The watering hole may well have been a favourite haunt of the real Peaky Blinders gang . New lease of life? Despite being put up for sale last year, the Victorian drinking den in Birmingham failed to sell and it is hoped the historic pub will be resurrected by a bidder at the auction on Thursday 22 . The gang earned its chilling nickname through the practice of sewing razor blades into the peaks of their flat caps, so that they could blind rival gangsters by headbutting them . Although there is no direct evidence linking the gang to the pub,  stories of them frequenting the site have been handed down by Midlanders throughout the decades. Speaking to the Birmingham Mail last year, Neil Hayes, security guard at the run-down site, said there were real concerns the building and its place in Birmingham’s history will be lost forever. 'Birmingham folk are such passionate people, but here they have a piece of their own history rotting into the earth,' he said. 'In its day, this was always the ""go to"" pub.' The Garrison goes up for auction by Cottons at Villa Park on Thursday May 22 at 11am. Harry Fowler, Ernest Bayles, Stephen McHickie and Thomas Gilbert, pictured, were members of the notorious 'Peaky Blinders' gang which terrorised Birmingham around the turn of the 20th century. The gang earned its chilling nickname through the practice of sewing razor blades into the peaks of their flat caps, so that they could blind rival gangsters by headbutting them. They ruled the industrialised areas of Bordesley and Small Heath from the 1880s through to the early 1900s, when the city was one of the world's most important manufacturing hubs. Left to right, Peaky Blinders Harry Fowler, Ernest Bayles, Stephen McHickie and Thomas Gilbert are revealed in archived police photos . To coincide with the release of the series, West Midlands Police dug up the original charge sheets for some of the gang members, which are now more than 100 years old. The fading sheets show that, despite the reputation of the gang for terrible crimes, these men and boys had been hauled up on relatively trivial offences. Fowler and Bayles, aged just 19 in the photographs, were charged with 'bike theft' after stealing the unattended item and attempting to sell it on. Stephen McHickie, 25 when pictured, was charged with breaking into a drapers shop which was just 11 doors from his own home. Thomas Gilbert, much older than the others at 38, was arrested for the crime of 'false pretences'. All four gangsters are shown wearing the traditional Peak Blinders outfit, of donkey jackets, silk scarfs, bell-bottom trousers, steel-capped boots and a distinctive flat cap. Baby-faced thugs: Harry Fowler and Ernest Bayles were just 19 when their mugshots were taken by police . Thomas Gilbert, 38, was arrested for 'false pretences', and Stephen McHickie, 25, broke into a drapers shop . Court reports from the time refer to the gang members as 'foul mouthed young men who stalk the streets in drunken groups, insulting and mugging passers-by'. West Midlands Police Museum worker David Cross, 69, explained the method behind the gangsters' signature weapon. He said: 'It was quite a strange weapon they used to rob people, although makes sense when you think about it. 'When they would hit someone on the nose with their cap, it would bring tears to their victim's eyes and cause temporary blindness - that's when they'd thump you and rob you. 'It is a very quick manoeuvre - that is how they worked. They would target anybody who looked vulnerable, the gentleman on his way to work who didn't look strong or fit, ladies, teenage girls, anyone - they would take anything they could convert into money.'

"David Keene, the outgoing president of the NRA, said Barack Obama was an anti-gun activist even in the years before he sought public office . In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, outgoing National Rifle Association president David Keene said Barack Obama 'knows better' than to claim American guns are to blame for violence in Mexico. 'I would rank the president's statement about . American guns being responsible for the mayhem in Mexico right up there . with the ads running before the election that said that he wasn't . opposed to Second Amendment rights. The fact of the matter is, he knows . better.' Keene spoke to MailOnline on the convention floor at the NRA's annual meeting and convention in Houston, Texas. Obama claimed Friday during a speech at . Mexico’s National Anthropology . Museum that 'most of the guns used to commit violence here in . Mexico come from the United States.' The comment was roundly criticized by gun-rights defenders and repeated in media outlets that have been traditionally unfriendly to the NRA. Keen told MailOnline that President Obama's recent public push for new gun control laws is a natural extension of his political positions through the years. 'This guy was an anti-Second . Amendment activist long before he ever ran for office,' Keene said. 'He had said in . the past that he didn't believe any private citizen has a right to own a . firearm,' he continued. 'He has supported legislation that would have banned the . ownership and manufacture of sidearms in America.' CONTROVERSIAL: Incoming NRA president James Porter has reportedly called Barack Obama 'a fake president,' and referred to the Civil War as the 'War of Northern Aggression' An attendee holds a Smith & Wesson pistol during the NRA meeting in Houston - a gun David Keene says President Obama once wished to ban . The National Rifle Association's David Keene knocked President Obama's campaign ads that claimed he would protect gun owners' Second Amendment rights in a second White House term . 'So it was our belief . that he couldn't afford to do anything, politically, before the . election. And of course his campaign actually ran ads saying ""Barack . Obama will support your right to keep and bear arms"".' Asked if that claim in the president's re-election campaign ads were lies, Keene was diplomatic. 'Well,' he said, 'they certainly weren't truthful.' The White House did not respond to requests for comment about Keene's accusation. Keene's term as NRA president ends Monday. The position is awarded on a rotating basis to a different NRA officer every year. His successor, James Porter, is an Alabama attorney who spent the past 12 months as the organization's First Vice President. Porter warned NRA members during a speech on Friday that they are in the midst of an American 'culture war.' He he a history of fiery rhetoric, including calling Obama 'a fake president and saying Attorney General Eric Holder is 'rabidly un-American.' The Associated Press reported Saturday that Porter is also on record calling the U.S. Civil War the 'War of Northern Aggression.' Soft sell: 'Guns save lives' stickers at the NRA convention in Houston seem quaint compared to the bare-knuckle rhetoric that has become common in the national gun rights debate . Keene said groups funded by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (R), shown with Barbra Streisand at the White House Correspondents Association Dinner in Washington, were helping a Connecticut activist disrupt town meetings in New Hampshire . On Friday, according to the AP, Porter called for every U.S. citizen to be trained in the proper use of military firearms. This, he said, would allow Americans to defend themselves against future tyrannical governments. By comparison, Keene seems mild-mannered and almost docile. But he has no warm feelings for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose self-funded Mayors Against Illegal Guns organization has become a thorn in the NRA's side. Inside the convention, gun lovers and gun vendors - like this man from the firearms retailer ALLSTAR Tactical - vied for the attention of the tens of thousands who descended on Houston for the year's biggest gun rights event . 'Michael Bloomberg's groups are spending a lot of money, even now,' Keene told MailOnline, 'advertising in those states where Democratic senators voted with the NRA' on a failed White House-approved legislative proposal that would have required universal background checks for gun buyers. Activists funded by Bloomberg, Keene said, 'are harassing those senators. Two town hall meetings were broken up in New Hampshire by one activist from Sandy Hook [Elementary School] who Mayor Bloomberg has, and they're taking her around.' 'She was supposed to be here ... but that hasn't happened yet. They're trying to make it as uncomfortable as possible for people to support the Second Amendment.' The only protest that materialized at the Houston event included about 45 people at its peak, and was anchored by activists from Code Pink, Occupy the NRA, and Moms Demand Action. The NRA convention attracted a reported 70,000 attendees and vendors. Keene said he's not worried about White House Press Secretary Jay Carney's hint on Friday that President Obama is still considering a raft of executive orders to implement gun control measures without the approval of the House and Senate. 'It's very difficult for him to do as much as he might like via executive order,' Keene explained, 'because, in fact, in order to fund the actions he might order, he has to go to Congress.' A woman who called herself 'Code Pink Cathy' (L) shouted 'NRA, Go Away!' along with a smattering of other protesters outside the NRA's Houston convention . In Mexico, Barack Obama said American guns were responsible for most of the deaths in Mexico related to gun violence . 'We're going to have a whole series of fights that are going to take place in Congress and elsewhere.,' Keene added. 'There's no question, though, that Obama can make life miserable for gun owners.' But first, Keene said, he has to wrap up his tenure as the NRA's top dog. And then, he told MailOnline, 'I'm going to get a knee replacement, and then I'm going to go fishing.'","David Keene, the NRA's outgoing top dog, said Obama's campaign ads about gun control 'weren't truthful'

"Albert Einstein writes an equation: His famous Theory of Special Relativity has been shown to be compatible with travel at faster-than-light speeds . Applied mathematicians have extended Einstein's theory of special relativity to work beyond the speed of light. Einstein's famous theory holds that nothing could move faster than light, but academics at the University of Adelaide, Australia, have developed new formulas to describe travel beyond this limit. The theory of special relativity was published in 1905 and explains how motion and speed is always relative to the observer's frame of reference. The theory connects measurements of the same physical incident viewed from these different points in a way that depends on the relative velocity of observers. As well as this, relativity introduced the concept of time dilation, which suggests that the faster you travel the more time seems to slow. However, special relativity breaks down if two observers relative velocity - the difference between their respective speeds - approaches the speed of light. According to the mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, an object travelling at c would have infinite mass and would therefore require an infinite amount of energy to reach c. Now Professor Jim Hill and Dr Barry Cox in the University's School of Mathematical Sciences have developed a new way to extend Einstein's sums to understand how faster than light movement can be possible. Professor Hill said: 'Since the introduction of special relativity there has been much speculation as to whether or not it might be possible to travel faster than the speed of light, noting that there is no substantial evidence to suggest that this is presently feasible with any existing transportation mechanisms. How is it possible? This 3D graph shows the relationship between . three different velocities: v, u and U, where v is the velocity of a . second observer measured by a first observer, u is the velocity of a . moving particle measured by the second observer, and U is the relative . velocity of the particle to the first observer . 'About this time last year, . experiments at CERN, the European centre for particle physics in . Switzerland, suggested that perhaps neutrinos could be accelerated just a . very small amount faster than the speed of light. 'At this point we started to think about how to deal with the issues from both a mathematical and physical perspective. The theory of special relativity was . published in 1905 and explains how motion and speed is always relative . to the observer's frame of reference. The . theory connects measurements of the same physical incident viewed from . these different points in a way that depends on the relative velocity of . observers. As well as this, . relativity introduced the concept of time dilation, which suggests that . the faster you travel, the more time seems to slow. However, . special relativity breaks down if two observers relative velocity - the . difference between their respective speeds - approaches the speed of . light. 'Questions . have since been raised over the experimental results but we were . already well on our way to successfully formulating a theory of special . relativity, applicable to relative velocities in excess of the speed of . light. 'Our approach is a . natural and logical extension of the Einstein Theory of Special . Relativity, and produces anticipated formulae without the need for . imaginary numbers or complicated physics.' Their formulas extend special relativity to a situation where the relative velocity can be infinite, and can be used to describe motion at speeds faster than light. However, neither Einstein's equations nor the new theory can describe objects moving at the speed of light itself. 'We are mathematicians, not physicists, so we've approached this problem from a theoretical mathematical perspective,' said Dr Cox. 'Should it, however, be proven that motion faster than light is possible, then that would be game changing. 'Our paper doesn't try and explain how this could be achieved, just how equations of motion might operate in such regimes.' Their ground breaking research has been published in the prestigious Proceedings of the Royal Society A.","According to Einstein's theory, nothing can travel faster than light .
But researchers now say the 'game changing' concept is compatible with greater speeds ."
"Soldiers announced that they had seized control of Mali yesterday in an angry reaction to the government's weak response to an uprising of Gaddafi fighters in the country's north. They ousted the president just one month before he was due to step down at the end of his legal term and said on national television they were suspending Mali's constitution, dissolving its institutions and imposing a nationwide curfew. The soldiers had complained that the . civilian government had not done enough to combat a rebellion by ethnic . Tuareg separatists - Azawad National Liberation Movement - made up of . Gaddafi fighters, who want to carve out a homeland in the country's . northern desert. Take over: Soldiers announced that they had seized control of Mali yesterday in an angry reaction to the government's weak response to an uprising of Gaddafi fighters in the country's north called the Azawad National Liberation Movement . They stated that the country is now . under the control of the military's National Committee for the . Reestablishment of Democracy and the Restoration of the State, or CNRDR . and said they were suspending Mali's constitution and dissolving its . institutions. Mali, which supports Western counter-terrorist efforts in western Africa, has been under siege since Malian combatants, who had . fought to defend the late Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, fled back home last year after his defeat. They brought with them powerful and sophisticated weaponry and formed the most powerful Tuareg-led rebel . group the region has known - the Azawad National Liberation Movement . (MNLA). The current whereabouts of President Amadou Toumani Toure  who has overseen a decade of relative stability, is unknown but officials in his camp and diplomats said they believed he was being protected by a pocket of loyalist soldiers. Mutinous soldiers said they would launch an attack on the parachute regiment they believe is protecting the president. Toppled: They ousted the president just one month before he was due to step down at the end of his legal term and said on national television they were suspending Mali's constitution and dissolving its institutions .

Mutiny:The exact whereabouts of President Amadou Toumani Toure, pictured here in November, is unknown but officials in his camp and diplomats said they believed he was being protected by a pocket of loyalist soldiers . 'We will finish it this evening,' said one soldier at an abandoned fuel station in Bamako. The MNLA rebels, have been fighting since mid-January for an independent north. They have pushed government soldiers out of remote towns but had not yet threatened the regional capitals of Kidal, Timbuktu and Gao. Mali's Tuaregs have long complained that they have been marginalised by the southern government and have staged several rebellions over the years. Joined by young recruits and former rebels who had been integrated into the Malian army in recent years, the MNLA fighters took over several key northern towns in just two months. Rebels pledged yesterday to take . advantage of the chaos as senior civilian and military officials in . northern regions were arrested by mutinous soldiers. Sporadic . gunfire rang out in Bamako late last night and the streets were largely . deserted but mutinous soldiers moved around the capital on trucks, . motorcycles and on foot. A . Malian officer in the northern town of Kidal said rebels had occupied . the military camp in Anefis, 100 km (60 miles) to the southwest, after . government forces withdrew. 'The army has pulled back to Gao,'  a . source in Timbuktu, another main town in the north, told Reuters, . asking not to be named. 'There is no longer any military leadership. (The rebels) will take the towns in the north,' he said. Focus: The coup is a major setback for one of the region's few established democracies in the volatile Saharan region and the presence of the al-Qaeda affiliate now turns a local dispute into an international security issue. The coup is a major setback for one of . the region's few established democracies in the volatile Saharan region . and the presence of the al-Qaeda affiliate  now turns a local dispute into an international security issue. Even . before the Tuareg rebellion, there was frustration in the West at . Bamako's unwillingness to act against the al-Qaeda allies. Now as the government seeks military support in its fight against the Tuareg rebels, a tougher line will be demanded. Toure, . 63, a former paratrooper who seized power in 1991, had gained the . nickname 'Soldier of Democracy' in his West African state and had been . preparing to cede power in April after an election. Mali has been under siege since Malian combatants, who had fought to defend the late Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, fled back home last year after his defeat . Mali's neighbours, the United Nations and world powers from Paris to Washington called for a return to constitutional rule. The regional decision-making body ECOWAS Commission said it would not recognise the junta. The 7,000-strong army has for weeks sought better weapons to fight the rebels. Captain . Amadou Sanogo, president of the newly formed National Committee for the . Return of Democracy and the Restoration of the State (CNRDR), said the . poor handling of the crisis in the north was mostly to blame for the . coup. Speaking to . pan-African television station Africable, Mr Sanogo, who said he . received training from U.S. Marines and intelligence, pledged not to . remain in power but refused to give a timeframe for restoring civilian . rule. 'Three months, 6 . months, 9 months, it will depend on the structure that we put in place . for me to go back to being a soldier. Someone else will do the rest,' Mr . Sanogo said. 'We have come asking for decent living conditions and to be treated well ... we will fight for this,' he added. Restoring state authority to the north was the priority, he said. But, . amid reports of arrests of ministers and other senior government . officials, Mr Sanogo implied that those detained would face trial for . alleged crimes. 'We are not . killers. I am not a killer. But the moment was right and everyone will . have to face charges before the appropriate authority,' he said. The events that culminated in the coup began on Tuesday morning at a military camp in the capital, where Defence Minister General Sadio Gassama came for an official visit. In his speech to the troops, the minister failed to address the grievances of the rank-and-file soldiers. The rebellion has claimed the lives of numerous soldiers, and those sent to fight say they are not given sufficient supplies, including arms or food. Recruits started firing into the air on Tuesday morning. By afternoon, troops had surrounded the state television station in central Bamako, located in southwest Mali, yanking both the television and radio signals off the air for the rest of the day. By last night, troops had started rioting at a military garrison located in the northern town of Gao, some 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometres) away. The government has not disclosed how many government soldiers have been killed. The toll is believed to be significant and in February, military widows led a protest, publicly grilling Toure on television over his handling of the rebellion. On state television today the putschists announced a curfew starting at dawn until further notice and the closure of the airport. They called for calm and said violence and pillage would not be tolerated. Their spokesman, who was identified on screen as Lt Amadou Konare, said the coup was caused by the government's incompetence in dealing with the insurgency.","Last year Malian combatants who fought for Gaddafi, returned home and formed Tuareg-led .

"The menacing advance of the Islamic State in Iraq should not prejudice Western people against Muslim people and the Islamic faith. I once served as an  airman in Egypt and Iraq and can vouch for the kindness and goodness of many Muslim  people. Indeed, more than three million have made their home in Britain, and by far the majority want to get on and make good and peaceful homes among us. But there is a darker side. Radical Islam is on the rise and imperilling our way of life, threatening to undermine the values that have been bitterly won over the centuries. Scroll down for video . Lord Carey says Radical Islam is on the rise and imperilling our way of life, threatening to undermine the values that have been bitterly won over the centuries . In recent weeks, we have heard desperate reports of  barbaric violence – including crucifixions and beheadings – accompanying the onward march of the terrorist group calling themselves ‘Islamic State’ (IS, formerly ISIS). Even worse, about 500 of these murderous thugs, criminals and rapists are said to be Britons and a further 1,500 from other parts of Europe. The youngest of these would-be terrorists is reported to be 13 years old and has travelled to the Middle East from Belgium with an older brother. Frighteningly, the young British hostage-taker who may have beheaded the incredibly brave reporter James Foley, is not even the first to have committed such a despicable act. Journalist Daniel Pearl was murdered by a Briton as well. My good friend Canon Andrew White, widely known as the ‘Vicar of Baghdad’, has seen many of his parishioners killed. He said only the other day that a child he had recently baptised was cut in half by terrorists in the advance of IS. He and other church leaders in Iraq are witnessing the ethnic cleansing and even the genocide of the ancient Christian community in the homeland of our Christian faith. Christianity in Iraq dates back to the first century and the missionary expansion inspired by the preaching of St Paul. By contrast, Islam arrived by conquest and the sword centuries later. These young fanatical Muslims from Britain and elsewhere are bringing the sword yet again to this region. Only this time they are killing all in their wake, including fellow Sunni Muslims who do not hold the same belligerent interpretation of Islam, together with Shia Muslims who by population are in a majority in Iraq. How can we respond to the evil these young people are doing in the region, including young Britons that we have educated in our schools and who now repudiate our decent and tolerant values by pursuing jihad in Iraq and Syria? The first step is to withdraw their passports. This includes young people who we learn are planning to travel to commit terrorist acts, together with those who are fighting for foreign terrorist groups. American journalist James Foley was beheaded by an ISIS militant . They should not have access to the privilege of travelling under a British passport with the accompanying consular protection – and they certainly should not be able to travel back to their shores with the barbaric and bloodthirsty skills they have gained. Young people who travel abroad to commit violent ‘jihad’ should know before they go that there is no way back to civilised society. It may focus their minds to know that the privileges and luxuries of our country (including our gyms, games consoles and relative peacefulness) will be denied to them in future. It will take a brave Government to carry out this intent but it is my feeling that the majority of our fellow citizens want this to happen. They will want it out of sheer disgust that so-called Britons are killing others in the name of Islam and so challenging the tolerant values that stem from our Christian heritage. The second and most important step is to recover a confidence in our own nation’s values. For too long we have been self-conscious and even ashamed about British identity. By embracing multiculturalism and the idea that every culture and belief is of equal value we have betrayed our own traditions of welcoming strangers to our shore. The strangers we welcome were attracted to our way of life and our democratic traditions. They were often escaping totalitarianism and religious persecution and wanted to come to a country where there was freedom of religion and separation of the powers of church, state and judiciary. They also came to one of the only countries in Europe where there was an established Church. The establishment of the Church didn’t mean that other beliefs were not welcome but it did offer hospitality for a range of diverse beliefs. In Britain’s hospitable establishment different beliefs were welcomed but only one was pre-eminent – Christianity. The fact is that for too long the doctrine of multiculturalism has led to immigrants establishing completely separate communities in our cities. This has led to honour killings, female genital circumcision and the establishment of sharia law in inner-city pockets throughout the UK. It Is a situation that mainstream Muslims – the vast and quiet majority – are fed up with. They are witnessing the radicalisation of some of their young people and feel powerless to do anything about it. The majority of Muslim leaders firmly condemn such radicalisation, but the appeal of such illicit underground movements to radicalised young men cannot be underestimated. The best way to challenge a thoroughly bad thing is to offer a better one. The better idea we can offer is the broad and all-encompassing values of liberal democracy in which we all have a voice and a say in shaping our future together. In this must involve the power and co-operation of Muslim communities who need to state, more clearly than they have done so far, their denunciation of these fanatical forms of Islam. Islam has many strengths to contribute to our land. When I was Archbishop of Canterbury  I had a strong and rich friendship with Sheikh Zaki Badawi, who sadly died in 2003. He often remarked that Muslims had  difficulties living as minorities in plural societies and much more work had to be done by Muslim scholars. With him I set up an important ‘listening exercise’ that eventually led to a Christian-Muslim Council. I was also closely involved with Tony Blair in the establishment of Building Bridges following the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York. There has been a huge investment in strengthening Muslim, Christian and secular dialogue. Muslim communities are being challenged as never before to discipline their young people or face the consequences that such radicalised young men will be banished from our shores. This year we are reminded by the commemoration of two world wars that the values of our democratic traditions are precious. Our fathers and grandfathers – including many thousands of Muslims from around the Commonwealth – fought against totalitarianism for the survival of democratic virtues. The bloodthirsty advance of IS is a reminder that totalitarianism is far from dead. Our fight continues.","Lord Carey wants those involved in terrorism to lose their passports .
And for Britons to embrace multiculturalism and treat all cultures equally .

"The mother of 11-year-old Luke Batty who was murdered by his father earlier this year has told of her life living in fear of her violent former partner. In a harrowing testimony given on Tuesday, Rosie Batty revealed she and her son were terrified of Greg Anderson, Luke's father. 'We locked the doors... we had a baseball bat in one bedroom, we had a baseball bat in another bedroom,' Ms Batty said in court, the ABC reported. Scroll down for video . Rosie Batty, whose son Luke Batty was killed by his father Greg Anderson in February, outside the inquest into Luke's death on Tuesday . Mr Anderson, 56, killed his son Luke, 11, on the Tyabb oval in Victoria on February 12 of this year . 'This is what I was living with. The police were telling me we can't be there in time if he wants to kill you... perhaps you should consider moving back to England.' She broke down multiple times in the witness box, revealing her angst over not knowing how to tell Mr Anderson he couldn't see his son. 'I couldn't do it. I so wanted him to take out his hatred on someone else,' Ms Batty said. She also said that Mr Anderson's mental illness was 'sabotaging everything in his life', but spoke of the close relationship Luke and his father shared. Ms Batty told of inquest police said they couldn't help her if her former partner tried to kill her and Luke . Ms Batty also revealed she feared her son's father may have been contemplating killing their child in a murder suicide but believed the 11-year-old would be safe in public places. Ms Batty said she started believing Greg Anderson could pose a physical risk to their son when he showed Luke Batty a knife and told him 'this could be the one to end it all'. But she believed he would be safe with his father so long as they were in public areas like the football or cricket oval, Ms Batty told an inquest into Luke's death at his father's hands at a Victorian oval. 'I didn't know if Greg was referring to his own suicide tendencies or if he would like to have a joint suicide,' she told the Victorian Coroners Court on Tuesday. She said she started to believe Mr Anderson could pose a physical risk to their son when he showed Luke a knife and told him 'this could be the one to end it all' 'That image of him harming him (Luke) couldn't happen in a public place. 'It couldn't happen at the Tyabb oval but it bloody did.' Anderson murdered his 11-year-old son by hitting him with a cricket bat then attacking him with a knife while they played together in the nets following cricket training in Tyabb in February. The 54-year-old was shot by police and died in hospital. After the knife incident in April 2013, Ms Batty won an order to deny Anderson access to Luke, but it was changed to allow him to see his son in public at weekly sporting events just three months later. Earlier this week it was revealed Luke Batty's father told ambulance workers to let him die after he killed his 11-year-old son at a Victorian cricket oval during a custody visit. Greg Anderson was covered with blood and holding a knife when he lunged at emergency services workers called to the Tyabb oval on February 12, an inquest into Luke's death has heard. The 54-year-old was shot by police and said 'let me die' as paramedics attempted to treat him, the Victorian Coroners Court heard on Monday. Mr Anderson and Luke were practising in the cricket nets, 'substantially on their own', when the attack happened, but it was witnessed by an eight-year-old boy, the inquest heard . An inquest into Luke's death has heard Mr Anderson begged Ambulance workers to 'let him die' Mr Anderson and Luke were practising in the cricket nets, 'substantially on their own', when the attack happened, but it was witnessed by an eight-year-old boy, the inquest heard. Luke died after Mr Anderson struck him with a cricket bat and attacked him with a knife. The boy saw Mr Anderson raise the bat over his right shoulder but did not see it connect with Luke. Luke died after Mr Anderson struck him with a cricket bat and attacked him with a knife during a custody visit . He ran and told his father, who called paramedics. When emergency services workers arrived they saw Mr Anderson kneeling by Luke. At first they thought he was helping him, the inquest heard. When ambulance workers tried to approach Luke, Mr Anderson said 'he's in heaven now'. Mr Anderson died in hospital from gunshot wounds and self-inflicted knife wounds. The inquest heard that in the months before he killed his son, Mr Anderson once held up a knife while talking to Luke and said: 'This could be the one to end it all.' Luke reported the incident to police and a child protection officer, but told them that he loved his father and was not in fear of him, the inquest heard. Luke's mother, Rosie Batty, said she had always wanted her son to have a relationship with his father. 'For me it's really important a child should know his father,' she told the inquest. 'Greg was really loving and keen to be involved in Luke's life. 'But I said to myself this is a journey, I'll keep doing things that feel right until they didn't feel right anymore.' Ms Batty said she changed her mind in April 2013 when Luke revealed his father had shown him the knife while Anderson prayed in his car. 'I was so alarmed I knew I could no longer support his relationship with his father,' Ms Batty said. Mr Anderson's contact with Luke was restricted by an intervention order from May 2012, but that was changed to block access to his son in April 2013. When ambulance workers tried to approach Luke, Mr Anderson said 'he's in heaven now' Counsel assisting the inquest, Rachel Ellyard, said the order was changed again in July 2013 to allow Mr Anderson access to Luke at football and cricket matches on the weekend. Ms Ellyard said Mr Anderson was technically in breach of that order by seeing Luke at cricket training on a weekday. The inquest heard Ms Batty was not told Mr Anderson had failed to appear in court on charges of assault and not answering bail. She learned that Anderson's housemate sought and was granted an intervention order in January this year through media reports. Ms Batty said when she saw Mr Anderson at the cricket oval on the night of Luke's death it occurred to her to call the police, but she decided not to. She said she had previously had unpleasant situations trying to get the police involved at the cricket club. Luke's mother Rosie Batty (pictured) said she had always wanted her son to have a relationship with his father . Ms Batty said she didn't trust the situation, and previous attempts had been traumatic, stressful and unpredictable. She said she thought: 'This will be the third time I've tried to get this man arrested in front of Luke and his friends at that bloody oval.' The police had Anderson's address, so she thought it would be better if they arrested him there, discretely, Ms Batty told the inquest. Ms Ellyard said key issues to be explored during the inquest included the assessments of Mr Anderson made by police and the Department of Human Services (DHS) and the supervision orders dictating Mr Anderson's contact with Luke. The information sharing between Ms Batty, the DHS and police, and any changes DHS and police have made to their procedures since Luke's murder, would also be investigated. More broadly, Ms Ellyard said the inquest would look into whether there were any signs Anderson had the potential for violence towards Luke and whether they could have been acted on.

"Gordon Gallagher was killed after he tripped upon the Republican-made bomb . The IRA finally apologised yesterday for the death of a nine-year-old boy after blaming the British Army for almost 40 years. Gordon Gallagher was killed after he tripped upon the Republican-made bomb while playing ‘Cowboys and Indians’ with his brother in their garden in Londonderry in 1973. Doctors tried to save his life by amputating both of his legs, but he died from the injuries caused by the booby-trapped device. Gordon’s parents have previously . claimed IRA members visited them days after his death and told them they . placed the bomb without a detonator and it was added by the British . Army to try and ‘frame’ them for the killing. But . yesterday the IRA confessed to planting both the bomb and the detonator . after Gordon’s family called upon Sinn Fein politician Martin . McGuinness to tell them who put it in the children’s play area and why. McGuinness was a former IRA commander in Londonderry at the time and the statement was made on the eve of the 39th anniversary of Gordon’s death. British Army troops confronting rioters in Londonderry, Northern Ireland in the seventies . The IRA statement said the group accepted responsibility and was ‘truly remorseful and profoundly sorry’. It also offered its apologies ‘for the pain and grief caused’. It has issued similar admissions and apologies over the past 15 years for killings that it long denied committing and sometimes falsely attributed to the British Army. Gordon’s father Billy said yesterday the IRA statement represented a major U-turn from the group’s 1973 position but it still wasn’t good enough. The IRA confessed after Gordon¿s family called upon Sinn Fein politician Martin McGuinness (pictured) to tell them who planted it . ‘I am glad they take full responsibility and accept that they were to blame and no one else was,’ he said. But he said McGuinness still should be able to provide his family much more detailed information on who did it and why. Asked about the IRA’s initial claim of the British Army’s involvement, he added: ‘I never believed that for a second.’ Sinn Fein in a statement said McGuinness was in a Republic of Ireland prison in 1973 and so couldn’t help the family. McGuinness - who since 2007 has been deputy leader of Northern Ireland’s government - has repeatedly said he will never provide anyone information on individual IRA members’ involvement in bombings and shootings. Londonderry was predominantly Catholic and the second-largest city in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s. The IRA had several hundred members trying to ambush police and British soldiers, often in the Gallagher’s home area of Creggan, during fierce fighting. Soldiers investigating the blast found a second booby-trap bomb nearby that appeared to have been placed in hopes of catching troops responding to the first explosion.",Gordon Gallagher tripped on the bomb when playing 'Cowboys and Indians' in his garden .
"An American scientist was today awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on quantum particles which could make it possible to build a new kind of computer far more powerful than any seen before. David Wineland and his French colleague Serge Haroche found ways to manipulate the very smallest particles of matter and light to observe strange behaviour that previously could only be imagined in equations and thought experiments. The 68-year-old physicist has described his own work as a 'parlour trick' that performed the seemingly magical feat of putting an object in two places at once. Other scientists praised the achievements as bringing to life the wildest dreams of science fiction. Winners: American David Wineland, left, and Frenchman Serge Haroche, right, have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their research into quantum particles . Delight: Mr Wineland following a press conference he gave to mark his winning the Nobel Prize . In the lab: The physicist giving a tour of his laboratory in Boulder, Colorado on Tuesday . 'The Nobel laureates have opened the door to a new era of experimentation with quantum physics by demonstrating the direct observation of individual quantum particles without destroying them,' said the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awarded them the $1.2million Nobel Prize in Physics. 'Perhaps the quantum computer will change our everyday lives in this century in the same radical way as the classical computer did in the last century.' Mr Haroche said he was walking in the street with his wife when he recognized the Swedish country code on the incoming call which would inform him of the award. 'I saw the area code 46, then I sat down,' he said. 'First I called my children, then I called my closest colleagues, without whom I would never have won this prize.' Asked how he would celebrate, he said: 'I will have champagne, of course.' He added that he hoped the prize would give him a platform 'that will allow me to communicate ideas, not just in this field of research but for research in general, fundamental research'. Hard at work: Mr Wineland's research could help build unimaginably powerful new types of computers . Honoured: The physicist received the 2007 National Medal of Science from President George W. Bush . Mr Wineland, who is married with two sons, is a native of California and was educated at UC Berkeley and Harvard. He now works at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and at the University of Colorado Boulder. Physics is the second of this year's crop of awards - scientists from Britain and Japan were yesterday awarded the medicine prize, for adult stem cell research. The prizes, which reward achievements in science, literature and peace, were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the will of Swedish dynamite millionaire Alfred Nobel. 'This year's Nobel Prize recognizes some of the most incredible experimental tests of the weirder aspects of quantum mechanics,' said Jim Al-Khalili, professor of physics at the University of Surrey. 'Until the last decade or two, some of these results were nothing more than ideas in science fiction or, at best, the wilder imaginations of quantum physicists. Wineland and Haroche and their teams have shown just how strange the quantum world really is and opened up the potential for new technologies undreamt of not so long ago.' Announcement: The pair's victory was first revealed in Stockholm on Tuesday . Quantum physics studies the behaviour of the fundamental building blocks of the universe at a scale smaller than atoms, when tiny particles act in strange ways that can only be described with advanced mathematics. Researchers have long dreamt of building 'quantum computers' that would operate using that mathematics - able to conduct far more complicated calculations and hold vastly more data than classical computers. But they could only be built if the behaviour of individual particles could be observed. 'Single particles are not easily isolated from their surrounding environment, and they lose their mysterious quantum properties as soon as they interact with the outside world,' the Nobel committee explained. 'Through their ingenious laboratory methods Haroche and Wineland, together with their research groups, have managed to measure and control very fragile quantum states, which were previously thought inaccessible for direct observation. The new methods allow them to examine, control and count the particles.' Victoire! Mr Haroche celebrates his win in the historic setting of the College de France in Paris . Research: Mr Haroche working on quantum physics in Paris with one of his assistants . Both scientists work in the field of quantum optics, studying the fundamental interactions between light and matter. The Nobel committee said they used opposite approaches to the same problem: Mr Wineland uses light particles - or photons - to measure and control particles of matter - electrons - while Mr Haroche uses electrons to control and measure photons. In one of the strange properties of quantum mechanics, tiny particles act as if they are simultaneously in two locations, based on the likelihood that they would be found at either, known as a 'superposition'. It was long thought that it would be impossible to demonstrate this in a lab. But Mr Wineland's 'parlour trick' was to hit an atom with laser light, which according to quantum theory would have a 50 per cent chance of moving it, and observe the atom at two different locations, 80 nanometres apart. In a normal computer, a switch must either be on or off. A quantum computer would work with switches that, like the particles in Mr Wineland's experiment, behaved as if they were in more than one position at the same time. An example is a computer trying to work out the shortest route around town for a travelling salesman. A traditional computer might try every possible route and then choose the shortest. A quantum computer could do the calculation in one step, as if the salesman travelled each route simultaneously.","David Wineland awarded prize alongside French colleague Serge Haroche .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers vowed to stick with Mario Balotelli after another goalless but encouraging display against Hull. Balotelli is still to score in the Barclays Premier League goal since moving to Anfield after the Reds were shut out by the Tigers in a 0-0 home draw. But after some underwhelming performances, and controversy in midweek after exchanging shirts at half-time in the loss to Real Madrid, Balotelli produced a much-improved effort. Mario Balotelli (left) tussles with James Chester (right) during Liverpool's 0-0 draw with Hull at Anfield . Balotelli has an effort at goal but the Italian couldn't find the back of the net against Steve Bruce's side . He had one of Liverpool's best chances in the first half, forcing a fine save from Eldin Jakupovic, and was again thwarted by the Hull goalkeeper with almost the last kick of the game. His work rate and body language were also positive and Rodgers is convinced the controversial Italian will come good. Rodgers said: 'I thought he worked very well, very hard. He maybe thought he wasn't going to play today but you have got to stay with it. He is working hard and he is doing his best. 'Unfortunately it is that wee bit of confidence sometimes, when you don't get the goal. He kept going, kept getting into the areas. 'Sometimes with players if it's not going so well they have a day where they don't train or don't work, but he puts himself out to train every single day. He is out there wanting to be better, wanting to improve. Reds boss Brendan Rodgers believes Balotelli worked hard and tried his best against Hull . Balotelli is crowded out by Chester (centre) and goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic (left) 'Goalscorers will tell you they get their energy from the ball hitting the back of the net and it is just not happening for him in terms of that, but all I will ask is they do their best. You saw today's reaction. It was unlucky he didn't get the goal.' Liverpool showed urgency only sporadically but still created a number of chances and finished the match strongly. Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho both went close in the closing minutes before Balotelli was denied at point-blank range by Jakupovic. Rodgers said: 'It was a big chance. We had one or two of those but we couldn't quite put the ball in the net. 'He will be disappointed he hasn't scored but, for the team, it was a big effort on the back of playing against a good team in midweek. 'We were a bit slow in the first half but in the second half I thought we were outstanding in the energy and effort we put into the game. It was a game we should have had three points from.' Balotelli takes a breather after being brought down by Hull's Alex Bruce at Anfield . Balotelli's lack of goals was lampooned in a publicity stunt staged by a bookmaker outside the ground, who offered fans the chance to swap shirts bearing the player's name. But Hull boss Steve Bruce was also impressed by the contribution of the former Manchester City forward and feels the criticism has been harsh. Bruce said: 'I thought he was their best player. There is a lot written about him and a lot of debate about him and he is not everyone's cup of tea, but he is a bit of a character, a bit of a maverick. When you sign a maverick you have to treat him like one and get the best out of him somehow. 'He is going through one of those sticky periods but the kid is a talent.' Bruce also praised Balotelli for having the decency to accept a request to swap shirts with one of his players, despite the furore of Wednesday night. 'It is a shame for him. He is the whipping boy,' Bruce said. 'But even then he was good-spirited enough to swap shirts. So, one of them have got it, but he did it out of the road of the cameras this time.' Hull boss Steve Bruce believes Balotelli was Liverpool's best player on Saturday afternoon . Bruce was pleased to have collected another good point after last week's draw against Arsenal. He said: 'When you come to Liverpool, like the Emirates last week, you have to make sure you play well. If you play well and take something it is excellent for a club like ours, and where we have been, and what is expected. So we are very pleased with it.' Hull have been hit hard by injuries, not least in goal with Allan McGregor and Steve Harper out, providing the opportunity for the Swiss Jakupovic to come in. Bruce said: 'I would expect him to make those saves but, to be fair to the kid, he has waited a long time. It is not easy being the third-choice goalkeeper. 'The corners were raining in from Steven Gerrard and he stood up to the task of it. Maybe 18 months ago he found that a struggle. 'He will remember that, he has kept a clean sheet at Anfield.'","Liverpool drew 0-0 at home to Hull City on Saturday afternoon .

"A plane carrying the body of Korean War POW Glenn Schoenmann arrived at Nashville International Airport in Tennessee on Thursday to be greeted by four emotional siblings, 62 years after their brother voluntarily left home to fight in the war. Private First Class Schoenmann died in a North Korean prison camp on December 29, 1950, at the age of 20. He was wounded and suffered days in the frigid cold alone during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, known to Korean War veterans as the ‘frozen Chosin.’ Not forgotten: Private First Class Glenn Schoenmann, who left his family farm in Tennessee to volunteer for the Korean War, is seen in this undated handout photo courtesy of the Tennessee Department of Veterans Affairs . Long-awaited service: Schoenmann's personal items were put on display during a funeral for the Korean War veteran who died in a prison camp at the age of 19 . The battle took place in late November 1950 as severe winter weather hit North Korea and hundreds of thousands of Communist Chinese troops poured into the country to overturn what had been a largely successful American and United Nations advance. Injured and cut off from his unit, Schoenmann managed to avoid being captured for several days. But eventually, wounded and weakened from the cold, the young soldier was caught and detained in a North Korean prison camp, where he died. His remains were later recovered in 2004 during a brief period of cooperation between the U.S. and North Korea. Schoenmann’s corpse was identified by DNA taken from family members after a nephew’s online ancestry search came to the attention of U.S. authorities involved in recovering Korean War POW remains, the Leaf Chronicle in Tennessee reports. Closure: Sibling Raymond Schoenmann wipes his eyes during the funeral for his brother held at the Grundy County High School in Coalmont, Tennessee . Respects paid: Army Chaplin Ladislao Hernandez paid respects during the funeral for Korean War veteran Private First Class Schoenmann . Preparation for burial: The Army honor guard preparing to move Glenn Schoenmann's to the cemetery . His older brother says he remembers driving him to a bus station in Nashville more than 62 years ago. ‘He knew where he was going,’ Ernest Schoenmann, 86, of Creve Coure, Illinois, told the Chronicle. ‘He said, “I don’t think I’ll ever come home alive."" ‘That was hard. Those were the last words I can remember.’ Ernest Schoenmann, who was informed of the positive identification shortly before Thanksgiving, said his family learned a lot about what their sibling went through. ‘They gave me a booklet with an interview with one of the boys who was in prison with him,’ he said. ‘I started to read it, but I couldn’t. It was so horrible.’ Communal dedication: Locals lined the streets during the funeral procession . Proper ceremony: The honor guard carried Schoenmann's casket during the funeral in Palmer, Tennessee, on Saturday, January 12, 2013 . Saying goodbye: Ernest, left, and Raymond, right, Schoenmann sat quietly during the funeral service for their brother who was 20 when he died in December 1950 . As with thousands of other U.S. soldiers killed in action or by the harsh conditions of their captivity, Schoenmann’s remains were not returned to the U.S. after authorities signed an armistice with North Korea on July 27, 1953. Six decades after the signing of that armistice, over 8,000 U.S. military men and women remain unaccounted for. The Korean War, which was fought between June 25,1950, and July, 27, 1953, has often been referred to as 'The Forgotten War' and 'The Unknown War' due to the lack of public attention it received. Ernest Schoenmann said he wishes other families of missing Korean War service members will still be able to find closure as their loved ones remain half a world away. ‘I just wish more of them were home,’ he said. ‘There’s still so many of them missing over there.’Glenn Schoenmann’s long-awaited funeral was held in Tennessee on Saturday. A day to not forget: Final respects were paid before the burial . Flag folding: Members of the honor guards folded the flag during the funeral service .

"What better way to celebrate your five-year anniversary than by fooling your girlfriend into believing you’ve cheated? Professional YouTube prankster Roman Atwood did just that while he and his partner Britney vacationed in Aruba, thinking the stunt could live among his many others posted online. But Atwood was in for the shock of his pranking career when his sobbing girlfriend admitted she’d been unfaithful, too. Scroll down for video... Beaten at his own game: YouTube prankster Roman Atwood, left, decided to tell his girlfriend that he cheated while they vacationed in Aruba for the 5-year anniversary . Pranked: With a hidden camera rolling, Atwood tells his girlfriend Britney that he cheated, even though he hasn't . Happier times: Here, Roman and Brittney show their love for one another. Their trip to Aruba marked their five year anniversary . ‘I’m in Aruba right now celebrating my five-year anniversary with my girlfriend,’ Atwood tells the camera as he approaches their hotel room. ‘I’m going to prank her tonight by telling her I cheated on her.’ On his YouTube channel, Atwood has posted similarly tasteful prank videos such as ‘Scary Hangman Prank!’ and ‘Homeless Pizza Party Prank!!!’ But he may have gone wrong with this particular stunt by involving his girlfriend. ‘We have a family,’ she sobs after Atwood’s fake admission. 'We had a family': The seemingly heartbroken Britney breaks down in sobs as Atwood begs for forgiveness . But then...: Through her tears, Britney admits 'I cheated on you' He says he’ll never do it again and apologizes profusely. But then the tables turn. ‘I cheated on you,’ Britney admits. Atwood flips out and paces in stunned disbelief. His prank has gone terribly wrong. Most of Atwood's jokes end with a laugh. But most don't involve Brittney. A few tense moments appeared to put a damper on what had been a wildly popular YouTube prank career for Roman. Then, before his anger can go too far, Britney smiles. Flip out: The shocked Atwood can't believe his ears and he begs Britney to say it ain't so . Gotcha! Then Britney serves her just desserts. She was pranking the prankster. 'I saw you set up your camera, you idiot!' She was pranking him. ‘I saw you set up your camera, you idiot!’ All is well again and both get a good laugh before Atwood wonders what’s become of his prank. ‘I suck so…I cannot upload that.’ Thankfully, he decided to upload it after all and the world has enjoyed it. In less than a day, the video had gained over 630,000 views. But there may be more shenanigans in store for the serial trickster and his sly girlfriend, who admits at the end of the video: 'I thought you were going to propose!'

"American fighter jets and drones continued to pound Islamic State militants in Iraq Wednesday, and military planners weighed the possibility of sending a small number of additional U.S. troops to Baghdad, U.S. officials said, even as the insurgents threatened to kill a second American captive in retribution for any continued attacks. The airstrikes came in the hours after militants released a gruesome video Tuesday showing U.S. journalist James Foley being beheaded and underscored President Barack Obama's vow Wednesday afternoon to continue attacks against the group despite its threats. The most visible threat to emerge came at the end of the video when Steven Sotloff, a Miami freelance journalist, appeared as a militant spoke directly to President Barack Obama. 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,' he says on-camera. Scroll down for video . Boom: The wreckage of a car belonging to ISIS militants lies along a road after it was targeted by a U.S. air strike near the Mosul Dam on Wednesday . ISIS jihadis warned in a video released Wednesday that Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist from Miami, would be the next to die if President Barack Obama continues to send planes and drones into Iraq to attack the terror group . 'Reaper': The latest U.S. drone aircraft is reportedly in use delivering airborne blows to ISIS in Iraq . Ready to go: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel talked last week to a group of U.S. Marines preparing for deployment to Iraq; the Pentagon said Thursday that as many as 300 more would be sent in to help stabilize Baghdad . According . to a senior U.S. official, the number of additional troops currently . under discussion would be fewer than 300, but there has been no final . decision yet by Pentagon leaders. Officials said that the forces, if approved, would mainly provide extra security around Baghdad. The 14 latest airstrikes were in the area of the Mosul Dam and were aimed at helping Iraqi and Kurdish forces create a buffer zone at the key facility. U.S. Central Command said Thursday that America's military have conducted a total of 90 airstrikes across Iraq. 'Of those 90 strikes,' CENTCOM said in a statement, '57 have been in support of Iraqi forces near the Mosul Dam.' U.S. intervention has helped Iraqi and Kurdish troops reclaim the dam from the insurgents. The militants, a trio of British jihadists known to their captives as 'the Beatles,' threatened to kill Steven Sotloff, an American journalist who they also hold as a hostage, if the U.S. continued to conduct airstrikes. The officials who spoke to the Associated Press were not authorized to discuss the ongoing operations publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not clear Wednesday if Obama would have to adjust his recent notifications to Congress under the War Powers Act to accommodate the higher U.S. troop level in Iraq if more soldiers and Marines are deployed. Currently there are about 748 U.S. forces in Iraq, in addition to the approximately 100 troops that have routinely been assigned to the Office of Security Cooperation in Baghdad. Under the current war powers resolutions sent to Congress, Obama authorized up to 775 U.S. troops for security assistance, assessment teams, and advisers at two joint operations centers in Baghdad and Irbil. Foley, a 40-year-old photojournalist from Rochester, New Hampshire, went missing in northern Syria while freelancing for Agence France-Presse and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost. Officials have said the video appears authentic. Precision craters: U.S. airstrikes can devastate an enemy from hundreds of miles away with an accuracy range of just a few meters . Islamist rebels from ISIS have claimed territory, seized towns and raised flags across Syria and Iraq since their campaign of terror began . Horrifying: American photojournalist James Foley is beheaded in a video released by a trio of British ISIS militants known to their captors as 'The Beatles' Released on websites Tuesday, the video shows a man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert, next to a black-clad militant with a knife to his throat. Foley's name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen. After the captive makes a statement, the masked man is shown apparently beginning to cut at the neck of the captive. The next shot appears to show the captive lying dead on the ground, his head on his body. At the end of the video, a second man – identified as Sotloff – is shown and the militant warns that he could be next captive killed. Sotloff was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border in August 2013 and freelanced for Time, the National Interest and MediaLine.","14 new strikes hit ISIS targets near the Mosul Dam .

"Lottie Dexter, from the Year of Code, said students can 'carve their own destiny' online . Schoolchildren are to be told how they can become internet millionaires in an attempt to inspire them to learn how to create websites and mobile phone apps. Just five digitally-savvy Brits – all of them under-25 – have built web companies which are worth a combined total of more than £10million. By creating fitness apps, revision guides, car sites and a chain of tuck shops, they have used IT skills to turn an idea into hard cash. From this September children as young has five will be given lessons in computer coding – the language used to create and programme websites, games and apps. Ministers have overhauled the curriculum to end boring IT lessons which focussed on how to use software like Microsoft Word and Excel. Instead pupils will be told how to take an idea and develop their own software. More than 9 in 10 parents of under-16s think computer skills are important for today's job market - the same proportion who say the same about literacy and numeracy. To hammer home the message, campaigners have highlighted the achievements of young tech entrepenuers who have created business worth millions before turning 25. They include George Burgess who created a revesion app at the age of 17 which is now worth £4million and Alendaer Foster whose Race Yourself fitness site is valued at £3million. Lottie Dexter, director of Year of Code, said: ‘Self-starters with a good degree of digital know-how can carve out their own destiny online. ‘Our economy is changing and we need a workforce the right skills for the 21st century. That requires us to have a good grasp of technology.’ It is hoped a generation of children already adept at using iPhones, uploading video to YouTube and switching between social media including Twitter, Whatsapp and Snapchat will become the designers of the future. Rohan Silva, a former Number 10 adviser to David Cameron, warned middle class jobs are being replaced by technology. 'It is technology replacing white collar jobs in the way that it replaced blue collar jobs back in the 70s, 80s and 90s,' he said. George Burgess, 24, who created Gojimo - a revision site now worth £4million . Most teenagers hate revision but few of them have found a way to turn it into a multi-million pound business. At just 17 years old George Burgess from London began developing his own online one-stop-revision-shop, Gojimo. The app proved so popular after its launch last year that George dropped out of University in . America to dedicate all efforts to it, quickly securing over $1 . million in start-up funds. Now 22, he has seen the company grow to be valued at more than £4million and his ambitions have gone global: 'By the end of this year we want to be a major player in the US too.' Petrolhead Adnan Ebrahim, 23, created Car Throttle, which is now said to be worth millions . Adnan Ebrahim has always had the entrepreneur bug. In his teens he made money selling writsbands on eBay before launching a blog called . Blogtrepreneur.com aged just 16 years old. Two years later he sold the . business to an American company for a five-figure sum, even before he was old enough to celebrate with an alcoholic drink. Born in Middlesex, the 23-year-old was studying at University College London when he launched Car Throttle, aimed at young petrolheads, in his dorm room. Now the company is worth multi-millions, has 2 million visitors per month and over 110,000 YouTube subscribers. Bejay Mulenga, 18, pictured outside Number 10 with Liam Tootill, created Supa Tuck which helps set up tuck shops across the country . Bejay Mulenga came up with the idea of Supa Tuck, at the age of only 14. The social enterprise that encourages pupils to set up their own break time tuck shops in schools. It was born out of bordeom during business studies lessons and he convinced his school to let him run his own tuck shop as part of his course. Within a year he had turned over £15,000 and had started to franchise his Supa Tuck, tuck shop to other schools in the area. Since December 2011 Supa Tuck have helped over 5,000 young people set up their own tuck shops. Bejay is still just 18 years old and his socially-minded company is valued at £200,000. Alexander Foster, 24, created Race Yourself, which is now valued at more than £3million . Alexander Foster, 24, launched Race Yourself just last year but it is already worth £3million. The gaming platform will allow people to exercise by racing a virtual version of themselves - or even zombies -  while exercising, able to view them using technology like Google Glass. The firm has just re-located its headquarters from London to San Francisco and is expanding rapidly as it prepares to launch its first smart-watch product.

Laying low, the 27-year-old Russian model  sported a casual black wrap dress and studded sandals. Her face was covered with minimal make-up and her brunette locks were tossed into a relaxed updo. The shopping trip was undoubtedly a success, as Irina exited the store carrying two large bags. Meanwhile the model is said to be seeking a restraining order against a stalker who managed to get access to her New York home. Spicing up her wardrobe: The model was seen looking at bright, lacy pieces . The Russian beauty has filed two police reports following multiple sightings of a man loitering  around her West Village apartment, according to the New York Post's Page Six. Late last year the man managed to get inside Shayk's home while it was being renovated after it was damaged during Superstorm Sandy. Irina managed to escape and call police. The stalker has also been sending her gifts and flower over a two year period, the publication reports. Besides this ongoing stressful situation, Shyak - an aspiring actress - revealed earlier this month that she has landed a big-screen movie role opposite Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. 'For my first time on the big screen...I'm so excited and honored to say ill be working with Brett Ratner on his new movie Hercules!!! Thank u,' she tweeted. Mannequin inspiration? Irina turned  around to check out the sexy numbers on the plastic models . Success! The 27-year-old left with two big shopping bags . Meanwhile, Irina's Portuguese beau has been holidaying in Miami, Florida. Yesterday, the 28-year-old showed off his ridiculously sculpted physique as he lounged aboard a luxury yacht with some of his friends. But while he has been lapping up the Miami sun, his footballing future seems unclear, with constant rumours circulating of late about his next move. Ronaldo has been reluctant to enter talks to re-sign for his current club Real Madrid, with rumours circulating that he could re-join his old team Manchester United. Writing on his Twitter page earlier this week, he said: 'All the news about my renewal with Real Madrid are false.' Footballer's legs: There are two very obvious reasons why Ronaldo is attracted to the model . Where are you Ronny? Irina's attempts at getting a hold of her ball juggling beau did not seem to pay off .

"Land Rover is developing a ‘see-through’ car that gives drivers the sense of Superman-style ‘X-ray eyes’ to look beyond the metal at what dangers lurk beneath their vehicles. The system combines cameras in the grille and jet-fighter-style head-up display technology on the windscreen to create the appearance of a  ‘transparent’ bonnet. Although designed principally for those who want to better spot rocky terrain or deep crevices  when they take their 4X4s seriously off-road, it could even have some use in the urban jungle by allowing drivers to spot and avoid potholes lurking just out of sight. Scroll down for video... The system combines cameras in the grille and jet-fighter-style head-up display technology on the windscreen to create the appearance of a  'transparent' bonnet . The pioneering technology is to be showcased next week at the New York International Auto Show on a prototype off-roader called ‘Discovery Vision’ which signals the design direction of a new next generation ‘family’ of Land Rover Discoveries. Land Rover bosses said the system is being developed to give Land Rover drivers a ‘digital vision’ of the terrain ahead by making the front of the car ‘virtually invisible’ and is expected to become an option on future models. The system acts like an electronic periscope to project image from below the car onto the windscreen in front of the driver. Cameras in the vehicle’s grille capture mobbing pictures of the state of the road or terrain immediately ahead.

A Land Rover spokesman said: ‘The technology provides full visibility of what is underneath and in front of the car, with total clarity of otherwise hidden obstacles.’ He added: ‘It enables a driver climbing a steep incline or manoeuvring in a confined space to see an augmented reality view capturing not only the terrain in front of the car but also the angle and position of the front wheels.

There will be huge strides in environmental innovation, in safety and capability.’ A spokesman said: ’It demonstrates Land Rover’s design vision for a future family of premium sports utility vehicles built on  our key principles of emotive design, unrivalled capability and ultimate versatility. ‘From the city to the sand dunes, Land Rover’s new, driver-assisting technology will enable safer, smarter and more enjoyable driving in the SUVs of tomorrow.’","Concept combines cameras in the grille with jet-fighter-style displays on the windscreen to create the appearance of a  ‘transparent’ bonnet .

"A group of college professors have launched an initiative to help parents build fun wheelchairs and therapy vehicles for their disabled children. Frustrated by the expensive and limited wheelchair options for children, University of Delaware professors Cole Galloway, Michele Lobo and Sam Logan launched Go Baby Go, which offers instruction in how to create wheelchairs out of popular toy vehicles for about $200. According to Go Baby Go, a standard toy car can be installed with seat backs, arm rests, or other structural amenities that make transportation more comfortable for children with physical disabilities. Helping hand: University of Delaware professor Cole Galloway (pictured, left) has helped create a method for alternative wheelchairs that are constructed of toy cars . Special idea: Professor Galloway's wheelchairs can be made in a matter of hours, by installing headrests, seat backs, and other structural additions onto the cars . The trio initially started the . program in 2000, and have since created numerous instructional guides . and videos showing how to remodel kids’ four-wheelers to accommodate . disabled children’s various physical therapy needs. That idea has already helped create hundreds of affordable wheelchairs around the country. Professor Galloway revealed that the idea was inspired by a trip to the four-wheeler department at Toys R' Us. He told The Today Show: ‘Anyone can build these in a matter of hours.’ Professor . Galloway explained that the battery-powered cars’ on-and-off mechanisms . can be rewired to help build a child’s strength. For . example, he advises placing the switch on a car’s foot bed if a child . needs to build strength in their legs – as this placement will force . them to stand up as the cruise along. Wallet friendly: Professor Galloway created the Go Baby Go program to help parents create wheelchairs at a much lower cost than traditional models . Therapeutic: A trained physical therapist, Professor Galloway says that his toy car program can help children build strength too by strategically placing an on-and-off switch in areas that need therapeutic attention . For . those who need to add strength in their necks, Professor Galloway . recommends placing the switch in a headrest – forcing the child to push . their head against the rest, and therefore exert and build strength in . their neck. He said that by . using toy cars in fun designs shaped like animals or famous cartoons, . disabled children feel like they are playing, rather than struggling to . move through their day. ‘All kids deserve a ride on car that's set for them,’ Professor Galloway said. ‘That's . going to take a little bit of modification for some kids. It might take . a lot of modification for other kids. But everybody can get around . independently.’ Typical fare: Toy cars typically look like this and cost around $200 at retail .",The Go Baby Go initiative teaches parents of disabled children how they can add structural support and rewire toy cars to benefit their child’s individual needs .
"MOST women dream of an hourglass figure - but for Kelly Lee Dekay sculpting her waist has become an obsession. Inspired by her favorite comic book characters, Kelly, a fetish model, has shrunk her waist to a minuscule 16 inches using a steel boned tight-laced corset. The 27-year-old, from New York, started 'waist training' seven years ago after being inspired by the extreme shapes of voluptuous Jessica Rabbit and Marvel super-heroine 'Storm'. Scroll down for video . Kelly Lee Dekay, 27, started 'waist-training' seven years ago. The fetish model from New York claims the steel boned tight-laced corset helped her to overcome shyness . Kelly, who studies fashion, said: 'Growing up I just loved the exaggeration of styles and the beautiful costumes that comic book characters would wear and that led to the aesthetic that led to tight-lacing. 'I like that they wore their personalities externally. 'I do understand their measurements can't ever possibly be achieved because they would break. 'I think it's interesting how fabric and thread can just easily manipulate the body to do such an extreme silhouette though. ' Growing up, Kelly was a tomboy, and says that corset training has helped her to overcome childhood shyness. She said: 'As a little girl I was very shy and I loved the way comic books portrayed the characters. Kelly has been waist-training with a corset for seven years. Her middle now measures an incredible 16 inches . She continued: 'I liked that Batman is actually Bruce Wayne but when he puts on the batsuit it allows him to become this vigilante. 'He was the same person but the different outfit allowed him to channel a different side of himself. 'I've always loved how certain pieces of garments gave you permission to let out certain parts of you. 'So I think that's what tight lacing does for me, I wanted to become my own super hero villain.' But waist-training is not without it's problems and Kelly does struggle with some physical tasks. Kelly was inspired to start waist-shrinking after becoming obsessed with cartoon characters like Jessica Rabbit as a child . Kelly Lee Dekay pictured around the age of sixteen with a friend at school in New York City was incredibly shy as a child . She said: 'The corset can be restrictive when going up the stairs and you can't carry too many heavy things because you could hurt yourself. 'I actually did hiking in my corset and that's very dangerous. 'I also played soft ball in a corset once, that was an interesting feeling, but I don't go to the gym in a corset - that's really dangerous because I do weight lifting. 'But if I do want to do something extreme, I don't limit myself. If I have to be out of my corset, then I'm out of it.' Kelly works as a fetish model, here she is pictured in some of the clothing that she wears on the job . Kelly's corset is unsuitable for any exercise or heavy lifting . But despite the limitations, Kelly has no plans to hang up her corset, despite facing some negative comments online. She said: 'I get mixed reactions. 'Some people really love it, some people really hate it, but I always did it for myself - I didn't really do it for people's reactions. 'I love modifying and its often mistaken that modification is being a means of not loving yourself but I modify because I can, because it's fun. 'People say that it looks unnatural, but I have big bright blue hair - what part of me screams that I want to be like everybody else?'","Kelly Lee Dekay, 27, started 'waist-training' seven years ago .

"In a single second the blinding flash of the detonating IED knocks the solder to the ground in Afghanistan as rubble and dusty debris are spewed out. The rare and disturbing POV footage was filmed two years ago, but the shock and sheer intensity of the leveling blast still shocks. Presumably on a routine patrol in war-torn Afghanistan, the American soldier is surrounded by his comrades after the blast and miraculously survived. Scroll Down for Video . Coast is clear: The soldier is wearing a POV camera at stares up and down the deserted stretch of road in Afghanistan . While the soldier in the video is unfortunately not identified, the video serves as a reminder of the perils that servicemen and women endure daily whilst deployed to the Central Asian nation. At the height of the war against the insurgency of the Taliban in 2010, 60 percent of the 400 weekly attacks in Afghanistan were the result of roadside bombs. Data released by the Pentagon in 2010 showed 1,059 IED incidents in April of that year, one of the highest monthly numbers on record and more than double the amount in April 2009. The work performed by bomb-disposal experts - made famous by the film Hurt Locker, which was set in Iraq - became more deadly as the Taliban became more sophisticated. Detonation: The IED can be seen to explode as a blinding flash around the soldier as he walks on through the passageway . Debris: The IED throws up a huge cloud of rubble and dust that fill the lens of the camera the soldier is wearing on his head . Part of the problem was that the novice Afghan army engineers were facing an enemy that had mastered the art of bomb-making and were becoming more creative. Trained by Western military experts, the Afghan military's progress has been arduous because the Taliban had become so ingenious with their methods of killing. In the training session soldiers pass the metal detector past a disused anti-tank mine rigged with explosives. A cooker stuffed with an explosive device is placed on the side of the road. Then there is a wired, old mortar on display. One soldier is told to take his weapon off before placing a rock down on a sand mound to mark the location of an IED. Stay still: Comrades rush to the aid of the stricken soldier as he lies on the ground after being struck by the IED in Afghanistan . US Army soldiers attached the 91st U.S Cavalry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team carry a wounded comrade injured in an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blast during a patrol near Baraki Barak base in Logar Province on October 13, 2012 . Infantrymen kneel along the side of the road, practising how to keep an eye out for Taliban fighters who may stage an ambush during an IED-sweeping operation. The Taliban are also now hiding bombs in trees and walls, not just the carcasses of dogs or donkeys. They often plant IEDs in one area and melt away to do the same in another. The engineers are likely to be frustrated for lack of more sophisticated training and they need more devices to detect IEDs activated by remote-controlled devices.","Disturbing POV video footage reveals the moment an IED blast strikes a soldier in Afghanistan .

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will collect a $225,000 speaking fee from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in October, it emerged on Tuesday. The massive expense was confirmed just weeks after the university formalized a 4 per cent tuition increase for each of the next four years. Rate hikes have nearly tripled tuition costs there since 2004. Clinton will deliver the keynote address at an invitation-only gala for philanthropists and other high-dollar donors who support UNLV. The university said private funds are being tapped to pay her speaking fee. But students see a zero-sum financial gain in which that money could have chipped away at tuition increases. Cashing in: Former Secretary of State and first lady Hillary Clinton is promoting her memoirs in a nationwide book tour, but will drop by Sin City in October for a $225,000 payday . 'Not really well off': Following a blistering 2012 presidential campaign in which Democrats pilloried Republican Mitt Romney for being super-wealthy and out of touch, Clinton risks falling into that category . '$225,000? That's obscene!' UNLV student Jordan Mason told MailOnline. 'And the money is all fungible, right? Even if some CEO is writing the check, that's money that the person probably would have given to the university in some other way.' 'I like Hillary,' Mason added, 'but if she's not willing to support us without all that money changing hands, maybe they should book someone else who won't add to the reasons we're paying more for school.' Elias Benjelloun, UNLV’s undergraduate student body president, told the Las Vegas Sun this month that the school's trustees were trying to improve its offerings 'on the backs of students.' Clinton has attracted eye-rolls and guffaws from Republicans, Democrats and TV anchors alike for her recent claims that she and her husband Bill Clinton are 'not truly well off' and were 'dead broke' hen they left the White House in 2001. She told the Guardian on Saturday that Americans won't hold her big paydays against her because she and bill pay 'ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off – not to name names.' 'And we've done it through dint of hard work.' The UNLV Foundation Board of Trustees is paying Clinton's $225,000 speaking fee to the Harry Walker Agency, which books her public appearances, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The event was confirmed on behalf of the Bill, Hillary, & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, but a UNLV spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday that the money will not go to the Clintons' family philanthropy. The $200 per plate dinner will include some attendees paying as much as $20,000 for special sponsorships that include a private photo session with Hillary Clinton. The UNLV Foundation, which will collect the money, took in $49 million in its last fiscal year and ended up with $228 million in assets, according to tax records. Seems like only yesterday: Hillary Clinton's last high-profile visit to UNLV was in November 2007 at a CNN-hosted Democratic presidential primary debate against future President Barack Obama and a slate of other also-rans . High roller? The University of Nevada, Las Vegas is just blocks away from Sin City's famous casino district (background), but it's doubtful Hillary Clinton will cash in her $225,000 check for poker chips . Tim Miller, executive director of the conservative America Rising political action committee, said on Sunday that that 'if Hillary is going to run for President she might be advised to take a lengthy sabbatical from her $200k per pop speaking tour and private shopping sprees at Bergdorfs to try and reconnect with what’s happening back here on Earth.' The Clintons own stately homes in Washington, D.C. and upstate New York, along with a pricey apartment in New York City. According to 24/7 Wall Street, they are the wealthiest living former first couple. Democrats, especially those likely to be loyal to Vice President Joe Biden in the 2016 presidential race, are now joining with Republicans in bashing the former first lady for being financially tone deaf in a bad economy. 'I don't know whether it’s just that she’s been ""Madam Secretary"" for so long, but she’s generating an imperial image,' former South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian told The Washington Post on Sunday. 'She’s been living 30, going on 40 years with somebody bringing your coffee to you every morning.

"The three American hikers who were imprisoned for more than a year after accidentally crossing into Iran are telling their side of a the story in new book 'A Sliver of Light'. Sarah Shourd, Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal wrote about the holiday they took to Kurdistan in 2009 that quickly turned into a nightmare when a guide led them astray. The guide mistakenly led them into Iran, and the three college-friends were arrested. The two men spent more than two years in prison while Shourd spent most of her year behind bars in solitary confinement. Mix-up: Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd and Josh Fattal were imprisoned after accidentally hiking into Iran in 2009 . Shourd became severely depressed during her imprisonment, but there were a few periods of unexpected joy. Like the time Bauer proposed to Shourd, his girlfriend, using strings he pulled rom a towel fastened with a staple. Life behind bars: Bauer, Fattal and Shourd tell the story of their imprisonment in new book 'A Sliver of Light' In the prison yard one day, Bauer pulled her away from the surveillance cameras to pop the question. 'Baby, I didn't want to do this here,' he said. I wanted it to be somewhere beautiful, but...will you marry me?' Following their release, Shourd and Bauer were married in May 2012. They also share another fond memory from their period of imprisonment. One night, while being housed next to each other, Bauer snuck out of his cell to have sex with his girlfriend but Shourd initially protested. 'if you're caught they'll separate us, Shane. We'll lose everything,' she said. 'Please, Baby, let me do this. I need to see you,' Bauer responded. The two were never caught, but in the confusion of sneaking back to his own cell, Bauer mistakenly took Shourd's pants instead of his own. The next day, Shourd saw her boyfriend in the prison yard and laughed out loud when she noticed his mistake. But Shourd and Bauer's romantic moments were rare exceptions in the long period of a distressing confinement. Life got even worse when the trio were transferred to Evin, the Tehran prison notorious for holding political prisoners. At one point, the two men were terrorized by a guard they nicknamed 'AK'. AK initially threw Fattal, blindfolded, down a set of stairs before putting Bauer in a headlock and throwing him against the wall. Shourd was released after a year while her friends were kept behind bars for an additional year. Above, a rally for the hikers outside the United Nations in July 2011 . After a year behind bars, Shourd was released for a 'medical condition' and she joined the many on the outside championing for her friends' release.

Chavez, the then-president of Venezuela was personal friends with Iran's then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

"The refusal of the US government to pay the $132 million ransom demanded by James Foley's ISIS captors has exposed the grubby payments that compliant European nations make for their kidnapped citizens around the world. Because while the US and the UK categorically do not negotiate with terrorists and present a united front, their NATO allies frequently enter clandestine talks and have paid millions to get their people home. This year alone ISIS and Al-Qaeda are believed to have received ransom payments for three Spanish journalists released in April, and four French journalists who were freed two weeks later. Free: Didier Francois, (center) and Nicolas Henin (right, on the day they were released with Eduoard Elias) in May . Ransom paid: El Mundo correspondent Javier Espinosa (R) and freelance photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova alight from an aircraft at the military airbase in Torrejon de Ardoz near Madrid following their release . Freedom: El Mundo correspondent Javier Espinosa (R) and freelance photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova arrive at the military airbase in Torrejon de Ardoz, near Madrid following their release . Indeed, the ransom trade has fueled the seemingly inexorable rise of ISIS, pushing it to grow in strength. Just today, Chuck Hagel, the US Defense Secretary called ISIS 'well funded', no doubt as a result of their activities in extorting money in ransom from European governments . 'ISIS is as well funded and sophisticated a group we have seen...This is beyond anything we have ever seen'. FRANCE   $58.1m . QATAR AND OMAN  $20.4m . SWITZERLAND   $12.4m . SPAIN   $11m . AUSTRIA   $3.2m . According to the New York Times it wants to emulate the business model of al-Qaeda who have raked in upwards of $125 million over the last five years in ransom -  - mostly from European nations. According to a statement by the US Treasury in June, ransom payments are now the second largest source of income for terrorist groups, after state sponsorship. But all anti-terrorism experts agree that the paying ransoms perpetuates the problem of hostages. More so, it means that American's stance on non-negotiation is undermined and means Americans face never be released without the use of force. Flow of terror funds: Switzerland, France, Austria and Spain are accused of paying ransoms to terrorist groups along with Qatar and Oman . The leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has even described kidnappings as 'an easy spoil' giving swift income to his terror network. 'Thanks to Allah, most of the battle costs, if not all, were paid from through the spoils,' the newspaper quoted him as saying. 'Kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil, which I may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure.' The most prominent case - involving by far the most money - was that of four French nuclear firm employees who stunned the world when they were returned unharmed after three years in captivity. Pierre Legrand, Thierry Dol, Daniel Larribe and Marc Feret were captured in September 2010 while working on a uranium mine in northern Niger. Their touchdown at a military airport near Paris in October, where they were met by President Francois Hollande, prompted world headlines amid claims a heavy price had been paid. The French government insisted it used diplomacy to free the four men, with Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian saying: ‘France has held the same position for the past three years - we don’t pay.' But the French newspaper Le Monde, renowned for its secret service contacts, reported the country's intelligence agencies paid 20million Euros or $28 million for their release. The New York Times investigation puts this figure far higher - at 30million Euros or $39 million which it is claimed was paid by a state-owned company. Snatched: . Foley was taken by an armed gang in Syria on Thanksgiving Day in 2012. He was then held with other journalists in terrible conditions. They . spoke out about the harsh treatment Foley endured . The New York Times also claims France paid Al Qaeda 12.5million Euros or $16 million in 2011 to free three hostages from France, Togo and Madagascar. The total - $58 million - means France's payments were almost than triple those of the next-highest payer, Qatar and Oman with $19.9 million. Switzerland also paid $12,11 million, Spain paid $10.78 million and Austria paid $3.15 million, while the source of another $21.57 million in ransom money could not be determined. Indeed, according to recently released prisoners, their ISIS captors were extremely aware of their prisoners monetary value, as judged by their nationality. It was six weeks after a failed July 4 mission to rescue James Foley authorized by President Obama involving 'nearly every US military service' that his captors sent his family and the US government a $132 million ransom demand. As well as money, the terror group had also requested the release of Aafia Siddiqui, an M.I.T. graduate and Pakistani neuroscientist with ties to Al Qaeda currently locked up in Texas. Over the nearly two years he was hostage, James Foley's parents received numerous financial demands to secure his release. His family were explicitly told by the government to not discuss the ransom demands with the press nor to name ISIS as his kidnappers. According to Reuters journalist, David Rohde, Foley believed he would ultimately be freed by his own government. 'Foley believed that his government would help him,' says Rohde according to The Wrap. 'In a message that was not made public, Foley said that he believed so strongly that Washington would help that he refused to allow his fellow American captives to not believe in their government.' Ransom: . It has emerged that ISIS demanded a staggering $132m ransom for the . return of Foley. Philip Balboni, the CEO and co-founder of GlobalPost, . the Boston-based website that Foley was reporting for when he was . captured told MailOnline it was considerably higher than for European . captives 'purely because he was an American . His former boss, GlobalPost co-founder and CEO Philip Balboni told WCVB on Wednesday that he spent millions trying to secure his reporter's release. 'You know when you kidnap someone and hold them for almost two years, you don't do it unless you believe there is value in those hostages.' 'We received an email from the captors on Wednesday night of last week stating their intention to execute Jim,' Balboni said. 'The email was full of rage. We pleaded with the captors for mercy, but to no avail.' Now, the failure to free Foley or negotiate his release has backed the president into a corner as he deals with the threat to kill the second hostage paraded in front of the camera on Tuesday, Steven John Sotloff. Indeed, at the end of Tuesday's grisly video, Foley's executioner, who is widely believed to be British, delivers an ominous threat towards the White House. 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,' Sick . propaganda: James was forced to say in the beheading video: 'Think . about what you are doing. Think about the lives you destroy, including . those of your own family,' before he was murdered . Inspiration: . Diane and John Foley Snr., told reporters outside their home in New . Hampshire on Wednesday how James was inspired to report in war zones . because of his brothers in the military . The policy of non-negotiation, which the US shares with UK, now puts it increasingly at odds with many of it NATO partners. In an opinion piece for Reuters, David Rohde, who works for the news agency argues that by launching a mission and not paying the ransom contributed to Foley's death. 'The payment of ransoms and abduction of foreigners must emerge from the shadows. It must be publicly debated,' wrote Mr. Rohde, who escaped from the Taliban himself by climbing out of a window. 'American and European policy makers should be forced to answer for their actions.'","Since 2008 it is estimated that ISIS and al-Qaeda has raked in $125 million in ransom payments .

"Jailed teacher Jeremy Forrest is to be moved to a sex offenders’ prison nearly 200 miles away from his former school after the pupil he ran away with tried to contact him and obtain visitor rights, it has emerged. Forrest is currently serving a five-and-a-half-year sentence at the mainstream Lewes prison, East Sussex, only a few miles from Bishop Bell School, Eastbourne, where he started the affair with the 15-year-old. But he is now being moved to a specialist jail 179 miles away after The Mail on Sunday revealed that his victim managed to get a letter to him and bombarded the governor with calls demanding to see him. Jeremy Forrest, 30, abducted the girl and took her to France, where he was caught . The transfer is likely to scupper any chances of his victim, who is now 16 and studying for her  A-levels, meeting him face to face before his release, expected to be in 2015. Lucy Duckworth, of child protection campaign group See Changes, said: ‘It is a good thing that he is being moved and to a specialist jail. Hopefully he will recognise the terrible nat . Forrest was jailed in June after being convicted of abduction and admitting a further five counts of sexual activity with a child. HMP Lewes, the prison the ex-teacher was moved from . Last month, The Mail on Sunday revealed that the victim had written to the 30-year-old in jail vowing to ‘wait for ever’  and had bombarded his current prison governor with calls demanding visitor rights. Forrest’s sister also said he told her he plans to marry his former pupil when he is released. The former maths teacher will be moved this month to Ashfield prison, near Bristol, one of five controversial new jails designed to house only sex offenders. Built to cope with the dramatic increase in the number of people being convicted of sexual abuse, they have faced a barrage of criticism, with many people fearing that keeping abusers together could reinforce their behaviour. Last night a Prison Service spokesman refused to comment on the transfer.

"A convicted felon charged with kidnapping and killing an Arkansas real estate agent proclaimed his innocence in this week’s jailhouse interview, telling a reporter that Beverly Carter's death was 'an accident.' Arron Michael Lewis, 33, was arrested two weeks ago in connection to the disappearance and slaying of Carter, a married mother of two, who vanished after meeting with Lewis to show him a house. Carter's body was discovered five days later buried on the grounds of a concrete company in the town of Cabot. Scroll down for videos . Confessions of a dangerous mind: Murder suspect Arron Lewis, 33, said from behind bars that he did not kidnap or murder Beverly Carter last month . 'Claims of innocence': The ex-convict accused the prosecution of trying to pin the kidnapping and killing of Beverly Carter (right) on him based on his lengthy rap sheet . Speaking to a KARK-TV reporter, Lewis insisted that Carter went with him willingly, and that whatever happened to her was an accident . Lewis, an ex-convict with a lengthy criminal history, was apprehended by police September 29 and charged with capital murder, kidnapping and gun possession. He pleaded not guilty to all counts. Speaking to a reporter from KARK-TV this week from jail, Mr Lewis, clad in all white and sitting behind a glass divider, stated: 'I didn't murder her, and anything that did occur was an accident. Arron Lewis pleaded not guilty to capital murder in the slaying of real estate agent Beverly Carter in rural Arkansas . 'I never denied her going with me, [but] as far as kidnapping, I've never kidnapped anybody.' Asked about his meeting with Mrs Carter on the day of her disappearance September 25, Lewis said it had nothing to do with her showing the house. The 33-year-old reiterated that he did not put Beverly Carter in his car by force. 'I mean, somebody goes with your of their own free will, they're not being kidnapped,' he told the reporter. Sounding a defiant note, Lewis accused the prosecution of trying to pin the murder on him simply based on his past misdeeds, including convictions of credit card fraud and theft. 'It's not as clean-cut as they're wrapping it up to be,' Lewis said. The murder suspect added that while he has an extensive rap sheet, he is not the cold-blooded killer that the prosecutors are making him out to be. ‘My lawyer said that we're taking a beating in the media,’ Lewis lamented. ‘My response to him was I'm not taking a beating in the media - I'm being crucified.’ Investigators found the body of Beverly Carter September 30 at Argos Concrete Company in a rural area about 25 miles northeast of Little Rock. Hours later, Arron Lewis was charged with capital murder, kidnapping and multiple counts of gun possession. Carter's body was found more than 20 miles away from Scott, where she had an appointment to show a house five days earlier. Grim discovery: Mrs Carter's body was found in a shallow grave at Argos Concrete Company in a rural area about 25 miles northeast of Little Rock (pictured beyond the donut store) Perp walk: Lewis is seen here been led in handcuffs to a car that would transport him to Pulaski County Jail . Lewis was apprehended in Little Rock by the local police at around 10am September 29 in connection with the case. As he was being led in handcuffs to a car to be transported to Pulaski County Jail, a KARK reporter asked Lewis if he killed Beverly Carter. 'No,' he replied, adding that he has not seen her for two days. In response to a reporter's question 'why Beverly?' he replied: 'Because she was just a woman that worked alone, a rich broker.' It's understood that Lewis did not give up the location of the body, but that police received a tip that led them to the makeshift burial site in the 12100 block of Highway 5 in Cabot. Following the devastating discovery, the Carter family released a statement  mourning the loss of their 'precious Beverly.' 'There is now a hole in our hearts that will never be filled,' the statement read. 'Mr Lewis robbed us of an amazing wife, loving mother and grandmother.' The Little Rock blog Forbidden Hillcrest tweeted that Lewis was captured in Pleasant Pointe apartments on Green Mountain Drive after allegedly pulling a knife on a bystander. A passerby recognized Lewis from the news coverage and approached him, sending the man fleeing towards the Pleasant Pointe apartments. Cornered: Lewis jumped from a window and tried to flee, but was surrounded by officers (pictured) Nowhere to run: Lewis is pictured with his hands cuffed behind his back outside a Little Rock housing complex . Humble abode: This is a house in Little Rock where murder suspect Arron Lewis once lived . As responding officers arrived outside the building, Lewis allegedly burst into the manager's office and jumped out the window in an attempt to flee, but was immediately caught. Lewis was named as a 'person of interest' after being involved in a car accident and taken to a hospital by police - before fleeing while officers thought he was having a CT scan done. Authorities released images of Lewis, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, with blood on his face following the crash in a bid to track him down. According to the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office, deputies received a call at around 10am September 28 about a single-vehicle crash in the 8700 block of Cato Road in Jacksonville, in which Arron Lewis' vehicle smashed into a concrete culvert. A bloodied Mr Lewis reportedly told the responding officers that someone had run him off the road. A witness told investigators that Lewis was driving at a high speed when he lost control of his vehicle in a curve, KARK reported.. Notorious: Lewis has criminal records in several states, including Arkansas, Missouri and Utah . The sheriff's office also has revealed that the 33-year-old is an active parolee with a long criminal history, including charges of felony theft; accomplice to theft; unlawful removal of theft device; obstruction of government operations, and other counts. Lewis also has rap sheets in Kansas City, Missouri, and in Utah. He was released on parole in Arkansas in August 2013. Earlier, Mrs Carter's husband of 35 years, Carl, made a tearful plea for authorities and residents to do all they can to find her. Mr Carter found his wife's car abandoned outside the house, which was left unlocked and open. Dark past: Lewis has a long criminal history and is currently an active parolee . Tragic: Mrs Carter was a realtor with Crye-Leike in Little Rock, Arkansas . Mr Carter, who raised the alarm after his wife didn't come back from her appointment after three and a half hours, has since received unusual text messages from her phone, but no other sign of her. Describing the moments he went to look for her, he told KARK: 'By eight o'clock I knew something was wrong - but I waited to eight thirty. I went up in the house, went through every closet, everything.' Matriarch: Beverly Carter has been married for 34 years and has four grandchildren . Property: Mrs Carter was showing this property in Scott, Arkansas, to an unknown buyer who reportedly said he would be willing to pay in cash . According to ABC News, the home had been foreclosed, and Mrs Carter, who worked for the Crye-Leike real estate company in Little Rock, was showing it to a buyer she had never met, who said he could pay in cash. Her husband said that he received unusual texts from her number at 1am the morning after she disappeared. He said: 'All of a sudden I received three texts in a row. One said ""Yes."" Then she sent another text that said, ""My phone's low. The battery's down, and I'll call you whenever I get signal."" 'And, then, straight back-to-back, I received a text that said ""Oh, I'm out drinking with some friends.""' 'Beverly's not a drinker…We just want our mom back, and my wife of 35 years…I need her.'

"Southampton have moved to further fill the void left by their summer departures by signing striker Graziano Pelle. The Italian has penned a three-year deal with the Saints, leaving Feyenoord and following former boss Ronald Koeman to the south coast. The 28-year-old scored 27 goals for the Rotterdam club in the 2013/14 season and will be viewed as a replacement for Rickie Lambert, who moved to Liverpool earlier in the summer. VIDEO Scroll down for Southampton's Pelle finds net for Feyenoord with cheeky mule-kick . New arrival: Southampton completed the £8m signing of Pelle from Dutch side Feyenoord earlier this summer . Signing on: Pelle has agreed a three-year contract at St Mary's and is re-united with former manager Ronald Koeman . Proud: Pelle tweeted this message and picture after completing his move . Delighted: Ronaldo Koeman posted this message on Twitter after the deal was completed . Koeman has been tasked with rebuilding key areas of the Southampton first team since taking over from Mauricio Pochettino last month, with Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw having also left. He signed playmaker Dusan Tadic on Tuesday and the capture of Pelle will be seen as another important move. Pelle started his career with Lecce and had a number of loan spells before moving to AZ Alkmaar, where he first made contact with Koeman. A return to Italy and Parma followed, before taking in Sampdoria and then Feyenoord and Koeman again. His goalscoring feats of last season mean he is the second highest-scoring Italian to have played outside of Serie A. Prolific: Pelle scored 26 times in 33 matches in all competitions for Feyenoord during the last campaign . 'I'm really happy that it's finally signed,' Pelle told his new club's official website. 'I had some teams interested in me, but this is going to be the best choice for me because the club wants to keep improving every year. 'The talks between us were only short in terms of how long it took to convince each other. I was pretty sure that, for me, this would be a great step. '[Ronald] Koeman and I worked together for two amazing years at Feyenoord, and I hope that it will be the same here. 'There are many good things about this club other than the trainer. The Premier League is amazing, and Southampton is showing year by year that it wants to improve.' New man: Southampton boss Ronald Koeman believes Pelle can replicate his Feyenoord form at St Mary's . Koeman believes he has got a rare commodity in his new man. He said 'I had Graziano in my team for my last two years at Feyenoord. He scored a lot of goals - more than 50 in two seasons - and they brought a lot of points to the club. 'Goals mean points, and we needed a good player in that position after Rickie Lambert left. 'In terms of his qualities, he's a tall striker with a lot of movement and he's fast. He's a player who gives confidence to the team because he keeps the ball, and he's very dangerous in front of goal.'","Saints unveil 28-year-old striker as latest signing .

"It is the largest monument from the ancient era in northern Europe, but Hadrian's Wall in fact has an older and more northern brother. Archaeologists have been carrying out research into a huge late fist century AD defence system, which stretches 120 miles across Scotland. A total of 14 forts and several fortlets, which formed part of a defensive network built in the AD 70s, have so far been investigated over the past decade by the team, led by Dr Birgitta Hoffmann and Dr David Wolliscroft, both of the University of Liverpool. Archaeologists have been carrying out research into a huge defence system, which is believed to have been built in the AD 70s and stretches 120 miles across Scotland . The structure is not believed to be a continuous wall or ditch, but instead consist of 20 forts, a dozen fortlets and up to 30 watchtowers in total, the BBC History Magazine has reported. The network, which is thought to have run from Montrose or Stonehaven, south of Aberdeen, on the North Sea coast to the Firth or Clyde, was built some 50 years before Hadrian's Wall, and is an extra 20 years older than Antonine Wall. The team, who have carried out surveys of seven of the largest forts over the last five years, are hunting for the missing fortlets and towers. The forts are believed to have been manned by more troops than previously thought and it is also believed many were cavalry units. The BBC has reported the defensive line was built by the Romans in an attempt to keep hold of the land they had invaded in around 69 or 70 Ad from hostile northern Caledonian tribes. It also thought however that the . fortress protected the friendly lowland tribes from cattle-raiders, . fostering good relations which led to large civilian settlements being . set up near the forts. According to the BBC, these settlements could have been made up of merchants, craftsmen and possibly girlfriends of the troops. Hadrian's Wall (pictured) is the largest monument from the ancient era in northern Europe, but archaeologists have been carrying out research into its older brother . Hadrian's Wall remained in use until the early fifth century . Although the Romans in Scotland had good . relations with many of the locals, they did have tensions with the . northern Caledonian tribes, which is thought to have eventually erupted . into major conflict in AD 83 or 84. It is thought the two sides clashed at the battle of 'Mons Graupis', with up to 30,000 men fighting on either side. The precise location of the battle is still unknown, however it is possible the research along the Scottish fortress, abandoned by the Romans in about AD 87, could lead to its discovery. Hadrian's Wall, which stretches across northern England, was built in 122 AD on the orders of the Roman emperor Hadrian to mark his empire's northern frontier. It took eight years to build the 73 mile-long wall from the Solway Firth to Wallsend on the Tyne. It is believed to have provided a barrier between Roman Britain and Scotland and is thought to have been where the army could determine who was allowed access to the empire. It remained in use until the early fifth century when, with the empire collapsing and the city of Rome itself under threat, the Romans left British shores. It is the largest monument from the ancient era in northern Europe and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. When Emperor Hadrian built Hadrian's Wall nearly 2,000 years ago, it extended 73 miles coast to coast across northern England from the Solway Firth to Wallsend on the Tyne. Standing 16ft high and up to 12ft wide, it was an extraordinary feat of engineering which was completed in eight years. It was built in AD 122 after Emperor Hadrian ordered his soldiers to build a barrier between Roman Britain and Scotland. According to the Hadrian's Wall Trust, a chief function of the wall was probably frontier control, where the army enforced the regulations which determined access to the empire. It is believed people could only enter the empire at certain points and would have been forced to travel unarmed and under military escort to markets or other specified places. It is also believed to have helped to prevent raiding. It was believed to have been the first of two fortifications built across Great Britain. The Antonine Wall, however, is the lesser known of the two because its physical remains are less evident. As well as being a strong military fortification, it is believed the wall featured a number of gates which would have served as customs posts. It is the largest monument from the ancient era in northern Europe and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.","Archaeologists reveal Roman defence system in Scotland .

"A man has lost an incredible 11st and transformed his life after his wife casually signed them up to Weight Watchers after a night out. Chris Eichfeld's, 39, from Washington DC, story is made all the more remarkable by the fact he achieved his weight loss while in his job at a fast food company. Rather than a eureka moment or dramatic event, Chris's weight loss began in an almost accidental way. Chris has managed to drop from 23st (left) to a trim 10st 7lbs (right, with his wife Diane, who also lost weight alongside Chris ) through a calorie controlled diet . Chris was out for dinner with his wife Diana, 39, to celebrate her birthday when she casually mentioned that a voucher they had received for Weight Watchers membership was about to expire, and that she planned to sign them both up. That spur of the moment decision began a year long journey which saw both Diana and Chris totally transform their diets and lives, with the result that Chris dropped over 11st (154lb) in weight. Chris struggled with his weight throughout his childhood, often suffering from lung infections meaning sports were difficult for him. ‘I had asthma and my father smoked and I always had bronchitis. Consequently, running wasn’t easy and I was never overly good at sports. So there was just food. The way we ate as a family was always a meat, a potato and then a starchy vegetable covered in butter and massive portions. ‘My father, my mother and my sister were all overweight. We were just a fat family. We were your typical American fat family and I was just terrified of it.’ Chris and Diane, with their son, before they both embarked on their weight loss journey . Chris and Diana, pictured here with their son Aidan, were previously eating a high fat diet, which included a lot of red meat, dairy products, bread and chips . Although Chris grew up and found love with Diana, welcoming a son, Aidan, now 9, and finding a fulfilling job working in the catering industry, his weight continued to be an issue for him. ‘I worked in hotels, restaurants and I was constantly around food. I never put myself in a position to be successful with weight loss. Part of my issue was not just what I ate, but how much of it I ate. I had no self-control, I wouldn’t have one sandwich, I’d have two.  There was no sense of portioning or restraint. ‘My wife and I always wanted to lose weight but we just never had the self-motivation. We always said it would be great and then never did anything about it.’ At 6ft Chris, who works at Five Guys Burgers and Fries, had reached 23st  (322lb) when his wife signed him up to Weight Watchers. When Diane signed them both up to the slimming group after her birthday meal, Chris did not hold much hope for success, but found the gradual reduction of calories and online services offered meant the process was not as daunting as he had expected. Despite his colossal weight loss, Chris says the main effect has been the way those around him have reacted to his drastically changed appearance (Chris before his weight loss, left, and now, right) ‘When the . weight started coming off, I thought, I can do this. What helped for me . was that fruits and unprocessed vegetables are zero points so you can . snack on those all the time. I can eat those all day. 'I started out and I said ok – let me get below 300lbs. That was 20lb. Then I said - let me hit 270. 'Then I thought, I can lose 100lb.’ The . family swapped their high fat diet, which included a lot of red meat, . dairy products, bread and chips, for a largely home-made, unprocessed . food with lots of fruit and vegetables. As the weight began to fall off, Chris was able to become more active and began running . Despite . not finding the diet too much of a struggle, Chris says having the . support of his wife, who was following the plan alongside him, was a . huge help. I . didn’t do the meetings but I had my wife. We had the same foods. We . could talk to each other and share ideas. There wasn’t bad foods in the . pantry. ‘Finally, when we got it, the weight loss came easily and it wasn’t as much of a challenge as I thought it would be. It also helped us get athletic. Being lighter enabled us to run, to get out and be more active.’ Chris, pictured with his son Aidan after completing the the Run or Dye race, says he now realises that he was not happy when he was overweight . But despite losing 11st (154lb) - half his body weight,-  Chris says much of the change has been a shift in the perception others had of him. ‘I’ve learned is that you never really see yourself as heavy as you are and you never really see yourself as thin as you are. You need someone outside to give you that perspective. 'People I worked with after I lost the weight said to me, “Man, I was worried about you, you would be out of breath walking down the corridor.” And I just had no idea. I chose not to see that about myself.’ Now maintaining his new low weight and enjoying a new active and healthy lifestyle, Chris says that, despite slightly falling into his diet by accident, he realises he wasn’t happy at his former size. 'I look back and see I was angry. I didn’t realise it, but I was angry. I wasn’t comfortable in my own skin and if you’re not OK with yourself then you’ll make everyone else around you miserable.'

Bush has a net worth of $23 . million, but much of that comes from the value of his home and a 100+ . acre estate he owns in Maine. In his hey day, H.W. Bush would charge anywhere from $60,000 - $80,000. In 1993 H.W. charged a record-breaking $100,00 for a speech. Bill Clinton has since topped that with a $750,000 speech. President . Barack Obama has the lowest net worth of all the living presidents, . coming in at $5 million. Most of that money can be attributed to the . royalties he received on the two books he wrote before becoming . president, the 1995 hit Dreams from May Father and his 2006 book The . Audacity of Hope. In terms of the richest presidents ever, Bill Clinton ranks in the top 10. The wealthiest American president in history, according to 24/7 Wall Street, . was John F.

"An Occupy Wall Street protester who served food at the New York camp has been arrested on charges of sexually abusing a woman and is a suspect in a rape at Zuccotti Park. Tonye Iketubosin, 26, was charged yesterday after allegedly groping an 18-year-old protester in a tent he helped her pitch on October 24. The victim told police in a delayed report on Tuesday Iketubosin had refused to leave when she returned hours later to sleep. Accused: Tonye Iketubosin, 26, a kitchen worker at the Occupy Wall Street camp in Zuccotti Park, is led away by police to be quizzed over a series of sex attacks . Reports suggest the woman had managed to shove the man out of the tent after he grabbed her thigh and buttocks. It is not believed she was acquainted with him before the incident. Police confirmed to MailOnline Iketubosin was arrested on Broadway and Liberty shortly after the incident was reported. He was arraigned last night with bail set at $7,500 bond or $5,000 cash. Iketubosin, who resides with his aunt in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, has a sealed juvenile record in Texas. The prosecutor told the New York Post Iketubosin is a suspect in several rapes in the park. He was being questioned over an alleged assault that occurred on October 29, after another 18-year-old woman from Massachusetts accused Iketubosin of raping her in a tent at the encampment. 'The 99 per cent': A sign at the Occupy Wall Street encampment in Zuccotti Park reads: 'No Bulls, No Bears only Pigs' on November 1 . Occupy Wall Street spokesman Patrick Bruner told DNA Info he was not aware of specifics about the alleged incidents. 'But I can say that we take security and safety very seriously at the park and have many dedicated working groups that are devoted to creating and maintaining a safe space in Liberty Square,' he said. Reports of sexual assaults have prompted concerns about security in New York's Zuccotti Park, and other cities where Occupy demonstrations are taking place. Dallas police recently arrested convicted sex offender Richard Wayne Armstrong, 24, for having sex with a 14-year-old runaway in the Occupy Dallas camp. Armstrong is being held on felony charges of failure to register as a sex offender and sexual assault of a minor. The girl is in the custody of Child Protective Services. ABC News reports on October 15, police responded to a delayed report of a sexual assault at Occupy Cleveland. Demonstration: Princeton University Professor Cornel West, far left, march with Occupy Wall Street protesters to Goldman Sachs headquarters on Thursday . Order: Motorcycle police keep Occupy Wall Street protesters on the sidewalk as they march to Goldman Sachs  headquarters . The news came as Mayor Michael Bloomberg cited unconfirmed reports today that Occupy Wall Street protesters are allowing crimes to go unreported and are instead chasing wrongdoers out of their park encampment. He declined, however, to say whether the information could be grounds for police to forcibly evict protesters from the site. 'Instead of calling the police, they form a circle around the perpetrator, chastise him or her and chase him or her out into the rest of the city to do who knows what to who knows whom,' Bloomberg said, although he noted the city was uncertain of the reports' accuracy. 'If this is in fact happening, and it's very hard to get good information, it is despicable.' Meanwhile, in lower Manhattan today, 17 Occupy Wall Street protesters were arrested today at Goldman Sachs' headquarters. Many of the protesters were carried off by police after refusing to move. Arrests: Police handcuff an Occupy Wall Street protester as thegroup staged a sit-down at Goldman Sachs . Sit-down: Reverend Billy is arrested at the demonstration, along with 16 others . Cause: Protesters marched from  Zuccotti Park and delivered statements demanding the financial giant take responsibility for its role in the economic crisis . Several hundred activists marched from Zuccotti Park a few blocks away. Officers flanking them had handcuffs strapped to their waists. At the Goldman Sachs building, police demanded that the protesters get off the private pavement in front of the entrance. Most did. But the rest sat down and refused to walk. Also in New York City, more than 50 people arrested at an Occupy Wall Street march rejected offers to get disorderly conduct cases dismissed by staying out of trouble for six months, saying they wanted trials on what some called unjustified arrests. Prosecutors say the demonstrators blocked traffic and prevented pedestrians from getting by. But many of the protesters say the disorderly conduct charges weren't justified. They say they stayed on the sidewalk, took care to leave a path for others to get through and followed police instructions.","Reports of sexual assaults in Dallas, Cleveland and New York Occupy camps .

"David Cameron is expected to put a female minister in every Government department to counter claims that he has a ‘woman problem’. A senior Tory source said the Prime Minister would use his forthcoming reshuffle to promote women and address the ‘gender imbalance’ in his top team. He added: ‘You will see a lot more women coming through. The Government will look and feel quite different.’ The news came as Labour accused the Conservatives of  sexism, saying that only one of the 14 Tory MPs given major honours since the election was a woman. Prime Minister David Cameron is considering appointing one female minister to each government department . While in Opposition, Mr Cameron said 30 per cent of his ministerial team would be women within one parliament. But progress has been slow, with just 25 female ministers out of 120 – or 21 per cent. The total includes only three full members of Mr Cameron’s 22-strong Cabinet. Aides doubt the target can be met in the reshuffle, which is expected in weeks. But they believe he will make significant progress and end the embarrassment of having seven departments with no women ministers. Esther McVey, pictured, is widely expected to get promoted to Cabinet as part of the next reshuffle . Sources expect at least one woman to be moved up to the Cabinet. Employment Minister Esther McVey is heavily tipped for promotion, as are Women’s Minister Nicky  Morgan and Childcare Minister Liz Truss. Mr Cameron will also have to bring a number of women into the Government for the first time. Potential names include Portsmouth MP and Royal Navy reservist Penny Mordaunt, who hit the headlines this year after appearing on the reality TV show Splash!. Another contender is rising star Priti Patel, a former adviser to Foreign Secretary William Hague, who was appointed to the Prime Minister’s policy board last year to help draw up plans for the next Tory manifesto.","Cameron expected to wield the axe during next 'immanent' reshuffle .

"A tractor pulling a cart full of watermelons bearing a racially charged sign stirred controversy at a small town Fourth of July parade last week. ‘White history month,’ was emblazoned on the side of farmer Donnie Spell’s float in a Hope Mills, North Carolina parade Thursday. The sign also read ‘HUG WTE PPL.’ And as is chugged along the parade route waving a Confederate Flag, many residents took offense to the racial implications. Courtin' controversy: Hope Mills, North Carolina farmer Donnie Spell tacked a sign with racial implications to his 4th of July parade float . Hope Mills Director of Parks and Recreation Kenny Bullock oversaw the parade entries. He told WNCN there was no mention of the signs on Spell’s float application. According to Bullock, Spell only listed that he’d be parading with 8-10 antique tractors, one with a trailer of watermelons for sale. Bullock said he asked the Spell family to remove the sign. Indeed, a photo of the trailer can be seen on the Hope Mills Chamber of Commerce website without it. But apparently the sign was placed back on the trailer of watermelons because photos clearly show it as the tractor and its Confederate flag pulled through town. What sign? A chamber of commerce photo snapped before the parade shows no sign. Director of Parks and Recreation Kenny Bullock said Spell was told to remove the potentially offense sign . Implications: The sign was clearly replaced, however, and toted alongside a Confederate flag . Alicia Jones was attending the parade with her young son and said she was completely taken aback by what she saw. ‘At that time his innocence was broken, and I had to sit there in the parade and explain to my son what that, at seven years old,’ Jones told WNCN. ‘I mean it really caught me off-guard.’ Bullock and town commissioner Pat Edwards said Spell had been in parades before. In the past, he was allowed to display his antique tractors as he did Thursday, and even to wave the Confederate flag. Shocked: 'It really caught me off-guard,' said attendee Alicia Jones. She had to explain the sign to her 7-year-old son . This year, though, he took things further. ‘I know where they're coming from,’ Edwards said of the townspeople like Jones who couldn’t believe what they saw. ‘I know some of them were hurt by it, and it's just something that happened, and I'm sorry it happened.’ While other trailers bore signs like ‘I didn’t vote for Obama’ and ‘God loves rednecks,’ Spell’s was just too much, said Jones. ‘I think there needs to be an apology, and he needs to not be able to submit,’ she said ‘to be in any parade again.’ Bullock is considering creating clearer, more specific guidelines for future parade entries but said he’s unsure if Spell can legally be banned from pulling his tractors during next year’s festivities. Apology: 'I know some of them were hurt by it, and it's just something that happened, and I'm sorry it happened,' said commissioner Pat Edwards .",Donnie Spell's trailer of watermelons also read 'HUG WTE PPL'
"Edwin van der Sar believes Brazil are the favourites to win the World Cup because they will be able to handle the conditions the better than any other team. Luiz Felipe Scolari's side are going in search of their sixth World Cup and will have the advantage of playing at home. And former Dutch keeper Van der Sar, who won 130 caps for his country, says Brazil are the team to beat. Close shave: Edwin van der Sar believes Oscar, Daniel Alvez and the rest of the Brazil squad have the best chance . Going all the way: With players like Fred and Neymar, Brazil have emerged as favourites . Van der Sar told Laureus Sport: 'I think Brazil are clear favourites because of the weather, the humidity, the warmth, the expectation from the people. 'And besides, there are so many good football players that they can put two or three teams in the World Cup. So I think it will be very hard for an outsider, or maybe a European team, to get to the final and try to win it.  I think Brazil will win for the sixth time.' But when it comes to individual star, the ex-Manchester United keeper is in no doubt who will shine, he added: 'My friend Cristiano Ronaldo. I played a couple times against him in 2006 and 2008.  We always lost and I think it is fair to say that Ronnie could well be top scorer of the tournament.' Van der Sar has also tipped England's Joe Hart to have a long and successful career ahead of him – despite suffering difficulties earlier this season when he was dropped by City earlier in the season. Van der Sar added: 'I think sometimes it is not bad to have a period that you are making mistakes and maybe you are on the bench for a couple of games. Shinning star: Cristiano Ronaldo is tipped to be the stand out player by Van der Sar . Tipped for the top: Van der Sar is expecting big things from Ronaldo . 'Maybe that helps to bring back your focus and the desire and the will. I think the second part of the season, he really performed at the level that he is capable of. 'The save that comes in my mind is the one he did against Everton for Manchester City. 'Those are the saves that you want to make and shows that you are ready for business. Hopefully the pressure of the nation is not going to be too much on him. Turning it around: Joe Hart can be one of the best keepers in the World . 'He is 27. I was 28 when I went to Juventus; I was 30 when I came to Fullham and I was 34 when I went to Manchester United. 'So, it is a long path that you have to go.  Hopefully he has a long career, and normally as a goalkeeper, you keep getting better and better by the games you play.

"Coalition tensions over immigration boiled over last night after the Home Office launched a provocative poster campaign telling illegal immigrants to ‘go home’. The Liberal Democrats reacted furiously to the initiative, with party president Tim Farron condemning the billboards as the ‘politics of division’, and saying they should be ‘shredded’. In a separate intervention, Vince Cable said the Coalition’s immigration policy was ‘totally illogical’ and ‘very damaging’ to the economy. Unlikely allies: UKIP leader Nigel Farage (left) condemned the 'unpleasant' campaign while Lib Dem president Tim Farron called for the posters to be shredded . The Business Secretary said that . cracking down on foreign students and skilled workers from outside . Europe when the public is mainly concerned about mass immigration from . the European Union was ‘like having a family quarrel and trying to . resolve it by kicking the cat’. The giant billboards, which are being driven around on the back of vans, say: ‘In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.’ Illegal immigrants are offered a number to text for ‘free advice and help with travel documents’. Tory Immigration Minister Mark Harper . said the controversial poster campaign would encourage illegal . immigrants to leave voluntarily – and serve as ‘an alternative to being . led away in handcuffs’. Speaking at the launch of the . campaign, Mr Harper said the initiative was ‘just another part of the . reforms of the immigration system that have cut out abuse and seen net . migration drop to its lowest levels in nearly a decade’. Advertisment: Vans bearing signs asking illegal immigrants to text the government are being driven around London . The initiative is being piloted in six London boroughs but could be extended nationally if successful. The . billboards also display the number of illegal migrants arrested . recently in the area the vans are visiting. The blunt message will also . be displayed in leaflets, posters and advertisements in local . newspapers. Critics claim that illegal immigrants face only a minimal risk of deportation. The Commons home affairs select . committee reported this month that the now-defunct UK Border Agency had . left behind a backlog of more than 500,000 cases, which would take 37 . years to clear at the current rate of progress. Overstayed: The Home Office believes 200,000 people may still be in the UK after their visas have expired . But the Home Office campaign prompted an angry response from the Lib Dem part of the Coalition. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘These . poster vans were not cleared or agreed by Lib Dems in government. We are . totally committed to tackling illegal immigration but this is a . disproportionate, distasteful and ineffective way to do it.’ Mr Farron wrote on Twitter: ‘These . “Go home” posters are the politics of division – the billboards must be . shredded, and now.’ Lib Dem peer Lord Roberts of Llandudno, also raised . the ‘dreadful Home Office campaign’ in the House of Lords, saying the . posters were ‘creating a great divide in our communities’. The poster campaign also drew . unexpected criticism from UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who . described the initiative as a ‘diversion’ from the issue of legal mass . immigration from the EU. Help: Illegal immigrants who text the new number will be offered free advice on how to get back home . Mr Farage told ITV’s Daybreak . programme the posters were a direct response to UKIP’s surge in the . polls. But he said voters wanted action on immigration, not publicity . stunts. ‘I think the tone of the billboards . is nasty, unpleasant, Big Brother,’ he said. ‘I don’t think using . messages like this will make any difference. What will make a difference . is enforcing our borders properly. ‘It’s also a diversion: the real . problem isn’t illegal immigration, there are perhaps one million illegal . immigrants in the country. The real problem is that on January 1st next . year we’re opening up our borders to 28million people from Bulgaria and . Romania.’ Meanwhile, Mr Cable has attacked  the . Government’s Tory-led immigration policy. He said there was a sense of . ‘panic’ among Tory ministers in their response to public concern about . mass immigration from the EU, which the Government can do little about. Answering questions after delivering . the Management Consultancies Association annual lecture, Mr Cable said . the immigration policy ‘doesn’t actually deal with the problem that . people worry about’. He said implementation of the policy was ‘very, very damaging in many respects’. Mr Cable added: ‘It doesn’t sit very . easily with being open for business. My job is to attract inward . investment and show that we are open for business.’ He said overseas students were not . actually immigrants, but were included in the Government’s cap on . immigrants from outside the EU. ‘It is totally illogical, but that is . the policy,’ he added. The row comes as the Tories step up both action and rhetoric on immigration in the run-up to the next election. David Cameron warned this week that immigration is a ‘constant drain’ on public services. He . also suggested that he wanted to see more action towards meeting his . pledge to slash annual net migration – the number of immigrants minus . the number emigrating – from more than 200,000 to the ‘tens of . thousands’. Last year the number of immigrants fell by 89,000 to 153,000.","Border officials released advert asking illegal immigrants to text them .

"Hillary Rodham Clinton says she has 'moved on' from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and told everyone else to do the same. The former Secretary of State also revealed she did not read an essay Ms Lewinsky wrote for last month's Vanity Fair magazine that focuses on the scandal that dominated Bill Clinton's second term as president. In an interview for this week's People magazine, Mrs Clinton said: 'I think everybody needs to look to the future,' referring to Ms Lewinsky. Over it: Hillary Rodham Clinton, pictured Monday in Colorado, says she has 'moved on' from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and told everyone else to do the same . She also refused to confirm or deny calling her a 'narcissistic looney toon' after the affair became public. The comments are the first time Mrs Clinton has publicly addressed questions about Ms Lewinksky since the scandal was brought back into the spotlight earlier this year. In January, Senator Rand Paul countered claims that the Republican Party had waged 'a war on women' by stating President Bill Clinton had taken advantage of a young intern in a 'predatory' fashion. In February, The Washington Free Beacon published a collection of White House-era documents from Mrs Clinton's friend Diane D. Blair who died in 2000, which included diary entries based on conversations with Mrs Clinton about Ms Lewinsky. Then came May's Vanity Fair piece. In the article, which features photos of a posed up Ms Lewinsky in a white dress, the former White House intern said she found Mrs Clinton's 'impulse to blame the woman - not only me, but herself - troubling.' Looney: Mrs Clinton also refused to confirm or deny calling Ms Lewinsky, pictured here with Bill Clinton in 1995, a 'narcissistic looney toon' after the affair became public . In the . People interview, Mrs Clinton explains that becoming a grandmother - Chelsea . Clinton's first child is due in the fall - may impact on whether she . runs for president in 2016. 'I . know I have a decision to make,' she told the magazine in what was her . first at-home interview since the end of Mr Clinton's presidency in . January 2001. 'But part of what I've been thinking about, is everything I'm interested in and everything I enjoy doing - and with the extra added joy of ""I'm about to become a grandmother,"" I want to live in the moment.' At the same time, however, she added: 'I am concerned about what I see happening in the country and in the world. Through the next months, I will think more about what role I can or, in my mind, should play.' The comments come after her former boss - President Barack Obama - said he thinks she would be a 'very effective' president if she decides to run. The President praised his former Secretary of State during an interview for Live with Kelly and Michael at the White House that aired last Friday. 'Hillary and I, we're buddies,' he said in the interview. At home interview: Hillary Clinton on the cover of June 16, 2014 issue of People . 'I think because we ran in the longest primary in history and our staffs, I think, were doing battle politically, I think the perception was that this was always kind of a marriage of convenience when she came in as secretary of State. 'I always admired her. As soon as she got here, she couldn't have been more effective, more loyal and since that time, we've become really, really good friends.' Discussing life after government, Mrs Clinton told People that while she fantasized for years about sleeping in, she only made it to 8a.m. 'That's good, huh?' she said with a chuckle. Her new life also consists of binge-watching TV with her husband. Particularly the political drama  House of Cards. Part of the appeal, she explained, was 'a little bit of the, ""Oh, my gosh, I can't believe we can just sit here and do this"" and ""We're only going to watch one episode, oh, let's watch another. Okay, well, we have time, we're not going anywhere, let's watch a third."" I know that sounds kind of devoid of content.' Mrs Clinton told People she was enjoying not stressing about her hair now she's hit 66. 'Hair . strategies are essential to everything in life, we know that. I'm at an . age where I can pretty much do what I want: Here I am, whether you like . my hair or not,' she said. And responding to a question about her husband's thin frame, she said Bill was in good health. 'People say he's too thin. He doesn't think so and he has an enormous amount of energy.' As well as catching up on lost sleep, Mrs Clinton has been heavily involved, as Chelsea now is, in the Clinton Foundation, advocating important projects to stop poaching elephants in Africa and to improve the global status of women and girls. Now, With her state department memoir Hard Choices hitting shelves, she is back on the road, launching a nationwide book tour on June 10.","The former Secretary of State talked for the first time about the scandal since it was brought back into the spotlight this year in a People interview .

Police are thoroughly searching the woods near where Goode's car was found but they have found nothing as of yet . Ms Goode, 21, is thought to have gone missing under 'suspicious circumstances,' last Friday night after she went to work and then out with friends. Police found Goode's 1999 BMW parked a mile away from her house on Fire Avenue near new London Avenue in Medford. Police say the car showed obvious signs of a struggle and a witness said that there appeared to be blood in the vehicle. Suffolk police say they received a call shortly after 6 p.m. from a member of a search party organized by Goode's family reporting a body in the woods off Camden Court in Medford. Detectives found her body within a mile of where Goode's car was found earlier this week, about a mile from her home. Family and friends had been leading the search for Goode and called the situation a 'nightmare.' 'I feel horrible for them and her 4-year-old daughter,' said family member Joseph Miller to PIX11.  'She loved her daughter so much, I know that.' Goode who works as a medical technician and who is the mother of a four-year-old lives in Suffolk with her mother and her daughter. NBC reports that a woman who lived a mile away  on the street where the car was found noticed that the license plate was bent and that the numbers were obscured. Thinking the car might have been stolen, she reported it to police. 'Your baby girl can¿t wait to give you that great big hug when you come home. We just want you to come home safely,' Goode's sister Elizabeth DeMuria (pictured) said tearfully . 'This . is a 21-year-old lady. She has a 4-year-old daughter, a very close . family — and the circumstances, as I’ve explained, are suspicious to . us,' said Suffolk County police Detective Sgt. Michael Fitzharris. 'Your . baby girl can’t wait to give you that great big hug when you come home. We just want you to come home safely,' Goode's sister Elizabeth DeMuria . said tearfully. 'Please, if anybody knows anything, please let somebody know,' she added. Goode recently broke up with her boyfriend but police don't have any suspects nor have they chosen a person of interest. Goode's friends and family say she has no drug or alcohol problems and they describe her as 'gracious, outgoing, and caring.' Anyone with information regarding Goode's disappearance is asked to call Suffolk County Crime Stoppers at (800) 220-TIPS.","Sarah Patricia Goode, 21, went missing under 'suspicious circumstances' after she disappeared on Friday night .

"Change: Physicist Stephen Hawking has dropped plans to attend a major conference in Israel in June . Physicist Stephen Hawking has dropped plans to attend a major conference in Israel, sparking a new row over treatment of Palestinians. The world-famous scientist had earlier agreed to attend the Israeli Presidential Conference, hosted by President Shimon Peres, in late June, but has now changed his mind. He has joined a boycott organised to protest Israel's treatment of the Palestinian after a number of Palestinian academics contacted him. Tim Holt, media director at the University of Cambridge spokesman, initially said Hawking's decision was based strictly on health concerns. However, it has now been revealed that the withdrawal is politically-motivated. A letter sent to event organisers said: 'I accepted the invitation to the Presidential Conference with the intention that this would not only allow me to express my opinion on the prospects for a peace settlement but also because it would allow me to lecture on the West Bank. 'However, I have received a number of emails from Palestinian academics. They are unanimous that I should respect the boycott. In view of this, I must withdraw from the conference. 'Had I attended, I would have stated my opinion that the policy of the present Israeli government is likely to lead to disaster.' Mr Holt's initial statement said: 'For health reasons, his doctors said he should not be flying at the moment so he's decided not to attend.' 'The decision is for health reasons. He is 71 years old. He's fine, but he has to be sensible about what he can do.' A University of Cambridge statement released after the letter, published in The Guardian were revealed, read: 'We have now received confirmation from Professor Hawking's office that a . letter was sent on Friday to the Israeli president's office regarding . his decision not to attend the Presidential Conference, based on advice . from Palestinian academics that he should respect the boycott.' Hawking suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The news provoked an angry reaction from Israelis. Conference chairman Israel Maimon said Hawking's decision was 'unjustifiable and wrong.' Tension: A Palestinian protester holds the Palestine national flag during clashes of the weekly protest against the Jewish settlement of Qadomem, at Kufr Qadom village near Nablus, West Bank last month . Blast: Palestinian militants of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) inspect a training base after it was hit by an Israeli air strike in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip . 'The academic boycott against Israel is in our view outrageous and improper, certainly for someone for whom the spirit of liberty lies at the basis of his human and academic mission,' Maimon said, calling the imposition of a boycott incompatible with open, democratic dialogue. The Israeli ambassador to Britain, Daniel Taub, called it a 'great shame', adding: 'Rather than caving into pressure from political extremists, active participation in such events is a far more constructive way to promote progress and peace.' He noted that former world leaders including Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev and Tony Blair plan to attend the conference. Hawking's decision was hailed by the British Committee for the Universities of Palestine as support for its goal of severing academics' connections with Israel. 'This is his independent decision to respect the boycott, based upon his knowledge of Palestine, and on the unanimous advice of his own academic contacts there,' the committee said on its website. Conference chairman Israel Maimon said Hawking's decision was 'unjustifiable and wrong.'  He noted that former world leaders including Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev and Tony Blair plan to attend the conference . Samia al-Botmeh, of Birzeit University in the West Bank, called Hawking's decision 'fantastic'. 'We tried to communicate two points to him,' he said. 'First, that Israel is a colonial entity that involves violations of the rights of the Palestinians, including academic freedom, and then asking him to stand in solidarity with Palestinian academic colleagues who have called for solidarity from international academics in the form of boycotting Israeli academia and academic institutions.'","World-famous scientist had agreed to attend Israeli Presidential Conference .

"Hate preacher Abu Hamza is expected to die behind bars after he was last night found guilty in the US of a string of terror offences. The hook-handed Islamist cleric – who for years spouted evil on Britain’s streets – was convicted by a New York court of 11 charges after a five-week trial. The firebrand, 56, had denied helping to organise a hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998 when three Britons were killed. Scroll down for video . Guilty verdict: Hate preacher Abu Hamza, 56, who was extradited from the UK in 2012, has been found guilty of terrorism offences in New York on Monday night . He also denied supporting Al Qaeda in . Afghanistan by sending volunteers and money and trying to set up a . terrorist training camp Oregon in 1999. But a jury of eight men and four . women took 11 hours to reach their guilty verdict. The . trial took place just a few streets from the site of the attacks on the . World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, which Hamza gloated was a . ‘towering day in history’. Hamza, also known as Mustafa Kamel . Mustafa headed the Finsbury Park Mosque in the 1990s, reportedly . attended by 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui and shoe bomber Richard . Reid. The . conviction marks the end of a relentless ten-year mission by the US . authorities to extradite Hamza, who only has one eye and stumps instead . of hands. He cost British . taxpayers millions of pounds resisting American justice and went all the . way to the European Court of Human Rights but lost his case and was . extradited to New York in 2012. In court: Hamza, pictured in a court sketch from last month, looked straight ahead as the Manhattan jury found him guilty of providing material support to al-Qaeda-linked organizations in Yemen and Afghanistan sending men to establish an al-Qaeda training camp in Oregon, U.S. One-eyed preacher: Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri addresses followers during prayer near the Finsbury Park mosque in 2004 . Finally: The hook-handed father-of-eight, formerly the imam of Finsbury Park Mosque in London, fought extradition to the U.S. for eight years . The . jury at Manhattan’s Federal Court agreed with the prosecution claims . that Hamza, 56, was a ‘trainer of terrorists’ who recruited and . indoctrinated young men at the Finsbury Park Mosque as part of his . global empire. In his . opening statement Edward Kim, Assistant District Attorney for the . Southern District of New York, also said that Hamza used the cover of . religion to ‘hide in plain sight’ under the noses of the British . authorities for years. Hamza . was convicted of 11 counts of criminal conduct related to the taking of . 16 hostages in Yemen in 1998 that left three Britons and an Australian . dead. He was also found . guilty of advocating violent jihad in Afghanistan in 2001 and conspiring . to establish a jihad training camp in Bly, Oregon, between June 2000 . and December 2001. During . the trial Hamza’s defence team tried to claim that the prosecution case, . which included videos of his fiery sermons at the Finsbury Park Mosque, . was just about ‘words, not deeds’. They portrayed him as an ‘independent thinker’ who was ‘on his own island’. They . admitted the jury might not like some of things that Hamza said but . defence lawyer Joshua Dratel told them: ‘These are views, not acts. This . is expression, not crimes.’ In . his testimony Hamza did little to enamour himself with the jury when he . brazenly said that even today he loves Osama bin Laden and that he . thought 9/11 was a good thing. Hiding in plain sight: Abu Hamza, sketched giving testimony earlier this month, was accused by the judge of hiding his terror message behind his religion . Abu Hamza al-Masri facing U.S. terrorism charges, gives testimony in Manhattan federal court in New York in this artist's sketch . Ironically it was only due to his personal intervention that he spoke at all about such matters. Hamza . wrote a series of letters to District Judge Katherine Forrest saying . his evidence would be 'important for historians' and overruling his . lawyers’ objections to him talking about anything inflammatory not . strictly to do with the case. A . major defeat for Hamza was the decision by Judge Forrest to ban him . from discussing his supposed links with MI5 or Scotland Yard. Mr . Dratel had had told the court that he had 50 pages of notes from . meetings between Hamza and British intelligence agencies between 1997 . and 2000 which had been handed to him by the UK. Mr Dratel said this showed a ‘constant dialogue’ between them Hamza - but the jury never got to hear it. As . a result Hamza was left claiming that he was just the ‘mouthpiece’ for . the Yemeni kidnappers and nothing else, a role he likened to that of . Gerry Adams with the IRA. Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri in the street outside the closed Finsbury Park Mosque in London . He . claimed that he tried to ‘de-escalate’ the situation and told the jury . he had nothing to do with the camp in Oregon and did not send anyone to . fight with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Hamza . - who had already claimed decades of disability benefit - cost British . taxpayers millions of pounds fighting his extradition to the US but in . 2012 the European Court of Human Rights ruled it could go ahead. During . the trial there were moments of levity where Hamza displayed an offbeat . wit that was accentuated by his strong Egyptian accent. At . one point Hamza said that changing your name in Britain was so easy . that ‘if you want to be John Travolta, you become John Travolta’. District Judge Katherine Forrest asked: ‘And did you become John Travolta’ Hamza replied: ‘No madam’. Among . those the jury heard from were Saajid Badat, the former Al Qaeda . operative turned British ‘Supergrass’ who told the court that he saw . Feroz Abbasi, one of Hamza’s followers, at a terrorist training camp in . Afghanistan. There was also . moving testimony from Mary Quin, one of the Yemeni hostages who flew to . Britain and confronted Hamza at the Finsbury Park mosque in 2000 - her . interview proved to be a key piece of evidence. Abu Hamza al-Masri was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1958 as Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, the son of a naval officer and a primary school headmistress. After initially studying civil engineering he entered the UK in 1979 on a student visa. He was granted UK citizenship when he met and married his first wife, a British Muslim convert, in 1980.Hamza has previously said she was the one who got him interested in Islam and he converted after taking time off from his job as a nightclub bouncer in London’s Soho. Abu Hamza continued to preach near the Finsbury Park Mosque after the congregation was thrown out in 2003 . As he found his new religion and his . job incompatible, he instead resumed his civil engineering studies at . Brunel University and Brighton Polytechnic, gaining a degree. He . then divorced his first wife, the mother of his oldest son, Muhammed . Kamel, who at the age of 17 was convicted of being part of a bomb plot . in Yemen and imprisoned for three years in 1999. He met and married his second wife in 1984 in a Muslim ceremony in London and had a further seven childen. Heavily . influenced by the Iranian revolution, he took an interest in Islam and . politics, in particularly the occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet . Union. After meeting the . founder of Afghan Mujahideen in 1987, he moved to Egypt and then to Afghanistan, and it . was in the following years that he lost his hands and one eye. Over the years, Hamza has given several different reasons . for the loss of his hands and eye. These include a road project in Pakistan, an . explosion during a de-mining project in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, fighting the jihad as a Pakistani Mujahideen, and . working with Pakistani military in Lahore when an explosives experiment . went wrong. After spending . time in Afghanistan and Bosnia in the early 90s, he returned to Britain . and adopted a new name - Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri. It was in London that Hamza began his rise to public notoriety as the Finsbury Park mosque imam, where he arrived in 1997. One . year later, in 1998, he helped organise hostage-taking of 16 mostly . British tourists in Yemen. Three Britons and an Australian killed in . rescue mission. In 2000, he set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, . Oregon, sending volunteers and money to Afghanistan to support al Qaeda . and the Taliban. He firmly . placed himself on the national radar in 2001 after speaking out in . support of Osama bin Laden following the September 11 attacks. His . inflammatory speeches led to the Charity Commission suspending him from . his position at Finsbury Park Mosque the following year. In 2003, legal moves begin to get Hamza deported to Yemen, a move which he appealed. In . 2004 Hamza was arrested on a US extradition warrant over charges of . conspiring to take hostages in Yemen, funding terrorism, and organising a . terrorist training camp in Oregon. Charged with 15 offences under the . Terrorism Act, temporarily staying US extradition. In . 2006, Hamza  was jailed for seven years at the Old Bailey after being . found guilty of 11 of 15 charges, but the courts still battle to have . him extradited. He was finally extradited in October 2012, and appeared in a U.S. court, indicted under the name Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, where he pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges. Tonight, . Hamza was convicted of all 11 charges on terrorism offences at Manhattan’s Federal Court. Sentencing on September . 9th.","Abu Hamza found guilty of terrorism offences in a Manhattan court .

"CIA operatives and U.S. special operations troops have been training Syrian rebels with anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons since last year, it has been revealed. Covert training bases were set up in Jordan and Turkey months before President Obama approved plans to arm the opposition fighting to oust Syria's President Assad, U.S. officials and rebel leaders claim. White House officials refused to comment on the Los Angeles Times revelations, but said the U.S. had increased its help to rebels. Military maneuvers: An air and ground exerciise in south Jordan, where rebels are allegedly being trained . 'We have stepped up our assistance, but I cannot inventory for you all the elements of that assistance,' White House press Secretary Jay Carney said. 'We have provided and will continue to provide substantial assistance to the Syrian opposition, as well as the Supreme Military Council.' The Supreme Military Council represents more moderate rebel factions, including the Free Syrian Army. The revelation comes as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrives in Qatar for an international conference on . backing the rebels. A State Department official said the talks would include discussions on delivering military aid. CIA . and White House officials declined to comment on the secret training . programs. Other U.S. officials confirmed the training, but disputed some . of the specific details provided by rebel commanders. Jordan's prime minister, Abdullah Ensour, also denied the CIA and U.S. Special Forces were training rebels in his country. 'There are no trainings for opposition forces in our territory. We only aid refugees who fled to Jordan,' he said, according to AFP. An American official, who did not want to be named, told the Los Angeles Times that Free Syrian Army rebels were being trained. Talks: Secretary of State John Kerry meets Qatar's prime minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani for talks . Although the . number of rebels being helped is not known, in Jordan, the training . involves 20 to 45 insurgents at a time, a rebel commander said. Blame: John Kerry says President Assad is responsible for the deteriorating situation in Syria . He added that during the two-week course, rebels are shown how to fire anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft weapons. The rebels were picked by U.S. special operations teams last year when supply lines were set up to provide uniforms, radios and medical aid. 'Those . from the CIA, we would sit and talk with them during breaks from . training and afterward, they would try to get information on the . situation inside Syria,' the commander said. Brigadier General Yahya Bittar, who defected as . a fighter pilot from Assad’s air force last year and is now head of . intelligence for the Free Syrian Army, said training has taken place in Jordan. Between . 80 and 100 rebels have been trained by the U.S, France and Jordan in . the past month, he said, with rebels then returning to the battlefield. The recent decision to supply arms and ammunition to the rebels this month raised hope that Washington will send heavier weaponry later. Rebel groups have said that they lack the weapons needed to resolve the bloody conflict that has killed more than 100,000 people. President Obama has resisted calls to . get drawn into the civil war, and Washington fears Islamic militants . could gain control of U.S. weapons. The Obama administration may supply . anti-tank weapons but it is unlikely that they will provide portable . anti-aircraft missiles, which rebels say they need. In Qatar, Mr Kerry said assistance would help change the balance on the battlefield. Training: American troops join Jordan and Iraq for an exercise as it is revealed Syrian rebels are being helped . It was his first meeting with his counterparts about aid to the Syrian rebels since it was announced that the U.S. would send lethal aid to the opposition, despite fears that weapons could fall into the hands of Islamic extremists in Syria. That decision was based partly on a U.S. intelligence assessment that Assad had used chemical weapons, but Mr Kerry expressed deeper concerns about Iran and Hezbollah fighters, according to Yahoo. The Secretary of State blamed President Assad for the deteriorating situation in Syria, adding that as the international community tried to hold a conference to create a transitional government, Assad invited Iranian and Hezbollah fighters to bolster his troops.","Free Syrian Army taught to use anti-aircraft missiles, military source claims .

"HIS tennis playing skills have been honed on the court in games against the Prime Minister. But Nick Clegg was defeated today as he took on presenter Andrew Castle in a charity tennis match. The Deputy Prime Minister lost 6-4 in a one set doubles match against Britain’s former number one player. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, pictured losing another point, was defeated in today's charity match . Former British number one Andrew Castle won the one set doubles match against the Deputy Prime Minister . Mr Clegg, who was tennis captain of his college at Cambridge, showed off his skills, pirouetting on the court as he successfully returned shots from Mr Castle. But perhaps still tired after his party conference speech the day before, Mr Clegg had to concede defeat and admitted he had a ‘somewhat erratic serve’. Commons Speaker John Bercow umpired the match at Queen’s Club, which was held to raise money for Global’s Make Some Noise charity day. Mr Bercow is a self-declared tennis nut, and has written a book called Tennis Maestros on his favourite 20 male players of all time. Mr Clegg and Mr Castle were joined by two listeners to LBC, who had bid in an auction to take part. Speaker John Bercow, normally keeps order in the Commons, was in the umpire's chair for the match . Mr Bercow a self-declared tennis nut, and has written a book called Tennis Maestros on his favourite 20 male players of all time. Mr Clegg, who was a keen tennis player in his teens, took up the sport again last summer to help him lose weight . The proceeds went to the Make Some Noise charity, which supports projects that help children and young people affected by illness, disability, bereavement or lack of opportunity. Mr Clegg said he enjoyed the game, but admitted he playing ‘without skill and without elegance’. He said: ‘It was lovely, great great fun. It went as predicted, Andrew taught us a thing or two, I let the side down but nonetheless a great, great game of tennis, really enjoyed it. ‘I’ve played tennis a few times over the summer. I play with my brothers and the family and I’m afraid it’s just classic family tennis, we just whack it at each other.’ Mr Castle praised Mr Clegg’s skills and said he ‘hit the ball hard’ and played ‘a couple of corkers’. He added: ‘It doesn’t take long to see whether someone has talent for a game and Nick has it. ‘The basic element of tennis is over the net and in. Make few mistakes. Nick’s view of the world when it comes to tennis is hit the ball hard and if it goes in good… if it doesn’t…’ Mr Clegg, who was a keen tennis player in his teens, took up the sport again last summer to help him lose weight. He has shed pounds as he gets into shape ready for the general election campaign. Shortly after the Coalition was formed, Mr Clegg and David Cameron played a match at Chequers. Mr Clegg has played against Prime Minister David Cameron twice, and lost both times . For months neither would say who won and Mr Clegg joked it was a ‘state secret’. But Mr Cameron, who is coached by Mr Castle, later revealed how he had triumphed. ‘It was eight-six. He is probably a better player, but I was more wily,’ he said. Mr Cameron is said to relax at the weekend by practising with a tennis machine he has nicknamed the ‘Clegger’.","Lib Dem leader took part in one set doubles match for charity... and lost .

"Facebook has been accused of 'impersonating' its users 'without their consent' to secretly endorse items in the news feeds of their friends. Critics say the social network is recycling users' Likes and using them to promote 'Related Posts' about products and stories with which they may not want to be linked. In some cases users have even seen items 'liked' by friends and relatives who are in fact no longer alive. 'Helps you connect and share': But it seems that Facebook has been sharing content on its users' behalf without their explicit consent - or even their knowledge . The process is completely invisible to the users whose identities are being exploited, it is claimed, with the posts only showing up in the news feeds of friends and families. It happens when a user likes an advertiser's Facebook page. As would be expected, this 'Like' appears on the user's page and is recorded on their activity log. However, an advertiser using Facebook's Sponsored Stories ad product can then take that 'Like' and attach it to related content promoted to the particular user's friends as a 'Related Post'. For example, if a user were to like Starbucks' page on Facebook and the coffee shop chain paid to advertise a new variety of coffee on the social network then that 'like' could reappear on friends' news feeds next to a Related Post promoting the new product. In effect, once a user Likes a particular brand, the social network then recycles that indication of approval . for later 'Related Posts' by that advertiser which the user may never have . even seen. And there is no indication to the user that their 'Like' is being attached to such related content. Minneapolis-based developer Craig Condon said he first became aware that Facebook was recycling his likes when a friend asked him if he liked 'penis-shaped waffles'. That shocking association spurred him to investigate the phenomenon using a fake account, and he has posted a video to YouTube documenting what he found out. 'Facebook is impersonating people without their consent, and most individuals have no idea this is happening,' he wrote in a related article on Bureau Of Minds. 'Facebook is impersonating people without their consent': This screengrab from a YouTube video by Craig Condon shows where his fake account set up to investigate Related Posts is linked to an article . He showed how the feature works by using his fake account to Like pop culture magazine Vice, then logging in with his genuine account to find that identity was linked by a Related Post to a risque story published by his website. However, logging back into the face account showed that the Like was completely invisible to the user, and there was no way of finding out about that the identity and the story were linked, or to withdraw consent. 'This goes beyond just advertising on a user’s behalf,' he wrote. '[M]y friends & family might think I like inappropriate content, or information I don’t agree with - it can damage relationships.' In the cases highlighted by Mr Condon each story was labelled as 'related', but apart from that the posts looked like any other and with no explanation of what 'related' meant in that context. The accusations come even as Facebook agreed to a $20million settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought by users angry about their identities being linked to Sponsored Stories on the site. The lawsuit alleged the adverts are a violation of privacy that unwittingly turns users into spokesmen for products without their approval. And that is not the worst of what Facebook is accused of. Another Facebook user last month documented a range of cases where friends had liked brands that seemed completely out of character. Related Posts are part of Facebook's Sponsored Stories product for advertisers. Sponsored Stories are based around content users have already interacted with on Facebook by, for example, liking a particular brand's page. Advertisers can pay the social network to ensure that user's friends see this interaction with a brand, but they can also publish fresh, related content alongside that Like as a Related Post. In this way, users' identities can be linked with content on the site that they may be entirely unaware of, let alone have endorsed. For example, if a user was to like the Facebook page for Nike, and the sportswear brand was to publish fresh content on Facebook about a new trainer they are marketing, then that user's Like could be republished to their friends alongside the post about the new footwear. Indeed, in some cases highlighted by Bernard Meisler on ReadWrite Social, the person who had liked the item in question was no longer actually even alive. Mr Meisler conducted his own investigation by asking his friends whether they had liked the particular brands they had been linked with, and none said they had. After contacting Facebook to ask them directly what was going on, a spokesman told him its possible these people liked the things they were linked on accidentally, perhaps by inadvertently pressing a button on the mobile app. The spokesman maintained that in the case of dead people liking things, it could be that the social network is recycling likes from when they were still alive. When contacted by MailOnline, Facebook said that Sponsored Stories were 'useful' for giving 'social context' to pages promoted on the site. 'Sponsored Stories are based around content that people have already interacted with on Facebook, for example a friend liking a page,' a spokesman said. 'Advertisers can pay to ensure you see this interaction, although the precise audience is government by an individual's privacy settings. 'For most of us the opinion of our friends is an important factor in how we view the world and many people find it useful to have this sort of social context when discovering new Facebook pages. 'However we also give people the option to opt out of Sponsored Stories. 'When Facebook users die, we ask that their families or close friends notify us so that we can memorialize the account. 'That enables us to remove it from the Sponsored Stories system.'","The social network is 'recycling' likes alongside new, related content that the users may never have seen .

"Neurologists have warned that Michael Schumacher now seems unlikely to make a full recovery after spending nearly two months in a drug-induced coma. The 45-year-old Schumacher fell while skiing in France and hit the right side of his head on a rock, cracking his helmet. Doctors operated to remove blood clots from his brain, but some were left because they were too deeply embedded. Nearly two months after Michael Schumacher suffered serious head injuries in a skiing accident some neurologists say the seven-time Formula One champion seems unlikely to make a full recovery. The racer with his wife Corrina . The seven-time Formula One champion's condition stabilised after he was placed in the coma. Late last month, doctors began the process of withdrawing sedatives to try to wake him up. His agent, Sabine Kehm, said in an email today that 'Michael is still in the wake-up phase' and that 'this phase can be long.' Schumacher's family has released few details of his condition to protect his privacy. 'It does not bode well,' said Dr. Tipu Aziz, professor of neurosurgery at Oxford University who is not connected to Schumacher's care. 'The fact that he hasn't woken up implies that the injury has been extremely severe and that a full recovery is improbable.' His agent, Sabine Kehm, said in an email today that 'Michael is still in the wake-up phase' and that 'this phase can be long' Patients who have had major head injuries are sometimes put in a drug-induced coma to give the brain a chance to heal; a coma reduces the need for blood flow and may help the swelling go down. Aziz said doctors typically try every few days to bring someone out of a coma. 'If you don't start getting any positive signs, that becomes very worrisome,' he said, adding that Schumacher's doctors are probably doing regular brain scans to look for signs of activity - though such signs may be difficult to detect if he is still being sedated. Other experts said it was premature to make an accurate prognosis. 'About 90 percent of the recovery is made within nine to 12 months, so this is still early days,' said Dr. Anthony Strong, an emeritus chair in neurosurgery at King's College London. 'The longer someone is in a coma, the worse their recovery tends to be.' Coma: Doctors have told the family of Michael Schumacher 'only a miracle can save him' Now that several weeks have passed since the accident, doctors may also have a better idea of how the rest of Schumacher's brain is doing. 'MRI scans can show any secondary deterioration in the brain structure,' said Dr. Colin Shieff, a neurosurgeon at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London and a trustee for Headway, a British brain injury charity. He said other parts of Schumacher's brain that weren't directly affected by the accident might now be starting to show worrying signs that may not have been visible before. Shieff said that if Schumacher does eventually come out of the coma, he probably would face significant disabilities because of the length of time he has already spent comatose. While there have been rare instances of people emerging from comas months and years later with the ability to communicate, Shieff was doubtful that would be the case with Schumacher. He said the cases where comatose people made a surprising recovery had mostly suffered things like poisoning, strokes or failed resuscitation attempts.

"We will find intelligent life on other planets within 25 years, the man behind one of the world's most advanced searches for alien life has predicted. Seth Shostak of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute made the claim at a Nasa conference looking at advanced technologies. He believes the key is to keep scanning the skies looking for alien-produced electromagnetic signals. The Allen Telescope Array -- named for Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen, who put up $11.5 million for the project, was one of the first dedicated SETI telescopes. It now says it believes we will make contactwithin 25 years. Shostak told the conference the hunt for alien life was a three way race. The players are: . 'I think we'll find E.T. within two dozen years using these sorts of experiments,' Shostak said at the 2014 NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) symposium at Stanford University. 'Instead of looking at a few thousand star systems, which is the tally so far, we will have looked at maybe a million star systems' 24 years from now, Shostak said. 'A million might be the right number to find something.' 'The bottom line is, like one in five stars has at least one planet where life might spring up,' Shostak told the conference. 'That's a fantastically large percentage. 'That means in our galaxy, there's on the order of tens of billions of Earth-like worlds.' The search for alien signals started in 1960, when pioneering astronomer Frank Drake scanned two sun-like stars with an 85-foot-wide (26 meters) West Virginia antenna. It has ramped up considerably over the past half-century, as astronomers have taken advantage of significant advances in electronics and digital technology. However, Seti has repeatedly warning it needs more cash to continue the search. The 24-year estimate, for example, 'depends on continued SETI funding, which is in dire straits right now,' he told Space.com after his talk at the NIAC symposium. Researchers say that funding to use radio telescopes such as Jodrell Bank (pictured ) is key to their research . Shostak told the conference the hunt for alien life was a three way race between researchers looking for advanced, intelligent civilizations; scientists scouring solar-system bodies such as Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa for simple organisms; and researchers focusing on finding signs of microbial life on nearby exoplanets using future instruments such as NASA's $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2018. 'I think any of these horses has a pretty good chance of succeeding — just my opinion — a pretty good chance of succeeding in the next 20 years, say,' he said during the NIAC talk.","SETI boss pledges 'we will find ET'

"Jude Law asked the News Of The World to ‘back-date’ his girlfriend’s affair with Daniel Craig so it would appear she cheated on him before he betrayed her, it was claimed yesterday. The actor’s publicist asked the newspaper to make it seem like Sienna Miller cheated first – before Law’s fling with his children’s nanny – saying: ‘That’s the thing he [Law] wants the most’. Meanwhile Miss Miller, 32, insisted she had never sought to manipulate Press attention and complained she had been vilified over the affair. Giving evidence to the phone-hacking trial by videolink yesterday, the actress sought to play down her fling with the James Bond star, saying it was a ‘very brief encounter’. Love triangle: Jude Law and Sienna Miller pictured together with Daniel Craig in North London in 2004 . The affair has taken centre stage at the Old Bailey this week amid claims that the News Of The World discovered the romance through hacking a voicemail in which Miss Miller told the 007 actor, ‘I love you’. Journalist Dan Evans told the court he hacked Craig’s answerphone and played the message to the tabloid’s editor Andy Coulson, and claimed Coulson knew it came from illegal hacking. But Coulson’s lawyers said Miss Miller’s driver had sold the story to the tabloid after catching the actress at a secret rendezvous with Craig, and had also told Law about her infidelity. Internal emails from the News Of The World, which summarised what the driver told the paper, said: ‘When she got in the car she spent 45 minutes talking to Daniel and trying to cover their tracks. ‘Source one [the driver] was under no doubt they had been s******g. He felt duty bound to tell Jude and he has done so. It caused huge rows.’ The court heard that Law phoned Craig and confronted him over the affair. According to other internal emails, Craig confessed and Law told him: ‘How could you do this? I thought we were friends.’ The News Of The World paid Miss Miller’s driver £6,000 and a journalist then met Law’s publicist to discuss how the paper would report the affair. The PR asked the journalist to back-date the affair so it would appear Miss Miller cheated first, and said the request came from Law himself. According to a transcript of their taped conversation, she said: ‘If you could definitely pre-date it so that she cheated first, that’s the thing he wants the most.’ The actor was then said to have given his approval to a headline saying he had broken off their relationship over the affair. The publicist unleashed a ‘character assassination’ against Miss Miller, depicting her as a fame-hungry flirt and ‘a bit of a stalker’, the jury heard. She was said to have called Miss Miller ‘embarrassingly tactile’, adding: ‘She does tend to kiss men on the mouth, she wants everyone to love her, she wants all the men in the room to love her and fancy her and all the girls to be her best friend. You should definitely put in background that she’s not a nice girl, she’s not a goody-two-shoes.’ Miss Miller’s driver said the actress had always wanted to be a celebrity, and Law was ‘her stepping-stone to fame’. Neither the driver nor the publicist were identified as they were deemed to be confidential journalistic sources, and the journalist who interviewed them cannot be named for legal reasons. Journalist Dan Evans, left, told the court he hacked Craig’s answerphone and played the message to his editor Andy Coulson, right, but Coulson's lawyers came the story was sold to the paper by Miller's driver for £6,000 . Timothy Langdale QC, for Coulson, said: ‘It’s quite clear that the newspaper was being briefed by Jude Law’s camp. I suggest it’s a further demonstration that what was relied on was information from sources, not the voicemail.’ He said Coulson, who later became David Cameron’s head of communications in Downing Street, had believed the story came from legitimate sources. Law, 41, denied sanctioning the article, but said his publicist had met journalists to ensure his views were represented. The court has heard that the actor was caught having a fling with nanny Daisy Wright before Miss Miller’s affair with Craig in 2005. 'Misconstrued': Pictured in a court sketch giving evidence to the phone-hacking trial by videolink yesterday, Miller sought to play down her fling with the James Bond star, saying it was a 'very brief encounter' In her evidence, Miss Miller said it had been a ‘difficult’ time and she turned to Craig, one of her closest friends, for comfort. She said: ‘I think the thing that’s been slightly misconstrued about this voicemail message is that I said “I love you”... I always ended my phone calls with him with “I love you”, just like I did with all my friends and family. ‘Whether I was or was not in a relationship with Daniel Craig - it was never a relationship, it was a very brief encounter. ‘He was my best friend. Me saying “I love you” – whether anything romantic had happened briefly or not – that was always the way I communicated with him, whether Jude was present or not. It’s been turned into this titillating piece of information.’ Coulson, 46, denies conspiring to hack phones and commit misconduct. All seven defendants in the trial, including former Sun and News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks, deny all the charges against them. The trial continues.

"Saucy clothing retailer Ann Summers has been forced to apologise after it named its latest range of frilly knickers after an Egyptian godess who happens to share a name with Islamic terror group ISIS.

"A woman made a desperate 999 call saying she was ‘running for her life’ moments before she was shot dead by her mother’s ex-boyfriend, a court heard yesterday. Lucy Lee, 40, told the emergency operator ‘I fear he’s going to shoot me’ after John Lowe, 82, allegedly shot her mother Christine. Armed police later surrounded Lowe’s farm but found the mother and daughter both dead amid ‘a scene of carnage’, the court heard. Killed: Lucy Lee, 40, made a desperate 999 call saying she was ‘running for her life’ moments before she was shot by . Lowe, a dog breeder, was said to have shown no remorse for killing them. After his arrest he is alleged to have told police: ‘I shot them both.’ He also said: ‘They’ve been giving me s*** for weeks.’ The pensioner denies two charges of murder and a third charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. Guildford Crown Court heard that he shot his 66-year-old former partner and her daughter at close range before killing four dogs at his farm in Tilford near Farnham, Surrey. Prosecutor Mark Dennis QC told the jury about a ‘desperate [999] call’ made by Lucy at 9.44am on February 23 this year. John Lowe, left denies the murder of wife Christine, pictured with step daughter Stacey Banner . Christine Lee had been living with Lowe and providing him with care and assistance after he fell on hard times . The court was played the harrowing 999 call from Lucy Lee as she 'ran for her life.' Breathing heavily and shouting, Lucy told the emergency operator: 'My mother has been shot. I'm running for my life.' Lucy repeatedly told the operator the address of the property, adding: 'He shot my mum. John Lowe.' She then said: 'I'm gonna go back for him but I'll die. Get Rafferty [a local policeman]. 'I'm nearly outside the house and I fear he's going to shoot me. 'I don't know if I'm going to be alive if I go back in there. He shot my mum. Bye.' The call was then ended. ‘The female caller was in a frightened and frantic state, saying that a man called John Lowe had just shot her mother and that she was herself running for her life,’ he said. ‘Moments later, showing extraordinary courage, the caller indicated that she had made the decision to go back to the scene of the incident, saying as she ran, “I’m gonna go back for him but I’ll die,” followed by, “I’m nearly outside the house and I fear he’s going to shoot me.” ‘Her last words to the operator were, “I don’t know if I’m going to be alive if I go back in there. He shot my mum. Bye.” Those were indeed her last words to anyone save possibly to John Lowe, who moments later was to kill her with two shots from a shotgun.’ The jury heard that when police arrived they found Lucy lifeless on the garden steps and Christine dead in the living room. Lowe, who had a valid shotgun licence at the time, had used the same weapon to kill the pair and the four dogs. A post-mortem examination confirmed Christine was killed by a single gunshot fired into her chest from about 1ft away. Mr Dennis said evidence suggested that he shot Christine as she was in a ‘cowering position’ as he stood over her. Lucy was shot in the back of her head from around 9ft away. Lowe then had to reload before firing a second fatal shot into her chest. ‘The defendant, in effect, ended her life in the same heartless way as he used to dispose of the lives of the four dogs,’ he said. John Lowe told police after his arrest that the two women had been 'giving me s*** for weeks' Lowe, pictured arriving at court, told police the shotgun went off by accident after he argued with Mrs Lee . Armed police found Mrs Lee and her daughter dead at Lowe's farm after they surrounded the property . The court heard officers found a 'scene of carnage' at the rural site, with four dogs also shot dead . Police at the scene in February. Lowe is accused of shooting his partner and her daughter in a fit of rage . The court heard that the former gamekeeper had a love-hate relationship with the pair, who had been looking after him in the months before their deaths. Mr Dennis said that Christine had known Lowe for many years and had occasionally been in a relationship with him. She had moved into his house to care for him after he fell on hard times. Lowe’s long-term partner Susanna Wilson had died in 2013 and he had lost his licence to breed dogs at the farm. But Mr Dennis said that the defendant had complained about the mother and daughter interfering in his affairs. A few weeks before the killings, Lowe told a mechanic who visited the property to repair a vehicle: ‘Those two between them drive me ******* mad, they want to know about the ins and out of everything.’ PC Chris Gleeson, who arrested Lowe, said: ‘He said she [Christine] was an ex-girlfriend and added, “She’s been supposed to be looking after me but she’s been starving me to death and she’s been keeping me short of money. I just sold my Toyota Landcruiser for £5,500 and they’ve spent the lot.”’ The trial continues.

"Allyson Ng was jailed for fraudulently helping learner drivers pass their theory test . A Chinese interpreter was jailed today for helping more than 100 learner drivers cheat on their theory tests. Allyson Ng, 45, charged £110 to get Mandarin speakers through the written part of the UK driving test. A court heard Ng was cheating by telling candidates when to use 'dui' the Mandarin word for 'yes' on multiple choice questions. But bosses at the Driving Standards Agency became suspicious of the number of Chinese learners queuing up to hire Ng for their theory tests. She was arrested at Cardiff theory test centre on 18 October 2012. An investigation team analysed a random sample of 27 recordings of Ng’s translations and found they were all fraudulent. And the agency believes some candidates never bothered to learn the Highway Code because they knew Ng would get them through. Ng, of Cardiff, admitted making 27 fraudulent translations and asked for another 40 offences to be taken into account. She was jailed for 12 months at Cardiff Crown Court. DSA chiefs said it was in the process of tracing 94 people who used Ng to pass their theory test at a centre in the Welsh capital. They will have their test pass certificates revoked and will have to sit their entire driving test again. The DSA’s head of fraud and integrity, Andy Rice, said: 'The driving test is there to ensure that all drivers have the skills and knowledge to use the roads safely and responsibly. 'Anyone who tries to circumvent this process is putting innocent road-users at risk. 'This sentence sends a clear message that driving test fraud is a serious offence and will be dealt with accordingly.' The theory test which costs £31 is a series of multiple choice questions on a computer screen at an official driving test centre. The interpreter charged £110 to help Mandarin speakers pass the £31 theory test . Under current legislation learners whose first language isn’t English can use an interpreter on both the theory and practical driving tests. Theory tests candidates can choose from an approved list of interpreters compiled by the DSA. The candidate pays for the interpreter - who can charge as much as they like for their services. To become an approved by the DSA interpreter’s must have a qualification . from a recognised body and attach two references to their application. After their qualifications and references have been checked and approved they are free to charge candidates for their services. Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said drivers must have the correct skills before taking to the road . DSA spokesman Stephen Small said interpreter fraud was a 'serious problem'. He said: 'There are a relatively small number of tests conducted with interpreters. 'When you look at the overall figures it is a serious problem but not widespread. 'This is the third conviction in as many years of interpreter fraud.' Earlier this year the Government launched a consultation on proposals to withdraw foreign language support for driving test candidates. This was in response to concerns about potential road safety implications and the risk of fraud. Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: 'We want to ensure that all drivers have the right skills to use our roads safely and responsibly. 'We also want to keep test fees to a minimum for candidates, and I am not convinced that providing translations is the most effective use of resources. 'There is a potential road safety risk of drivers not understanding important traffic updates or emergency information. 'Allowing interpreters on tests also presents the risk of fraud, for example if they are indicating the correct answers to theory test questions.' The Government’s response to the consultation is expected in the autumn.","Allyson Ng, 45, charged £110 to get Mandarin speakers through theory test .

"Fierce fighting continues to rage in eastern Ukraine today as government forces claimed they killed 300 pro-Russian separatists. Kiev's 'anti-terrorist operation' said the rebel fighters were killed and about 500 wounded in the past 24 hours in and around the city of Slaviansk, a strategically located separatist stronghold. Government forces used aircraft, helicopters and artillery in a fierce attack to try to root out the separatists who have controlled Slaviansk and surrounding areas since early April. Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama issued a new warning to Russia saying the West will 'refuse to allow the dark tactics of the 20th century to define the 21st.' Scroll down for video .

Fighting was continuing in Slaviansk region and mopping-up operations were underway in the nearby town of Krasny Liman, which he said government forces had taken control of on Tuesday. President-elect Petro Poroshenko ordered the resumption of operations by government forces to quell the rebellion by pro-Russian militia in the Russian-speaking east soon after scoring a resounding victory in an election on May 25.

Kiev also accuses Russia of letting volunteer fighters cross into Ukraine to fight alongside the rebels. Moscow denies this and is urging Ukraine to end military operations and open dialogue with the separatists. Since government forces resumed their push against the rebels, there have been clashes in and around the main industrial hub of Donetsk and near the border town of Luhansk, with loss of life on both sides. But it is not clear what real progress the Ukrainian military - whose initial efforts in April to root out the rebels flopped with defections and loss of military equipment - are making against the rebels who occupy strategic points in densely populated cities.

His expected to meet then with three G-7 leaders: French President Francois Hollande, British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. British officials said Russia's actions since Ukraine's May 25 presidential elections - muted condemnation and a pullback of troops from Ukraine's border - are better than some had feared, and they hope Putin will use those meetings to demonstrate a more positive, engaged attitude. In March, the U.S. and its most important allies retaliated for Putin's military occupation and subsequent annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula by suspending Russia's membership in what had been the G-8 club of rich countries. They also nixed Putin's plan to hold the meeting in Sochi, the city Russia lavished billions on to host the 2014 Winter Olympics, and shifted the venue to a building in the Belgian capital instead.

Meanwhile, President Barack Obama held up 25 years of Polish democracy as a beacon for neighboring Ukraine in a public celebration, warning Russia that the free world is united against its 'dark tactics' to violate Ukraine's sovereignty. 'We stand together because we believe that people and nations have the right to determine their own destiny - that includes the people of Ukraine,' Obama said before a crowd of more than 6,000 that spilled into the streets before Royal Castle, a symbol of Polish independence. 'Our free nations will stand united so that further Russian provocations will only mean more isolation and costs for Russia,' Obama said. 'Because after investing so much blood and treasure to bring Europe together, we refuse to allow the dark tactics of the 20th century to define the 21st.' Obama spoke just after announcing new U.S. assistance for Ukraine's armed forces, including body armor and night vision goggles - the first such delivery of tools that would directly help Ukrainian troops in their battle against pro-Russian separatists. Speaking from behind protective glass, Obama declared that 'the days of empires and spheres of influence are over.' 'Bigger nations must not be allowed to bully the small, or impose their will at the barrel of a gun or with masked men taking over buildings,' Obama said. 'And the stroke of a pen can never legitimize the theft of a neighbor's land. So we will never accept Russia's occupation of Crimea or its violations of Ukraine's sovereignty.' He also assured east European NATO allies which were once part of the Soviet Union or its Warsaw Pact military bloc that the United States would defend their territorial integrity.

"The bust of an Ancient Egyptian bronze cat found during a house clearance in Cornwall may have belonged to archaeologist Howard Carter . For years, this unusual ornament – a cat complete with delicate gold earrings – stood on the hearth of a small Cornish cottage, believed to be a cheap copy of an Egyptian bronze. When the elderly owner died, her family assumed it was worthless and were ready to throw it away. Then an expert intervened – and his suspicion that the 7in bust might be of some value has been proved true beyond his wildest dreams. Because the cat is a genuine relic dating back to around 600BC, and is expected to sell for tens of thousands of pounds when it goes under the hammer today. However, it came very close to ending up in a skip. The statue had belonged to Doreen Liddell of Penzance, Cornwall. When she died in November, her family called in Penzance Auction Rooms to clear her house – and auctioneer David Lay saw the cat. He too initially assumed that it was a reproduction, but took it back to his office for a closer look. Only then did he realise how old it could be. When he shared his discovery with Mrs Liddell’s family, they told him her late husband, Douglas, had once been managing director of the prestigious Spink and Son auction house in London. The firm, founded in 1666, is renowned for its sales of Ancient Egyptian artefacts. In 1939, Spink sold the estate of archaeologist Howard Carter, who discovered Tutankhamun’s tomb. It is thought Mr Liddell bought the 2,500-year-old cat at a Spink sale, although his family has no record of it. Scroll down for video . He had joined the auction house in 1946, and was its managing director from 1976 until he and Mrs Liddell retired to Cornwall. He died in 2003. The cat was found in front of an imitation fire, complete with gold earrings, and is believed to have belonged to world famous archaeologist Howard Carter (right) who found Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922 . Mr Lay said of the cat: ‘Once we discovered it had originally been owned by a one-time managing director of Spink and Son, one of London’s oldest and greatest art dealing institutions, its presence made much more sense. The cat is thought to date from the 26th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, in 664 to 525BC. Founded by King Psamtik I, this age of prosperity saw a huge rise in animal worship . Cats were associated with the gentle, protective goddess Bastet. Egyptians believed she listened to prayers made to cats, and many were buried at her temples . At one time, killing a cat, even by accident, was a capital crime . Wealthy families dressed their pet cats in jewels. After death, they were embalmed and given offerings of milk, mice and rats . Many owners shaved off their eyebrows when a cat died, and mourned until they grew back . Statues of cats – often wearing jewels – were placed in tombs to go with the owner to the afterlife . In 2013, a 13in bronze of a cat from 300BC was sold for £1.3million . ‘In excellent condition, authenticated by the British Museum, who were genuinely delighted to see such a “perfectly proportioned” piece, we expect a lot of interest in this wonderful find.’ Penzance Auction Rooms has given the sculpture a ‘very conservative’ estimate of £5,000 to £10,000, but says it could make as much as £50,000. Spokesman Mimi Connell-Lay said: ‘The life-size head, mounted on a polished slate base, was sitting on the hearth in a small local cottage in front of an imitation-coal gas fire. ‘When David first saw it, it was so hot that he couldn’t pick it up, and he assumed it was a reproduction. On closer inspection, he realised he had something quite special on his hands.’ Miss Connell-Lay said the head of the Ancient Egypt department at the British Museum confirmed the cat dated from the 26th Dynasty. She added: ‘David asked the family for some background, and amazingly they had no idea it was valuable and were about to throw it in the skip.’ She said the cat was a ‘particularly fine example’ and would have been commissioned by someone of ‘considerable means and status’. Howard Carter was an English archaeologist and Egyptologist. 1907- he was appointed by Lord Carnarvon to supervise his Egyptian excavations in the Valley of Kings. 1917 - His excavations were interrupted by World War One but Carter resumed these in 1917. November 1922 - His team found steps which were believed to have led to the tomb and with Lord Carnarvon made a small hole to peer inside. Carter told Lord Carnarvon he could see 'wonderful things.' The next few months were spent cataloguing contents of the antechamber. Howard Carter (pictured left with Lord Carnarvon at the opening of the burial chamber) supervised the removal of artefacts from Tutakankhamun's chamber (right with stick and right with bow tie) February 1923 - Carter opened the tomb and saw the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun. 1923 - 1932 - Clearance of the tomb and recording of its contents took 11 years. 1932 - Carter retired from archaeology and became a part-time agent for collectors and museums. March 1939 - After several years spent doing talks about his discovery Carter died at his Kensington home of lymphoma. Since the discovery of the tomb there have been many rumours about curses arising from its discovery. Lord Carnavon died six weeks after entering the tomb and Carter received several letters warning him of the 'curse of the pharaohs.'","David Lay did routine house clearance of a property in Cornwall .

"Stress, panic and anxiety related to modern-life costs Britain almost £10billion a year, it has emerged. A study by leading psychiatrists found that more than 8million men, women and children suffer from anxiety disorders a year – at a cost to the country of £9.8billion. The figure includes cost of treatment and lost productivity and covers problems from stress to obsessive compulsive disorder. Dementia is the most costly illness to the country at almost £20billion a year with anxiety in fifth place, the Journal of Psychopharmacology reports . It also includes people with phobias such as agoraphobia, a fear of open spaces that can leave people afraid to leave their home. Cambridge University researcher Barbara Sahakian said that anxiety problems and depression can be exacerbated by the stresses and strains of modern life. Worries about debt and job security can make matter worse. She said: ‘Mental health disorders tend to increase in urban environments, partly due to the stress of urbanisation and the competiveness. ‘Debt is something that causes an increase in mental health disorders.’ Around half of the £9.805billion is spending on drugs and counselling and other psychological treatments. The rest goes on lost productivity, including sick days, early retirement and ‘presenteeism’ – or being at work but being hugely unproductive. Professor Sahakian said that anxiety disorders are particularly costly because they are often chronic and so dog a person throughout their life. They also often occur alongside other conditions such as depression. The figures, which are for 2010, come from a study of the burden of brain disorders to the UK. Overall, the 18 different conditions, from dementia and multiple sclerosis to headaches and alcoholism, cost the country an estimated £112billion a year. This is more than the GDP of New Zealand. Dementia was the most costly at almost £20billion a year – or almost a fifth of the total. Most of this money goes on nursing home care, rather than drugs and hospital treatment. Schizophrenia and other ‘psychotic disorders’ are the next most expensive, with an annual cost of £14billion a year. Professor Barbara Sahakian, of Cambridge University, said anxiety disorders are costly because they are often chronic and dog a person throughout their life. They also often occur alongside other conditions such as depression . Depression, bipolar disorder and similar conditions take third place, with £17billion and alcoholism and depression come fourth, with an annual spend of £9.832billion. This is only slightly more than anxiety which is in fifth place, the Journal of Psychopharmacology reports. The researchers said that the cost of brain disorders to society will only increase as society ages and we must act now, if we are not to be ‘overwhelmed’. They said that stigma surrounding mental health has led to much less money being devoted to research than for other conditions such as cancer. More cash would speed the search for new drugs and techniques to pick up disease early. Together, they could be used to nip problems in the bud. Professor Sahakian said that with extra money, great strides could be made in Alzheimer’s. ‘The outlook is really exciting but we don’t have the research funding to push ahead in a major way. ‘We could do so much if we had the same sort of money as goes into cancer research.’ The Department of Health said it is investing in a raft of new studies into brain disease. A spokesman added: ‘We want the UK to lead the world in researching debilitating brain diseases like dementia. That’s why we’re investing millions of pounds to increase research into these conditions through a number of projects.’","Eighteen different conditions cost the country £112billion a year .

"A nature-lover has revealed how he spent two days tracking down a giant insect on a remote New Zealand island – and got it to eat a carrot out of his hand. Mark Moffett’s find is the world's biggest insect in terms of weight, which at 71g is heavier than a sparrow and three times that of a mouse. The renowned 53-year-old scientist discovered the giant weta up a tree and his real life Bug's Bunny has now been declared the largest ever found. Big appetite: A renowned scientist from America found the heaviest ever recorded giant weta on New Zealand's Little Barrier Island and fed her this carrot out of his hand . Various species: There are over 70 types of Weta species in New Zealand but the giant weta has been named the biggest insect in the world because of its weight . There are over 70 types of Weta species in New Zealand but the giant weta has been named the biggest insect in the world because of its weight. A female giant weta filled with eggs can reach up to 70g or more and the largest of the species are found on Little Barrier Island. They are usually less social and more passive than other weta. Their diet consists of plants, other small insects and fruit. Their size is an example of island gigantism, which is a biological phenomenon leading to a larger size than their mainland relatives because of their isolation and lack of large predators. He came across the cricket-like creature, which has a wing span of seven inches, after two days of searching on a tiny island. The . creepy crawly is only found on Little Barrier Island, in New Zealand, . although there are 70 other types of smaller weta found throughout the . country. The giants of the species were wiped off the mainland by rats accidentally introduced by Europeans. After Mark found the female weta he fed it the carrot before putting it back where he found her. Mark, 53, said: ‘Three of us walked the trails of this small island for two nights scanning the vegetation for a giant weta. ‘We spent many hours with no luck finding any at all, before we saw her up in a tree. ‘The giant weta is the largest insect in the world, and this is the biggest one ever found, she weighs the equivalent to three mice. ‘She enjoyed the carrot so much she seemed to ignore the fact she was resting on our hands and carried on munching away. ‘She would have finished the carrot very quickly, but this is an extremely endangered species and we didn't want to risk indigestion. ‘After she had chewed a little I took this picture and we put her right back where we found her.’ Mark, from Colorado, America, added: ‘We bug lovers hear a lot of people who think insects are inferior in some way because of their size, so it was great to see such a big insect. ‘This became all the more amazing when we realised that this was the largest insect recorded.’",New Zealand's giant weta is the heaviest insect in the world and this one is the largest ever recorded .
"Hospital admissions for stress have risen by seven per cent in just one year, it was revealed today. Stress admission rates at hospitals in England rose by 410 to 6,370 in the 12 months to May, compared to 5,960 in the year beforehand. The most likely patients were people of working age, from 18 to 60, figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) show. On the increase: Stress admission rates at hospitals in England rose by 410 to 6,370 in the 12 months to May, compared to 5,960 the year before . The report, which considers admissions only and not cases dealt with solely in A&E, shows that stress admissions rose at a faster rate than overall admissions overall, which increased by about 2 per cent in the same period. Men accounted for 54 per cent of stress admissions, but women made up 63 per cent of all anxiety admissions and admission rates were higher for females than males across all age groups. The figures also showed that admissions rose with increasing age until 50, when they declined steadily. HSCIC chief executive Tim Straughan said: 'It might be assumed that stress and anxiety are conditions that result in a journey to a GP consulting room rather than a hospital ward. 'However, our figures suggest thousands of cases a year arise where patients suffering from stress or anxiety become hospitalised in England.' The North-West had the highest admission rate for stress of any region, while the South-West had the lowest. The report covered two different conditions - stress (the feeling of being under too much emotional or mental pressure) and also anxiety (the feeling of mild or severe unease, such as worry or fear). In contrast to stress, admissions for anxiety fell by 3 per cent in the same time period, from 8,810 to 8,590 and admissions for this condition were highest among the elderly. Mr Straughan said: 'The report highlights a marked contrast between stress and anxiety admissions to hospital over the last two 12 month periods. 'On one hand, stress admissions have risen by 7 per cent to 6,370; while on the other anxiety admissions have fallen by 3 per cent to 8,590. 'Despite this shift in balance however, many more cases of anxiety were admitted than for stress. 'There is also a clear difference in the likely age of a patient admitted for one of these conditions. While working-aged people account for the highest rate of admissions for stress, it appears hospital admissions resulting from anxiety are more amongst the elderly.'","Stress admission rates at hospitals in England rose by 410 to 6,370 in the 12 months to May ."
"New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft is backtracking on his story that Russian President Vladimir Putin stole his Super Bowl Ring. A spokesman for the billionaire businessman on Sunday said Kraft's claim that Putin pocketed his $25,000 Super Bowl XXXIX ring was a 'humorous, anecdotal story that Robert retells for laughs.' A careful reading of the statement, though, reveals that Kraft isn't saying the story is untrue - only that it isn't meant to be taken seriously. Kraft said Thursday that after Putin . made off with his ring, he was pressured by the Bush White House into . calling it a gift was a gift and letting Putin keep it. Scroll down for video . New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has claimed that Vladimir Putin took his Super Bowl ring and that the White House told him to say it was a gift . On Sunday, Kraft's spokesman said: . '(Kraft) loves that his ring is at the Kremlin, and, as he stated back . in 2005, he continues to have great respect for Russia and the . leadership of President Putin.' It's a good thing, too. Because Putin isn't giving it back. Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN  the ring resides at the Kremlin museum - where all 'state gifts' are kept. He denied that Putin stole the ring - . insisting that Kraft freely gave it to the Russian leader in 2005 at a . meeting in Saint Petersburg. 'What Mr. Kraft is saying now is . weird. I was standing 20 centimeters away from him and Mr. Putin and saw . and heard how Mr. Kraft gave this ring as a gift,' he told the network.

The statement adds that the ring being at the Kremlin has 'an added benefit from the attention this story gathered eight years ago was the creation of some Patriots fan clubs in Russia.' ‘I took out the ring and showed it to . [Putin], and he put it on and he goes, “I can kill someone with this . ring,”’  Kraft told the crowd. Kraft continued: ‘I put my hand out and he put it in his pocket, and three KGB guys got around him and walked out.’ The incident occurred in 2005, the summer after the Patriots had won their third Super Bowl under his Kraft's ownership. He was one of a number of prominent American businessmen who visited Russia to meet with Putin. At the time, Kraft released a public statement saying the . diamond-encrusted ring - worth more than  $25,000 - had been a gift.

"A US Marine held in a Mexican jail for over two months after mistakenly entering the country with guns has made an impassioned plea today for President Obama to secure his release. Sgt Andrew Tahmooressi said as the head of the military Mr Obama should get personally involved in his plight. 'Mr. President, you are my Commander in Chief. Please get me out of jail.' Speaking exclusively to Mail Online from his Mexican prison, the 25-year-old said: 'I am still in the Marines and President Obama is my Commander in Chief. Day in court: Sgt Andrew Tahmooressi will appear in court in Tijuana today after 100 days in a Mexican prison . The waiting game: Jill Tahmooressi, a nurse has traveled from the family home in Florida to support her son . 'I want him to get involved. He was involved in helping to free a prisoner of war, and that is how I feel I am being treated. 'I am able to cope right now, but I want out. This has gone on too long. I am innocent and have done nothing wrong.' His views were echoed by his mother Jill who has led the campaign to get her son released. She compared his ordeal to that of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a suspected deserter who was released from Taliban custody in exchange for five prisoners of war being held by the U.S. 'I know Andrew hasn't been held five years, but he is still being held against his will,' she said. 'He has not done anything wrong expect make a driving mistake. He took a wrong turn, that's all. 'President Obama has an obligation as Commander in Chief to take an interest. It is time for him to get involved now. This has gone on too long and Andrew is suffering. Border wars: This is Andrew on his first tour of duty in Afghanistan. He is a veteran of two and is suffering from PTSD following his service . Perils of war: Now a reservist, Tahmooressi had traveled to San Diego for treatment for his PTSD . 'He has to talk with the Mexican president to get this sorted. Andrew like Sgt Bergdahl served his country. He is a reservist now and is still serving his country. 'How can he just be left there and nothing happen. I am thrilled for the parents of Sgt Bergdahl, but now I want my son home as well.' Over 100,000 people have signed a White House petition that has been sent to the White House calling for action. Two US Senators have taken up the case, and Secretary of State John Kerry has spoken to Mexican authorities. But despite this Sgt Tahmooressi still languishes in prison and could be jailed for up to six years if convicted. For Mrs Tahmooressi as she anxiously awaits for news at her home in Weston, Florida, it is not enough. 'Why as Commander in Chief would he allow one of his soldiers to remain in prison for something he has not done,' she said. Tahmooressi's ordeal began on March 31 when he says he mistakenly drove into Mexico with three guns in the back of his pickup truck. He had recently relocated from Daytona Beach, Florida, where he was studying to be an commercial airline pilot. Suffering from PTSD from his two tours of duty in Afghanistan, he had been persuaded by a Marine friend to seek help from the Veterans Administration in San Diego. On the morning of March 31 he had a meeting with doctors who agreed a course of treatment for PTSD. Shame: Mom Jill, holding his medals of honor from his two tours of Afghanistan. She has questioned why he has been left inside a Mexican jail for 100 days . Behind bars: Sgt Tahmooressi has been languishing for more than three months at the 'El Hongo' jail in Tecate . Bad reputation: The jail near Tijuana houses the region's most dangerous criminals and is said to be controlled by notorious drug lords . As he had . yet to rent a place to live he had all his possessions in the back of . his pick up truck, including a AR-15 rifle, shotgun and handgun. All the weapons were legal and licensed to Tahmooressi. After his hospital appointment he drove to the border town intending to stay overnight. He parked his car on the US side and walked across the footbridge that links the two countries. But after checking out of the hotel because it felt unsafe he returned to his car around 10.30pm. Instead of heading North on Interstate 5 he took a wrong turning out of the car park and ended up a Mexican checkpoint. Tahmooressi told the border guards about the three weapons in the back of his pickup truck and explained he had taken a wrong turn after getting lost. It is illegal to cross the border to Mexico with any weapons. Instead of being escorted back across the border he was arrested. The Marine Sgt managed to make a 911 call to seek help from US authorities but was told as he was in Mexico nothing could be done for him. He also called his mom to explain that he had been arrested and asked her to get him a lawyer. A 911 tape released by U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, backs up what Tahmooressi has said. In the call he is heard saying, 'I crossed the border by accident, and I have three guns in my truck, and they're trying to take my guns from me'. But on hearing the caller is in Mexico, replies: 'There's nothing I can help you with then, sir. I do apologize. You're not on American soil anymore.' After he was jailed, Tahmooressi tried to escape by climbing over a gate and heading up onto a roof, and then onto another one. He gave up when a guard opened fire, but the incident earned him the nickname 'Spider-Man'. He later grabbed a light bulb and stabbed himself in the neck. He was taken to the hospital and given stitches. Mrs Tahmooressi, a nurse, said her son has not changed his story once since being arrested and has suffered brutally at the hands of the Mexican authorities. One for all: Sgt. Tahmooressi was a loyal soldier who was tight with his unit. Bergdahl is suspected of desertion. He is at the top, far left . Loving son: Photos of Andrew adorn the walls of Mrs Tahmooressi's home. Andrew has an older sister Andrea, a chiropractor who lives in North Carolina . Proud Marine: Mrs Tahmooressi said Andrew had always wanted to serve his country, and his bedroom at the family home in Weston is testament to his love of the Marines and his country . 'While he was at the La Mesa jail where he was first held he was tortured, brutalized and victimized,"" said Mrs Tahmooressi. 'He was stripped naked and chained to a bedpost. When they undid the chains he was so weak he could not walk. At one point he was shackled to a bed with a four point restraint. That is not right. No soldier, no person should have to endure that sort of treatment.' 'How is that anyway for a US Marine who has not been convicted of a crime to be treated. He was being treated like a prisoner of war.' Mrs Tahmooressi, who has masterminded the campaign for her son's release from her kitchen table, said he was threatened by drugs cartel henchmen who were in jail. 'Andrew was diagnosed with PTSD and that was the reason he had moved from Florida to San Diego. He had trouble concentrating on the course, but had wanted to be an airline pilot. He got his pilot's licence when he was just 17 years old, and loved to fly.' Mrs Tahmooressi said the VA had treated her son promptly as he had been showing signs of paranoia with fears the US Government were spying on him. She said he was getting treatment and worries that being locked up in jail his condition will deteriorate. Andrew has been able to call her from the prison where he is currently held and has recently found a new lawyer after he fired his last counsel when he suggested his lie in court. A court hearing earlier this week was adjourned when his lawyer was fired. Prosecutors have said Tahmooressi made multiple trips to Tijuana and suspect he was involved smuggling guns - a suggestion refuted by his mum. 'He had a friend whose mother lived in Tijuana. He went with her and was a passenger in her car. They will have all that on CCTV cameras. He was doing nothing wrong.' Mrs Tahmooressi is able to send her son clothes and books to read, but has not been able to get him any of his favourite food. 'He tell me the food is terrible in the jail,' she said. Mrs Tahmooressi said he son 'was proud' to serve in the Marines. He was promoted to sergeant during his last tour and was honorably discharged in 2012, but remains on the reserve list. Happier days: Sgt Tahmooressi with him mom and sister Andrea enjoyed attending sporting events together before his ordeal . She said he had always wanted to serve his country, and his bedroom at the family home in Weston is testament to his love of the Marines and his country. A Stars and Stripes hangs on one wall while the US Marine Corp flat is at the end of his bed. A framed photo of Andrew getting his pilots license at aged 17 takes pride of place on a wall. Across the home are photos of Andrew and his elder sister Andrea, a chiropractor who lives in North Carolina. Apart from fears about his health, Mrs Tahmooressi said her son had mounting legal bills.'He has already spent $20,000 and he has yet to appear in court,' she said.

That is what any mother who has a son in the military wants.'","Sgt Andrew Tahmooressi has been held in a Mexican prison for two months for making a wrong turn and entering Mexico with registered guns .

"Immigrants from outside Europe have taken £100billion more in benefits and services than they paid back in taxes, a major study revealed yesterday. Over a 16-year period, the bill to the taxpayer of providing them with welfare, health and education was 14 per cent higher than the money they put in the national purse. However, migrants from Europe – including those from Eastern Europe who came in large numbers after 2004 – have paid more in taxes than they received, researchers said. Unemployed line up at a Jobcentre Plus: . Immigrants from outside Europe have taken £100billion more in benefits . and services than they paid back in taxes, a major study revealed . yesterday. (Stock image) The report from academics at University College London claims to be the most far-reaching study yet conducted of the impact of migration on taxpayers. Its findings were based on official figures, including those for public spending and tax receipts, and on the Government’s Labour Force Survey that looks at the lives of around 150,000 families each year. Professor Christian Dustmann and Dr Tommaso Frattini said that between 1995 and 2011, migrants from European countries paid 4 per cent more into the tax system than they took out, while British-born people had on average paid in 7 per cent less than they received from the state. However, migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) – which is the 27 EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway – had made a ‘negative fiscal contribution’ overall,’ their report said. Fresh influx: A banner promoting a firm . in Bucharest, the Romanian capital, recruiting for workers for jobs in . Britain when borders open to Romanians next year . ‘This is partly explained by their . demographic structure – non-EEA immigrants have had more children than . natives, and we have allocated educational expenditure for children to . immigrants.’ The analysis comes at a point of deepening controversy over the cost of health and benefit tourism and widespread anxiety over the potential impact of a new wave of migration from Romania and Bulgaria in the new year. Citizens of the two countries, which joined the EU in 2007, win the right to work freely in Britain from January. The Daily Mail reported at the weekend that British firms are actively recruiting workers in Bucharest and that job agencies in Romania are already being asked how to claim state benefits in this country. UCL’s report said the population of migrants from outside Europe grew by more than 2.2million between 1995 and 2011, reaching just under 6.15million in 2011. It said that over the same period, the non-EEA immigrants received public services and benefits worth £104 billion more, at 2011 prices, than they paid in taxes. Their contributions, the report said, paid just over 86 per cent of the value of the services and benefits they received. Over the same period, the EEA migrant population went up from under two million to 2.85million in 2011. But they contributed £8.8billion more to the Treasury than they received in services and benefits, meaning they paid 4 per cent more than they took. According to the data, migrants are 20 per cent more likely to be claiming work tax credit than Britons. One in seven people claiming the benefit is a non-UK national. The report does not break down differences between migrants from wealthy western European countries like France and Germany and those from poorer Eastern European nations. Migrants from Poland and seven other Eastern European states gained the right to work freely in Britain in 2004. Open door: University College Londonss report said the population of migrants from outside Europe grew by more than 2.2million between 1995 and 2011, reaching just under 6.15million in 2011 . Professor Dustmann and his colleagues said: ‘Immigrants arriving since the early 2000s have made substantial net contributions to public finances, a reality that contrasts starkly with the view often maintained in public debate.’ However their report said recent immigrants are likely to be of working age and so make fewer demands on schools or the NHS. But Sir Andrew Green of the MigrationWatch UK think tank said: ‘It is very interesting that this report finds that non-EU migrants since 1995 have made a negative contribution to the national budget, yet they have accounted for two thirds of foreign immigration over the past 15 years. ‘As regards EU migrants, much of the benefit stems from their relative youth but, like the rest of us, they will get older. No allowance has been made in these calculations for future pensions or for higher health costs in old age.’ Dr Carlos Vargas Silva of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University said the research suggests the net contribution of recent migrants is positive – but some groups can ‘represent a burden’.","Major study tracks cost and contributions of migrants over 16-year period .

"The use of antidepressant medication in the UK has increased five-fold since 1991, new data reveals. It also showed that the use of such drugs had increased by 20 per cent each year across Europe over a similar period. This increase in uptake across Europe was found to have coincided with a gradual decline in suicide rates. Experts said that data collected over past 30 years provides 'strong evidence' that antidepressants are playing a key role in treatment strategies for depression . Between 1995 and 2009, the use of antidepressants across Europe increased by almost 20 per cent per year on average, with a corresponding 0.8 per cent annual reduction in the suicide rate. Researchers, including David McDaid from the London School of Economics and Political Science, said that data collected from 29 European countries over three decades provided ‘strong evidence’ that antidepressants are playing a key role in treatment strategies for depression. However, he said that other factors should not be discounted - such as a country’s economic state, cultural mores and access to psychological services. Interestingly, the report found no consistent relationship between suicide rates and alcohol consumption, divorce, or employment rates. Sweden, Norway and Slovakia have seen the largest growth in antidepressant usage with an 1000 per cent increase in Sweden’s case between 1980 and 2009 – while the lowest growths have been recorded in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Bulgaria, France and Luxembourg. The United Kingdom has recorded a five-fold increase (495 per cent) in the use of antidepressants since 1991 and a 14 per cent fall in suicide rates over the same period. Icelanders are the heaviest users of anti-depressants with previous studies suggesting that almost nine per cent of the population take daily doses of medication, compared to just four per cent in Romania. While suicide rates have fallen across Europe, suicide still remains a major public health problem in the EU countries, accounting for 60,000 deaths each year. Lithuania has the highest current suicide rate followed by Hungary, while Greece, Italy and Spain are at the other end of the spectrum, with suicide rates the lowest in the EU. Mr McDaid, an LSE mental health policy researcher, said the data showed that suicide rates had decreased more in countries where there had been a spike in the use of anti-depressants on a regular basis. 'These findings underline the importance of the appropriate use of anti-depressants as part of routine care for people diagnosed with depression, therefore reducing the risk of suicide,' he said. Lithuania has the highest current suicide rate followed by Hungary, while Greece, Italy and Spain are at the other end of the spectrum, with suicide rates the lowest in the EU . 'The stigma surrounding antidepressants has decreased in line with improved awareness of mental health problems over the past 30 years, more counselling services and safer medication options. 'Increased funding for mental health systems has also helped make anti-depressants more affordable and accessible,' he added. 'A decline in suicide rates cannot be linked directly to antidepressants but the evidence in support of them – when used appropriately – is pretty compelling,' he added. The findings of the study, Antidepressant utilization and suicide in Europe: an ecological multi-national study are published in the latest issue of the Public Library of Science (PLoS One).","Use of medication has increased by 20% each year across Europe since 1995 and this has coincided with a suicide drop of 0.8% .

"A 22-year-old student who was shot dead by her ex-boyfriend at a busy Nordstrom store on Black Friday had previously split up with him after he forced a gun into her mouth, it was today claimed. Nadia Ezaldein was hospitalized after Marcus Dee, 31, shoved the handgun into her mouth in December 2013 following months of 'psychological torment' and physical abuse, her family said. Although she subsequently ended the relationship, she and her siblings then received threatening calls from Dee on a regular basis, forcing her to change her number three times, they said. Miss Ezaldein, a seasonal worker at Nordstrom's downtown Chicago branch, was fatally gunned down by Dee at the store on Friday - her 22nd birthday - before he turned the gun on himself. She was rushed to hospital and placed on life support, but died on Saturday at 3:43pm, a day after her family had planned a surprise dinner for her birthday. Dee was declared dead at the scene.

Corden: Chicago police secure the entrance to The Shops at North Bridge  that leads to the Nordstrom store in downtown Chicago, where the two people were shot . Miss Ezaldein's relatives had flown in from Florida especially to surprise the University of Chicago law student for her birthday. She had taken the job so she could afford her tuition fees. The victim started dating Dee in August 2012 after meeting him through her older sister's roommate, her family members, who wished to remain unnamed, told the Chicago Tribune. However, in the 14 months that followed, she was repeatedly abused and beaten up, leading her to eventually seek an order of protection against Dee, they said. But she reportedly backed out of the request when Dee threatened to kill himself if she went through with it. She was also hesitant to report abuse because his parents were Chicago police officers. 'She thought his parents could cover it up,' one of Miss Ezaldein's sisters said, adding that the entire family would receive constant phone calls and texts from Dee following the pair's break-up. Speaking of Friday's shooting through tears, she added: 'It is the worst situation ever. Our sister came up to visit her in Chicago from Florida. We made dinner. We were supposed to have fun. 'She’s the smartest person I know. She didn’t deserve to die.' The victim's brother told the Chicago Sun-Times that Dee used 'a lot of emotional traumatizing phrases and words' to his sister during their relationship, saying: 'It was a very strange circumstance.' The store's management decided to close the branch today following the 'tragic situation that occured' A spokesperson speaking outside on Saturday said: 'We just felt it was the right decision as a company to take this day, regroup and support our employees' On Saturday, Nordstrom posted on its Facebook page: 'We are deeply saddened to learn that our employee who was injured in Friday evening's tragedy at our Michigan Avenue store passed away this afternoon' At one point, Dee tried to file a restraining order against Miss Ezaldein - who had moved to Chicago from Florida in 2009 to start studying law - but the request was denied by a judge, it is reported. On Friday, crowds in the upscale department store off North Michigan Avenue were sent into a panic as they heard gunshots on the second floor at around 8.30pm and hurried out of the building. Hundreds of shoppers were inside at the the time for the Black Friday sales. Miss Ezaldein, originally from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was reportedly shot in the head and neck area. The company decided to close the store on Saturday, meaning many customers hoping to catch the sales were turned away. It was due to reopen at 11am on Sunday. A spokesperson said on Saturday: 'We just felt it was the right decision as a company to take this day, regroup and support our employees'. Panic: The store was filled with customers at the time during the Black Market sales. Shoppers ran to all exits of the building when they heard the shots ring out . A sign in the windows said the branch would not be opening its doors due to the 'tragic situation that occurred'. Michelle Smith, 47, was buying purses with her daughter Krystal, 25, when they heard two gunshots. She told the Chicago Tribune: 'It was a pow and a pow. It was a stampede coming down the escalator. Authorities reiterated that no one else was in harms way and that the suspect entered the store with the intent to hurt his ex-girlfriend. However they stressed that the store was an active crime scene. Suzanne Nanos-Gusching was on the third floor with her daughter who was trying on a dress for a sorority formal at the University of Michigan when shots rang out. 'We just saw people running out and they (the employees) rushed her to get dress,' he told the paper. 'They were adamant about getting us out of the building.' Janis Tillman who was in the store at the time told NBC Chicago: . 'I was right around the corner when an eyewitness came out. I said, 'What happened?' She said, 'I saw somebody.. I saw the guy pull out a gun, shot her, and then he then shot himself.' She was shaken. Very shaken.'

"Jeffrey Neyle McAllister, 38, a former police officer,  was arrested on multiple sex assault charges on Wednesday, amid accusations he abused women at the Legacy Emanuel Medical Center emergency room,  in Portland . A patient who claims she was raped by a male nurse has spoken of her anger that it apparently took police four months to investigate, allowing her alleged abuser to 'attack again'. Jeffrey Neyle McAllister, 38, a former police officer,  has pleaded not guilty in Multnomah County Circuit Court . He was faced with an 11-count indictment accusing him of raping a patient at Legacy Emanuel Medical Centre's ER, in Portland, Oregon, in January, and sexually abusing two other patients in February and last September . The Portland Police Bureau investigation only began when a patient came forward in April 2013. One of this alleged victims claims she told police months earlier, in January, that she had been raped by the nurse. Susan Graham waived her anonymity to speak out about her outrage that police 'mishandling' of her complaint, could mean that others were also attacked. She told Oregon Live that she was not only devastated by her alleged attack but furious that it took four months for police to follow up on her complaint. She claims the nurse made comments about the patterns on her underwear and physical appearance, including complimenting her on her 'narrow hips' while she was undergoing treatment at the hospital. She said he practically carried her into a bathroom because she was unable to walk, to give a urine sample. She was then raped, she says. She said she left the Legacy Emanuel ER the night of January 15, and two days later went to a different hospital, Providence Portland Medical Centre, to make a complaint and undergo examinations. She told the paper that it was not until April that she returned home to find a Portland detective's card waiting for her and asking her to contact police. She said: 'I'm upset because it happened again to someone else after me. I'm appalled on how the police handled my complaint.' Police confirmed that Ms Graham had made a report of sexual assault on January 17, but did not know what exactly her allegations were, and if they were reviewed or acted upon. They did admit to the paper that there was a gap between her initial complaint and any subsequent follow up. Ms Graham, a recovering opiate addict, said she believed that police had not taken her complaint seriously because she has a criminal conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicants and first-degree burglary convictions in 2012. She said: 'I'm upset because it happened again, and it happened once before me, and the police knew.' He has been accused of abusing women at the Legacy Emanuel Medical Center emergency room,  in Portland, Oregon, where he worked as an emergency room nurse . Legacy Emanuel Medical Center dismissed McAllister in April after being made aware of the police inquiry, a hospital spokesman said. He is charged with two counts of first-degree rape, four counts of first-degree sodomy and two counts of first-degree sexual abuse in relation to the alleged January 15 assault against Graham, the indictment says. It also accuses McAllister of first-degree and second-degree sexual abuse of a patient who was who was 'mentally incapacitated and physically helpless' on February 14, and he is also accused of third-degree sexual abuse last September 24, having allegedly touched the breast of another patient. A police spokesman said : 'The . Portland Police Bureau investigation began when a patient came forward . in April 2013, regarding allegations that McAllister inappropriate . sexual contact in the Emanuel Hospital ER. Subsequent investigation and . assistance from Investigator Jessica Van Horn of the Oregon State Board . of Nursing (OSBN), made detectives aware of additional victims.","Jeffrey McAllister, 38, has been arrested on multiple sex assault charges .

"A supporter of Barack Obama has admitted he tried to hide a video of the President speaking out in favour of a controversial Harvard professor while he was a student. Conservative rabble-rouser Andrew Breitbart had promised to release the 'explosive' video, which shows Mr Obama embracing outspoken academic Derrick Bell, just weeks before his sudden death last Thursday. A website unearthed the video earlier today, but it initially seemed much less dramatic than one might have expected given Mr Breitbart's boasts. SCROLL DOWN FOR THE VIDEO . Then-law student Barack Obama speaks to a crowd at a rally supporting a controversial professor at Harvard in 1991 . Embrace: Mr Obama hugs Derrick Bell after urging a crowd to 'open your hearts and minds' to the professor . However, Charles Ogletree, a Harvard professor and ally of the President, clearly thought otherwise. In footage filmed last year and revealed on Fox News tonight by the editors of Mr Breitbart's website, Mr Ogletree is seen showing the video of Mr Obama and Mr Bell to an audience of students. After it was completed, Mr Ogletree said: 'Of course, we hid this during the 2008 election... I don't care if they find it now.' Hot topic: The rally was in support of Mr Bell, who was upset that a female black professor was not tenured by the university . Lecture: Charles Ogletree showed the video to a group of students and admitted he had tried to hide it . No matter political persuasion, it is hard to dispute that Derrick Bell was a pioneer in the legal field, but controversy followed him from school to school. After working at the University of Southern California, he used the protests of students at Harvard Law School to leverage himself to get a faculty position there. He then left to take over the dean position at the University of Oregon School of Law, which made him one of the first black deans of a non-black school, if not the first. The diversity of the faculty at the University of Oregon became a cause dear to his heart and that passion continued throughout his career. He left Oregon in amid a row over faculty diversity, and then, as seen in the video featuring Mr Obama, he spearheaded the cause when he returned the the hallowed-grounds of Harvard. He staged multiple sit-ins during his time there in an effort to get more female professors on staff. When it came to the question of Regina Austin in 1991, he even took a leave of absence from the school in protest and went on to do a hunger strike. Mr Bell, pictured below, died in October of last year from carcinoid cancer. This afternoon, Buzzfeed posted a video . of Mr Obama speaking at a protest in support of Mr Bell's . fight for a more diverse faculty while he was a student at Harvard Law . School. The video, which runs just over a . minute, was shot in 1991 when Mr Obama was 30 years old. At the time, he . was president of the Harvard Law Review and a well-known figure on . campus. At the rally in question, Mr Obama . said good things about Harvard Professor Mr Bell, who was . protesting the fact that a female black professor, Regina Austin, was . not given tenure. 'I . remember him sauntering up to the front and not giving us a lecture but . engaging us in a conversation,' Mr Obama said of his memories of Mr Bell . during their law school orientation. Professor . Bell was a controversial but legendary figure on Harvard's campus, as . he was the first black dean at a non-black law school. 'Now how did this one man do all this, . how has he accomplished all this? He hasn't done it simply by his good . looks and easy charm, although he has both in ample measure,' Mr Obama . said. He encouraged his fellow students to 'Open up your hearts and minds to the words of Professor Derrick Bell'. The pair then hugged in front of the audience, before Mr Bell in turn addressed the crowd. Given the size of the crowd, it was definitely a significant event on the campus, and Professor Bell's decision to take a leave of absence - and later, go on a hunger strike - in support of Ms Austin was certainly radical. Though viewers were initially unsure . whether or not the video was accurate, editors at Mr Breitbart's website . confirmed that the video is the one in question but said that it had . been 'selectively edited' by Buzzfeed's Ben Smith. At the Conservative Political Action Conference in early February, Mr Breitbart said: 'I've got videos. 'This election we're going to vet . him, from his college days to show you why racial division and class . warfare are central to what hope and change was sold in 2008,' he . continued. The current editors of Mr Breitbart's . website confirmed that it is the video that their former leader was . referencing, but added: 'The video has been selectively edited - either . by the Boston television station or by Buzzfeed itself'. Promise of controversy: Andrew Breitbart appeared at CPAC last month and said that he had explosive videos of a young President Obama talking about race . Time hasn't changed his look: President Obama, pictured today with Air Force Col. Greg Urtso, looks very similar to his law school-aged self . The footage published by Buzzfeed did . not feature the footage of Mr Obama embracing Mr Bell, or of Mr . Ogletree talking about the video. Appearing on Fox News to present the . footage in full, one of the Breitbart editors described Mr Bell as 'the . Jeremiah Wright of academia', a reference to the controversial pastor of . a church once attended by Mr Obama. The footage of Mr Bell was not the first time that Mr . Breitbart tried to use videos - or the tease of videos to come - to cause problems . for his Democratic rivals. His videos of Shirley Sherrod and abortion clinics made him famous, and most recently he was directly involved with the resignation of former New York congressman Anthony Weiner as he obtained the politician's sexually explicit Twitter pictures. 1995 Breitbart sees Drudge Report and is so impressed he emails Matt Drudge, going to work for him shortly after . 1997 Arianna Huffington hires him as researcher on her website.Site exposes scandal of fake war hero Ambassador Larry Lawrence buried at Arlington . 2004 Publishes first book celebrity culture expose 'Hollywood, Interrupted' 2005 Instrumental in development and launch of Huffington Post . 2006 Launches own news website Breitbart.com and, soon after, video blog Breitbart.tv. 2009 Launches Big Hollywood quickly followed by Big Government blogResponsible for controversial ACORN undercover video sting . 2010 Big Journalism and Big peace blogs follow . 2011 Big Government breaks Wienergate sexting scandal, forcing Anthony Wiener's resignation .

"NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has defended his disclosure of top-secret U.S. spying programs in an online chat as he attacks President Obama over his broken promises. As he answered readers' questions online, Snowden lambasted U.S. officials for calling him a traitor and said the government won't silence him by 'jailing or murdering' him. 'The US Government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me,' he said in the live chat, which was launched on Monday. 'Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped.' The Guardian hosted the online chat with Snowden, who has been in hiding in Hong Kong since fleeing the U.S., as reporter Glenn Greenwald received and posted Snowden's answers. Speaking out: Edward Snowden is taking part in a live web chat, where he is defending leaking information . Among his responses, he said he waited until after the election to release the information as he had been hopeful that Obama would make good on his promises about civil liberties. In fact, Snowden said, privacy and civil liberties have actually worsened since the re-election. 'Shortly after assuming power, [Obama] closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in Guantanamo, where men still sit without charge,' he said. He said he saw no option but the flee the country as the administration would never have given him a fair trial. 'The U.S. Government, just as they did with other whistleblowers, immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home, openly declaring me guilty of treason,' he said. 'That's not justice.' But Snowden added that he did not think it was too late - that the leaks gave the president a chance 'for a return to sanity, constitutional policy, and the rule of law rather than men'. Connection: Snowden is responding via Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian reporter who broke the story . On his escape to Hong Kong: 'The U.S. Government immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home... That's not justice. It would be foolish to volunteer yourself to it if you can do more good outside of prison than in it.' On leaking information about the U.S. tracking foreign countries: 'Congress hasn't declared war on the countries but without asking for public permission, NSA is running network operations against them that affect millions of innocent people. And for what? So we can have secret access to a computer in a country we're not even fighting?' On being silenced: 'The U.S. government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me.' On why he leaked the information: 'Obama's campaign promises gave me faith that he would lead us toward fixing problems. Unfortunately, he closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused... to end human rights violations.' On beating NSA surveillance: 'Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on. Unfortunately, endpoint security is so terrifically weak that NSA can frequently find ways around it.' On spying for China: 'Ask yourself: if I were a Chinese spy, why wouldn't I have flown directly into Beijing? I could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now.' On when he decided to act: 'There was no single moment. It was seeing a continuing litany of lies from senior officials to Congress.' He called for Obama to set up a special committee to review the surveillance programs and set up a special investigator to review presidents' policies for wrongdoing. He added that he did not reveal any . U.S. operations against what he called legitimate military targets, but . instead showed that the NSA is hacking civilian infrastructure like . universities and businesses. U.S. officials say the data-gathering programs were legal and operated under court supervision. Snowden explained his claim that from his desk, he could 'wiretap' any phone call or email - a claim top intelligence officials have denied. 'If an NSA, FBI, CIA, DIA, etc. analyst has access to query raw SIGINT (signals intelligence) databases, they can enter and get results for anything they want,' he said. 'Phone number, email, user id, cell phone handset id (IMEI), and so on - it's all the same.' Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said that the kind of data that can be accessed and who can access it is severely limited. His online chat comes after China . denied that Snowden is working for them after former US Vice-President . Dick Cheney branded the leaker a 'traitor and possible Chinese spy'. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a daily briefing today, 'This is sheer nonsense,' when asked if Snowden worked for China. Snowden himself added in the web chat: 'Ask yourself: if I were a Chinese spy, why wouldn't I have flown directly into Beijing? I could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now.' Several nations, including U.S. allies, have reacted angrily to revelations by the ex-CIA employee that U.S. authorities had tapped the servers of internet . companies for personal data. National defense: Former Vice President Dick Cheney spoke on Fox News Sunday in Washington about the need for surveillance . 'We believe the United States should . pay attention to the international community's concerns and demands and . give the international community the necessary explanation,' Hua said. The Chinese government has previously . not commented directly on the case, simply repeating the government's . standard line that China is one of the world's biggest victims of . hacking attacks. A senior source with ties to the . Communist Party leadership said Beijing was reluctant to jeopardise . recently improved ties with Washington. Cheney said how the controversial surveillance methods used by the NSA could . have prevented the September . 11 attacks and said the revelations have done 'enormous . damage' to America's security. Speaking on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace, Cheney took credit for crafting the program of data collection, saying that he 'worked with [former Director of . National Intelligence] Mike Hayden when we set this program up.' 'Traitor': According to Cheney, Snowden . could be leaking U.S. security secrets to China. Supporters in Hong Kong have come out strongly in defense of . the former CIA employee, as pictured . 'As everybody who's been associated with the program's said, if we had . had this before 9/11, when there were two terrorists in San Diego - two . hijackers - had been able to use that program, that capability, against . that target, we might well have been able to prevent 9/11,' Cheney told Wallace. In the webchat, Snowden added: 'Journalists should ask: since these programs began operation shortly after September 11th, how many terrorist attacks were prevented SOLELY by information derived from this suspicion-less surveillance that could not be gained via any other source? 'Then ask how many individual communications were ingested to acheive that, and ask yourself if it was worth it.' Cheney ridiculed the notion that the NSA . was listening in to personal calls of ordinary Americans. 'The allegation is not that we get all this personal information on . Aunt Fanny or Chris Wallace, that's not the way it works,' he said. Anger: Snowden said civil liberties had worsened ever since President Obama was re-elected last year . 'What . information [was collected]?' he said. 'And the answer is phone numbers . and who contacted who. But we don’t have any names associated with it. It’s just a big bag of numbers that’s been collected.' Of Snowden, Cheney said the breach of security was one of the worst in history. 'I think he's a traitor. I think it's . one of the worst occasions, in my memory, of somebody with access to . classified information doing enormous damage to the national security . interests of the United States,' he said. He suggested that Snowden, who is thought to have fled to Hong Kong, could be working with the Chinese government. 'I am very, very worried that he still . has additional information that he hasn't released yet, that the Chinese . would welcome the opportunity and are probably willing to offer . immunity - or sanctuary, if you will - in exchange for what he . presumably knows or doesn't know,' said Cheney.","Edward Snowden answers questions from readers in live web chat .

"By . Taylor Auerbach . A deadly outbreak of the Ebola virus that has so far killed at least 78 people in Guinea has spread to neighbouring Liberia, the World Health Organisation confirmed on Sunday. In a statement, the WHO confirmed two samples of blood from Liberia tested positive for Ebola - a virus with a fatality rate of up to 90 per cent - and described the African outbreak as a 'rapidly changing situation'. In nearby Sierra Leone a further two recent deaths have been attributed to Ebola. It has closed its land border with Guinea to keep the virus from spreading further. Scroll down for video . Isolation zone: Areas like this one in Conakry, Guinea have been set up to quarantine Ebola sufferers . Outbreak: Officials have now confirmed cases in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia . Officials have called for calm in the wake of the outbreak, with the WHO advising against travel restrictions being placed on the affected countries. According to the UN's chief public health body, 'There have been 2 deaths among the suspected cases [in Liberia]; a 35 year old woman who died on 21 March tested positive for ebolavirus while a male patient who died on 27 March tested negative.' The worrying news was passed onto the WHO by Liberia's health minister Walter Gwenigale, who told The Associated Press that one of the patients, who died in Lofa County, was married to a Guinean man and had returned ill from a recent trip there. The second patient is a sister of the dead woman. Mr Gwenigale said she is alive and has been isolated in a medical center outside of Monrovia. He would not elaborate on the woman's condition or circumstances surrounding her illness 'because we don't want to cause panic'. Ebola is passed onto humans from animals - especially fruit bats - and often breaks out near rainforests in central and western Africa. According to a WHO fact sheet: Ebola 'is a severe acute viral illness often characterised by the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. Emergency response: The World Health Organisation is devoting extra resources to stop the spread of the disease . Epidemic fears: Doctors Without Borders is dispatching protection gear to affected regions as the death toll hits 70 . 'This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes.' The intensely painful illness is highly contagious and can be passed on to humans through contact with the bodies of people killed by the virus. There is no known cure or vaccine for the five viruses which cause Ebola. Guinea confirmed last week that several victims of hemorrhagic fever in the country's southern region had tested positive for Ebola. Cases have also been confirmed in the capital, Conakry. The WHO is devoting extra resources to surveillance and tracking of cases in response to the outbreak - which has been dubbed an epidemic by some news sources - and is training health care workers in the region. Senegalese music star Youssou Ndour cancelled a weekend concert in the Guinea capital because it would bring a large crowd together. The Ebola outbreak is the first of its kind in west Africa in two decades. It has killed an estimated 1500 people since it was first discovered in Zaire in 1976.","Officials brace for epidemic as isolation zones are set up around Africa .

"New York Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Gabryszak resigned Sunday after mounting accusations of sexual harassment from several staffers led to calls for him to step aside. Mr Gabryszak, a married father of two, announced he would 'retire' after demands he step down came from all corners of state government, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The Buffalo-area politician has been accused of harassment by at least seven staffers . Six current female staffers, as well as a former employee, claim the assemblyman's unwanted advances include taking them to massage parlors and sending at least one woman a video of a sex act being performed on him. Assemblyman Dennis Gabryszak, D-Cheektowaga, speaks last year in the Assembly Chamber at the Capitol in Albany, N.Y. The embattled politician resigned Sunday amid several claims of sexual harassment . The embattled politician claimed in his announcement that he is innocent, but said he was stepping aside to mitigate the negative impact the scandal is having on both his family and the state assembly. Mr Gabryszak wrote in a resignation letter published by the Buffalo News that 'there was no sexual contact between me and any members of my staff' and 'there was never a request that sexual contact should occur.' He also claimed he never intended to create a hostile work environment. 'In fact, there are allegations that have been made that are demonstrably false,' he continued, without refuting any specific claims. 'There was mutual banter and exchanges that took place that should not have taken place because it is inappropriate in the workplace even if it does not constitute sexual harassment,' Mr Gabryszak admitted. The outgoing politician also said he will continue to fight the allegations in court and will not have any further comment at this time. New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (D-Manhattan) said in a statement that Mr Gabryszak stepping aside was the right decision. Ethics Committee Chairman Charles Lavine (D-Nassau County) told the New York Daily News the move ends his investigation into Mr Gaabryszak's conduct since his committee has no jurisdiction over former state representatives. The announcement came one month after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that Mr Gabryszak should resign if the allegations are true. 'He has to be out. Period. End of story,' Cuomo told WIBTV. Erie . County Democratic Chairman Jereemy Zellner told WGRZ 'there is no place for this type of conduct, the work place should be a safe and respectful environment for . employees.' More than half a dozen current or former staffers have filed claims of misconduct against the longtime local politican. Stepping down: Mr Grabryszak, a married father of two, is accused of multiple incidents of sexual harassment by former staffers . The latest accusation came from longtime communications director Kristy Mazurek, the Daily News reported. Ms Mazurek, 43, said in a court filing that Mr Gabryszak suggested she and another female staffer dress up as sexy elves and sit on his lap for an office Christmas photo. Kimberly Snickles, 26, who also served as Director of Communications, from May 2013 through October 2013, alleges that she was asked by Gabryszak to accompany him to a massage parlor her first week on the job. Ms Snickles also says that Mr Gabryszak asked her to stay over at his apartment. She claims he even joked to both her and an intern that he had a 'tattoo on his penis.' In her testimony, Ms Snickles says Mr Gabryszak 'regularly told her and a co-worker that they should wear bikinis to his events.' Ms Snickles claims that she scheduled a meeting with him regarding his behavior -- but he never showed up. Jamie L. Campbell, 24, Mr Gabryszak's former legislative director from 2010 to 2013, says she received a video from him in 2011 that showed the man in a bathroom stall 'either receiving or pretending to be receiving fellatio.' One of the accusers: Annalise Freling says that Gabryszak told her 'you're so hot, you know what I want to do with you' and tried to give her pearls on Valentine's Day . Former staffer: Kristy Mazurek left her job as Mr Gabryszak's communications director and now works for a local television station . Ms Campbell's testimony also says that Mr Gabryszak frequently told her about women he wanted to have sex with, and 'alluded to a prior affair with a former assemblywoman.' He also reportedly talked about prostitutes and going to a strip club regularly. In one of the most shocking allegations, she says Mr Gabryszak offered her $100,000 to move to relocate for her job. When Ms Campbell said that she couldn't because of her fiance, Mr Gabryszak allegedly said 'I guess I will just have to get your fiance to break up with you.' The third former staffer involved in the suit, Annalise C. Freling, 28, who served as Director of Communications from 2011 through 2013, claims Mr Gabryszak attempted to take her out on Valentine's Day in 2011 and give her a set of pearls. Ms Freling says Mr Gabryszak made a . number of remarks on her appearance, including 'you're so hot, you know . what I want to do with you.' Embarrassed: New York Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Gabryszak (bottom right), seen here with his family (from left) daughter Jennifer Atwal, son-in-law Ephraim Atwal, wife Louise Gabryszak and son Brian Gabryszak . The lewd comments led Ms Freling to stop putting on makeup and doing her hair for work, she claims. She also claimed Mr Gabryszak called her when he forgot his wallet while at a massage parlor, and was pressured into bringing it to him. He also frequently asked her to get massages with him. Mr Gabryszak's public persona was different than the one being portayed in court filings, he even supported a 2012 law to help stop psychological abuse and intimidation in the workplace, the Times Union noted. Johnny Destino, a Niagra Falls-based lawyer representing the women, previously told the Buffalo News 'a minimum of two additional former employees' will come forward to bring similar allegations.","Gabryszak, 62, stepped down after accusations of taking staffers to massage parlors and telling them about trips to strip clubs .

"Convicted child killer Brett Peter Cowan, who tore the Morcombe family to pieces when he killed 13-year-old Daniel 10 years ago, has been seen behind bars for the first time looking visibly fit and healthy. The mug shot of the once gaunt and frail looking Cowan, obtained by Channel 7, shows the prisoner with a fuller face and facial hair just four months after he was jailed within Australia's maximum security prison - the Wolston Correctional Centre. The image has brought disgust to the faces of Bruce and Denise Morcombe, Daniel's parents, who are still tormented by the man who abused and killed their son when he chocked him in an abandoned house in 2003. Scroll down for video . Daniel Morcombe's killer Brett Peter Cowan had requests for the chocolate cereal Coco Pops in jail turned down but is still looking fit and healthy . How Brett Peter Cowan looked - a frail and gaunt figure - before he was locked away in Wolston Correctional Centre . Daniel Morcombe went missing from a Sunshine Coast bus stop back in 2003 . It is an unwanted reminder of their son's killer, Bruce Morcombe said, who highlighted that despite his change in physical appearance is still the same man who abducted Daniel from a Sunshine Coast bus stop 10 years ago before killing him. 'You can't change a leopard's spots,' he said, as he and wife Denise painfully looked at the image of Cowan when shown by a Channel 7 reporter. 'The goatee, chin-beard is very prominent...he does look a little porky.' Denise Morcombe found his look equally as unflattering: 'He's grown his goatee back..and he's died his hair darker,' as she described the man as an evil child killer and molester that nobody liked. 'No one likes a child killer or molester, and that's what Cowan is,' she said in the Channel 7 interview. It is the first time Bruce and Denise Morcombe had seen their son's killer since he was led away from Brisbane Supreme Court following his  sentencing. Bruce and Denise Morcombe speak after the first photo of Brett Peter Cowan from behind bars emerges of him looking fit and healthy . When he was imprisoned, he had special food requests such as Coco Pops rejected, but in his cell he has his own TV, radio, toilet and shower. Himself a father, Cowan has three children but they won't be seeing their dad for at least 20 years when the 44-year-old is eligible for parole from his maximum security cell. He will be kept in solitary confinement during his time inside purely for his own protection from prison inmates. In some cases, according to prison staff, Cowan requires high level escorts when he leaves his cell to guard him down the halls during weekly visits to the doctor. He visits a gym, a concrete room with a single sun-drenched window, which is the only time he ever gets to see life life outside. Bruce Morcombe said he knows Cowan would be doing it tough, and quite frankly, didn't care much for his treatment behind bars. In a message to Cowan Mr Morcombe told the father of three neither he nor his wife 'feel sorry for sorry him' 'Suck it up,' he said.

Back in March Cowan was found guilty of murder, indecent treatment of a child and interfering with a corpse. The Morcombe family declined to be present for the sentencing, in which Supreme Court Judge Roslyn Atkinson spoke at length about Cowan's crimes. She described his crime as 'entirely abhorrent.' 'You didn't look like a monster, you didn't look like a peadophile, you looked like an ordinary person,' she said. 'You knew if he ran away, you'd be caught. So you killed him. You killed him because you didn't want to get caught. 'Everything you did to that boy is horrific and disgraceful. I've seen no evidence in the months you've been in this court that you ever felt any remorse for what you did. 'You have tragically and pointlessly snuffed out a young life.'","Prison image shows Brett Peter Cowan, 44, looking fatter behind bars .

"An intriguing set of pictures reveals the hidden emotional lives of subjects who agreed to have their portrait taken. The work of international photographer Christopher Dodd, the photo series aims to show a side of the citizens of London usually kept locked away. Sixteen very different individuals were cast to sit for a portrait on the proviso that they, in turn, gave up one secret to sit beside their portrait, with some moving and poignant revelations coming out of the project. People were cast by This Is Dodd to sit for a portrait on the proviso that they, in turn, gave up one secret to sit beside their portrait . Ceci, 35, confesses she kept a tooth of her late father's before burying him in Shanghai . Many of the secrets reveal a huge about of inner pain on the part of the subject, with the secrets adding an additional depth and significance to the accompanying pictures. Gary 24, confesses: ‘I am in love with my best friend who does not feel the same. It has put a strain on our friendship which I feel guilty for. I suffer in silence with this secret with no one to talk to.’ One boy, identified only as Ali, 17, writes: ‘There is one person I hate most of all, it’s myself. Don’t know why, I just don’t like him.’ Another woman, aged 35, confesses to a dark secret regarding the remains of her dead father. ‘This is Ceci. Back in 2008 I buried my father’s urn outside the city of Shaghai. Approx 9200km away from where I’m right now...That box is missing one thing; a tooth of him. I took it with me the night before. Cos just being his daughter having his blood in me isn’t enough for me to keep it going. I didn’t know how to deal without him.’ Nick reveals he was once given half an hour to live after suffering a pulmonary embolism . Priscilla, 62, admits she owns a stolen cat, and that her husband still thinks that it was an orphan . London based photographer Christopher, who posted the pictures to his website says that he undertook the project due to his belief in the power of photography to help people open up. ‘The . project idea comes from years of shooting. I have worked with an array . of people, sitting for various situations from all walks of life. Each . person always had a story to tell which made them comfortable when . sitting for the photo,’ he explains. ‘So . this led onto the idea that people when put into an uncomfortable . situation always tend to reveal more than they would usually to relax . themselves. ‘From that . detail, I thought up the project and asked people to sit for a portrait . but in turn they must tell me a secret that nobody else knows and the . use of photo would help them release that secret to the public. Lee, 35, reveals he gave up on a Phd in the history of poltergeist hauntings in the 17th and 18th centuries . Many of the secrets reveal inner pain, such as Will, 43, who says he tried to kill himself 25 years ago . ‘The secrets where so vast it was incredible to hear each and every one. Some very moving, some very shocking and the rest very rude, but I take this as a slice of London and what you see on the surface is not always what you actually get. ‘Everyone has secrets; we just need to be brave to unlock them sometimes.' In one photo a 43-year-old man confesses that at 25 he tried to kill himself after being seduced by an older man. Another subject, confessed that after neutering and vaccinating a cat she thought was a stray - it then came back with a collar and a phone number which she promptly threw away. The project follows the growing trend of telling, rather than repressing, our darkest innermost thoughts. Website Post Secret and the Whisper app have both created a worldwide following on their 'secret sharing' premises, with thousands combining art with revealing their secret, creating a sense of community artwork as well as lessening the feeling of solitude so many feel when holding onto a secret. Christopher's project, of course, removes the anonymity that the other secret sharing projects grant, which is perhaps why it carries such an emotional weight for those who view the photographs.","Photographer Christopher Dodd asked people to allow him to take their picture .

"A teenage girl who was the victim of a real-life ‘Mean Girls’ hate campaign at school has had the last laugh - after reaching the final of a national beauty contest. Rosie Thompson, 17, was targeted at the age of 11 because she joined a new school and didn’t have any friends. However, the student has now put the taunting behind her and reached the finals of Miss Birmingham, beating thousands of other young hopefuls. Rosie has overcome bullies at school (left) and beat thousands of girls to reach the final of Miss Birmingham . Rosie (L) pictured in 2011 at Bromsgrove School, with her friends Emily Taylor, Clara Hunt and Alice Shinner (L-R) Rosie will take on 19 other girls later this month with the winner getting the chance to compete in Miss United Kingdom on November 15. Rosie, from Redditch, Worcs, said: 'I have wanted to do modelling since a young age but I just didn’t have the confidence. 'I have also had a passion for fundraising and by modelling I can also fund raise which is great, the two things just merged together. Rosie will now compete in the final of the beauty pageant for Miss Birmingham, with the winner going on to compete for Miss United Kingdom . Rosie, pictured in 2007, describes the bullying as similar to the type seen in the movie Mean Girls . 'When I was around 11-years-old I was bullied, it wasn’t physical abuse, it was mainly verbal. 'I joined the school late and by the time I got there everyone had their friendship groups, but I was on my own. As part of the competition, Rosie is raising money for The Variety Club, a disabled children's charity . 'It was a bit like the Mean Girls film when Lindsay Lohan is ostracised at the new school by the popular kids. 'It wasn’t very nice, I had a fall out with one of the most popular girls in the school and people started to turn against me. 'They would call me names and throw things at me which was horrible and I left the school a few years later because it go so bad. Rosie's mother Callie, pictured with her at home, says she is very proud of her daughter, who wants to pursue a career in modelling . 'When I left the school my confidence was at an all-time low, it was horrible. 'But then at my new school I fitted in perfectly and my confidence just grew, I guess that helped with my modelling and helped me to do it. 'I have tried to block out the past, I put up a barrier and just got over it, it was hard to do but I needed to to move on with my life.' Rosie, pictured centre, with her family on holiday in 2008 said the bullying destroyed her self confidence . As part of the competition, Rosie is raising money for The Variety Club, a disabled children’s charity. Proud mother Callie, 50, who runs her own dog grooming salon, said: 'I am so very proud of her. 'She is a good girl, she makes effort in everything she has ever done and it is great that she is raising money for the charity. 'She is keen to pursue a modelling career and has applied to lots of different agencies on her own, she is like that, very independent, which is great. 'We have thought about her winning the competition, but we don’t want to jinx it, we are just taking things one day at a time.'

"Proud grandfather: Bill Cassidy, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senator from Louisiana, has announced that his 17-year-old daughter is having a baby out of wedlock . A conservative Louisiana Republican seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu announced Thursday that his unwed 17-year-old daughter is pregnant. Bill Cassidy, a U.S. congressman and medical doctor, is challenging Landrieu, a three-term incumbent, in a race that Republicans view as important in their quest to reclaim the U.S. Senate from Democrats. 'Earlier this year, Laura and I learned we will become grandparents this summer,' Cassidy said in a statement provided to the Times-Picayune of New Orleans. 'Our children have been the greatest blessing of our lives and we welcome our grandchild as a joyous addition to our family. 'Our daughter now faces a more challenging future than her peers. She has our unconditional love and support.' The 17-year-old mother-to-be will be a senior in Baton Rouge High School in the fall. The baby is due sometime this summer. The Cassidy campaign did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Bill Cassidy is a physician specializing in the treatment of liver disease. His wife, Laura Layden, is a retired breast cancer surgeon. The couple have three children: a son and two teenage daughters. His campaign website states that Cassidy 'works to promote the culture of life and protect the unborn.' Cassidy and Mary Landrieu, the senior U.S. senator from Louisiana, have clashed over the issue of abortion in the course of the campaign. Landrieu publicly criticized a law restricting abortion rights that was signed by Gov Bobby Jindal last month, Politico reported. The centrist Democrat explained that she has a nuanced position on the subject of abortions with the voting record to prove it. Bitter rivals: Cassidy (left) is seeking to unseat three-term incumbent Seantor Mary Landrieu, whom the GOP hopeful has described as the pro-choice candidate in a pro-life state . ‘I’ve voted against late-term abortion, I voted for access in the … pre-viability [period],’ she said. ‘Although I personally believe that life begins at conception, I believe the last place the government needs to be is in the church, in the doctor’s office or in the bedroom.’ But Bill Cassidy has disputed his opponent's position, painting her as a pro-choice candidate. ‘She has supported using U.S. taxpayer dollars for overseas abortions and most folks, even if they are pro-choice, don’t care for that,’ Cassidy said. On his part, Cassidy has backed a bill passed in the Congress that bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy on the federal level. In a recent interview, the Senate hopeful described Louisiana as a 'pro-life' state where most of the constituents are Catholics and evangelicals who support the rights of the unborn.","Bill Cassidy, a U.S. congressman from Louisiana, is seeking to unseat three-term Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu .

"With everyone from Lady Gaga to Cheryl Cole hopping on the buttock baring bandwagon, it was surely only a matter of time before the animal world got in on the act. Now a collection of belfies [bottom selfies] featuring hamsters has gone viral after a selection of snaps was posted on website Rocket News 24. Among the cute pictures are hamsters snapped slumped over their feed trough, burrowing behind an armchair and asleep on their owner's kitchen table. Adorable: Hamsters have fallen prey to the belfie trend pioneered by Kim Kardashian and copied by the A-list . Tight squeeze: The hamster on the left appears to be stuck in a sofa while the other is trapped in one of his toys . Cute though they are, they can't muster quite enough buttock to rival the queen of the Belfie - reality star, Kim Kardashian. After a photo of the new mother posing in a white swimsuit with her bottom on show went viral last month, a series of tributes have appeared - some more successful than others. One of the most amusing was the tongue-in-cheek effort posted by model Kelly Brook who used Photoshop to inflate the size of her derriere to Kardashian like proportions. Alongside the cheeky Instagram shot of the 33-year-old's newly-enlarged bottom, she wrote: '@kimkardashian I've seen that shot somewhere before HA!!' The Kent-born beauty then posted a before and after comparison of the same snap, writing: 'Inspired @kimkardashian.'

Other celebrities to tackle the trend include Lady Gaga and Rihanna, both of whom have used social media to show off their derrieres, and TOWIE star Lucy Mecklenburgh. Another to give the world a peek at her rear end was Cheryl Cole, who also took the opportunity to unveil her now-healed bottom covering tattoo. Unlike the others, who chose to imitate Kim Kardashian's side-on pose, the 30-year-old singer opted to turn her back on the camera completely, ensuring that all eyes were on her backside in the process - much like the stars of Rocket New's ultra cute hamster photos.

"Using a card to withdraw money from a cash machine could soon be a thing of the past. Japanese technology company Hitachi and Polish banking services provider Itcard S.A. are in the process of installing their biometric ‘Finger Vein’ technology across Poland. The technology allows people to simply place their finger in a scanner instead of entering a card and pin number to withdraw cash. Hitachi and Itcard S.A. have announced plans to install 1,730 ATM machines in Poland with their biometric Finger Vein technology (pictured). This allows people to simply scan their finger and then access their account, rather than using a standard card and pin . The project, called Planet Cash, will be implemented in a minimum of 1,730 ATMs in Poland this year. The technology has already been employed in a few banks in Poland, but now it is being rolled out to the general public. In a separate development, Intel has unveiled a new 3D interface to replace regular touch screens and keypads. It enables people to make choices and go through menus on a computer display by 'touching' icons in the air. A 3D camera is used on the special glass to make the interactive display. It's somewhat like the technology Tom Cruise's character uses in the film Minority Report. Intel says it could be employed in future on ATM machines and other devices. Such depth-sensing cameras have been used to replace other technologies like the computer mouse. As of yet, however, Hitachi has announced no plans to bring the innovative technology to other countries like the UK. The technology works by using a combination of a CCD camera and near-infrared light. When a finger is placed in a scanner, the near-infrared light is passed through the finger. This is partially absorbed by haemoglobin in the veins and captures a finger vein pattern profile that is unique to everyone. This is then matched to a pre-registered profile to verify individual identity. Using the system users can perform the same functions on an ATM that they would with a regular card and pin number – withdraw cash, check balance, make payments and so on. ‘Finger Vein is a key technology in our company’s strategy, Jarosław Chrzanowski, CEO at ITCARD S.A, says in a statement. ‘We’ve already been using this technology for ATMs in the cooperative banking sector. ‘Once again, ITCARD is making a revolution in the market by launching the first biometric shared network in Europe which can be used by all banking customers.’ The technology works by sending near-infrared light through a person's finger. This is partially absorbed by hemoglobin in the finger, which then creates a specific finger vein pattern unique to the person that can be matched to a pre-registered profile . The announcement follows similar vein technology that is being employed elsewhere. In April, Swedish shoppers signed up to make payments with a simple swipe of their hand. The . developers hope hand scanning will become an alternative payment method . if it is a success during trials in the city of Lund in southern . Sweden. The vein-scanning . terminals have been installed in 15 shops and restaurants after an . engineering student at the local university came up with the technology . two years ago while waiting in line to pay. Handy idea! Developers hope hand scanning will . become an alternative payment method for people if it is a success . during trials in the city of Lund in southern Sweden (pictured) Some 1,600 signed up for the system which its inventor insists is safer than credit cards. 'Every individual's vein pattern is . completely unique, so there really is no way of committing fraud with . this system,' said researcher Fredrik Leifland. 'You always need your . hand scanned for a payment to go through.' The plan is to patent the system and expand it around the globe. To . sign up, users have to visit a shop or restaurant with a terminal, . where they scan their palm three times and enter their social security . and telephone numbers. A . text message is then sent to their mobile phone with an activation link . to a website, with payments taken directly from customer's bank accounts . twice a month. More than 1,000 shoppers have signed up to make . payments with a swipe of their hand. Every person's vein pattern is . unique, so there really is no way of committing fraud with this system, . the maker claims .","1,730 cash machines in Poland are to be given 'Finger Vein' technology .

Above, Justin Bieber is pictured in a mugshot in January . Among the UK celebrities considered 'bad' and 'famous for nothing' were Canadian singer Justin Bieber and reality television star Kim Kardashian.

"It is not even on the market for another six months, but one eagle-eyed teenager has spotted the hotly-anticipated Jaguar F-Type coupe heavily camouflaged in a supermarket car park. The £80,000 model is the coupe version of the much sought-after sports car, regarded as one of the world's best looking car.

But car enthusiast Rob Barker got a sneak preview of the sports car when he spotted it in a supermarket car park in Leamington Spa. The Jaguar test driver made a hasty exit when he saw the college student with his camera, but not before the 18-year-old got a few pictures. Mr Barker, from Leamington Spa, said: 'I spotted this Jaguar prototype at the Shire’s shopping park in Leamington on Sunday afternoon. 'As soon as I saw it I knew it was a prototype from either Aston Martin or Jaguar/Land Rover because they have factories at Gaydon, and sometimes bring their cars around the local area for testing purposes. 'They are always wrapped in this strange camouflage to hide the body so that people can’t see what’s underneath, but I think it’s very eye catching and it seemed to attract a lot of unwanted attention. 'The car sounded incredible and looked amazing too. I’ve never really liked Jaguars, but the company’s latest models are certainly changing my view.' The car was spotted in Leamington Spa, around ten miles from Gaydon in Warwickshire which is the headquarters for Jaguar Land Rover . Car enthusiast Mr Barker said the Jaguar 'sounded incredible and looked amazing too' Leamington Spa is around ten miles from Gaydon in Warwickshire which is the headquarters for Jaguar Land Rover. The British brand, which is owned by Indian conglomerate Tata, is one of the world’s most profitable car manufacturers. Last week it announced sales for the most recent quarter were up 21 per cent with a staggering 102, 644 vehicles sold. For the first half of the financial year it has boasted revenues of more than £8billion with profits of £1.1billion - an increase of 42 per cent. The coupe model of the Jaguar F-Type will make its official world debut on November 20 during next week's Los Angeles Motor Show . In July MailOnline reported how the brand new Rolls Royce Wraith was spotted in the street while one of the engineers road tested it . The firm is hoping the coupe, which will be available as a V6 or V8 and cost between £55,000 and £80,000, will help boost sales figures further. The Jaguar F-Type Coupe is set to make its global debut on November 19, the eve of the Los Angeles auto show. The all-aluminium range is said to complement the award-winning F-Type Convertible range.Ian Callum, director of design at Jaguar, said: 'We've been overwhelmed by the positive reaction to F-Type Convertible, but for me the purity of creating a sports Coupé is a uniquely satisfying process - and I know that both visually and dynamically, F-TYPE Coupé raises the bar yet again.' Full technical details of the Coupe have not yet been released, but will be made available at the Los Angeles auto show. It is regarded as the spiritual successor . to the iconic Jaguar E-Type which has been voted the world’s most . beautiful car in the past. The F-Type Coupe will make its official world debut on November 20 during next week’s Los Angeles Motor Show. Jaguar declined to discuss the F-Type’s spotting, only pointing to previous comments made about its hotly-anticipated unveiling. It is not the first time the car has been spotted in public.

"Detectives investigating the horrific shooting which massacred a British family in the French countryside now believe more than one professional assassin was involved - after it emerged three of the four victims were shot twice. The three Britons killed on the outskirts of the village of . Chevaline, near Annecy, were hit by two bullets each – while the French cyclist who stumbled across the scene of the . carnage was hit five times. The fact that intense gunfire was heard for less than 30 seconds – and . it was so brutally effective – strengthens the theory of experienced . hit-men being responsible. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Clues: Detectives investigating the horrific shooting which massacred a British family in the French countryside now believe more than one professional assassin was involved. Police are pictured  gathering evidence from the BMW in which the family was massacred . Killing: The three Britons killed on the outskirts of the village of Chevaline, near Annecy, were hit by two bullets each - while the French cyclist who stumbled across the scene of the carnage was hit five times . It also emerged today that police officers are hunting for a Peugeot 4x4, green or white, which was being driven by a man in a black shirt. It was spotted near the scene by a young woman and also an RAF veteran who stumbled across the bloodbath near the beauty spot. The . unidentified Briton has now been hailed as a hero for saving the life . of seven-year-old Zainab  Al-Hilli in the moments after the forest . murders. Her father Saad Al-Hilli, 50, mother Ikbal and her grandmother . were all killed. Her little sister Zeena, four, was . unharmed and a French cyclist, father-of-three Sylvain Mollier, who is . believed to have witnessed the bloodbath, was also shot dead. Mr Al-Hilli, 50, was initially shot once in . the forehead as he sat at the wheel of the BMW estate car he had used to . drive his family to a caravan holiday to Lake Annecy, in eastern . France. Then a second ‘coup de grace’ bullet was apparently used to make sure that Mr Al-Hilli, of Clayton, Surrey, was indeed dead. This is the classic modus operandi of gunmen the world over who are . contracted to kill people, whether working for criminal gangs, terrorist . groups, or security services. Dead: Saad Al-Hilli, 50, was ambushed with his family on Wednesday during a family outing in the French Alps . Mr Al-Hilli, his wife Ikbal, and her elderly mother were shot twice through the car’s windows, with not a single bullet wasted. Mr Mollier, a 45-year-old father of three who arrived at the scene . by bike, is likely to have disturbed the multiple killings, and thus . would have made a more difficult target. An investigating source confirmed to French media that all those in the . car ‘received two bullets each’, while Mr Mollier ‘was hit five times’. Witnesses have described hearing around 30 seconds of gunfire at the . isolated beauty spot next to woods on the outskirts of Chevaline. This suggests that more than one gunman is likely to have been involved, . given the ruthlessness of the killings, and the treatment of other . witnesses. The Al-Hilli’s seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, suffered a fractured skull and a bullet in the shoulder. Her four-year-old sister, Zeena, was the only member of the family to . escape unscathed after hiding underneath her mother’s legs. It was to be a full eight hours before police eventually found her . following the murders, which took place just before 4pm on Wednesday, . suggesting that the gunmen also had no idea that she was there. Zainab and Zeena’s testaments are likely to be crucial as French . examining magistrates and police try to establish exactly what happened. They will be assisted by the results of autopsies which will be carried . out on all four bodies later today. A source close to the enquiry said: ‘The elements emerging certainly . point towards a professional assassination, with more than one gunman . likely to have been involved. ‘Both girls are under armed police guard, but Zeena is starting to speak quiet fluently about her ordeal.’ Zainab is in an induced coma because of her skull injuries, but is otherwise ‘stable’ in intensive care. Julian Stedman, Mr Al-Hilli's accountant, said: 'They were shot through . the head so that sounds like a professional killing, which is really . very worrying. A casual killer would not do that. The reason for that – I . haven't a clue.' Intelligence officers from the British Embassy in Paris are said to have . been at the scene of the murder hours after it happened. They were tipped off by contacts in the French Interior Ministry as soon . as the identity of the car's owner was confirmed. According to the . French TV station Demain, locals described embassy staff as being . 'military types' and numbering around 20. The RAF veteran  who discovered the scene was following a popular cycling route . around Lake Annecy and the surrounding countryside when he noticed the British-registered BMW estate in the forest car . park and went to investigate. Mystery: How the brutal slaying of the family in the French Alps unfolded . The cyclist, who has a holiday home . in the area, discovered the engine was running . before he spotted a girl near the front of the vehicle fall to the . ground. He immediately put her in the recovery position and called the . emergency services from his mobile phone at 3.48pm on Wednesday. But he grasped the full extent of the horror only after he smashed the driver's side window to reach in and turn off the engine. This was when he saw the bodies – the . man at the steering wheel and two women in the back – two shot in the . face. Then he saw a cyclist slumped on the ground near his bike, also . shot dead. This same man had overtaken him only . moments earlier on his bike ride. Lt Col Benoit Vinnemann of  the . Chambery gendarmes, said: 'The main witness, a cyclist who discovered . the grisly scene, said he was overtaken by another cyclist on the climb . that leads to the parking lot where the shooting took place. 'Arriving there, he found the cyclist . on the ground with gunshot wounds near a car. In the vehicle, a man and . two women, has also been shot. French police guard the scene of the murders. An RAF veteran has now been hailed as a hero for saving the life of seven-year-old Zainab Al-Hilli in the moments after the forest murders . Grim: A tow truck escorted by French gendarmes carries the car in which the three Britons were shot dead  in the French Alpine village of Chevaline . Investigation: The fact that intense gunfire was heard for less than 30 seconds - and it was so brutally effective - strengthens the theory of experienced hit-men being responsible for the killings. The car is pictured being taken away by police . 'On the other side of the car, a . child of 6-8 years old was alive. He placed her in the recovery position . until help arrived. She had been very badly beaten.' Lt-Col Vinnemann said that the Briton . had seen 'various cars leaving the scene including a 4x4'. It has also emerged that he told police that -  before arriving at the murder . scene - he saw a green 4x4 and a motorbike speeding towards it. A detective said: 'He has a keen sense of observation. This could help us greatly,' the source told French channel M6. It is the first time that the possibility of the assassins using a motorbike has been raised. Now a young woman who was also in the area has told police that she saw a . ‘white Peugeot 206 or 306’ a few minutes later, along the same road and . heading towards the village of Horses. She said it was being driven extremely fast by ‘a man in a black shirt’ who had to swerve suddenly to avoid hitting her own car. Peugeot makes 4x4s in both the 206 and 306 range, leading to the . possibility that both witnesses saw the same Peugeot, and it was being . used as a getaway car by a man involved in the killings. Prosecutor Eric Maillaud said the ordeal of what the RAF man had witnessed had left him . in 'a great deal of shock'. He added: 'He should be . congratulated on his swift actions.' Mr Mollier, 45, was a father of three . from nearby Ugine. He was on paternity leave from his job at a company . producing stainless steel products. His . wife alerted police when he failed to return home from his bike ride. Prosecutor Maillaud said: 'It would appear he was in the wrong place at . the wrong time.' Following . the attack, in which Zainab is believed to have been pistol-whipped, . doctors induced a coma but she is believed to be out of danger and her . condition has stabilised. Zeena is receiving psychiatric care. London link: The home of Saad Al-Hilli in Claygate, Surrey .","The fact that intense gunfire was heard for less than 30 seconds – and .

"A tiny B&B in the Outer Hebrides has won a landmark legal victory against holiday review website TripAdvisor. Richard Gollin, 64, launched a small claims action at Stornoway Sheriff Court over what he says are ‘false and malicious’ criticisms of his guesthouse in Lewis, which the site refused to take down after being posted by its users. He maintained the website lost him valuable bookings of around £2,000 by refusing to remove the 'untrue' comments. Richard Gollin claimed that negative comments posted about his guesthouse are false and should have been removed by Tripadvisor . Criticised: The guesthouse at the centre of the legal dispute . Until now, TripAdvisor, which is . based in the U.S. and worth around $4billion, has denied it was . subject to UK laws and could therefore not be sued. It previously challenged the . jurisdiction of the Scottish court claiming the firm is outside the . remit of the Scottish legal system because it is based in Massachusetts. However, . Mr Gollin’s lawyer, Duncan Burd, a solicitor who is more used to . crofting cases, won a concession from the firm which has agreed it can . be sued in Scotland. The floodgates could be opened to people suing global website travel guide TripAdvisor after the significant victory won by a tiny B&B . Splendid isolation: Mr Gollin's guesthouse enjoys beautiful surroundings, with mountains and beaches on its doorstep . But it was a bittersweet victory for Mr Gollin as Sheriff Colin Scott Mackenzie ruled in TripAdvisor’s favour over transferring the action to a higher court, which requires him to hire a lawyer and be exposed to unlimited expenses. An appeal is being lodged and is expected to be heard in Stornoway in two months. If it goes ahead, the case will now pivot on the legal interpretation of TripAdvisor’s website terms and under the basis of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.

"Everything the Duchess of Cambridge touches turns to gold. From her pre-pregnancy high street steals to her chic maternity looks, Kate manages to impress every time. So it comes as no surprise that the former Kate Middleton has been crowned the number one most fashionable icon of modern time. Preceding Catherine’s royal flair for . fashion, Princess Diana was also voted one of the most fashionable icons . of all time, beaten only by the indisputable classic style of Audrey . Hepburn. No surprises here: The Duchess of Cambridge has been voted the modern day fashion icon, beating off the likes of Cheryl Cole and Victoria Beckham . Men and women nationwide are united in their opinion that Victoria Beckham – previously widely acclaimed as the unofficial queen of British fashion - has now been usurped by the Duchess for her trademark quintessentially British style and seemingly effortless flair with which she has become synonymous. In an unforeseen coup de théâtre from beyond the grave Baroness Margaret Thatcher, often mocked for her 'matronly’ attire made a surprise entry in at number ten on the ‘Top Ten Most Fashionable Celebrities of All Time’ list. Overall, the survey proves that the more classic, feminine style – currently favoured by the likes of Cheryl Cole and in her hey day the 50s movie icon, Marilyn Monroe - reigns supreme. All time classics: Audrey Hepburn and Princess Diana took the top spots when it came to biggest fashion icon of all time . Top spots: Fashion designer Victoria Beckham and songstress Cheryl Cole were second and third most fashionable icons in the modern day category . Whereas the more edgy and untamed look currently associated with model of the moment Cara Delevingne and off-beat musical wild child Lady Gaga proves slightly less popular amongst men and women alike. When it comes to female fashion, the survey also found that men and women are divided on what they deem to be attractive. Over half of the women included in the survey stated that a pair of heels makes them feel most attractive, whilst almost three in four men men prefer a tight dress and a mini skirt. Tomboy chic: The more edgy and untamed look currently associated with model of the moment Cara Delevingne and Lady Gaga comes in at bottom of the top ten .

A rape victim in India is believed to have committed suicide after police took 14 days to register her case. Authorities in India are attempting to stem any further violence from demonstrations that erupted in reaction to the brutal rape of another girl in New Delhi . Indian students protesting against a recent gang-rape of a young woman in a moving bus in New Delhi. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pledged today to take action to protect the nation's women . Her family said despite reporting the attack it took two weeks for police to take any action. The victim's older sister told India Today she had lost hope the case would be brought to justice when she suffered intimidation from the accused. She said the victim had approached the police at Badshahpur village: 'On some occasions, the policemen would . take her to the police station in late evening hours. They would seek . her to narrate the incident. They also tried to force her to withdraw . her complaint.' She said the accused men had threatened the family too and all had been forced to go into hiding at another family member's house at Samana - a town near Patiala - on November 29. However, the accused intimidated them there too. It is believed the girl 'consumed poison' at around 5pm on Boxing Day before she was rushed to Rajindera Hospital at Patiala, but she died later that night. It is believed the accused men were named in a 'suicide note' left by the girl. Patiala police are believed to have now ordered an investigation and said police would be 'dismissed from their job if negligence was proved'.

"Jailed: Mark Walsh has been jailed for 20 months after he was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving . An engineer who killed a motorcyclist after driving too slowly on a motorway fought back tears as he was jailed yesterday. Mark Walsh, 43, ‘invited catastrophe’ when he braked suddenly to take a slip road, a court heard. He was travelling at less than 10mph in rushhour traffic when motorcyclist Peter Sarchet, 41, who was behind Walsh’s car, tried to stop to avoid a collision but lost control of his Yamaha. The father of three fell off his bike and slid under Walsh’s Vauxhall Insignia, where he was trapped. A passing RAC recovery driver stopped and jacked up the car to try to free Mr Sarchet, but he had suffered catastrophic injuries and was pronounced dead in hospital. When questioned by police, Walsh offered no explanation as to why he had ‘all but stopped’. He was not using his mobile phone and had simply slowed down on the M65 in Lancashire to take the  turn-off for the M61, he said. Walsh did not give evidence in his defence during the four-day trial at Burnley Crown Court last month when he was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. At Preston Crown Court yesterday he was jailed for 20 months and banned from driving for three years. Robert Elias, prosecuting, told the court that at 7am on November 1, 2011, Walsh, from Hapton, near Burnley, was driving along the M65, near Walton-Le-Dale, to his office in Warrington. ‘For no reason... the defendant slowed down very quickly,’ Mr Elias said. ‘[He] all but stopped and was inviting catastrophe. No competent driver would consciously drive at less than 10mph on the motorway. 'There was no good reason for him to brake heavily. If someone is driving at less than 10mph on a motorway, he is an accident waiting to happen.’ Mr Sarchet, a retail manager, was travelling at between 37mph and 45mph, the jury was told. Walsh told police he had been travelling . at 70mph, keeping up with the flow of traffic, but moved to the inside . to take the exit on to the M61. 'He said he heard a loud bang at the back of the vehicle, but did not remember feeling any impact. His car stalled and when he started it, a man came running along the hard shoulder shouting to him not to drive it, he claimed. Alistair MacDonald, QC, defending, told the court Walsh was a hard-working ‘family man’. ‘This was the briefest of moments giving rise to this offence,’ he added. Walsh (left) was traveling to work on the M65 with other commuters when he suddenly slowed down to less than 10mph to take a slip road. Peter Sarchet (right) was forced to brake and lost control of his machine when his front wheel locked . Scene: A view of the M65 motorway near to the junction with the M6, close to the spot where the accident happened . Statement: In a prepared statement Walsh said he was a family man and was of good character . But, passing sentence, Judge Robert . Altham, told Walsh: ‘You gratuitously braked hard and veered to the left . while in the slow lane with such suddenness that you came to a rapid . halt at what was a fairly busy time. ‘The life that was lost as a result was a fine life. You never accepted responsibility for that day.’ In . a statement, Mr Sarchet’s widow, Jill, said: ‘Peter was a devoted . family man and lived for his children. Our loss cannot be described.’ Later, a personal injury expert said it was a ‘very unusual case’. Navdip Gill, a partner at Geoffrey Leaver Solicitors, said rear-end crashes were almost always the fault of the driver behind. ‘The law says motorists should always heed the presence of the vehicle . in front and be aware of their surroundings, so the rule of thumb is . that the driver who hits the rear of the vehicle in front is almost . always the responsible party. ‘It is only in exceptional circumstances that the driver travelling behind is not held responsible, or partially responsible.’ He said exceptional circumstances included a car deliberately pulling out in front of another driver and reckless braking.

"Holidaymakers are to be hit with bills for hundreds of pounds under European Union plans to impose MoT-style tests on caravans. Up to 200,000 families could be affected by the draconian demands which it is warned could devastate the UK’s tourism economy. The UK government is to launch an attempt to block the regulations, but it is feared it will be passed into law by Brussels later this year. Testing: Up to 200,000 caravans face annual MoT-style tests to see if they are roadworthy under EU plans . Under the new rules almost every caravan will have to undergo safety testing, similar to MoTs for cars. Controversially, all other light trailers under 2000kg will remain excluded from testing and only caravans have been singled out. German MEP Werner Kuhn, a member of the transport committee pushing the reforms, argued that regular checks are needed on caravans which can often be left 'in a barn and used only once a year'. He added: 'Then the chicken feathers are swept away and you do not know if the brakes are still OK, if the lighting works.' But the Caravan Club, which has 375,000 members across the UK, argues that families towing and staying in caravans, often with young children, are more likely to have it serviced regularly to ensure it is safe. A spokesman said: ‘The Caravan Club actively supports and encourages measures designed to improve road safety, but has seen no EU evidence that MOT-style testing on caravans will do so. ‘Caravanning is inherently very safe, with extremely low levels of reported accidents, and the overwhelming majority of accidents which do occur are caused by factors such as poor loading  - causing instability - and driver behaviour, not by factors that would be mitigated by roadworthiness testing.’ End of the road? Campaigners warn the charges could force families to give up a past time which has been popular since the 1960s . The Club warns that M-T-style testing . for caravans could act as a ‘significant financial barrier’ to families . being able to afford to keep a caravan and go on holiday. ‘This . will in turn have a detrimental effect on the UK's tourism economy, and . economy in general, if the number of caravanners reduces as a result of . the cost of caravanning increasing. ‘Club members alone, annually spend £40 million with local businesses, when on their caravanning trips,’ the spokesman added. An earlier EU plan to impose testing . on small trailers including caravans was rejected by government . ministers from governments across the continent at a meeting in December . last year. Criticism: UKIP MEP Derek Clark said the rules were unnecessary . But the testing regulations have been resurrected, and will be debated in the European Parliament this autumn. Transport minister Earl Attlee said: ‘The Government’s intention is to continue to oppose such a measure. ‘We do not yet have a developed assessment of the costs and benefits of this specific measure but we estimate that it could require around 200,000 tests on caravans per year.’ UKIP MEP Derek Clark said: ‘It is the EU again going right over the top with petty rules and regulations. ‘It . is totally unnecessary. Caravanners keep their caravan in good order. 'Caravanners as a whole are very sensible and caring people. They are not . going to risk their holiday, still less their lives with a dodgy . caravan. 'If it is a couple of hundreds pounds, that's the cost of several weekends away.' The plans passed their first stage in the European Parliament on July 2, after British MEPs spoke out against the idea. Tory MEP Jacqueline Foster said: 'There is no evidence to suggest that the inclusion of caravans – a £6billion pound industry in the UK – and light commercial trailers would benefit from a road safety angle. 'We should be encouraging our leisure and tourism industries, not penalising them.' The European Commission refused to comment.","Up to 200,000 families could be hit by costly new tests on caravans .

"Earth's poles are drifting and climate change is to blame, claim scientists. The planet's rotation has always wobbled slightly, and over time this movement has caused the North Pole to shift very slightly over time. But researchers now believe global warming could be drastically increasing this shift. Since 2005, the North Pole has shifted by 1.2 metres in an easterly direction. By using Nasa satellite data, researchers from Texas have discovered that 90 per of this shift has been caused by climate change, including the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, pictured, as well as the melting of mountain glaciers . The Chandler wobble is a wobbling motion that happens as the Earth rotates on its axis. It works in a similar way to how a . spinning top wobbles as it slows down. The effect was discovered by American . astronomer Seth Carlo Chandler in 1891. He found that the poles can 'wander' by approximately 20ft to 30ft over a period of 433 days before . settling. The wobble causes the latitude . position of the geographic poles to change over this 14-month period . and this means star charts have to be updated regularly to reflect new . reference points for the geographic poles. In 2005, the North Pole began to move suddenly in an easterly direction. Using Nasa satellite data, University of Texas researchers found that climate change, and in particular melting ice sheets, was to blame. Using the data, scientists also predicted that as as sea levels continued to rise, the shift would also carry on. Lead researcher Jianli Chen said that ‘ice melting and sea level change can explain 90 per cent of the shift’ and that ‘the driving force for the sudden change is climate change.’ Since 1899, the North Pole has been moving south by an average of 10cm a year along a 70-degree west longitudinal line. Between 1982 and 2005, the pole drifted 6cm a year in a south-easterly direction towards northern Labrador in Canada. In . 2005, this drift abruptly changed and the North Pole began moving to . the east, towards Greenland. Since that time it has shifted position by . around 1.2 metres. Chen . and colleagues studied changes in the Earth’s gravity during this time . period using Nasa’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite images. They were able to work out exactly how Earth’s mass had moved and changed during this time and found it was caused due to the melting of the ice sheets in Greenland and the . Antarctic, which has in turn caused sea levels to rise. Chen’s team hope that the discovery will provide scientists with a new way to measure the extent of ice sheet melting by tracing the movements of the pole. Greenland's ice sheet is said to be melting at a rate of 250 . gigatonnes each year.  Antarctica is losing 180 gigatonnes of ice every . year, and melting mountain glaciers adds a further 194 gigatonnes. These shifts in the Earth’s surface were found to ‘correlate perfectly’ with the changes in the position of the pole. To understand why this sudden change occurred, researchers studied changes in the Earth's gravity using Nasa's GRACE satellite images, pictured. They studied changes in the Earth's mass caused by melting ice sheets and found they 'correlated perfectly' with the changes in the position of the pole . According to previous research, this . shift is also caused by changes in the Earth’s mass that have been occurring . since the last ice age, affected by what’s called the . Chandler wobble. The Chandler wobble is a wobbling motion that happens as the Earth rotates on its axis. It . works in a similar way to how a spinning top wobbles as it slows down, . and this causes the alignment of the Earth’s poles to vary in position . as the planet spins. The . wobble was discovered by American astronomer Seth Carlo Chandler in . 1891 and the poles can 'wander' up to approximately 20ft to 30ft off . course over a period of 433 days, before settling. The . wobble causes the latitude position of the geographic poles to circle . during this 14-month period and this means star charts have to be . updated regularly to reflect new reference points for the geographic . poles. Chen presented the findings at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.","Since 1899, the North Pole has been drifting southwards by 10cm a year .

"A young British holidaymaker was killed by a stray bullet at a New Year’s beach party in a popular Thai tourist destination. City trader Stephen Ashton, 22, was dancing on the sand when he was caught in crossfire following a fight between two groups of Thai men. Despite frantic efforts by his distraught friends and other revellers, he died soon afterwards at a local hospital. Victim: Stephen Ashton, seen posing for a photograph for his Facebook page, was shot in the torso whilst celebrating New Year's Eve in a bar in Thailand . Mr Ashton, who is understood to have been on holiday with five friends, had travelled to one of the top locations on young Britons’ gap year wishlist – Haad Rin beach on Koh Phangan island. The resort has long been famed for its monthly ‘full moon’ parties, as well as its New Year festivities. Hippy travellers have been followed by growing numbers of affluent young  Britons fresh out of school or university, although the Foreign Office warns visitors to take care because of problems with roving criminal gangs. Mr Ashton, who lived with his mother Diane in a £1million house in Purley, Surrey, was simply enjoying the festivities at the Zoom beach bar when tragedy struck. According to local reports, 300 tourists were dancing shortly after 4am on New Year’s Day when two groups of Thai men, each half a dozen strong, began arguing, then fist-fighting. Killed: The 22-year-old was shot by a stray bullet after two Thai men started a fight in the bar on Koh Phangan . Tragic: Stephen Ashton was shot as he danced with friends at the the Zoom Bar on Haad Rin Beach (file photo) As one of the groups fled the bar, one man turned back and fired a gun, leading to panic. One bullet struck Mr Ashton in the torso, causing devastating  injuries. After first aid by partygoers failed, he was sent to the Ban Don hospital nearby, which has only elementary surgical  facilities, and was later pronounced dead. Local police officer Lieutenant Colonel Somsak Noorod said: ‘He was shot in the side while he was dancing on the beach.’ Thai police named their suspect as Ekkapan Kaewkla, 26, and arrested him yesterday afternoon in remote hills in the centre of the island. He is said to have had a home-made gun, which was allegedly the weapon used. Investigation: Thai police speak to holidaymakers about the shooting . Shock: The beach was packed full of people celebrating New Year's Eve when the incident happened . Killed: Mr Ashton was at a New Year party on one of Thailand's most famous islands . He was reported to have admitted being in the fight, but denied firing the fatal shot. Colonel Kittakarn Kramothong, head of the island’s police station, said: ‘Stephen was not involved in the fight. The gun used was home-made.’ Mr Ashton had been staying at the Pink Bungalow complex nearby with his friends. Just a fortnight ago he had posted on Facebook a photograph of himself and two companions in a Thai bar. His father John died suddenly aged around 50 about a year ago. A childhood friend last night told how he had given up work to nurse his father, who suffered a terminal illness. Zak Gorman, 22, said: ‘All I can say is Stephen was a top bloke. 'He was a barrister’s clerk and then started work in the City trading derivatives, but he quit his job to look after his father.’ He had returned to work last year. Mrs Ashton, 48, was on her own New Year holiday abroad and was last night understood to be on her way to formally identify her son’s body in Thailand. Other relatives at the family home yesterday were too upset to discuss their loss. A former neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It is so tragic. It is just Diane and her daughter Emily left now.’ Last night a Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British national in Thailand. We are providing consular assistance to the family.’ Gun crime: A tourist haven and regional base for multinational companies, Thailand has the highest number of guns in civilian hands in Southeast Asia . Haad Rin beach on Koh Phangan island, off the east coast of Thailand, was once a tranquil hippy secret. Over the last three decades, however, it has gained growing fame for its Full Moon parties – which can now take place pretty much any time – with blaring Western dance music. The hedonistic atmosphere of Haad Rin beach is thought to have inspired the hit film The Beach, starring Leonardo Di Caprio and Tilda Swinton, and the original book of the same name by British author Alex Garland. Revellers at a Full Moon party on Haad Rin beach, the destination thought to have inspired The Beach by Alex Garland . Its backpacker hero leaves a resort similar to Haad Rin for a secret island utopia populated by young Western travellers with access to unlimited marijuana. In the real Koh Phangan, there are young tourists experimenting with drugs, but many simply head there for the cheap beer and dance music parties. The Foreign Office has warned of problems at the beach, including sexual assaults, drownings involving swimmers high on drugs and attacks by local gangs.","Stephen Ashton was killed at a party on the island of Koh Phangan .

"Our galaxy - which is around 100,000 light years wide, is thought to have 40 billion planets with potential for life. The figure is an estimate drawn up from our current knowledge 1049 planets orbiting around other stars, with over 2000 more candidates currently awaiting follow-up observations. Of those 1049, we know of a dozen planets around other stars with any possibility to support life as we know it. This infographic by U.S. web comic Randall Munroe shows just over 2,000 potentially habitable planets that scientists estimate could be within 60 light years from Earth. This infographic by U.S. web comic Randall Munroe attempts to represent habitable planets that could be within 60 light years from Earth . The . planets in the image are in the 'habitable' or 'Goldilocks' zone, which . is a belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water . to pool on a planet's surface - and support life. Mr Munroe used existing data to make a visual representation if the size and amount of potentially habitable planets. Earth is placed in the centre of the infographic to provide a sense of scale, and all the planets are organised by approximate size. While it doesn’t provide a sense of distance or position, the xkcd image shows that alien life may not be as far as we might think. Mr Munroe, who is a former Nasa robotocist, created the infographic after news in November that the nearest habitable world is near enough to see with the naked eye. Goldilocks zone is a belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for water to pool on a planet's surface . The hunt is on for planets about the . size of Earth that orbit at just the right distance from their star - in . a region termed the habitable zone. The . habitable zone is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal . for liquid water -- an essential ingredient for life as we know it -- to . pool on a planet's surface. To determine the location of a star's habitable zone, scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits. Knowing precisely how far away a habitable zone needs to be from a star also depends on chemistry. For . example, molecules in a planet's atmosphere will absorb a certain . amount of energy from starlight and radiate the rest back out. How much of this energy is trapped can mean the difference between a turquoise sea and erupting volcanoes. Researcher Andrew Howard said: ‘Potential sites for life to get started are abundant in the galaxy . ‘We still don’t know how easily life can spring forth on a potentially habitable planet but with 40 billion chances, I’m optimistic that we’re not alone.’ The findings, detailed in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, were based on a statistical analysis of observations made by Nasa's now-crippled Kepler space telescope. Scientists used data collected by Nasa’s Kepler telescope, which took photographs of 150,000 stars every 30 minutes for four years. These images were then analysed for . small but regular dips in the star’s light – a telltale sign that a . planet is passing in front of it. Some 42,000 of the stars monitored were like the sun or slightly cooler and these had 603 planets orbiting them. Ten of these were Earth-like, that is, . roughly the size of our planet and just the right distance from their . star for it to be neither too hot or too cold for life to survive. After . accounting for holes in the data, they estimated that 22 per cent of . all sun-like stars are circled by a planet that could be suitable for . life. ‘Our galaxy has 40 billion chances for life to get started and evolve,’ said Dr Howard, of the University of Hawaii. ‘Today, more than ever we need to focus on searching for intelligent life.’ The relative sizes of Kepler habitable zone planets discovered in April are shown (from left to right) Kepler-22b, Kepler-69c, Kepler-62e, Kepler-62f, and Earth .","Planets are all in the habitable zone and shown by relative size to Earth .

"We’ve all done it. It’s the week before that much-needed holiday in the sun, but the last few days of work prove so busy that we don’t get all those little pre-travel jobs ticked off. Including that most crucial of tasks – buying the relevant overseas currency. Wrong hands? A new survey has criticised the poor exchange rates offered by airport vendors . And so we end up using the foreign money booths at the airport – and, according to a new study, pay a heavy price for our failure to plan ahead. Research conducted by the Post Office has underlined the poor exchange rates offered by currency vendors at many UK airports – and the impact this has on consumers, with travellers reportedly wasting £21million each year by buying holiday cash this way. The calculations are based on 1.63million tourists using airport money-changers – rather than high-street operators, which tend to offer better exchange rates. The figures also show that two thirds of people who buy currency at British airports are heading for the Eurozone – and that a sample conversion of £268 into euros leads to a loss of £12.56 when placed against non-airport cash vendors. According to the survey, the euro is the currency on which the most money is wasted. But conversions of sterling into dollars also prove costly, with £1.16million being lost annually on purchases of American money at the airport – around £12 each time. Fewer people buy Australian or Canadian dollars at the airport – but the rate of waste is even higher with these currencies, at £18.64 and £18.43 per transaction respectively. Take care of the cents: £21million is reportedly 'wasted' every year by tourists using UK airport vendors . The survey also names and shames UK airports where vendor exchange rates are especially uncompetitive, with Bristol, Newcastle and Birmingham attracting criticism. ‘We compared rates for ten currencies at 11 UK airports with those available at Post Office branches, and found that tourists buying at the airport would get less foreign cash for their pounds,’ says Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money. ‘Families changing the average value transaction of £268 into euros at the airport face lose almost £13 – enough to buy a snack lunch for four in the Costa del Sol.’","New survey shows the poor rates offered by airport currency exchanges .

"Levels of inequality have reached unprecedented heights in Russia, with more than a third of its wealth concentrated in the hands of just 110 super-rich people, says a new report. Credit Suisse investment bank says wealth has been massively concentrated in the hands of powerful ‘oligarchs’ – among them well-known football tycoons Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea, and Alisher Usmanov, a major shareholder at Arsenal. And they nearly all owe their wealth to President Vladimir Putin, who has allowed trusted businessmen to gain exclusive rights to the nation’s vast natural reserves. Russia's richest men: (Clockwise from top left) Alisher Usmanov, Mikhail Fridman, Vicktor Vekselberg, Andrey Melnichenko, Mikhail Prokharov, Leonid Mikhelson, Gennady Timchenko, Vladimir Lisin, Vladimir Potanin and Vagit Alekperov . In Soviet times, the Communist credo was that everyone was equal – though the reality was different – but now the contrast could hardly be starker. Russia has a population of 143.5 million generating total household wealth of £750billion, but £263billion of that is owned by just 110 people. ‘Russia has the highest level of wealth inequality in the world, apart from small Caribbean nations with resident billionaires,’ said Credit Suisse. Its report said the discrepancy was a ‘parody’ of the hopes for a prosperous egalitarian society that some held for Russia following the Soviet Union’s collapse. And the gulf is expected to grow. Russia currently has 84,000 dollar millionaires, a figure forecast to rise to 133,000 by 2018 – a faster rate than Europe or America. Most of the ‘Reds-to-Riches’ dollar billionaires made their fortunes by buying up highly prized state assets of the old USSR, or through securing lucrative contracts awarded by the Kremlin for which the closest political connections are deemed necessary. Russia's richest man, Alisher Usmanov, controls USM Holdings, a British Virgin Islands-based entity with holdings in mining, technology and telecommunications. He also co-owns Arsenal football club . After a decade of chaos under Boris Yeltsin in the Nineties, Mr Putin set about tapping Russia’s vast natural wealth in order to rebuild a country battered by the transition from Communism to rampant capitalism. With loyal businessmen commanding the economy, a high oil price and Europe’s need for energy aided him in stoking a remarkable recovery. Mr Abramovich is seen by many as the figurehead of this Russian elite, many of whom have London bases and are synonymous with trophy wives, palatial homes, fleets of luxury cars and ocean-going armadas. But the Chelsea owner ranks only 13th in Credit Suisse’s analysis, which is based on the latest Forbes list for Russia. It is headed by mining magnate Mr Usmanov, who is said to be worth £11billion and owns Sutton Place in Surrey, a Tudor mansion once the home of J Paul Getty. Number nine on the list is Gennady Timchenko, who is seen as a personal friend of Putin. The enormous influence of the president is also demonstrated in the fortunes of those who have fallen out of favour. Manufacturing and banking mogul Boris Berezovsky was thought to have been the first post-Soviet billionaire and Mr Putin’s ‘kingmaker’, but they fell out and he moved into exile in London. He died in March after apparently taking his own life at his ex-wife’s home in Ascot, his wealth having fallen substantially. Another early billionaire, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, lost the bulk of his fortune after he was jailed on ‘political’ grounds after financing opposition parties in Russia. Russia now has one billionaire for every £6.9billion in household wealth. In the rest of the world, there is one for every £107billion.

"Manchester United defender Jonny Evans is adamant Louis Van Gaal's Old Trafford revolution will soon see his side back at their entertaining best. Van Gaal's tactics have come under fire from some United fans who are keen to see him revert back to the tried-and-tested 4-4-2 formation. And United midfielder Adnan Januzaj admitted this week that Van Gaal's system often made it 'more difficult for me to play'. Jonny Evans believes the Manchester United first team will soon be at their entertaining best . Louis van Gaal's side are now the highest ranked team left in the FA Cup . But Van Gaal's resolute defence of his methods is starting to pay dividends, with the club up to third in the Premier League and FA Cup favourites after Wednesday night's fourth-round replay win over Cambridge. Evans said: 'I think when you get as many attacking players on the pitch as we've got you are always going to entertain. 'But the manager has done a lot of work in trying to steady the team and making sure everyone knows their jobs. Once we get that nailed on, and everyone knows their defensive jobs, then I think we'll be able to push on from that and be really entertaining again. 'You can look at the formation changes and the personnel changes as well, plus the fact that there's a lot of players who haven't played together before, and he [the manager] is doing fantastically well in getting us organised. And as players we're really benefiting from that.' United midfielder Adnan Januzaj admitted this week that Van Gaal's system often made it 'more difficult for me to play' Evans, who made his United debut in 2007, insists it is inevitable the squad will take time to fully adapt to Van Gaal's methods following the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson and the tumult of David Moyes' brief and unsuccessful regime. 'I think the lads have taken a lot on board,' added Evans. 'At times it has been tough and it takes time. We've been used to playing a certain way for a number of years, then the change happens and he wants us to play a certain way. 'So it does take time for those things to become second nature. But I think you are starting to see that now.' Shock defeats for Chelsea and Manchester City have left United as the highest-ranked team left in the FA Cup .

United may have limped past lowly Cambridge at the second attempt but Evans thinks it could spell the start of the club's first FA Cup triumph since 2004. Shock defeats for Chelsea and Manchester City have left United as the highest-ranked team left in the competition, giving Van Gaal a superb chance of capping his first season in charge with a major trophy. Evans said: 'Our record in the FA Cup hasn't been good over the last few years. 'It's an old cliche that you want to win everything but it is such a historic trophy, especially for Manchester United, and the fact that the league is still not gone but not looking likely, the FA Cup looks our best chance of a trophy, especially considering some of the teams that have gone out. 'We're the highest ranked team left in the competition now. It was a bit of a shock sitting at home hearing the news that Chelsea and City had gone out. But we know from our own experiences all about upsets.'","Jonny Evans believes Manchester United are starting to click under Louis van Gaal .

"Jeremy Clarkson has suggested that racism might solve lengthy queues at Heathrow . Jeremy Clarkson sparked controversy by suggesting that long queues at airport control could be solved by 'a bit of racism'. The BBC Top Gear presenter said that delays were caused because immigration officials could no longer use their discretion to wave certain passengers through. 'Nobody is waved through any more. Immigration officials are not allowed to use their discretion,' he said. 'Common sense has been erased from the system. And the result is plain for all to see. There's a two-hour wait. And come the Olympics they're saying that time frame will double. 'Net result: Immigration officials have to assume that the nice family of four coming back from their holiday in Sardinia is going to cheat the social out of millions then blow up during the 100 metres final.' Clarkson then went on to say there is a possible solution to the problem. 'Nobody likes a racist. Nobody likes prejudice. It has no place at work, at play or on the terraces of a football stadium. It has no place at school, or in government. 'But at Heathrow airport? Hmmm.' However, a spokesman for the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents Border Force workers, said: 'Clarkson is an idiot.' Meanwhile, some Twitter users took to the social networking site to express their views. David Vance, editor of A Tangled Web, said: 'Jeremy Clarkson does not ""risk outrage"". He courts it.' While others called for the presenter to finally be sacked from the BBC. User Waqar Ahmed said: 'The BBC should sack Clarkson just too many slip ups from a nasty piece of work!!' (sic). But some said they agreed with his views. A woman known only as Alice said: 'Jeremy clarkson (sic) has summed up what will go wrong this summer. GO JEREMY! He is brilliant.' Clarkson used his weekly column in The Sun to highlight the problem of long waits for those coming through border control at Heathrow airport. He said that since security checks were tightened by Home Secretary Theresa May, officials have been prevented from only targeting those deemed 'high risk'. Clarkson, who is no stranger to . controversy and has become known for his provocative comments, hit the . headlines in December after he suggested that striking public sector . workers should be shot in front of their families. The gaffe came when he appeared on the BBC's The One Show during Britain's biggest public sector strike for the past 30 years. For years border officials feebly admitted thousands of people with tenuous claims to be refugees . Clarkson has said that immigration officials are not allowed to use common sense at airports . The BBC was also forced to apologise about an item on BBC2's Top Gear which led to the Mexican ambassador complaining about the 'outrageous, vulgar and inexcusable insults' made about Mexicans by Clarkson and his co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond. In February 2009 Clarkson famously insulted then-prime minister Gordon Brown by calling him a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' - a reference to the fact he is blind in one eye. The previous year the BBC also received nearly 2,000 complaints when Clarkson joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes. Controversial: Jeremy Clarkson calls form striking public sector workers to be shot on BBC 1's The One Show . Reaction: Presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones react to the remarks .",Lack of discretion by officials angers BBC presenter who says 'nice family returning from Sardinia' should be waved through immigration controls .
"A woman who was nearly paralysed in a freak horse riding accident has made an incredible recovery to become a weight lifting champion. Georgina Hodson, 27, was warned she may never walk again after she suffered a head on collision with a tree while riding her horse. Mrs Hodson, from Market Drayton, in Shropshire, was lucky not to have damaged her spine in the accident. Scroll down for video . Georgina Hodson (pictured with her husband, David, at a weight lifting competition) made a miraculous recovery from a horse riding accident to become a weight lifter . She said: ‘I had a freak accident and there was a very real chance I had seriously damaged my vertebra - the doctors thought I may have been paralysed. ‘I had to have 75 stitches in my forehead and my nose had been smashed off my face.’ As part of her slow recovery from the accident in 2007, Mrs Hodson - who is just 5ft 2ins - began doing gentle exercises in the gym and then slowly progressed onto weights to build up her strength. She said: ‘I'm not only physically strong, I have an emotional strength which has driven me forward and has helped me through my recovery. ‘At school I had always been picked on for being little- I used to get called ""squirt"" because I am so small, but when I started power lifting and training I felt empowered and I realised I can be strong.’ Mrs Hodson started power lifting properly this year and has just broken a British record by lifting 11st, despite only weighing 7st 7lbs herself. Mrs Hodson is only 5ft 2ins tall and weighs just 7st 7lbs but she has just broken a British record by lifting 11st . Mrs Hodson broke her nose and cracked her head open when she crashed into a tree while riding her horse. She also damaged several vertebrae and doctors initially feared she might be paralysed . She said: ‘I actually managed to do something that no other woman in my weight class in Britain has done before. ‘I managed a 67.5kg squat, but I then decided I would try and break my own record and managed to lift 70kg.’ Mrs Hodson trains hard with her personal trainer husband, David, but also finds time to pamper herself. After her accident, Mrs Hodson started going to the gym to rebuild her strength and as she recovered she started to try weight lifting . Mrs Hodson, who was bullied at school because of her height, said: ‘I'm not only physically strong, I . have an emotional strength which has driven me forward and has helped . me through my recovery' Mrs Hodson says she is proof that women can be weight lifters without losing their femininity . She said: ‘The human body is an incredible thing and I am very pleased to still consider myself very feminine despite being stronger than some men. ‘Women shouldn't think they can't be strong or if they use weights they will look manly or bulky - that is simply not the case. ‘I am proof that you can be feminine and strong at the same time.’ The psychologist now has her sights set on competing at next year's power lifting world championships in Canada. Mrs Hodson (pictured taking part in a weight lifting competition) is married to a personal trainer and he helps her prepare for competitions . Mrs Hodson (pictured as a child) said: 'When I compete it is just me against the weight and that is what I like. There is no hiding' She said: ‘When I compete it is just me against the weight and that is what I like. There is no hiding.’ Her husband and trainer, David Hodson, said: ‘When I first met Georgie I could not believe someone could be so brave and graceful in the face of what she has had to go through. ‘She started out with only a small part of the physical strength she has now but she always had a tremendous amount of emotional strength which has pushed her forward.’ Mrs Hodson added: ‘After the accident I was in a really bad way, but since I have starting building up my strength I have never felt so empowered and positive.’","Georgina Hodson, 27, crashed into a tree while riding her horse in 2007 .

"A two-year-old boy who suffers with a severe facial deformity and may never learn to walk or talk has baffled doctors with his undiagnosable condition. Despite suffering with a number of distinct symptoms, medical experts are unable to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with Aidan Jackoviak Smith. His mother, Vikki, 40, says that specialists are now forced to work out what is wrong with him by a process of elimination as test after test comes back negative. Scroll down for video . Parents Vikki and Karl Smith had no idea that there was anything wrong with son Aidan when he was born eight weeks prematurely on Boxing day 2010. But they soon discovered he had been born with a grown and after three weeks he began fitting . ‘At first they thought it was Proteus Syndrome, but after a biopsy six months ago, the results came back negative,’ Vikki told ITV’s This Morning. ‘But now they think it might be CLOVES syndrome.’ Proteus Syndrome is a genetic condition that John Merrick, the Elephant Man, suffered from. CLOVES Syndrome is also a genetic condition and causes blood vessel, skin and spinal abnormalities. Aidan was born eight weeks prematurely weighing 4lb 10oz on Boxing day 2010 after an uneventful pregnancy. He was immediately whisked away by nurses at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary because he was premature. Vikki and husband Karl, 35, had no idea that their newborn son was in fact very ill with a rare condition. Aidan had been born with a growth on his face, back and leg and three weeks later he started to experience seizures with alarming regularity. Doctor then broke the news that he had suffered brain damage. Karl said the enormity of the his son's situation hit him when doctors told him Aidan was brain damaged and may never learn to walk or talk . When Daniel, 13, (right) was asked what it was like to have a brother like Aidan, he said: 'It's just the same to have him as a brother. I look past what he looks like. He's my brother' ‘That’s when it hit home,’ said . father Karl. ‘The enormity of it hit me when the words ‘brain . damage’ were mentioned. 'We realised he might never walk or talk and were . worried he would never recognise us. It’s just terrifying.’ The parents, who also have a son . called Daniel from Vikki's previous marriage, were also overwhelmed when doctors . gave them CPR lessons in case Aidan stopped breathing. ‘You suddenly realise the responsibility of the little life you are looking after,’ explained Karl. Doctors are unable to work out what is wrong with Aidan and are hoping to diagnose him by a process of elimination. At one point they thought he suffered with Proteus syndrome, a genetic condition that John Merrick, the Elephant Man, suffered from. But tests came back negative.Now they believe he may suffer with CLOVES Syndrome. There are only 130 people in the world known to have the condition. CLOVES stands for for Congenital Lipomatous Overgrowth Vascular Malformations Epidermal Nevis Spinal/Skeletal Anomalies/Scoliosis. It was discovered in 2006 by Boston doctor Ahmad Alomari. Dr Alomari reviewed decades of data and photos of children who had been given different diagnoses for a specific combination of symptoms. Although the cases were rare, he noticed a definite pattern when comparing them. In 2009, Dr Alomari published a paper describing his findings which established CLOVES syndrome as a recognised disease. There is currently no test for the condition and doctors must rely on recognising the symptoms to make a diagnosis. Symptoms include skin, limb, torso and spinal abnormalities such as like fatty masses or scoliosis (spinal deformity). There can also be vascular (blood vessel) abnormalities such as a birthmark too. It is not entirely clear what causes CLOVES syndrome but experts have discovered that up to 60 per cent of cells in patients' affected tissues contain mutations in a gene called PIK3CA. There is no known cure for CLOVES but many of the associated problems can be managed or prevented successfully with the right medical and surgical care. Council housing finance officer Vikki, 40, admitted she never wanted a mentally and physically disabled child. ‘I always thought I was a bit superficial, I knew some people could cope with a disabled baby, I just never thought I was one of them,' she told the Mirror. ‘But thanks to Aidan I’ve discovered I can because he gives me so much love and I know he loves his family to bits,’ For Aidan’s parents now, the biggest worry is the unknown – not being able to put a name to his condition. ‘You wake up and try to work out if there is something different [in his symptoms]. But he’s proved to us he’s a fighter,’ added Karl. The family remain positive, especially as their fear that Aidan would never recognise them has not been realised. Vikki said that Aidan recognises exactly who they are and that his face lights up when he sees his parents after a day at school. Aidan's parents said they were worried he would be so brain damaged that he would never recognise them. But thankfully, their fears haven't been realised and his face lights up when he sees them. He also laughs and blows kisses to them . ‘He blows kisses, laughs and giggles,’ she said. 'We hope that once day he will walk and talk.’ Aidan . is due to undergo facial surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital in August this year. Later in the interview, half-brother Daniel, 13, is asked how it feels to have a little brother like . Aidan. He responded: 'It’s just the same to have him as a brother. I . look past what he looks like. He’s my brother.’ Vikki and Karl also explained how ignorant . members of the public can be when they see Aidan for the first time. Karl recalled one incident at the British Museum when a person came up very close to Aidan to look at his face. Karl then pointed out the the inquisitive man that the 'artifacts were on the wall and not in the pushchair.' But Karl added that he doesn’t want . to come across as 'bitter and twisted' and said that he does his best to . try and ignore insensitive onlookers. The family remains upbeat despite the emotional and financial strain that Aidan's illness puts on the family. They say that Aidan's arrival has been difficult but it has also been a blessing . The . parents said in a previous interview that Aidan’s condition has not just been an emotional drain but have provided financial . problems too. Karl was forced to give up his job as a salesman . to become Aidan's full-time carer and Vikki has taken a 20 per cent pay cut to . her £25,000 wage after switching from full-time to a four-day week to . help with Aidan.She also fears she may be made redundant. Aidan still needs nappies and has to be fed baby food, which push up the family’s living costs. The couple are £10,000 in debt on their credit card and Vikki said without a definitive diagnosis they cannot approach the right charity for help or even set up an internet JustGiving page. Vikki added that because they don't know if Aidan will ever walk, their house may be unsuitable for them once he’s too heavy for them to carry him upstairs to bed. 'If I lose my job we will lose this house. If we knew what Aidan’s problems are I’d at least feel there was some progress. But I do know that I love my son and just want to do whatever I can to give him the best possible life.'","Aidan Jackoviak Smith was born prematurely with a growth on his face and at 3-weeks-old he started to suffer regular fits that left him brain damaged .

"A shoplifter from Florida  collected over $1 million  in merchandise and after serving two years in jail he's now free to unremorsefully unwrap the secrets of his trade. Michael Pollara, 46, would go to Toys R' us, pharmaceutical stores, department stores, and shopping mall specialty stores and stuff merchandise into bigger product boxes along with his mother who served as his accomplice. ABC reports that Pollara also managed to travel to 25 countries, though he claims he's used 'travel points' to surface the globe rather than stolen goods. Secrets of the trade: Michael Pollara's signature shoplifting move is to take a box and empty the contents and then fill it up with expensive items . Team Pollara: Pollara would go to Toys R' us, pharmaceutical stores, department stores, and shopping mall specialty stores with his mother as his accomplice . Pollara admitted to taking the loot to criminals who traffic stolen goods called 'fences' and also sold items on eBay. 'There’s only five methods,' he said of shoplifting as he rocked back and forth in his seat. 'Either it’s on you, either, if you’re a female, it’s in the purse, either it’s in a bag or it’s in a shopping cart or it’s in a box.' Pollara's signature shoplifting was to take a box and empty the contents and then fill it up with expensive items. He'd then purchase the box, sometimes after buying a wet bottle of water, and put the box in the bag while the cashier was wiping his or her hands. Pollara's mistake was using the same customer cards when he went shoplifting and that lead to Toys R' us building a case against him. The loot: Merchandise stolen by Michael Pollara and displayed by Broward Sheriffs Office's Facebook . The method: Pollara explains how he would stuff expensive items in inexpensive toy boxes then buy the toy with the several stolen items inside . Sgt. Rich Rossman of the Broward County Sheriff’s Office followed Pollara on a shoplifting spree in August 2012 that spanned over more than 20 Florida stores. 'He was up bright and early and stole from dawn to the evening hours,' Rossman said. 'I had to call the wife and say, ‘I don’t know when I’m coming home.' After his 2012 arrest he served about two years in jail and confessed to stealing 'a whole store full' of goods from Toys R' US in an 11-year period . 'My nickname in jail-- everyone has a jail name, I mean, they don’t call you ‘Michael.’ So you could assume what my nickname was. I was ‘Toys “R” Us,’' Pollara said. Pollara's mother was not jailed but was put on probation. Pollara is happy he's free but won’t say where, especially what stores, he spends his time in. “I can’t tell those because, you don’t know, I might be in those,' he said with a sly smirk. Confessing: After being arrested in 2012 by Police Pollara confessed to being a serial shoplifter and looting stores in all 50 states in America . Still by his side: Pollara's mother helped him steal goods from stores for 11 years all over the country .","Michael Pollara, 46, has elegantly collected over $1 million dollars in merchandise along with his mother as a sidekick .

"The £4billion battle for live TV coverage of the Premier League is set to be a three-way contest. The dominance of Sky and BT Sport is likely to be challenged by Eurosport owners Discovery Communications when bidding for 2016-19 closes on Friday. The fierce competition for the 168 live games per season, which are split into seven packages, could set the price for a single match at an amazing £8million. There will also be an increase on the current £2bn for overseas deals, plus the £204m agreed with the BBC for Match of the Day. Sky are expected to pour all their resources into retaining at least four of their prime first-pick packages and BT will want an increase on their current deal which gives them 38 live games per season. Qatar-based beIN Sport, the richest TV network in the world, could also make a bid. Vincent Kompany holds aloft the trophy after winning the 2014 Premier League with Manchester City . Sky has dominated the showing of live games since the inception of the Premier League in 1992 . Who will be bidding in the auction for domestic live rights to the Premier League? Sky and BT, who currently share coverage, will both be involved again. They paid £3.018billion between them for the 2013-16 rights. That is expected to rise for 2016-19, and potentially soar to £4bn if other serious bidders enter the auction, such as US-based giant Discovery Communications and Qatar-owned beIN Sports. Will Sky lose matches this time? It’s feasible. Under the current deals, Sky have 116 live games per season, and BT have the other 38 games, for a total of 154 live games per season, which were sold in seven packages. The auction for 2016-19 also has seven packages for sale but more games overall. Five packages have 28 games per season and two packages have 14 games. About a dozen of the extra games will be shown on Friday nights. Sky have brought Arsenal legend Thierry Henry (right) into their star studded line-up of pundits . Former Liverpool stars Steve McManaman and Michael Owen (left) are part of BT Sport's team . Potential rival beIN Sports have already recruited former Sky presenters Andy Gray (left) and Richard Keys . Any one broadcaster will be allowed a maximum of 126 games per season — or four ‘big’ packages plus one ‘small’ package. That’s what Sky currently has and will want to keep. They will almost certainly be willing to pay more than the £2.28bn over three years they paid last time. But will another major player splash the cash and reduce what Sky have? BT have deep pockets. They spent £897m on Champions League and Europa League live rights for three seasons starting 2015-16. They won’t want less than the 38 PL games they have now and can be expected to bid strongly. The real unknown is whether Discovery and beIN Sports will come in with blockbuster bids. That could blow the market open and send prices soaring, again. Who are Discovery Communications and what personalities might we see on our TVs if a new bidder wins the rights to Premier League matches? Discovery are a US-based global media company that started in the 1980s with one documentary channel. They are now extremely wealthy and own a majority stake in Eurosport. Their chief executive was reportedly in London last month to meet Premier League officials for talks about a bid for UK rights. If Discovery win the rights to some matches the assumption is they would show them on British Eurosport, which has never televised live Premier League games. They would try to hire or poach established names, possibly from Sky or BT if those two lose games. beIN Sports already have former Sky frontmen Richard Keys and Andy Gray working for them in Qatar. BT Sport are expected to increase their share of 38 live games to see players like Alexis Sanchez in action . Premier League clubs like leaders Chelsea will get even richer following the new TV deal . Why is there such fierce competition for Premier League games? A generation ago virtually nobody in Britain paid to watch TV over and above their licence fee. Now around 60 per cent of households (or 16m homes) pay for a subscription whether Sky, Virgin or BT. Increasingly, the battle between these communications giants is for the ‘triple play’ market (phone, internet and TV from one source) and the ‘quad play’ market (which adds mobile phones). They want you to get all your services from them. Live Premier League matches are being used in an attempt to influence your choice. With millions of people paying £600-plus a year for these services, it’s a massive industry. Will Premier League football cost me more from 2016-17? Will I need more subscriptions? It’s feasible that Sky and BT will share the rights again in broadly the same way they do now, and fans won’t notice any difference to pricing. But if a third or even fourth broadcaster gets involved more subscriptions will be needed, almost certainly at extra cost. Although if Sky lose a lot of games they may have to reduce prices to keep customers. If another broadcaster enters the arena, TV fans may find they have to pay for another subscription . Manchester United will get a large share of the expected £7bn pot created by selling broadasting rights . Will the clubs get richer? Oh yes. The total broadcasting pot for the 2013-16 period was more than £5.5bn, mostly from domestic live rights (£3.018bn) and foreign rights (£2.23bn) with highlights, near-live rights and mobile rights on top. The 2016-19 total pot is expected to be close to £7bn with £4bn from domestic rights. The vast bulk of the cash will end up being split among the Premier League clubs. Premier League fans are not expected to see a reduction in ticket prices following the sale . Will ticket prices go down? You’re having a laugh, aren’t you? Almost certainly not and not by much in any case. Many Premier League games are sold out or nearly sold out, even though ticket prices are the most expensive in the world. While the demand is there, clubs will charge what they can. The only rider to that is that the Premier League hierarchy would like to see clubs offer more cheap deals, particularly to away fans and younger people. It remains possible that an increase in TV money will allow more subsidies for schemes like this... but don’t bank on it.","Broadcasters will bid for TV rights of Premier League matches on Friday .
The £3.01bn for 2013-16 rights paid by Sky and BT is expected to rise .

"According to the most recent NHS statistics, almost two thirds of British people are now overweight or obese and as a result, demand for gastric bypass surgery has shot up. But surgery doesn't always provide the hoped-for outcome and as Sarah, the 25-year-old star of Channel 4 documentary, My Baggy Body, knows only too well, it can create problems of its own. Sarah, and co-stars Gregg and Pauline, all suffer from the same embarrassing affliction - rolls of over-stretched empty skin that's failed to snap back and has left them feeling ashamed of their bodies. Miserable: Sarah, 25, was left with mounds of excess skin after losing 9st following a gastric bvpass . It's all the more galling for Gregg, 30, a school dinner chef, because unlike the other two, his dramatic 12st weight loss was the result of sheer hard work. 'It was my fault,' he says of his morbidly obese former frame. 'I can't walk past a fridge without going in it. 'If I'd got a gastric band, I wouldn't have learned anything. It feels like cheating. It took a lot of hard, hard graft [to slim down]. 'I was waking up to go swimming and do a mile in the pool, going to work and then going to the gym at night.' Three years after he first joined Weight Watchers and hit the gym, Gregg finally achieved the healthy weight he'd been hoping for but says he's been unable to move on with his life because of the huge amount of baggy skin he was left with. Ruined: Gregg says that his rolls of excess skin have hindered him in his quest for true love . Risk: Although gastric bands will reduce bodyweight, they can also leave baggy skin behind . Surgery: Gregg has since had his baggy skin removed after taking a second job and saving up . 'In my head, it was get slim, get a girlfriend, settle down - all the things normal people have,' he explains. But the excess skin has proved a hindrance - and he blames it for the end of his last relationship, a six week fling that collapsed after he plucked up the courage to show her his baggy body. 'That's the only thing I can think of,' he adds. 'It's the body that put her off.' Sarah, who lost nine stone after having gastric bypass surgery, tells a similar story and confesses to being reluctant to marry her fiance Ed while encumbered with pounds of excess skin. 'I still feel fat and that's because I have tyres, that are not tyres of fat anymore, but tyres of skin,' she explains. She adds: 'I've got a gorgeous family, I've got Ed, I've got my daughter Erin... The only thing that's not beautiful is me.' To get rid of it, both Gregg and Sarah applied for NHS-funded surgery. But with only one in 10 requests accepted, both were denied - in Sarah's case because she still needs to lose another two stone to be eligible. Although Sarah has opted for therapy in a bid to come to terms with her extra skin, Gregg has chosen a different route. After being denied surgery on the NHS, he took a second job at a local Conservative Club and tackled a sponsored assault course and 12 mile run in a bid to raise £8,000 for a full body lift. 'All parents don't want their kids to . suffer, they want them to be happy, healthy,' explains Gregg's father Simon. 'We're the same with ours.' Gruesome: Pauline, who used to have a 2st 4lb lump of skin named 'Fred' also appears on the documentary . Seven weeks after surgery, Gregg is healed and ready to start his search for love. 'All my negative thoughts about my body are going,' he explains. 'I'm looking forward to going out and meeting people, ladies in particular! He adds: 'Everyone fears rejection - no one likes getting shot down - but I've given everything to give me and my body a chance.'

"A mother-of-two lost more than eight stone after she got stuck in a restaurant chair at Disneyland Paris. At the time of the  incident Kathy Levick, 39, weighed nearly 20st and was languishing on a four-year waiting list for a gastric band operation. The humiliation of getting stuck in a booth during a family holiday gave her the prompt to forgo the long wait and begin losing the pounds naturally. Changing shape: Kathy Levick, 39, a mother-of-two lost more than eight stone after she got stuck in a restaurant chair during a family holiday to Disneyland Paris. She weighed nearly 20st and is now 11st 4lbs . Mrs Levick, a daycare personal assistant, said: 'Getting wedged into the seat was horrible. 'Looking around the restaurant I realised I was much larger than everybody else - it was the wake-up call I needed to show me I had to change, and fast.' Mrs Levick, who has a son, David, 20, and a daughter, Faoileann, 10, struggled with weight gain since childhood. After having children she joined various slimming clubs but the weight kept piling on instead of coming off. She was later diagnosed with an under-active thyroid. 'I blamed the weight gain on my under-active thyroid - I thought I couldn't do anything about it. 'I knew I was overweight but it isn't until you stop and think properly that you see how much you have let yourself go.' At her heaviest weight Mrs Levick found walking short distances difficult as her knees would ache and she would become breathless easily. Achievement: Kathy Levick posing after her weight loss with Fiona Gratzer the CEO of Unislim and TV presenter Sile Seoige . Low point: Once the family got to the Paris theme park they headed to an American-style diner for lunch, where she tried to squeeze into a fixed booth seat and got stuck - it was the wake up call she needed . Problematic: At her heaviest weight Mrs Levick found walking short distances difficult as her knees would ache and she would become breathless easily; she quickly realised she needed to shift the pounds . She approached her local GP in 2007 for help, explaining that she had dieted and failed and felt her weight had reached a crisis point. She said: 'I was struggling to do simple everyday tasks like looking after my two children and working full time.' Her weight problems became apparent during a family holiday to Disneyland in 2008. She said: 'While I was on the plane I found I couldn't fix my seatbelt - I was humiliated as I had to ask for an extension belt. 'I was so large in the seat I couldn’t even put my food tray down. I had to eat off my daughter’s tray instead of my own.' Once the family got to the Paris theme park they headed to an American-style diner for lunch, where she tried to squeeze into a fixed booth seat. After eating her meal she found she was stuck. Journey: She began to exercise more regularly, starting with ten minutes walks. Soon she could walk for half an hour at a time and before long she was walking full laps of her hometown and losing pounds . She said: 'When I tried to get up I found that I was wedged into the seat. I eventually managed to ease myself out and we went to one the other non-fixed seats, but it was horrible. 'Even the turnstiles at the rides proved to be a problem. I couldn’t fit through the spaces everyone was walking through. I couldn’t participate in the way I wanted to. 'I was worried about getting on some of the rides. I didn’t want to get stuck and I was worried about being too heavy for them. 'It made me desperately sad. The trip made me worry about my own health. I began to worry that my weight could kill me. I realised that I had let things go too far.' Mrs Levick, who had joined slimming club Unislim shortly before heading out on her holiday, redoubled her efforts to eat healthily and exercise. She said: 'I cut out all the rubbish foods and switched over to wholegrain options. My leader Anne Dixon helped a lot.' She began to exercise more regularly, starting with ten minutes walks. Soon she could walk for half an hour at a time and before long she was walking full laps of her hometown of Arklow in County Wicklow, Ireland. She said: 'After I lost the first four stone I was able to start aerobics too, which I never would have been able to do at my heaviest.' In 2012 Mrs Levick finally received her appointment letter to speak to a consultant about a gastric band, but by this point she had already lost eight stone. She said: 'I told them, ""thanks but no thanks"". I knew I could do it on my own. It was a great moment for me.' Now Mrs Levick weighs 11st 4lbs and her family and children have seen a major difference in her personality. She said: 'They see I’m more outgoing now because I can do a lot more. I’m able to walk everywhere. My son thinks it’s great.' Before beginning her weight loss, she typically ate a large all-day breakfast sandwich for breakfast, then a steak and kidney pie for lunch. For dinner she would often eat oven chips and chicken and would snack on chocolate bars throughout the day. Today, she typically eats a porridge with blueberries for her breakfast. For lunch she will have a ham salad sandwich with more fruit. For dinner she now goes for the healthy option of fish with boiled vegetables in smaller portions. If she wants to snack, she will have an orange or banana. She said: 'If I had to wait for the gastric band for four years I think I would have been heavier now, instead of in great shape. 'I’m happy I had that experience at Disneyland now, as that as well as healthy eating and exercise has helped me lose all this weight and my life is so much better. 'If I went to Disneyland now I would be able to have a much better time, that’s for sure.'","Kathy Levick, 39, weighed nearly 20st .

"Violence erupted last night after thousands of airline passengers faced hours of chaos because of a glitch in a central immigration computer. Travellers were told to expect delays of up to four hours as border staff struggled to cope with growing queues in arrival halls at every British airport. There were reports of fights breaking out at Gatwick as passengers took to Twitter to vent their frustration about queues stretching ‘for miles’. Huge queues of travellers jam into a Heathrow arrivals hall after a UK Border Agency IT glitch caused chaos at airports across the country . Furious travellers last night described the scenes as ‘a disgrace and a national embarrassment’, with many complaining about a lack of information. One passenger at Gatwick reported that passengers were turning violent. Kay Perry tweeted: ‘Gatwick airport chaos. Fights break out among passengers as queues reach for miles.’ Another posting mocked the airport, saying: ‘Well done Heathrow airport. I’ve spent longer in this immigration queue than in the air.’ Frustrated passenger David Logue questioned Gatwick Airport on Twitter, but his comments went unanswered. He said: ‘MASSIVE queues to get through arrivals. What on earth is going wrong? Need to be quicker if you want to compete with LHR’ [London Heathrow]. He added: ‘There must be over 500  people in this ‘pen’ alone but I’m not allowed to photograph. ‘Hundreds of people stuck in the heat. Get water!’ Hundreds of people snake their way through Gatwick's border control today following the IT glitch which caused delays of up to four hours and affected every British airport . One businesswoman who arrived into London . City airport said that on top of massive queues, travellers were made . to stand on the runway when a fire alarm went off. Passenger Simon Coleman who flew into Luton Airport from Barcelona on easyJet described the scene at the airport as 'organised chaos' . He told BBC Radio 5 Live that he had spent two hours getting through immigration and that fighting had broken out among frustrated passengers. Luton airport later later confirmed that police had been called to deal with 'scuffles ' in the immigration hall but that no arrests had been made. Mr Coleman described scenes as 'chaotic' and said that pregnant mothers were in clear distress. He said easyjet had texted them about problems, but only after they were experiencing them. Passengers said immigration staff were manually typing in names and dates of birth because they were unable to scan them. Non-EU travellers were hardest hit, with international arrivals queues snaking around airport terminals. The computer glitch is the latest humiliation for the Home Office’s beleaguered UK Border Force – and the biggest disaster since the widespread queue chaos before the 2012 Olympics. Problems began mid-afternoon with waiting times at Heathrow immigration quickly growing to an hour, according to officials. Airport staff handed out water to stranded passengers. Heathrow posted on its Twitter feed: ‘A nationwide UK Border Force IT issue is creating delays for arriving Non-EU passengers. Extra staff are on hand.’ The airport said the worst affected area was Terminal 3 and 4 – which are used by carriers including Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines, Qantas and Air India. British Airways, in Terminal 5, said it was liaising with the Border Force to ‘minimise disruption’. Britain’s largest airport said extra staff were drafted in to try and reduce the queues. Passengers there also reported problems at passport control desks, mostly affecting those trying to enter  the country. A BA spokesman said: ‘This is clearly an issue beyond our control and affecting all airlines, but we are doing everything we can to protect our customers. 'Obviously we want to sort the issue out but not risk the integrity of the border controls.’ At Gatwick, Chris Hyland, a  32-year-old company director from Islington, north London, said  international passengers had been told to expect a wait of up to  four hours. He said: ‘We landed from Geneva at 5.20pm but it took until 6.40pm for us to get through passport  control. It’s an absolute nightmare. We’ve been told there is an IT  failure but that’s it.’ He added: ‘You would have thought there would be a back-up plan.’ Mr Hyland said non-EU passengers are preparing for a long wait to officially enter the country. He said: ‘It is very frustrating. Nobody is really saying anything. The international queue is pretty huge, so people have already started sitting down because they know they will be there for a long, long time.’ A Gatwick spokesman said: ‘We are experiencing similar [problems] to the rest of the airports, and we are working to get people through. 'People should be able to get off the plane, it is those coming through the immigration process which it is frustrating.’ The spokesman said there should not be any delays to flights leaving UK airports. Birmingham Airport said problems appeared to be ‘getting  progressively worse’. Staff at Gatwick were tried to calm passengers down by handing out water in the queue . Frustrated passengers described how some desks were unmanned. Problems began mid-afternoon with waiting times at immigration increasing throughout the day . Luggage was pulled off the conveyor belt as passengers were held up by computer glitches . However, Manchester Airport said queues had subsided after ‘slight delays’. A . spokesman for the Border Force apologised for the delays and added: ‘We . are currently experiencing temporary IT problems which may add to the . time taken to conduct passport checks. ‘We . are working to rectify this issue and are providing extra staff to get . passengers through the controls as quickly as possible. ‘Our priority remains security of the border.’ Asked . last night if passport checks had been relaxed to ease the queues, the . Home Office simply said its ‘priority remains security of the border’. The problems affected every British airport, including Birmingham International, pictured, where a spokesman said: 'It appears to be getting progressively worse but we are hoping it will be sorted out soon' Passengers reported delays of up to four hours at some airports across the country as staff battled to get the large queues under control following the IT glitch .","Nationwide fault on UK Border Force computers caused severe disruption .

"A team of archaeologists come across a shaman sculpture (pictured) in an underground burial chamber in the state of Colima, Mexico . He has been guarding a tomb for over 1,500 years. And only now have a team of archaeologists come across a shaman sculpture in an underground burial chamber in the state of Colima, Mexico. It is unusual to find one of the statues intact as many have fallen victim to tomb raiders over the centuries. The sculpture has a long face and holds a weapon - probably an axe - to guard the shaft tomb which was covered over by slabs of volcanic rock. It was uncovered by archaeologists at the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) who have become the first people to see the sculpture in hundreds of years. Archaeologist Marco Zavaleta explained that the model was found in the entrance of an underground funerary space in Villa de Alverez. 'With regards to the figure of the shaman, he was found upright and is holding some kind of weapon, probably an axe. He was placed exactly at the entrance, towards the crypt. He is some kind of a guardian of the main character deposited inside the shaft tomb,' he said. Sites nearby have recently revealed burials of around 35 adults and three infants in cists - small stone coffin-like boxes or used to hold bodies from a slightly later period. The square shaft, which is around one-and-a-half metres deep, is thought to date to between 300 AD and 600AD and leads to an underground vault measuring approximately two metres squared, containing bones of either one or two individuals, physical anthropologist Rosa Maria Flores Ramirez explained. They could have been moved to the sides of the vault to make way for another individual who was found lying on his back, who was presumably buried slightly later. Scroll down for video . The sculpture has a long face and holds a weapon to guard the shaft tomb which was covered over by slabs of volcanic rock. Six pots of different sizes (pictured) were also recovered . There is a theory that shaft tombs were used as homage to people’s ancestors as well as where people and shaman sculptures were buried. Six pots of different sizes and an earthenware bowl called a tecomate were also found in the shaft, along with the shaman figure, which measures 19.7inches (51cm). The objects will be painstakingly cleaned in a bid to recover any traces of seed or other organic material, which could shed light on how the ancient people lived.

It is believed that burials of this kind belonged to elite members of society as only richer people had the resources to fund such constructions. Dogs were also buried with important people at the time as a guide to the underworld for the deceased and archaeologists have recovered what they think are dog’s teeth from the Villa de Alverez site, hinting that those laid to rest there were of high social standing.

"The tennis dress from one of the world's most famous posters is to be auctioned - and is valued at  £1,000. The little white-lacy number is recognisable from the Athena tennis picture where a blonde model shows her bare bottom. Taken on a court at the University of Birmingham in 1976, it has now sold more than two million copies internationally. Remember this? A dress from one of the world's most famous posters, the Athena tennis picture, is going under the hammer in the Midlands . Despite its fame, the teenage star wasn't identified until 35 years later, when she was named as freelance illustrator Fiona Walker. The dress, made by Fiona's friend Carol Knotts, has been hidden away in a cupboard until now. Carol, now a barrister, said: 'I used to get an allowance from my parents but to make it stretch further, I made my own clothes. Under the hammer: Fieldings Auctioneers in Stourbridge is auctioning the original dress and tennis racquet as used in the famous Athena poster of the young women holding her bare left buttock . Revealed: Fiona Walker, 53, poses with a picture of herself as the eighteen year-old 'Athena tennis poster girl' 'As I played tennis at the local club, I bought a ""Simplicity"" pattern and made my own dress, complete with lace trim. 'Fiona one day asked if she could borrow my dress and racquet and when she returned them, she gave me a big box of chocolates as a thank you. 'It's a little piece of tennis history and I hope someone might find it an interesting novelty item to buy.' Fiona, a freelance illustrator, was the girlfriend of unknown 29-year-old commercial photographer Martin Elliot when the picture was taken and she had never played tennis before. Vintage: Auctioneer Nick Davies poses with the dress which Fiona Walker wore on a court at the University of Birmingham in 1976 . Guess who? The snap of Fiona holding her buttocks was taken on a tennis court at the University of Birmingham in 1976 and has now sold more than two million copies internationally . Unsurprisingly the photograph, since recreated by superstars such as Kylie Minogue and Ricky Gervais, shot Martin to fame. The couple split in 1979, three years after the photo was taken. Fiona was never officially paid for the shot, but Martin always said: 'I looked after her.' The dress, racquet and two posters are estimated to fetch £1,000 to £2,000 at Fieldings Auctioneers in Stourbridge, West Midlands.

"A high school gym teacher in Queens has been arrested for the second time in three days, after being accused of having a sexual relationship with a second student on the rebound after falling out with her first student lover over his prom date. Joy Morsi, a 39-year-old teacher at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, New York, was taken into custody on Wednesday morning on the latest charge just hours after she had pleaded not guilty to raping a student when he was 16. Prosecutors say she hooked up with the second 16-year-old student on Saturday morning shortly after her relationship with the student wrestler fell apart because he asked a girl to prom. Joy Morsi, center, a 39-year-old teacher at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, New York, was taken into custody on Wednesday morning on the latest charge just hours after she had pleaded not guilty to raping a student when he was 16 . 'Two weeks . after the alleged relationship with that student ended, she enticed a . student and engaged in sexual activity with this 16-year-old again on . school property just over this past weekend,' said prosecutor Melissa . Kelly. Prosecutors cited text messages as evidence of the sexual encounter. Morsi was charged with two-counts of third-degree criminal sexual act and one-count of endangering the welfare of a child. She was ordered held on an additional $25,000 bail and has to return to court on June 23, reports ABC7. ‘These are serious accusations in which a school teacher - who should serve as a role model to students - is instead accused of using her position to gain access to children for her own gratification,’ said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. Joy Morsi's husband Hany Morsi is a science teacher at the same school as his wife, Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, New York . Morsi cannot be . fired or stripped of her pay without due process, officials said. The . second student told authorities that he had sex twice with the teacher . in the school on Saturday. On Tuesday Morsi had been charged with . third-degree rape and third-degree criminal sex act after being accused . of a year-long sexual affair with a 16-year-old student wrestler. Morsi is alleged to have sent the wrestler raunchy selfies and emails. Their affair was only exposed after she flew into a jealous rage because he was taking another girl to prom. The Long Island mother, whose husband Hany Morsi, also teaches at the school, was first arrested on Monday. The illegal relationship with the wrestler began last June when Morsi offered to help the student lose weight, prosecutors said in court. On June 10, Morsi allegedly lured the unidentified student into a 'secluded closet' where she exposed herself to him. Scene: Joy Morsi, 39, a gym teacher at Grover Cleveland High School in Ridgewood, Queens (pictured) allegedly had a year-long sexual relationship with a 16-year-old male student . She also allegedly sent the student emails asking if he was a virgin, along with saucy text messages. The . court heard the pair had sex all over the school from June to July last . year, and continued to meet for sex outside of school. Authorities were apparently tipped off after one of the victim's female friends told her parents. That girl's mother, who also works in the school system, informed another education department employee. In court on Tuesday, Morsi pleaded not guilty to numerous counts of third-degree rape, a criminal sexual act in the third degree and one count of endangering the welfare of a child. The stone-faced teacher did not comment after being ordered held on $25,000 bail. As the student turned 17 during the nearly year-long dalliance, subsequent alleged encounters are considered legal. Morsi, described by some students as 'a hard-working teacher' did not comment as she left court. If convicted, she faces four years behind bars. City Department of Education officials said Morsi was 'immediately removed' from the classroom when she was reported. Charged: Married teacher Joy Morsi (seated) is accused of raping a teenage wrestler at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, New York, where her husband works as a science teacher (pictured) 'We find these claims disturbing and reprehensible and she will remain reassigned - far from any student and the school - pending a criminal investigation,' deputy press secretary Marcus Liem said. 'We will work closely with the school to ensure they are given any needed support.' Morsi, who has four children, had nothing to say as she left court on Tuesday, but attorney, Virginia Lopreto, signaled she would fight the case. 'My client’s ties to the community have been verified,' Lopreto said. 'Her husband is here. She has a family and children. She’s very likely to see this through.' Morsi started working as a gym teacher in 1999, has a clean discipline record and earns $79,531 a year, according to records. Meanwhile students at the school said rumors had long circulated about the alleged affair. 'We had a feeling that something was going on,' ninth-grader Josie Gonzalez told New York Daily News. 'They would always be together around the school.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Joy Morsi is a gym teacher at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, New York .

"India's rape crisis grew yet deeper today when it emerged a schoolgirl died two weeks after a boy who tried to rape her set her on fire - with the help of his parents. The 15-year-old, from Jigna village in northeast India, was rushed to hospital after the January 6 attack with horrific burns to 80 per cent of her body. Despite doctors battling for two weeks to keep her alive, she died of her injuries on Sunday. Police have charged Gyan Singh and his parents with murder following her death and say all three face the death penalty if found guilty. Protest: There has been a groundswell of protest in India since a student was gang raped on a bus and left to die, with mass demonstrations for women's rights, tougher rape laws and calls for sex attackers to be hanged . It is claimed the three doused her in petrol and lit a match because they were afraid she  might lodge a complaint against Singh who had tried to sexually assault her the previous day. 'With the girl's death we have enough evidence to press for death penalty for Singh and his parents who had been arrested immediately after she was admitted to hospital,' Senior Superintendent of Police of Allahabad Mohit Agrawl said. It is the latest in a chain of high-profile rapes in recent months that have shaken India to its core, triggering nationwide self-reflection and soul searching. Justice: An Indian girl, center, dressed as Lady Justice takes part in a candlelight vigil in New Delhi last week after police said they have arrested six suspects in a second gang rape of a bus passenger in India . Second gang rape case: Indian policemen stand with six men, face covered in black sheet, suspected in a gang rape of a bus passenger in Punjab state . The first, on December 16 last year, saw a 23-year-old medical student gang raped on a private bus by five men in New Delhi before she was thrown, fatally injured and unclothed, into the road and left to die. Thirteen days later she died in hospital. The men alleged to have attacked her are awaiting trial for her rape and murder. There has been a groundswell protest in India ever since, with mass demonstrations for women's rights, tougher rape laws and calls for sex attackers to be hanged. Meanwhile last week, a fast-track court set up exclusively . to deal with cases of crime against women has imposed the death penalty . on a 56-year-old man for raping and murdering a minor. High profile case: A Delhi police van believed to be transporting the five men accused in the Delhi gang rape leaving the city court in New Delhi, India on January 7 . Anger: Indian protesters hold candles during a rally in New Delhi last month following the death of the gang rape victim . Accused: Ravidas camp, the slum where four of the six accused by police in the Delhi gang rape case, are reported to live . The act was termed 'heinous' and included in the category of rarest of the rare. Additional Sessions Judge Virender . Bhat, who heads the recently-created fast-track court at Dwarka court . complex, awarded capital punishment to Bharat Singh, a guard at a . farmhouse in West Delhi. Rape is the one of the most common crimes against Indian women. So common, in fact, that there is a euphemism coined for the public sexual molestation of women. In reference to the biblical 'Eve', 'Eve teasing' implies that women are responsible for the behaviour of their attackers. Rape victims rarely press charges because of social stigma and fear they will be accused of inviting the attack. Many women say they structure their lives around protecting themselves and their daughters from attack. New Delhi is the rape capital of India with a rape reported on average every 18 hours. Government data show the number of reported rape cases in the country rose by nearly 17 percent between 2007 and 2011. As . well as the death sentence, the court imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on . Singh under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). On January 15, hundreds of people surrounded a school in  the city of Vasco da Gama in Goa to protest after a seven-year-old girl was allegedly raped in the toilets next door to the headmistress's office. A day earlier, six men were arrested after another alleged gang rape of a woman on a bus in New Delhi. The victim had been travelling to her in-laws house in Punjab on Friday when she was allegedly snatched and to a district bordering Amritsar, the Sikh holy city. Five men joined the driver and conductor, who had taken her by motorbike to an unknown address, and took turns to rape the 29-year-old. But these are just a handful of cases that have reached public attention in recent months. In 'rape capital' New Delhi, police data revealed as many as 706 cases of rape - almost two per day - were registered in 2012, which is around 24 per cent more than the 572 cases reported in 2011. Even worse, the city witnessed 45 rapes (three in a day) and 75 cases of molestation (five in a day on an average) in 15 days after the December 16 gang rape of the 23-year-old paramedic in a moving bus in South Delhi.","The girl, from Jigna village in northeast India, was attacked on January 6 .

"The fate of Osama bin Laden's remains have been called into question after emails leaked from an intelligence analysis firm say the body of the terror leader was actually sent to the U.S. for cremation. Death: A federal appeals court will decide whether photographs of the body of former al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden should be made public . According to the emails, the Al Qaeda boss was shot and killed during the famous Navy SEAL Team Six raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, was transported back to the U.S. and cremated. The emails were allegedly obtained by the hacker group Anonymous from Stratfor, an organisation dealing with analysis of intelligence and geopolitical analysis. It's also known as the 'Shadow CIA'. Last week, Anonymous announced that it had gotten access to 2.7million of the firm’s confidential correspondences, and said they could provide 'the smoking gun for a number of crimes'. The hackers said Stratfor, based in Austin, Texas, were 'clueless' when it came to database security. After bin Laden was killed in the famous raid in Pakistan on May 2 2011, the Obama administration said his body was buried at sea off the USS Carl Vinson - in accordance with Islamic tradition. But in a particular set of emails given to WikiLeaks, the firm’s vice president for intelligence, Fred Burton, says he doubts the official White House version of what happened to bin Laden's body. Stratfor’s vice-president for intelligence, Fred Burton, says the body was 'bound for Dover, [Delaware] on [a] CIA plane' and 'onward to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Bethesda [Maryland]'. The claims are sure to stoke conspiracy theorists, especially since the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology that Burton refers to closed its doors on September 15, 2011, four months after bin Laden's death. In another email, Burton said: 'If body dumped at sea, which I doubt, the touch is very Adolf Eichmann like. The Tribe did the same thing with the Nazi's ashes'. Burial: After bin Laden was killed, the Obama administration said his body was buried at sea off the USS Carl Vinson, pictured here, in accordance with Islamic tradition . Final resting place? Leaked emails say Osama bin Laden's body was transported to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Maryland,' which closed its doors on September 15, 2011 . Leaked: Last week, Anonymous announced that it had gotten access to 2.7million of Stratfor's confidential emails, and claimed they could provide 'the smoking gun for a number of crimes' 'Eichmann was seen alive for many months . on trial before being sentenced to death and executed. No one wanted a . monument to him so they cremated him.' Emails purportedly leaked from the intelligence analysis firm Stratfor make mention of Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi lieutenant and a major figure of World War II. Eichmann, pictured above, is known as a major architect of the Holocaust. After World War II ended in 1945, he was caught by U.S. forces, and escaped custody after he gave them a phony name. Eichmann fled to Italy, where he was able to obtain a humanitarian passport. By 1950, he was in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he lived for years until he was captured by the Israeli spy agency the Mossad in 1960. War crimes and crimes against humanity were among the charges he faced when he was found guilty in an Israeli court in 1962. He was hanged, cremated, and his ashes were spread over the Mediterranean Sea. Stratfor CEO George Friedman responded: . ‘But i dont know anyone who claimed he wasnt eicjhman [sic]. No . comparison with suddenly burying him at sea without any chance to view . him which i doubt happened [sic]'. In a February 27 statement, Stratfor said: In December, thieves compromised Stratfor's data systems and stole a large number of company emails, along with other private information of Stratfor readers, subscribers and employees. Those stolen emails apparently will be published by Wikileaks. This is a deplorable, unfortunate - and illegal - breach of privacy. 'Some of the emails may be forged or altered to include inaccuracies; some may be authentic. We will not validate either. Nor will we explain the thinking that went into them. Having had our property stolen, we will not be victimized twice by submitting to questioning about them.' Stratfor, which is not affiliated with the U.S. government, would not comment further. The emails were revealed as it was reported that a members of LulzSec an offshoot of Anonymous, were arrested by the FBI. An agency official told Fox News that the arrests were 'devastating' blow to the organisation, saying: 'We’re chopping off the head of LulzSec.' The 'Adolf Eichmann' referred to by Burton was a Nazi lieutenant and a major architect of the Holocaust.

"Manchester City have an interest in England midfielder Ross Barkley, as do all of the Premier League's top clubs, but they have yet to set wheels in motion for any bid. Any such action would likely depend on Yaya Toure and what comes of his planned talks with City's hierarchy. It is understood he and his representative Dimitri Seluk have made contact with the club owners to dampen the initial furore that surrounded his claims of feeling unloved. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ginter the grinner after Dortmund move . Wanted man: Ross Barkley is attracting interest from Manchester City . Young star: Barkley had a good World Cup for England - despite being knocked out early . On his way? Yaya Toure could leave City this summer . City are relatively relaxed as the 31-year-old is on a lucrative four year contract but there is an unease that the problem could arise again. Paris Saint-Germain have made no secret of their interest should Toure be made available while reports in France have linked Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid. City hope to maintain control of the situation while the sale of such a talent would sorely test any buying club's Financial Fair Play guidelines. Should the worst happen and Toure goes then Barkley would come into their thinking but he would not be their only option. Suffice to say Everton have no plans to sell Barkley. After last season's step forward, it would be a huge fall backwards to sell the 20-year-old. The statement it sends out would undermine what the club is striving to achieve. They know they could command £50million plus but Barkley is pivotal to the plans of Roberto Martinez. If those plans come to fruition that should convince Barkley his immediate future is at Goodison. Correa could see Atletico move collapse due to heart problem . Atletico Madrid beat Manchester City to the signing of Angel Correa, who was hailed as Argentina's latest wunderkind. However, during the 19-year-old's medical in May, it was discovered that the San Lorenzo teenager had a heart defect and he was sent for surgery at a New York clinic. The latest prognosis is that he must avoid all football for another six months to allow his body time to repair and re-adjust. Moving off? Angel Correa's move to Atletico Madrid could be cancelled after a heart problem was discovered . The clubs have now decided to suspend the transfer and will monitor his recuperation with Atletico poised to make a statement in the coming weeks. Correa, who hails from the same city as Lionel Messi, Rosario, only made his full debut last year and had agreed a five year contract with the clubs agreeing a £6m transfer fee. Liverpool keen on PSV's Bakkali . Liverpool admire Zakaria Bakkali at PSV Eindhoven but are unlikely to make a bid at this stage. The 18-year-old has been watched closely by Arsenal and Tottenham this season while Valencia have an interest too. Liverpool are continuing talks with Stoke over the permanent sale of Oussama Assaidi for £4.5m, rising to £7m, while Sunderland are trying to find money to pay for Fabio Borini. Keeping an eye on thigns: Zakaria Bakkali of PSV is attracting interest from Liverpool . Liverpool plan to sign Divock Origi from Lille, who would then be loaned back. QPR's Loic Remy, Southampton's Dejan Lovren and Swansea's Ben Davies are the other players in their sights at this stage. Wilfried Bony's price and wages are an obstacle that Tottenham and Liverpool are wrestling with and if the figures don't change he may well stay at Swansea. Tottenham are also among clubs to have enquired about 23-year-old Mattia Destro at Roma but they are unlikely to pursue a deal for former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o, who it is understood has been offered to them. Burnley have taken former Leeds United winger Gboly Ariyibi on trial. The 19-year-old endured a difficult loan spell at League One Tranmere last season but Sean Dyche is willing to give him a chance as he looks to inject some pace into his squad. American-born Ariyibi came through Southampton's youth academy and was picked up by Leeds manager Brian McDermott as one to be developed for the future but the changes at Elland Road soon put paid to that. Premier chance: Burnleu are keen on Leed's Gboly Ariyibi . Dortmund sign World Cup winner Ginter . Borussia Dortmund have completed the signing of Germany man Matthias Ginter. Although Ginter, 20, can also play as a defensive midfielder, the deal has increased speculation that Dortmund may be willing to allow Mats Hummels to leave. Manchester United and Barcelona have both been linked with Hummels but the Spanish side are concentrating on Jeremy Mathieu at Valencia. On the move: Matthias Ginter has signed for Borussia Dortmund following helping Germany win the World Cup . VIDEO Ginter the grinner after Dortmund move . United have watched Hummels for some time but had reservations about his lack of pace with injuries having taken their toll. He remains outstanding in the box but may struggle if in a high line of defence. New manager Louis van Gaal remains keen on Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen and Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman but there are talks planned between staff and some Dutch agents at a Manchester hotel which may clarify other targets. United are not pursuing Arturo Vidal at Juventus, though. Shola Ameobi is the latest Premier League player to be courted by clubs in China. Fresh from his World Cup exploits with Nigeria, the former Newcastle striker is a free agent and weighing up offers from home and abroad. Chinese clubs are willing to pay lucrative contracts but it's not always easy convincing players to go. Guangzhou Evergrande, coached by Marcello Lippi last week signed Alberto Gilardino to join former West Ham forward Alessandro Diamanti. Heading east? Shola Ameobi could be tempted by a move to China after leaving Newcastle . They have agreed to match his wages at Genoa plus bonuses which are understood to be around £4m a year. Guangzhou R and F made an approach for Ameobi in February and remain keen on the 32-year-old. Hammer time for Taider . West Ham have been offered the chance to sign Inter Milan midfielder Saphir Taider. The 22-year-old Algeria playmaker was one of several of his countrymen to impress at the World Cup and Inter, who are in the throes of rebuilding, are ready to sell to re-inforce their squad in other areas. West Ham would prefer a loan but have other options. They are pursuing left-backs, another wide player and a centre-back. Hammer time? Algeria playmaker Saphir Taider could be on his way to West Ham . Benatia on Chelsea's radar . Chelsea have expressed an interest in Roma defender Mehdi Benatia. As reported in Sportsmail, the 27-year-old is an option for Manchester City and Manchester United also. However, Chelsea are keeping a keener eye on talks between Raphael Varane and Real Madrid this week. If there is any indication that he could leave, Jose Mourinho will try and sign the French defender who he rates as one of the best in the world. Blue day: Chelsea have shown an interest in Roma's Mehdi Benatia . The 21-year-old, a favourite of Castilla coach Zinedine Zidane, wants re-assurances about his role in the team with Carlo Ancelotti favouring he more experienced Pepe and Sergio Ramos for most of last season. Michu close to Napoli move . Napoli expect to wrap up the finer details of Michu's transfer from Swansea today. The 28-year-old Michu was due to fly to Verona today before getting a connection to Dimaro, in Trentino, northern Italy, where Napoli hold their pre-season training camps. Italian job: Michu moves closer to a transfer to Napoli . The deal will be a loan with a guaranteed £8million to follow at the end of the season. Swansea's Pablo Hernandez is close to finalising his move to Al Arabi but they expect to finalise Jefferson Montero's transfer from Monarca Morelia. Napoli have maintained interest in Tottenham's Sandro and may try to offer Valon Behrami as part of negotiations having baulked at the initial £20m valuation of Sandro.","Champions City keen on England star Barkley .

"Petrol prices have fallen to their lowest level in three years, new figures have revealed. The drop means a family with two cars is paying roughly £11.90 less a month on fuel for each vehicle. Prices have been driven down because of falling decline from countries such as China. But motoring campaigners have warned the costs could soon rise dramatically because of Russia’s annexation of the Crimea. Short-lived: Motoring campaigners have warned the prices could rise dramatically because of Russia¿s annexation of the Crimea . Earlier this month wholesale gas prices reached their highest levels in two years as markets reacted to the crisis in Ukraine, prompting fears fuel could be affected as a result. The cost of crude oil also rose – driven by fears that Russia, which is a major producer, might be hit by trade sanctions. A spokesman for the AA told the Daily Mirror: ‘You don’t get much more unstable than Russia invading another country.' The good news for motorists has also been offset by a real-terms plunge in earnings which has pushed wages back to 2002 levels, according to the AA Fuel Price Report.

"President Barack Obama has ruffled so many feathers during his five and a half years in office that he is now disliked by as many Americans as former president George W. Bush, a new poll shows. In the latest CNN/ORC International poll, 51 percent of Americans said they viewed President Obama unfavorably. The same percentage of respondents had a negative opinion of former President Bush. This is the first time in Obama's presidency that a majority of Americans have given the president bad marks. Once-beloved President Barack Obama is now viewed unfavorably by a majority of Americans . In the latest CNN/ORC International poll, 51 percent of Americans said they viewed President Obama unfavorably. The same percentage of respondents had a negative opinion of former President Bush . Do you think more favorably of President Obama than George W. Bush? Do you think more favorably of President Obama than George W. Bush? Now share your opinion . When Obama took office on January 20, 2009, an astounding 78 percent of . Americans said they had positive views of their new president. Meanwhile, a mere 35 percent had nice things to say about outgoing president George W. Bush. Coming . off the precipice of a financial disaster, there was no love lost . between Americans and the Republican president, whose final years in . office brought massive numbers of foreclosures and rampant unemployment. Obama . capitalized on his predecessor's misfortune, and an early strategy of . his administration was to 'blame Bush' for everything that was wrong in . America. Five . and a half years later, it's Obama who is mired in controversy and . fending off critics on both sides of the aisle for sins against America's . veterans and a shady deal with the Taliban that allowed five of its . finest fighters to walk free in exchange for the life of a suspected . deserter from the Army. The . president's signature law, Obamacare, also continues to be a drag on . his ratings, as health care costs continue to increase despite promises . from the president that wouldn't happen. A Bloomberg National Poll released on Wednesday found that 53 percent of Americans are opposed the law. CNN did not specifically ask survey-takers who viewed the president unfavorably why they were upset with him, however respondents have specifically cited Obamacare as area of dissatisfaction in other recent polls, like the the one taken by the Washington Post and ABC News in late April.

Bush left office on January 20, 2009 with an abysmal 35 percent approval rating, while Obama came in with a sky high 78 percent approval score. Now, Americans don't like either of them very much . CNN also asked poll takers about their opinions of other former presidents and members of their families. No other names on the list drew as much negative attention as Obama and George W. Bush. Former presidents Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush had unfavorable ratings of 31 percent and 33 percent favorable respectively. Of the first ladies, former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was liked the least, with 42 percent giving her a black mark. Michelle Obama came in under Clinton at 34 percent and Barbara Bush and Laura Bush scored poorly with 18 percent and 16 percent of respondents. Former first daughter and soon-to-be mother Chelsea Clinton also had low unfavorabilty rating of 16 percent. The poll did not ask about George W.

"The woman who was raped by two different men within the space of an hour had approached her second attacker pleading for help, prosecutors claim. The 31-year-old victim was walking home from a bar in Brooklyn at 5am when she was allegedly attacked by Nicholas Isaac, 17 who is said to have threatened her with a gun before assaulting her. She then walked 500 feet and approached Daquan Jackson, 21, in a desperate bid for support - but he told her 'I am going to do the same thing to you', before raping her as she begged him to stop, a court has heard, according to the New York Post. Detained: Nicholas Isaac, 17, was arrested on Monday and charged in connection with the first of two sexual assaults on a woman in Brooklyn, New York, within the space of one hour . Police . claim both attackers pushed the victim to the ground and threatened to . shoot her if she did not comply, but neither produced a gun. They also suspect the men were working together. Isaac was arrested on Monday. Jackson was arrested today after CCTV footage allegedly showing an attacker leaving the scene was released. Appearing . before Brooklyn Criminal Court, Jackson's attorney claimed it is a case . of mistaken identity - and branded the victim's account of being raped . twice in an hour a 'delusional fantasy'. He argued footage of the suspect walking away from the attack shows a taller man with lighter skin and a different hair style, New York Daily News reported. The judge set Jackson's bail at $100,000. The . woman says the first suspect sexually assaulted her while threatening . her with a gun, although he never displayed one, New York Post reported. Attacked: The woman was attacked twice in one hour, and police managed to retreive CCTV from the second crime scene, showing the alleged attacker leaving . Investigation: Police believe that the two sexual assaults may have been coordinated by the two men . Violence: The two addresses where the assaults took place were just 528ft from each other . After . the attack, the woman walked just over 500ft, where she was set upon by . a second man, who also pushed her to the ground and sexually assaulted . her. New . York police have managed to retrieve CCTV surveillance video footage of . the second suspect as he fled the scene in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, . minutes after the attack. ‘Both . incidents bear extreme similarities, so we aren’t ruling that out (that . one suspect tipped off the other),’ a police source told New York Post. ‘The similarities (between both sexual assaults) are hard to ignore.’ The assaults took place at 5am and 6am on Sunday August 31st in Brooklyn, New York. The first suspect is described as 5ft7in tall, wearing blue jeans and a red t-shirt. The second suspect is a 6ft male, weighing approximately and 170lbs.","Daquan Jackson, 21, charged with committing the second attack .

"Sunday night's episode of Mad Men saw Sally Draper spend a trial night at boarding school - a desperate bid to avoid spending future weekends with her father after catching him with his mistress. It wasn't just any boarding school though. Like most details in Mad Men, there is a real-life historical context, and the choice of Miss Porter's, the prestigious Farmington, Connecticut finishing school that today charges $48,500 a term for boarders, is no different. Early in the episode, Sally's mother, Betty Francis, tells her ex-husband, Don Draper, that it was the school Jacqueline Kennedy had attended. Escape? The latest episode of Mad Men saw Sally Draper spend a night at Miss Porter's boarding school in Farmington, Connecticut, in a bid to avoid future weekends with her father . And the former first lady is not the only famous alumna. Since it was founded in 1843, Miss Porter's has been responsible for the education of leading female academics and socialites alike, including members of the Rockefeller and Vanderbilt families. We know that just two decades before Sally's fictional visit, a 16-year-old Jackie penned love letters to then-boyfriend  R. Beverley Corbin, a student at Harvard, on Miss Porter's headed paper. Showing a degree of teenage melodrama that could just as easily have been part of Sally's Mad Men script, she wrote:  'If these are the happiest days of your life, I'm hanging myself with my skip rope tonight.' In . another, she tells 'Bev darling' that when she goes to parties during a school . holiday in New York, she'll 'make the hours that you stay up look like . the curfew for a two-year-old' and that over Christmas she 'can commute . happily between my doting parents until they both get sick of me.' Prestigious: Since it was founded in 1843, Miss Porter's has educated leading female academics and socialites alike, including Jackie Kennedy and members of the Rockefeller and Vanderbilt families . Elite education: Today, the Farmington, Connecticut school charges $48,500 a term for boarders . It seems that Jackie was regarded as a model student though. For years afterwards, former student Victoria Mudd tells Vanity Fair, she was held up as an example for girls to follow. 'Miss Watson never ceased rubbing our noses in the fact that Jackie . would have gotten it right, that Jackie would have said that correctly,' she said. 'They were very much, in the early 60s, preparing us for life in the 1930s. It was a man’s world' Shedding light on the type of environment Sally might have experienced, Beth Gutcheon, author of The New Girls, a novel based on Miss Porter's, told the magazine's same 2009 article that  'they were very much, in the early 60s, preparing us for life in the 1930s. 'It was a man’s world,' she wrote. 'And Farmington was making it clear to us that we . should learn to survive and learn to be our best selves within those . strictures.' The year Sally would have visited, . however, the school was going through its own major changes: in 1968, . Miss Porter's enrolled its first black student, Glenda Newell. Now . a doctor in San Francisco, Dr Newell-Harris tells Vanity Fair how . then-headmaster Richard Davis told her that the school was 'taking a . chance' on her. Teenage dreams: Just two decades before Sally's fictional visit, a 16-year-old Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy penned love letters to her then-boyfriend on Miss Porter's headed paper . Names of note: Famous alumni also include Gloria Vanderbilt, who graduated from Mis Porter's in 1941 . 'If I did well they would then believe what they had heard, which . was that many people of color may not be good test takers but could be . good students,' she recalled. 'And so, therefore, I had that burden.' Fired: Former Miss Porter's teacher Joseph Rajkumar was accused of having sex with a 17-year-old student in a classroom closet . It would seem that Dr Newell-Harris had a warmer reception than Sally, who found that students embraced her - more so, even, than their parents. But Miss Porter's had a tough reputation by all accounts. RoseAnne and Robert Keep, who were headteachers between 1917 and 1943, apparently forbade students from . playing cards, chewing gum, reading popular novels and leaving the . school grounds without permission. They breakfasted at 7am and were . forbidden from touching their hair at mealtimes or crumbling cookies . into ice cream. And indeed there would be no cookies . or ice cream if a girl was deemed overweight. There was a 'fat table' and 'thin table' at mealtimes for girls who the school felt needed to . lose or gain weight, Hill Street Blues actress Barbara Babcock, who graduated in 1955, says. There were also reports of hazing for . new girls - and a recent lawsuit accusing the school of allowing ritual . bullying to take place. In 2008, former student Tatum Bass claimed she had a nervous . breakdown following harassment from a secret student society of 'Keepers . of Tradition' who call themselves the Oprichniki after Ivan the Terrible's secret police. Miss Bass, who was expelled for . cheating on an art history test, claims she was villified by these Mean . Girls after suggesting that Miss Porter's students participate in a . multi-school prom, and was branded 'retarded' over her attention deficit . disorder. Unwanted advances: When Glen disappears into a room with Mandy, however, his friend tries to seduce Sally with the words: 'I've been with lots of girls. I know what I'm doing' A hit with the Mean Girls: Such drama apparently impresses the Miss Porter's girls, as Betty later informs Sally that she has earned herself glowing reviews . Former student Amos M. Nevin, who graduated from Miss Porter's in 1990, . told the New York Times how the fearsome name came about. 'We learned about . the 16th-century Russian Oprichniki in A.P. European history,' she . said. 'At the time, as precocious . teenagers, it seemed like a clever idea to name ourselves' because it was 'underground and cryptic.' There were other scandals that rocked the school too. In 1976, an apparently overweight student gave birth to a baby boy in a bathroom. The situation was only discovered afterwards when the girl began bleeding heavily, and the infant's body was later found. And earlier this year, a former teacher was accused of having sex with a 17-year-old student in a classroom closet. Joseph Rajkumar,  42, who taught physics and coached soccer and track since August 2009, was fired on March 4 and charged with sexual assault following claims that he had been making advances on the girl since she was 15 and had sexually inappropriate conversations and text messages with at least five other students ages 15 to 18. Regardless of bad press, the school's . alumni, or Ancients as they are known to each other, remain fiercely . loyal to their school. Sarah Hart Hansen, who graduated in 1974, told the New York Times: 'The . traditions aren’t really sinister. Maybe there’s nervousness in the beginning, but it’s a . bonding moment.' Of course, . as the Mad Men episode proved, an elite reputation does not prevent . mischief - and the antics of Sally and her dorm-mates Mandy and . Millicent were typical of girls at boarding school today. In a bid to impress the two existing . students with whom she is sharing a room and will cast verdict on her after the stay, Sally invites her friend . Glen Bishop, who brings alcohol, marijuana - and a friend - to get a dorm . room party started. When Glen disappears into a room with Mandy, however, his friend tries to seduce Sally with the words: 'I've been with lots of girls. I know what I'm doing.' Sally . is not won over though, and when he gets pushy, she calls on Glen to . rescue her, prompting a fist-fight between the two boys before they are . made to leave for fear that a teacher will hear them. Such . drama apparently impresses the Miss Porter's girls, though, as Betty . later informs Sally that she has earned herself glowing reviews. But whether Miss Porter's will prove the escape Sally so desires remains to be seen. Clearly both her parents' daughter, she can hold her own - the desire to run to boarding school, though, may see her thrown from the frying pan into the fire.","Famous alumni of the Connecticut boarding school include Jackie Kennedy, Lilly Pulitzer and Gloria Vanderbilt ."
"Iran could join forces with its old adversary the United States in a bid to restore security in Iraq. President Hassan Rouhani has said he will provide assistance if he sees Washington intervene in an effort to combat terrorism. The prospect of military co-operation came as the U.S. defense secretary ordered an aircraft carrier into the Gulf region to provide 'flexibility' in case military action proves necessary. Scroll down for video . Cooperation: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani speaks during a press conference in the capital Tehran. He has said he will help Washington if they intervened in Iraq . Chuck Hagel ordered the carrier, along with two missile ships, to move into the region in anticipation of military operations needed to 'protect American lives, citizens and interests in Iraq'. The carrier USS George H.W. Bush, moving . from the North Arabian Sea, will be accompanied by the guided-missile . cruiser USS Philippine Sea and the guided-missile destroyer USS Truxtun and are expected to arrive this evening. A Pentagon statement said: 'The order will provide the Commander-in-Chief additional flexibility should military options be required to protect American lives, citizens and interests in Iraq'. However, president Rouhani claimed Tehran was unlikely to send forces to Iraq, despite being ready to help within the framework of international law. Shi'ite Muslim Iran has been alarmed by . the seizure this week of several major northern Iraqi towns by Sunni . Islamist insurgent forces and their sweep southward to within an hour's . drive of Baghdad, and not far from the Iranian border. Sailing in: The USS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier, pictured, has been ordered into the Gulf in case it is needed in military operations . 'We all should practically and verbally confront terrorist groups,' Rouhani told a news conference broadcast live on state television. Asked if Tehran would work with Washington in tackling the advances by Sunni insurgents in Iraq, he replied: 'We can think about it if we see America starts confronting the terrorist groups in Iraq or elsewhere.' Fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) are bent on recreating a mediaeval caliphate spanning territory they have carved out in fragmenting Iraq and Syria, where it has exploited a power vacuum in the midst of civil war. A senior Iranian official told Reuters earlier this week that Tehran, which has strong leverage in Shi'ite-majority Iraq, may be ready to cooperate with Washington in helping Baghdad fight back against the jihadist ISIL rebels. The official said the idea of cooperating with the Americans was being discussed within the Tehran leadership. For now, according to Iranian media, Iran will send advisers and weaponry, although probably not troops, to boost Baghdad. 'Iran has never dispatched any forces to Iraq and it is very unlikely it will ever happen,' Rouhani told Saturday's news conference. Assistance: Rouhani said Iran was unlikely to send forces to Iraq but stood ready to provide help . Western diplomats suspect Iran has in the past sent some of its Revolutionary Guards, a hardline force that works in parallel with the army, to train and advise the Iraqi army or its militia allies. Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, quoted by Fars news agency, said: 'Supporting the Iraqi government and nation doe not mean sending troops to Iraq. It means condemning terrorist acts and closing and safeguarding our joint borders.' In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said he was reviewing military options, short of sending combat troops, to help Iraq repel the insurgency but warned any U.S. action must be accompanied by an Iraqi government effort to bridge divisions between Shi'ite and Sunni communities. U.S. officials said there were no contacts going on with Iran over the crisis in Iraq. Rouhani said he was not aware of any American plans for Iraq or whether Washington wanted to help Baghdad. 'If the Iraqi government and nation ask for our help, we will review it. So far there has not been such a request,' he added. 'We are ready to help in the framework of international regulations and laws."" Rouhani said 'terrorist groups' were getting financial and political backing and weaponry from some regional countries and some powerful Western states. He named no countries, but was alluding in part to Sunni Gulf Arabs who Iran suspects has funnelled support to ISIL. 'Where did ISIL come from? Who is funding this terrorist group? We had warned everyone, including the West, about the danger of backing such a terrorist and reckless group.' Gulf Arab governments deny any role in backing ISIL, noting that the group has long battled Saudi Arabia's allies among other Sunni rebel factions in Syria. Saudi Arabia last month designated ISIL a terrorist organisation, conveying its concern that young Saudis hardened by battle could come home to target the ruling Al Saud royal family - as happened after earlier wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.","Hassan Rouhani said he would consider helping if Washington intervened .
